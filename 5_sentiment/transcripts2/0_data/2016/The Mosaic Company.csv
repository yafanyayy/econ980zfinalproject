Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. It seems clear to us that you all understand the market-related challenges we face. To summarize, we're experiencing a major decline in the broader commodities",1180,"Good morning. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. It seems clear to us that you all understand the market-related challenges we face. To summarize, we're experiencing a major decline in the broader commodities markets as well as global economic uncertainty and unprecedented strength of the U.S. dollar.
The agriculture, the grain and oilseed supply and demand situation remains relatively balance. Even after 3 consecutive huge harvest. And despite the severe price decline across other commodities, crop prices have been relatively stable. Unlike hard commodities, we do not see a structural imbalance in agriculture so we have a positive outlook for the 2016 global shipments in both potash and phosphates. We believe recent price declines in potash and phosphates have been driven more by macroeconomic trends than by the current supply and demand balance. Weak currency valuations against the U.S. dollar are lowering production costs for exporting nations and raising prices for importing nations. Normal seasonal pressures are exacerbating the fertilizer price trends. As a result, our realized prices were down in the fourth quarter and have been under increasing pressure since the beginning of this year.
We see several factors that are giving farmers around the globe incentives to use fertilizer to maximize yield and revenue per acre. The price declines in fertilizer have led to high crop nutrient affordability. Farmers are experiencing lower energy cost. Currency valuations are providing tailwinds for non-U.S. growers, selling U.S. dollar-priced crops. And the recent big harvest have withdrawn large amounts of nutrients from the soil, which must be replenished.
As a result, demand is expected to remain strong. With that operating environment as a backdrop, we have 3 important concepts to discuss today. First, we expect Mosaic to emerge a stronger company from this difficult period. Second, the resilience we built into our business is real as demonstrated by the strength of our balance sheet, our cost control and our strong execution. We believe it will yield compelling opportunities for growth as this cycle plays out.
And third, agricultural commodities bear different dynamics than many other commodities. And that's a fact that we believe has been overlooked amid general commodity market pessimism. Cycles can turn more quickly in agriculture because of unpredictable weather and the consistent underlying global demand for food. We understand that cycles are inevitable, and that they are neither tidy nor predictable. We have always managed Mosaic for the long-term for success across the business cycle. That is a lot easier to say than it is to do. So let's explore the characteristics of our franchise that we believe will allow us to emerge ahead of our competition as the business improves.
First, the earnings we reported today show our resilience. We reported $0.44 per share or $0.53 per share excluding notable items and a catch up in our tax accruals. This catch up was a result of higher accruals for the first 3 quarters of the year, and a trough in this quarter which resulted in a lower effective tax rate in the quarter.
For the full year, we earned $1 billion. And our earnings per share of $2.78 were higher than the $2.68 per share Mosaic earned in 2014, reflecting both our execution and our capital allocation. It is important to note that Mosaic remains solidly profitable and free cash flow positive despite the very tough markets.
We've taken the actions necessary to ensure stability. We made tremendous progress on costs. We are well ahead of schedule on ownership to generate $500 million of cost savings by 2018. It's important to note that we began that work with Mosaic already occupying competitive cost positions on a global potash and phosphate cost curves. We've made tough decisions, including difficult moves to stop our MOP production at Carlsbad, New Mexico and decommissioned our potash mine in Hersey, Michigan. We've also saved significant cost through innovative decisions and by investing the necessary capital to improve processes for the long-term.
We've made major progress towards a strong and efficient balance sheet. We've reached our leverage targets while maintaining enough cash to provide a buffer. That seem conservative to some no doubt, but it will prove prudent and provide flexibility others do not have in this environment.
In 2012, when potash prices were close to $450 per tonne, we indefinitely postponed a $3 billion potash expansion. 2 years ago, we have the opportunity to contract for ammonia with natural gas base prices and decided to forego building a $1.2 billion ammonia plant. We took that capital and returned to shareholders, returning nearly a quarter of our outstanding shares since we split off from Cargill.
And we're executing at a very high level. Our plants and mines are efficient. We've had very little unplanned downtime. And as an indicator of our effectiveness, we delivered another year of record low reportable injury frequency.
To put it simply, we have not built the company just to weather storms. We have built it to succeed across the cycles that we all know will come. We've also created a great deal of potential, and that's why we believe so strongly that Mosaic will emerge a winner. We expect to realize the value of our many growth initiatives across the cycle and we believe we have created a tremendous amount of leverage for when better conditions arrive. We've covered our many growth initiatives in the past, so I'll provide you with a short update.
The Esterhazy K3 potash mine remains on schedule and on budget. When the project is completed, the mine will be amongst the lowest cost, most efficient mines in the world. It will give us important operating flexibility, including the ability at some point to fully eliminate our material brine management costs. The CF Phosphate acquisition has exceeded our expectations. Those facilities generated excellent margins for the first 18 months we owned them. The ADM acquisition in Brazil and Paraguay continues to hold significant promise. The current difficult economic and political situation in Brazil is temporarily muting the benefit we expect.
Our work to ensure stable, cost-effective access to our phosphate raw materials is nearing completion. We have finished the sulfur mill project in our New Wales facility in Florida and our ammonia supply agreement with CF begins next year. While the economics in the near term are less attractive with $310 per tonne ammonia, long-term economics remain highly possible. Also at New Wales, our project increased MicroEssentials capacity is nearing completion. We will have the ability to make 3.5 million tonnes of MicroEssentials, which provide significant value to the farmers, the retailers and to Mosaic.
The Wa’ad Al Shamal phosphate projects in Saudi Arabia is also progressing and we expect initial production of ammonia later this year. Taken together, all this work is Mosaic's resilience and potential, which in turn gives us the opportunity to emerge from the weak part of the cycle in the lead. 
Now I will turn the call over to Rich Mack for insights into our financial results and our guidance. Rich?"
890498,298687372,931967,"The Mosaic Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","The Mosaic Company","Executives","Thank you, Joc, and good morning, to you all. To briefly reiterate Jack's commentary on the markets, our financial results are being impacted by a confluence of challenging factors. Global macroeconomic uncertainty, ongoing currency volatility and weaknes",1421,"Thank you, Joc, and good morning, to you all. To briefly reiterate Jack's commentary on the markets, our financial results are being impacted by a confluence of challenging factors. Global macroeconomic uncertainty, ongoing currency volatility and weakness in key currencies against the U.S. dollar, the lack of sufficient credit in Brazil, and in potash, a recently completed Canpotex proving run that added supply in the seasonally slow part of the year.
Over the longer-term though, we see cause for optimism, including a balanced supply and demand picture in phosphates, a manageable supply and demand picture in potash and good conditions for agriculture in Brazil, where the weak reais leads to high prices in local currency for grains and oilseeds.
Now I'll provide an overview of results in each of our 3 operating segments. In Phosphates, our margin were lower in the fourth quarter primarily because of timing. We were selling fertilizer manufactured when raw material prices were higher than they are today. At the same time, prices drop quickly as traders anticipated the impact of lower raw material costs and buyers' delayed purchasing. So for the near term, we're seeing seasonally limited sales volumes in and prices before we can realize our lower raw material costs. These trends are expected to continue into the first quarter.
If we look longer-term however, our stripping margin is expected to remain healthy with much lower raw material prices offsetting lower fertilizer prices. We expect continued declines in sulfur, reflecting a number of curtailment announcements in China as well as our own. These low raw material costs, combined with a firming of phosphate prices in the spring, leads us to expect margin rates to rebound to normal levels after the first quarter.
In the first quarter, we expect the seasonally slow sales to continue and raw material cost to fall further. Last week, we announced that we are once again curtailing production to avoid the building of high-cost inventory. As a result, we expect our phosphate operating rates to be in the range of 70% to 80%. These factors are all embedded assumptions in our Phosphates guidance. It is noteworthy that sales volumes pickup after we announced our decision to reduce production.
For the full year, we expect margins to be similar to last year, underpinned by our constructive view of the industry. We expect to shift between 9 million and 10 million tonnes of phosphates with global market shipments increasing yet again this year to a range of 65 million to 67 million tonnes. 
In the Potash segment, we remained solidly profitable despite the drop in prices. Our work to reduce cost as well as the tailwinds provided by the weak Canadian dollar have enabled us to maintain a reasonable margins.
Looking back at potash supply and demand. In the latter part of 2014, customers built significant inventories with the expectation of a drawdown in 2015. That inventory reduction occurred to some extent, but it was less pronounced than we had expected. Heading into the 2016 planting season in North America, we expected strong demand and good shipment levels, tempered by the fact that retailers continue to hold higher inventories. As a result of these factors, we have lowered our estimate of global Potash shipments by 3 million tonnes to a range of 58 million to 60 million tonnes, consistent with 2016, which was the second higher highest year of ship was ever. We do not believe the potash supply and demand scenario is grossly out of balance. Many producers, including Mosaic, have cut back volumes in response to the seasonal lack of demand. Per our earlier production curtailment announcements, we reduced our operating rate in the fourth quarter by about 20 percentage points compared to last year.
In the first quarter, we plan to operate our potash mines at approximately 70% to 80% of capacity in order to meet global demand we expect to emerge during the second quarter. We expect pent-up demand to come from most of our major markets, China, Brazil, India, Southeast Asian and North America as well as from Europe, all at roughly the same time this year, which should provide a solid foundation for prices. In the meantime, we will maintain our disciplined approach to meeting our customers' demands. We have operational flexibility, a low cost structure, including the benefit of low natural gas prices at our Belle Plaine solution mines and the benefit of a weak Canadian dollar, which in 2015 was down as much as the Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar.
Our first quarter Potash volume guidance anticipates demand emerging around the world toward ties end of this quarter and as a result, our expect an operating rate is well below the same period last year. Margins are expected to be in the low to mid-20% range, reflecting both lower realized prices and our decision to produce only to expected market demand. We expect our shipments to North America to be about flat with last year's levels with the reduction in volumes primarily a function of delayed demand in the export markets.
Our full year volume guidance of 7.5 million to 8.5 million tonnes, reflects an expected increase in Canpotex potash exports.
In our international distribution segment, we continue to be impacted by the difficult political and economic situation in Brazil. Fertilizer demand remains slower than usual primarily because the farmers are having difficulty finding appropriate access to credit. The credit situation is giving farmers incentive to acquire their inputs through barter, a system that can benefit Mosaic because of our strong relationships with key players in the Brazilian barter market. These arrangements also allow us to take a conservative approach to granting credit which lowers overall credit losses.
Farmers in Brazil continue to plant for big crops. In fact, a high percentage of the second crop corn has already been sold in advance because of the favorable currency dynamics. So farmers need to plant their acres and maximize yields. We believe that will facilitate additional fertilizer demand.
Brazilian credit availability is the swing factor in our volume guidance assumptions for the first quarter and full year. Because of the relatively high proportion of fixed costs, higher volumes positively impact margins per tonne as does a higher proportion of MicroEssentials in our sales. Finally, I should note that our forecasted margins anticipate relative stability in the reais.
For 2016, we expect our distribution volumes to range from 6 million to 7 million tonnes. For calendar 2016, our annual guidance ranges are as follows: Canadian resource taxes and royalties are expected to be in the range of $180 million to $220 million, down from $281 million in 2015. Brine management costs are expected to be consistent with 2015 in the range of $160 million to $180 million. Our SG&A expense is estimated to be $350 million to $370 million. We will continue to look for opportunities to take additional costs out of the system to increase cash flow and to manage the company for the inevitable cyclical upturn.
Our effective tax rate is expected to be in the high teen percentage range. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $900 million to $1.1 billion plus around the $300 million for our interests in the Ma’aden Wa’ad Al Shamal Phosphate Company.
As we have previously guided, approximately $600 million of our capital expenditures is sustaining capital. And the majority of the remainder is for projects already well underway. We are prepared to calibrate capital spending further to reflect current market conditions. Given the current attractiveness of Mosaic's share price, new capital commitments must meet a very high risk adjusted hurdle rate.
And one more note on capital. Today, we announced an accelerated share repurchase program of $75 million. As you know, cycles bring opportunities. And during the fourth quarter, we were evaluating some unique opportunities and did not affect additional share repurchases. We are pleased to be in a position to make today's announcement and we will continue to embrace the capital management philosophy we have often articulated in the past.
To conclude, I would like to reiterate Joc's main points. There's no doubt that markets are challenging on several fronts but Mosaic has made and will continue to make notable progress. We have the financial and operational resilience and discipline to succeed in weak markets. And we have significant leverage to outperform as conditions improve, which they always do in this sector.
With that, I'll return the call back to Joc for his closing comments. Joc?"

Our projection that we're using right now in RSND is summer in that 10 million tonnes range, I will think will be off a bit from record last year. In terms of the first question, phosphate inventories and Rick, you should come as well. I think it varies from region to region. Certainly, continuing in China. We know that inventories have built up at the plant level. We think they're high there. Distributors in China are the same as distributors around the world in terms of when prices -- when prices are trending down, they tend not to take positions. So you've seen a backup of inventories of the plan. But overall, we don't think inventories in China are excessive. The situation in India maybe a little bit different. They had a 2.5 it million dollars tons increase in imports last year and we think that inventories there are certainly greater than what they have been the last couple of years when they were all down to very low levels. North America I think is in good shape. And in terms of Brazil, inventories ended the year maybe a little bit above average, but I think we're seen some positive signs there that things are beginning to move. So I'll let Rick provide his color commentary as well."

And we see the phosphate inventories frankly being drawn down. Mike described them as about even year-over-year. But the sales that are going on right now for the first quarter reflect farmers coming back into that marketplace. So I think those inventories get drawn down.

Andrew, what I would say is it goes to impart capital management, it goes into -- it goes under the cyclicality of the industry. And if you'd take a look at Mosaic historically, going the way back to the cargo years, the down parts of the cycle do present opportunities. And if you take a look at our track record, cargo got into the phosphate business at the down part of the cycle. We, years later, ended up by consolidating with IMC Global, that was a great opportunity for us. And just a couple of years ago, I would argue that we rolled up the CF Phosphates business at a very attractive valuation. As Joc noted, anything that we would do would go through a very strong filter, but the fact that we have a strong balance sheet, which I would argue would be the envy of many in the mining sector and ag sector today, is of a great benefit to us. And so we'll continue to balance between repurchasing our shares and looking for opportunities out there. And if there's something that is extraordinarily compelling, it's something that we could act on."

They were just adding gas and starting to commission the boilers for the ammonia plant and recognize a big piece of the value of the Ma'aden joint venture will be the ammonia plant. And that will come on midyear this year. And probably commit -- finish commissioning somewhere around the third quarter. The rest of the plant should be ready by, let's call it, late 2016 or early 2017, and then start commissioning at that stage. So that's kind of a timing.

Hey, Jeff, your two-part question had 5 questions in it, so I'll try to address them. We -- this year, we are at the tailwind of Ma'aden is what I would say. 2016 will represent the vast majority of our remaining expenditures there. I think we're suggesting about $300 million in 2016. There could be some spillover effect that goes into 2017. And that's yet to be determined based on a variety of factors in terms of how the construction is progressing today. Joc noted that the ammonia production comes online later this year. Phosphate production will come online sometime during 2017. But there will be a ramp-up period. And we're progressing, I would say, very quickly right now in terms of the construction process. And those time horizons are still generally consistent with what we thought about a couple of years ago. Your question about the positive contribution in the corporate segment really relates to intercompany eliminations between our Phosphates segment and our International Distribution segment. So when we sell phosphates to International Distribution, primarily Brazil, we do not take a -- we back off the profit or the profit is recognized, I should say, in the Phosphate segment and then it's eliminated in the corporate segment until that product is sold by International Distribution. So what you're seeing here is a product that moved in the fourth quarter out of International Distribution and therefore, the profit is fully being recognized by Mosaic. And then I think your third question was an increase in the current assets. And I think the answer to that is primarily additional FPDs this year compared to the last relevant period. So I hope that's a response to your question."

But late in January, the Indian government stops allowing shipments to be moved from ports in-country. So inventory had build up, it will get cleaned out to quicker. How long that lasts, and we've seen it before, where it allows inventory to be cleaned up in-country. And it allows them to reset the subsidy. We have no idea what the subsidy will be for P&K in India but it will be lower. And I think the other piece -- the inventory build up for a couple of reasons. And I think the biggest one was that the expectations for demand last year were a little higher than people -- than what ended up happening. The impact of the drought in India impacted both P&K usage. And right now, what we're seeing in-country with our own in-country business, this product is moving from the distributor's shelf to the farmer's. And so we have to separate what happens on the import side from what happens on the distributor's shelf. And frankly, this movement there will help clean up some of that inventory. And we look forward to the back half of the year will be very good going in to India. But it won't be at the level we experienced last year. Mike, do you want to add something there?"

Obviously, a lot of uncertainties there with respect to how good or bad the monsoon will be this year, what happens to exchange rates, what if any changes to subsidy. So a lot of moving parts there. But bottom line, our best guess at this point is in terms of MOP imports, we think they'll be off a little bit. Recall that in calendar year 2005, India imported 4 million tonnes of potash off a little bit from 4.3 million the previous year, but up from 3 million tonnes in 2013. We think they'll be in that 3.7 million to 3.9 million range this year, so off a little bit. So I'll say maybe a little bit different story as we noted earlier, imports surged to 2.5 million tonnes last year from buried low levels. Yes. we think they're probably off maybe 0.5 million to 0.75 million tonnes this year and how much of those factors we noted earlier."

We have probably about $300 million to $600 million to spend over the next 3 years in Esterhazy for the other equipment like the conveyors, the shaft and development around the shaft. So I would say those are the expected. And then there's a net tax effect. So overall, the net money we're spending, I'm not sure the exact number, but it isn't, the gross number is about $600 million. The think I'd point out is once we do have that completed, once we have ramped up Esterhazy, if we can remove our total brine cost at some point, that is today costing us about $18 a tonne across the whole business.

The drop that we're showing, for example, in potash shipments relates more to the buildup of inventories than any drop in demand.

And second, demand for agricultural commodities remains strong because global demand for food continues to grow, and I know we're harp on that, but the reality is the whole thing is based on the food story and it continues to grow. So we have created significant potential to accelerate when business conditions improve. And we know the business conditions will improve. So thank you very much for joining us today.

Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. It seems clear to us that you all understand the market-related challenges we face. To summarize, we're experiencing a major decline in the broader commodities",1182,"Good morning. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. It seems clear to us that you all understand the market-related challenges we face. To summarize, we're experiencing a major decline in the broader commodities markets as well as global economic uncertainty and unprecedented strength of the U.S. dollar.
In agriculture, the grain and oilseed supply and demand situation remains relatively balanced even after 3 consecutive huge harvests. And despite the severe price decline across other commodities, crop prices have been relatively stable. Unlike hard commodities, we do not see a structural imbalance in agriculture, so we have a positive outlook for the 2016 global shipments in both potash and phosphates. We believe recent price declines in potash and phosphates have been driven more by macroeconomic trend than by the current supply and demand balance. Weak currency valuations against the U.S. dollar are lowering production costs for exporting nations and raising prices for importing nations. Normal seasonal pressures are exacerbating the fertilizer price trends. As a result, our realized prices were down in the fourth quarter and have been under increasing pressure since the beginning of this year.
We see several factors that are giving farmers around the globe incentives to use fertilizer to maximize yield and revenue per acre. The price declines in fertilizer have led to high crop nutrient affordability. Farmers are experiencing lower energy costs. Currency valuations are providing tailwinds for non-U.S. growers selling U.S. dollar-priced crops. And the recent big harvest have withdrawn large amounts of nutrients from the soil, which must be replenished. As a result, demand is expected to remain strong. 
With that operating environment as a backdrop, we have 3 important concepts to discuss today. First, we expect Mosaic to emerge a stronger company from this difficult period. Second, the resilience we built into our business is real, as demonstrated by the strength of our balance sheet, our cost control and our strong execution. We believe it will yield compelling opportunities for growth as this cycle plays out. And third, agricultural commodities bear different dynamics than many other commodities, and that's a fact that we believe has been overlooked amid the general commodity market pessimism. Cycles can turn more quickly in agriculture because of unpredictable weather and the consistent underlying global demand for food. We understand that cycles are inevitable, and that they are neither tidy nor predictable. We have always managed Mosaic for the long-term for success across the business cycle. That is a lot easier to say than it is to do. So let's explore the characteristics of our franchise that we believe will allow us to emerge ahead of our competition as the business improves.
First, the earnings we reported today show our resilience. We reported $0.44 per share or $0.53 per share, excluding notable items and a catch-up in our tax accruals. This catch-up was a result of higher accruals through the first 3 quarters of the year, and a drop in this quarter, which resulted in a low effective tax rate in the quarter.
For the full year, we earned $1 billion. And our earnings per share of $2.78 were higher than the $2.68 per share Mosaic earned in 2014, reflecting both our execution and our capital allocation. It is important to note that Mosaic remains solidly profitable and free cash flow positive despite the very tough markets.
We've taken the actions necessary to ensure stability. We made tremendous progress on costs. We are well ahead of schedule on our initiative to generate $500 million of cost savings by 2018. It's important to note that we began that work with Mosaic already occupying competitive cost positions on the global potash and phosphate cost curves. We've made tough decisions, including difficult moves to stop our MOP production at Carlsbad, New Mexico and decommission our potash mine in Hersey, Michigan. We've also saved significant cost through innovative decisions and by investing the necessary capital to improve processes for the long term.
We've made major progress towards a strong and efficient balance sheet. We've reached our leverage targets while maintaining enough cash to provide a buffer. That seem conservative to some no doubt, but it will prove prudent and provide flexibility others do not have in this environment.
In 2012, when potash prices were close to $450 per tonne, we indefinitely postponed a $3 billion potash expansion. 2 years ago, we had the opportunity to contract for ammonia with natural gas-based prices and decided to forego building a $1.2 billion ammonia plant. We took that capital and returned it to shareholders, retiring nearly a quarter of our outstanding shares since we were split off from Cargill.
And we're executing at a very high level. Our plants and mines are efficient. We've had very little unplanned downtime. And as an indicator of our effectiveness, we delivered another year of record low reportable injury frequency.
To put it simply, we have not built the company just to weather storms. We have built it to succeed across the cycles that we all know will come. We've also created a great deal of potential, and that's why we believe so strongly that Mosaic will emerge a winner. We expect to realize the value of our many growth initiatives across the cycle, and we believe we have created a tremendous amount of leverage for when better conditions arrive. We've covered our many growth initiatives in the past, so I'll provide you with a short update.
The Esterhazy K3 potash mine remains on schedule and on budget. When the project is completed, the mine will be amongst the lowest cost, most efficient mines in the world. It will give us important operating flexibility, including the ability at some point to fully eliminate material brine management costs. 
The CF phosphate acquisition has exceeded our expectations. Those facilities generated excellent margins for the first 18 months we owned them. 
The ADM acquisition in Brazil and Paraguay continues to hold significant promise. The current difficult economic and political situation in Brazil is temporarily muting the benefit we expect.
Our work to ensure stable, cost-effective access to our phosphate raw materials is nearing completion. We have finished the sulfur mill project in our New Wales facility in Florida, and our ammonia supply agreement with CF begins next year. While the economics in the near term are less attractive with $310 per tonne ammonia, long-term economics remain highly possible. 
Also at New Wales, our project to increase MicroEssentials capacity is nearing completion. We will have the ability to make 3.5 million tonnes of MicroEssentials, which provide significant value to the farmers, the retailers and to Mosaic.
The Wa’ad Al Shamal phosphate projects in Saudi Arabia is also progressing, and we expect initial production of ammonia later this year. Taken together, all this work is Mosaic resilience and potential, which in turn gives us the opportunity to emerge from the weak part of the cycle in the lead. 
Now I will turn the call over to Rich Mack for insights into our financial results and our guidance. Rich?"
890498,298687372,932231,"The Mosaic Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","The Mosaic Company","Executives","Thank you, Joc, and good morning to you, all. To briefly reiterate Joc's commentary on the markets, our financial results are being impacted by a confluence of challenging factors. Global macroeconomic uncertainty; ongoing currency volatility and weakness",1414,"Thank you, Joc, and good morning to you, all. To briefly reiterate Joc's commentary on the markets, our financial results are being impacted by a confluence of challenging factors. Global macroeconomic uncertainty; ongoing currency volatility and weakness in key currencies against the U.S. dollar; the lack of sufficient credit in Brazil; and in potash, a recently completed Canpotex proving run that added supply in the seasonally slow part of the year.
Over the longer term though, we see cause for optimism, including a balanced supply-and-demand picture in phosphates, a manageable supply and demand picture in potash and good conditions for agriculture in Brazil, where the weak reais leads to high prices in local currency for grains and oilseeds.
Now I'll provide an overview of results in each of our 3 operating segments. In Phosphates, our margins were lower in the fourth quarter, primarily because of timing. We were selling fertilizer manufactured when raw material prices were higher than they are today. At the same time, prices dropped quickly as traders anticipated the impact of lower raw material costs and buyers' delayed purchasing. So for the near term, we are seeing seasonally limited sales volumes in and softer prices before we can realize our lower raw material costs. These trends are expected to continue into the first quarter.
If we look longer term however, our stripping margin is expected to remain healthy, with much lower raw material prices offsetting lower fertilizer prices. We expect continued declines in sulfur, reflecting a number of curtailment announcements in China as well as our own. These low raw material costs, combined with a firming of phosphate prices in the spring, leads us to expect margin rates to rebound to normal levels after the first quarter.
In the first quarter, we expect the seasonally slow sales to continue and raw material costs to fall further. Last week, we announced that we are once again curtailing production to avoid the building of high-cost inventory. As a result, we expect our phosphate operating rates to be in the range of 70% to 80%. These factors are all embedded assumptions in our Phosphates guidance. It is noteworthy that sales volumes picked up after we announced our decision to reduce production.
For the full year, we expect margins to be similar to last year, underpinned by our constructive view of the industry. We expect to ship between 9 million and 10 million tonnes of phosphates, with global market shipments increasing yet again this year to a range of 65 million to 67 million tonnes. 
In the Potash segment, we remained solidly profitable despite the drop in prices. Our work to reduce costs as well as the tailwinds provided by the weak Canadian dollar, have enabled us to maintain reasonable margins.
Looking back at potash supply and demand. In the latter part of 2014, customers built significant inventories with the expectation of a drawdown in 2015. That inventory reduction occurred to some extent, but it was less pronounced than we had expected. Heading into the 2016 planting season in North America, we expect strong demand and good shipment levels, tempered by the fact that retailers continue to hold higher inventories. 
As a result of these factors, we have lowered our estimate of global potash shipments by 3 million tonnes to a range of 58 million to 60 million tonnes, consistent with 2015, which was the second highest year of shipments ever. We do not believe the potash supply-and-demand scenario is grossly out of balance. Many producers, including Mosaic, have cut back volumes in response to the seasonal lack of demand. Per our earlier production curtailment announcements, we reduced our operating rate in the fourth quarter by about 20 percentage points compared to last year.
In the first quarter, we plan to operate our potash mines at approximately 70% to 80% of capacity in order to meet global demand we expect to emerge during the second quarter. We expect pent-up demand to come from most of our major markets: China, Brazil, India, Southeast Asian and North America as well as from Europe, all at roughly the same time this year, which should provide a solid foundation for prices. In the meantime, we will maintain our disciplined approach to meeting our customers' demands. We have operational flexibility, a low cost structure, including the benefit of low natural gas prices at our Belle Plaine solution mines and the benefit of a weak Canadian dollar, which in 2015 was down as much as the Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar.
Our first quarter potash volume guidance anticipates demand emerging around the world toward the end of this quarter. And as a result, our expected operating rate is well below the same period last year. Margins are expected to be in the low to mid-20% range, reflecting both lower realized prices and our decision to produce only to expected market demand. We expect our shipments to North America to be about flat with last year's levels, with the reduction in volumes primarily a function of delayed demand in the export markets. Our full year volume guidance of 7.5 million to 8.5 million tonnes reflects an expected increase in Canpotex potash exports. 
In our International Distribution segment, we continue to be impacted by the difficult political and economic situation in Brazil. Fertilizer demand remains slower than usual, primarily because farmers are having difficulty finding appropriate access to credit. The credit situation is giving farmers incentive to acquire their inputs through barter, a system that can benefit Mosaic because of our strong relationships with key players in the Brazilian barter market. These arrangements also allow us to take a conservative approach to granting credit, which lowers overall credit losses.
Farmers in Brazil continue to plant for big crops. In fact, a high percentage of second-crop corn has already been sold in advance because of the favorable currency dynamics. So farmers need to plant their acres and maximize yields. We believe that will facilitate additional fertilizer demand.
Brazilian credit availability is the swing factor in our volume guidance assumptions for the first quarter and full year. Because of the relatively high proportion of fixed costs, higher volumes positively impact margins per tonne as does a higher proportion of MicroEssentials in our sales. 
Finally, I should note that our forecasted margins anticipate relative stability in the reais. For 2016, we expect our distribution volumes to range from 6 million to 7 million tonnes. 
For calendar 2016, our annual guidance ranges are as follows: Canadian resource taxes and royalties are expected to be in the range of $180 million to $220 million, down from $281 million in 2015. Brine management costs are expected to be consistent with 2015, in the range of $160 million to $180 million. Our SG&A expense is estimated to be $350 million to $370 million. We will continue to look for opportunities to take additional costs out of the system to increase cash flow and to manage the company for the inevitable cyclical upturn. 
Our effective tax rate is expected to be in the high-teen percentage range. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $900 million to $1.1 billion, plus around the $300 million for our interest in the Ma’aden Wa’ad Al Shamal Phosphate Company.
As we have previously guided, approximately $600 million of our capital expenditures is sustaining capital. And the majority of the remainder is for projects already well underway. We are prepared to calibrate capital spending further to reflect current market conditions. Given the current attractiveness of Mosaic's share price, new capital commitments must meet a very high risk-adjusted hurdle rate.
And one more note on capital. Today, we announced an accelerated share repurchase program of $75 million. As you know, cycles bring opportunities. And during the fourth quarter, we were evaluating some unique opportunities and did not affect additional share repurchases. We are pleased to be in a position to make today's announcement, and we will continue to embrace the capital management philosophy we have often articulated in the past.
To conclude, I would like to reiterate Joc's main points. There is no doubt that markets are challenging on several fronts, but Mosaic has made and will continue to make notable progress. We have the financial and operational resilience and discipline to succeed in weak markets. And we have significant leverage to outperform as conditions improve, which they always do in this sector.
With that, I'll return the call back to Joc for his closing comments. Joc?"

In terms of Chinese exports, I'm sure you're all aware that exports spiked in 2015 to -- I believe the China customs numbers is in the 11.6 million tonne range. As I think was noted earlier, there have been some shutdowns in China. Those tonnes, we think will be lost. Our projection that we're using right now in our S&D is somewhere in that 10 million tonne range. We think it will be off a bit from the record last year. In terms of the first question, phosphate inventories and, Rick, you should comment as well. I think it varies from region to region. Certainly, continuing in China, we know that inventories have built up at the plant level. We think they're high there. Distributors in China are the same as distributors around the world in terms of when prices are trending down, they tend not to take positions. So we've seen a backup of inventories at the plant. But overall, we don't think inventories in China are excessive. The situation in India may be a little bit different. They had a 2.5 million tonne increase in imports last year, and we think that inventories there are certainly greater than what they had been the last couple of years, when they were pulled down to very low levels. North America, I think, is in good shape. And in terms of Brazil, inventories ended the year maybe a little bit above average, but I think we're seeing some positive signs there that things are beginning to move. So I'll let Rick provide his color commentary as well."

And we see the phosphate inventories, frankly, being drawn down. Mike described them as about even year-over-year. But the sales that are going on right now for the first quarter reflect farmers coming back into that marketplace. So I think those inventories get drawn down. And we just finished spending time this week with some of our larger North American customers. And I would say, their buying is probably lower than it's been for the last 3 years. They're going to wait and move hand to mouth, and so they're not sitting on a lot of inventories. There's not a lot of inventory sitting in North America. And so we expect when the season hits, this bodes very well. And volumes will move through the system."

That was a great opportunity for us. And just a couple of years ago, I would argue that we rolled up the CF phosphates business at a very attractive valuation. So as Joc noted, anything that we would do would go through a very strong filter. But the fact that we have a strong balance sheet, which I would argue would be the envy of many in the mining sector and ag sector today, is of a great benefit to us.

We -- this year, we're at the tailwind of Ma'aden, is what I would say. 2016 will represent the vast majority of our remaining expenditures there. I think we're suggesting about $300 million in 2016. There could be some spillover effect that goes into 2017. And that's yet to be determined, based on a variety of factors in terms of how the construction is progressing today. Joc noted, ammonia production comes online later this year. Phosphate production will come online sometime during 2017, but there will be a ramp-up period. And we're progressing, I would say, very quickly right now in terms of the construction process. And those time horizons are still generally consistent with what we thought about a couple of years ago. Your question about the -- or the positive contribution in the corporate segment really relates to intercompany eliminations between our Phosphates segment and our International Distribution segment. So when we sell phosphates to International Distribution, primarily Brazil, we do not take -- we back off the profit -- or the profit is recognized, I should say, in the Phosphate segment and then it's eliminated in the corporate segment until that product is sold by International Distribution. And so what you're seeing here is a product that moved in the fourth quarter out of International Distribution and, therefore, the profit is fully being recognized by Mosaic. And then I think your third question was an increase in other current assets. And I think the answer to that is primarily additional FPDs this year compared to the last relevant period. So I hope that's a response to your question."

We have no idea what the subsidy will be for P&K in India but it will be lower. And I think the other piece that -- the inventory built up for a couple of reasons. And I think the biggest one was that the expectations for demand last year were a little higher than people -- than what ended up happening. The impact of the drought in India impacted both P&K usage. And right now, what we're seeing in-country with our own in-country business, this product is moving from the distributor's shelf to the farmer's.

So a lot of moving parts there. But bottom line, our best guess at this point is, in terms of MOP imports, we think they'll be off a little bit. Recall that in calendar year 2005, India imported 4 million tonnes of potash, off a little bit from 4.3 million the previous year, but up from 3 million tonnes in 2013. We think they'll be in that 3.7 million to 3.9 million range this year, so off a little bit. So I'll say maybe a little bit different story, as we noted earlier. Imports surged to, like, 2.5 million tonnes last year from very low levels. Yes, we think they're probably be off maybe 0.5 million to 0.75 million tonnes this year.

Let me just highlight with Esterhazy, it's a little difficult to give an absolute CapEx number because much of it will be, going forward, will be development money that we spend, developing the add-its [ph] and the mining area in -- underground at Esterhazy. And that is money we will not be spending at K2 or K1. So there's a trade-off there. We have probably about $300 million to $600 million to spend over the next 3 years at Esterhazy for the other equipment, like the conveyors, the shaft and development around the shaft. So I would say those are the expected. And then there's a net tax effect. So overall, the net money we're spending, I'm not sure the exact number, but it isn't -- the gross number is about $600 million. The think I'd point out is, once we do have that completed, once we have ramped up Esterhazy, if we can remove our total brine cost at some point, that is today costing us about $18 a tonne across the whole business. So we see the Esterhazy cost as being extremely competitive, probably some of the best and certainly, some of the best in North America, once we get this done. Rich, do you want to continue that?"

To conclude our call, I just want to reiterate our key themes: First, we expect Mosaic to emerge as a stronger company from this challenging part of the cycle, because we've built a resilient business.

Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. It seems clear to us that you all understand the market-related challenges we face. To summarize, we're experiencing a major decline in the broader commodities",1182,"Good morning. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. It seems clear to us that you all understand the market-related challenges we face. To summarize, we're experiencing a major decline in the broader commodities markets as well as global economic uncertainty and unprecedented strength of the U.S. dollar.
In agriculture, the grain and oilseed supply and demand situation remains relatively balanced even after 3 consecutive huge harvests. And despite the severe price decline across other commodities, crop prices have been relatively stable. Unlike hard commodities, we do not see a structural imbalance in agriculture, so we have a positive outlook for the 2016 global shipments in both potash and phosphates. We believe recent price declines in potash and phosphates have been driven more by macroeconomic trend than by the current supply and demand balance. Weak currency valuations against the U.S. dollar are lowering production costs for exporting nations and raising prices for importing nations. Normal seasonal pressures are exacerbating the fertilizer price trends. As a result, our realized prices were down in the fourth quarter and have been under increasing pressure since the beginning of this year.
We see several factors that are giving farmers around the globe incentives to use fertilizer to maximize yield and revenue per acre. The price declines in fertilizer have led to high crop nutrient affordability. Farmers are experiencing lower energy costs. Currency valuations are providing tailwinds for non-U.S. growers selling U.S. dollar-priced crops. And the recent big harvests have withdrawn large amounts of nutrients from the soil, which must be replenished. As a result, demand is expected to remain strong. 
With that operating environment as a backdrop, we have 3 important concepts to discuss today. First, we expect Mosaic to emerge a stronger company from this difficult period. Second, the resilience we built into our business is real, as demonstrated by the strength of our balance sheet, our cost control and our strong execution. We believe it will yield compelling opportunities for growth as this cycle plays out. And third, agricultural commodities bear different dynamics than many other commodities, and that's a fact that we believe has been overlooked amid the general commodity market pessimism. Cycles can turn more quickly in agriculture because of unpredictable weather and the consistent underlying global demand for food. We understand that cycles are inevitable, and that they are neither tidy nor predictable. We have always managed Mosaic for the long-term for success across the business cycle. That is a lot easier to say than it is to do. So let's explore the characteristics of our franchise that we believe will allow us to emerge ahead of our competition as the business improves.
First, the earnings we reported today show our resilience. We reported $0.44 per share or $0.53 per share, excluding notable items and a catch-up in our tax accruals. This catch-up was a result of higher accruals through the first 3 quarters of the year, and a true-up in this quarter, which resulted in a low effective tax rate in the quarter.
For the full year, we earned $1 billion. And our earnings per share of $2.78 were higher than the $2.68 per share Mosaic earned in 2014, reflecting both our execution and our capital allocation. It is important to note that Mosaic remains solidly profitable and free cash flow positive despite the very tough markets.
We've taken the actions necessary to ensure stability. We made tremendous progress on costs. We are well ahead of schedule on our initiatives to generate $500 million of cost savings by 2018. It's important to note that we began that work with Mosaic already occupying competitive cost positions on the global potash and phosphate cost curves. We've made tough decisions, including difficult moves to stop our MOP production at Carlsbad, New Mexico and decommission our potash mine in Hersey, Michigan. We've also saved significant cost through innovative decisions and by investing the necessary capital to improve processes for the long term.
We've made major progress towards a strong and efficient balance sheet. We've reached our leverage targets while maintaining enough cash to provide a buffer. That seems conservative to some no doubt, but it will prove prudent and provide flexibility others do not have in this environment.
In 2012, when potash prices were close to $450 per tonne, we indefinitely postponed a $3 billion potash expansion. 2 years ago, we had the opportunity to contract for ammonia with natural gas-based prices and decided to forego building a $1.2 billion ammonia plant. We took that capital and returned it to shareholders, retiring nearly a quarter of our outstanding shares since we were split off from Cargill.
And we're executing at a very high level. Our plants and mines are efficient. We've had very little unplanned downtime. And as an indicator of our effectiveness, we delivered another year of record low reportable injury frequency.
To put it simply, we have not built the company just to weather storms. We have built it to succeed across the cycles that we all know will come. We've also created a great deal of potential, and that's why we believe so strongly that Mosaic will emerge a winner. We expect to realize the value of our many growth initiatives across the cycle, and we believe we have created a tremendous amount of leverage for when better conditions arrive. We've covered our many growth initiatives in the past, so I'll provide you with a short update.
The Esterhazy K3 potash mine remains on schedule and on budget. When the project is completed, the mine will be amongst the lowest cost, most efficient mines in the world. It will give us important operating flexibility, including the ability at some point to fully eliminate material brine management costs. 
The CF phosphate acquisition has exceeded our expectations. Those facilities generated excellent margins for the first 18 months we owned them. 
The ADM acquisition in Brazil and Paraguay continues to hold significant promise. The current difficult economic and political situation in Brazil is temporarily muting the benefit we expect.
Our work to ensure stable, cost-effective access to our phosphate raw materials is nearing completion. We have finished the sulfur mill project in our New Wales facility in Florida, and our ammonia supply agreement with CF begins next year. While the economics in the near term are less attractive with $310 per tonne ammonia, long-term economics remain highly positive. 
Also at New Wales, our project to increase MicroEssentials capacity is nearing completion. We will have the ability to make 3.5 million tonnes of MicroEssentials, which provide significant value to the farmers, the retailers and to Mosaic.
The Wa’ad Al Shamal phosphate projects in Saudi Arabia is also progressing, and we expect initial production of ammonia later this year. Taken together, all this work gives Mosaic resilience and potential, which in turn gives us the opportunity to emerge from the weak part of the cycle in the lead. 
Now I will turn the call over to Rich Mack for insights into our financial results and our guidance. Rich?"
890498,298687372,932320,"The Mosaic Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","The Mosaic Company","Executives","Thank you, Joc, and good morning to you, all. To briefly reiterate Joc's commentary on the markets, our financial results are being impacted by a confluence of challenging factors. Global macroeconomic uncertainty; ongoing currency volatility and weakness",1413,"Thank you, Joc, and good morning to you, all. To briefly reiterate Joc's commentary on the markets, our financial results are being impacted by a confluence of challenging factors. Global macroeconomic uncertainty; ongoing currency volatility and weakness in key currencies against the U.S. dollar; the lack of sufficient credit in Brazil; and in potash, a recently completed Canpotex proving run that added supply in the seasonally slow part of the year.
Over the longer term though, we see cause for optimism, including a balanced supply-and-demand picture in phosphates, a manageable supply and demand picture in potash and good conditions for agriculture in Brazil, where the weak reais leads to high prices in local currency for grains and oilseeds.
Now I'll provide an overview of results in each of our 3 operating segments. In Phosphates, our margins were lower in the fourth quarter, primarily because of timing. We were selling fertilizer manufactured when raw material prices were higher than they are today. At the same time, prices dropped quickly as traders anticipated the impact of lower raw material costs and buyers' delayed purchasing. So for the near term, we are seeing seasonally limited sales volumes and softer prices before we can realize our lower raw material costs. These trends are expected to continue into the first quarter.
If we look longer term however, our stripping margin is expected to remain healthy, with much lower raw material prices offsetting lower fertilizer prices. We expect continued declines in sulfur, reflecting a number of curtailment announcements in China as well as our own. These low raw material costs, combined with a firming of phosphate prices in the spring, leads us to expect margin rates to rebound to normal levels after the first quarter.
In the first quarter, we expect the seasonally slow sales to continue and raw material costs to fall further. Last week, we announced that we are once again curtailing production to avoid the building of high-cost inventory. As a result, we expect our phosphate operating rates to be in the range of 70% to 80%. These factors are all embedded assumptions in our Phosphates guidance. It is noteworthy that sales volumes picked up after we announced our decision to reduce production.
For the full year, we expect margins to be similar to last year, underpinned by our constructive view of the industry. We expect to ship between 9 million and 10 million tonnes of phosphates, with global market shipments increasing yet again this year to a range of 65 million to 67 million tonnes. 
In the Potash segment, we remained solidly profitable despite the drop in prices. Our work to reduce costs as well as the tailwinds provided by the weak Canadian dollar, have enabled us to maintain reasonable margins.
Looking back at potash supply and demand. In the latter part of 2014, customers built significant inventories with the expectation of a drawdown in 2015. That inventory reduction occurred to some extent, but it was less pronounced than we had expected. Heading into the 2016 planting season in North America, we expect strong demand and good shipment levels, tempered by the fact that retailers continue to hold higher inventories. 
As a result of these factors, we have lowered our estimate of global potash shipments by 3 million tonnes to a range of 58 million to 60 million tonnes, consistent with 2015, which was the second highest year of shipments ever. We do not believe the potash supply-and-demand scenario is grossly out of balance. Many producers, including Mosaic, have cut back volumes in response to the seasonal lack of demand. Per our earlier production curtailment announcements, we reduced our operating rate in the fourth quarter by about 20 percentage points compared to last year.
In the first quarter, we plan to operate our potash mines at approximately 70% to 80% of capacity in order to meet global demand we expect to emerge during the second quarter. We expect pent-up demand to come from most of our major markets: China, Brazil, India, Southeast Asian and North America as well as from Europe, all at roughly the same time this year, which should provide a solid foundation for prices. In the meantime, we will maintain our disciplined approach to meeting our customers' demands. We have operational flexibility, a low cost structure, including the benefit of low natural gas prices at our Belle Plaine solution mine and the benefit of a weak Canadian dollar, which in 2015 was down as much as the Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar.
Our first quarter potash volume guidance anticipates demand emerging around the world toward the end of this quarter. And as a result, our expected operating rate is well below the same period last year. Margins are expected to be in the low to mid-20% range, reflecting both lower realized prices and our decision to produce only to expected market demand. We expect our shipments to North America to be about flat with last year's levels, with the reduction in volumes primarily a function of delayed demand in the export markets. Our full year volume guidance of 7.5 million to 8.5 million tonnes reflects an expected increase in Canpotex potash exports. 
In our International Distribution segment, we continue to be impacted by the difficult political and economic situation in Brazil. Fertilizer demand remains slower than usual, primarily because farmers are having difficulty finding appropriate access to credit. The credit situation is giving farmers incentive to acquire their inputs through barter, a system that can benefit Mosaic because of our strong relationships with key players in the Brazilian barter market. These arrangements also allow us to take a conservative approach to granting credit, which lowers overall credit losses.
Farmers in Brazil continue to plant for big crops. In fact, a high percentage of second-crop corn has already been sold in advance because of the favorable currency dynamics. So farmers need to plant their acres and maximize yields. We believe that will facilitate additional fertilizer demand.
Brazilian credit availability is the swing factor in our volume guidance assumptions for the first quarter and full year. Because of the relatively high proportion of fixed costs, higher volumes positively impact margins per tonne as does a higher proportion of MicroEssentials in our sales. 
Finally, I should note that our forecasted margins anticipate relative stability in the reais. For 2016, we expect our distribution volumes to range from 6 million to 7 million tonnes. 
For calendar 2016, our annual guidance ranges are as follows: Canadian resource taxes and royalties are expected to be in the range of $180 million to $220 million, down from $281 million in 2015. Brine management costs are expected to be consistent with 2015, in the range of $160 million to $180 million. Our SG&A expense is estimated to be $350 million to $370 million. We will continue to look for opportunities to take additional costs out of the system to increase cash flow and to manage the company for the inevitable cyclical upturn. 
Our effective tax rate is expected to be in the high-teen percentage range. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $900 million to $1.1 billion, plus around the $300 million for our interest in the Ma’aden Wa’ad Al Shamal Phosphate Company.
As we have previously guided, approximately $600 million of our capital expenditures is sustaining capital. And the majority of the remainder is for projects already well underway. We are prepared to calibrate capital spending further to reflect current market conditions. Given the current attractiveness of Mosaic's share price, new capital commitments must meet a very high risk-adjusted hurdle rate.
And one more note on capital. Today, we announced an accelerated share repurchase program of $75 million. As you know, cycles bring opportunities. And during the fourth quarter, we were evaluating some unique opportunities and did not affect additional share repurchases. We are pleased to be in a position to make today's announcement, and we will continue to embrace the capital management philosophy we have often articulated in the past.
To conclude, I would like to reiterate Joc's main points. There is no doubt that markets are challenging on several fronts, but Mosaic has made and will continue to make notable progress. We have the financial and operational resilience and discipline to succeed in weak markets. And we have significant leverage to outperform as conditions improve, which they always do in this sector.
With that, I'll return the call back to Joc for his closing comments. Joc?"

In terms of Chinese exports, I'm sure you're all aware that exports spiked in 2015 to -- I believe the China customs numbers is in the 11.6 million tonne range. As I think was noted earlier, there have been some shutdowns in China. Those tonnes, we think will be lost. Our projection that we're using right now in our S&D is somewhere in that 10 million tonne range. We think it will be off a bit from the record last year. In terms of the first question, phosphate inventories and, Rick, you should comment as well. I think it varies from region to region. Certainly, continuing in China, we know that inventories have built up at the plant level. We think they're high there. Distributors in China are the same as distributors around the world in terms of when prices are trending down, they tend not to take positions. So we've seen a backup of inventories at the plant. But overall, we don't think inventories in China are excessive. The situation in India may be a little bit different. They had a 2.5 million tonne increase in imports last year, and we think that inventories there are certainly greater than what they had been the last couple of years, when they were pulled down to very low levels. North America, I think, is in good shape. And in terms of Brazil, inventories ended the year maybe a little bit above average, but I think we're seeing some positive signs there that things are beginning to move. So I'll let Rick provide his color commentary as well."

And we see the phosphate inventories, frankly, being drawn down. Mike described them as about even year-over-year. But the sales that are going on right now for the first quarter reflect farmers coming back into that marketplace. So I think those inventories get drawn down. And we just finished spending time this week with some of our larger North American customers. And I would say, their buying is probably lower than it's been for the last 3 years. They're going to wait and move hand to mouth, and so they're not sitting on a lot of inventories. There's not a lot of inventory sitting in North America. And so we expect when the season hits, this bodes very well. And volumes will move through the system."

I was actually over there a couple of weeks ago, and it's really come along well. I think we're pretty pleased with where we sit with Ma'aden. They were just adding gas and starting to commission the boilers for the ammonia plant. And recognize, a big piece of the value of the Ma'aden joint venture will be that ammonia plant. And that'll come on midyear this year and probably commit -- finish commissioning somewhere around the third quarter. The rest of the plant should be ready by, let's call it, late 2016 or early 2017, and then start commissioning at that stage. So that's kind of the timing and I believe we have about $300 million left to spend on it. But again, I'll get Rich to give you a little more background and then give you answers on our corporate spending."

We -- this year, we're at the tail end of Ma'aden, is what I would say. 2016 will represent the vast majority of our remaining expenditures there. I think we're suggesting about $300 million in 2016. There could be some spillover effect that goes into 2017. And that's yet to be determined, based on a variety of factors in terms of how the construction is progressing today. Joc noted, ammonia production comes online later this year. Phosphate production will come online sometime during 2017, but there will be a ramp-up period. And we're progressing, I would say, very quickly right now in terms of the construction process. And those time horizons are still generally consistent with what we thought about a couple of years ago. Your question about the -- or the positive contribution in the corporate segment really relates to intercompany eliminations between our Phosphates segment and our International Distribution segment. So when we sell phosphates to International Distribution, primarily Brazil, we do not take -- we back off the profit -- or the profit is recognized, I should say, in the Phosphate segment and then it's eliminated in the corporate segment until that product is sold by International Distribution. And so what you're seeing here is a product that moved in the fourth quarter out of International Distribution and, therefore, the profit is fully being recognized by Mosaic. And then I think your third question was an increase in other current assets. And I think the answer to that is primarily additional FPDs this year compared to the last relevant period. So I hope that's a response to your question."

But late in January, the Indian government stopped allowing shipments to be moved from ports in-country. So inventory had built up. It will get cleaned out to quicker. How long that lasts -- and we've seen it before, where it allows inventory to be cleaned up in-country, and it allows them to reset the subsidy. We have no idea what the subsidy will be for P&K in India but it will be lower. And I think the other piece that -- the inventory built up for a couple of reasons. And I think the biggest one was that the expectations for demand last year were a little higher than people -- than what ended up happening. The impact of the drought in India impacted both P&K usage. And right now, what we're seeing in-country with our own in-country business, this product is moving from the distributor's shelf to the farmers. And so we have to separate what happens on the import side from what happens on the distributor's shelf. And frankly, this move of their's will help clean up some of that inventory. And we look forward to -- the back half of the year will be very good going into India, but it won't be at the level we experienced last year. Mike, do you want to add something there?"

Obviously, there are a lot of uncertainties there with respect to how good or bad the monsoon will be this year, what happens to exchange rates, what if any changes to subsidies. So a lot of moving parts there. But bottom line, our best guess at this point is, in terms of MOP imports, we think they'll be off a little bit. Recall that in calendar year 2005, India imported 4 million tonnes of potash, off a little bit from 4.3 million the previous year, but up from 3 million tonnes in 2013. We think they'll be in that 3.7 million to 3.9 million range this year, so off a little bit. Phosphate may be a little bit different story, as we noted earlier. Imports surged to, like, 2.5 million tonnes last year from very low levels. Yes, we think they're probably be off maybe 0.5 million to 0.75 million tonnes this year. And how much depends on all of those factors we noted earlier."

Let me just highlight with Esterhazy, it's a little difficult to give an absolute CapEx number because much of it will be, going forward, will be development money that we spend, developing the add-its [ph] and the mining area in -- underground at Esterhazy. And that is money we will not be spending at K2 or K1. So there's a trade-off there. We have probably about $300 million to $600 million to spend over the next 3 years at Esterhazy for the other equipment, like the conveyors, the shaft and development around the shaft. So I would say those are the expected. And then there's a net tax effect. So overall, the net money we're spending, I'm not sure the exact number, but it isn't -- the gross number is about $600 million. The think I'd point out is, once we do have that completed, once we have ramped up Esterhazy, if we can remove our total brine cost at some point, that is today costing us about $18 a tonne across the whole business.

Farmers are still having issues with access to credit, but from our own business, we're doing a nice job of managing credit, helping farmers connect themselves with either banks or with barter opportunities. Mike, do you want to take the China question?"

But that basically took their support price down from on big round numbers, $10 to $9. We expect that there will be further cuts in that, but it still keeps Chinese support prices for corn at relatively high levels compared to the rest of the world. So just in terms of farm economics, we think farm economics remain healthy in China. The drop that we're showing in, for example, in potash shipments relates more to the buildup of inventories than any drop in demand. I think the bigger concern there is making Chinese corn, for example, more competitive will cut into their imports of corn substitutes, whether it's DDGS, sorghum, barley or whatever. But by and large, we think Chinese farm economics and the demand drivers there are still okay."

So just to call out to our potash team, that has really done an extraordinary job of a very complicated big project. 
So let me give my conclusions. To conclude our call, I just want to reiterate our key themes: First, we expect Mosaic to emerge as a stronger company from this challenging part of the cycle, because we've built a resilient business. And second, demand for agricultural commodities remains strong because global demand for food continues to grow. And I know we harp on that, but the reality is the whole thing is based on the food story, and it continues to grow. So we have created significant potential to accelerate when business conditions improve, and we know the business conditions will improve.

Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. It seems clear to us that you all understand the market-related challenges we face. To summarize, we're experiencing a major decline in the broader commodities",1182,"Good morning. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. It seems clear to us that you all understand the market-related challenges we face. To summarize, we're experiencing a major decline in the broader commodities markets as well as global economic uncertainty and unprecedented strength of the U.S. dollar.
In agriculture, the grain and oilseed supply and demand situation remains relatively balanced even after 3 consecutive huge harvests. And despite the severe price decline across other commodities, crop prices have been relatively stable. Unlike hard commodities, we do not see a structural imbalance in agriculture, so we have a positive outlook for the 2016 global shipments in both potash and phosphates. We believe recent price declines in potash and phosphates have been driven more by macroeconomic trend than by the current supply and demand balance. Weak currency valuations against the U.S. dollar are lowering production costs for exporting nations and raising prices for importing nations. Normal seasonal pressures are exacerbating the fertilizer price trends. As a result, our realized prices were down in the fourth quarter and have been under increasing pressure since the beginning of this year.
We see several factors that are giving farmers around the globe incentives to use fertilizer to maximize yield and revenue per acre. The price declines in fertilizer have led to high crop nutrient affordability. Farmers are experiencing lower energy costs. Currency valuations are providing tailwinds for non-U.S. growers selling U.S. dollar-priced crops. And the recent big harvests have withdrawn large amounts of nutrients from the soil, which must be replenished. As a result, demand is expected to remain strong. 
With that operating environment as a backdrop, we have 3 important concepts to discuss today. First, we expect Mosaic to emerge a stronger company from this difficult period. Second, the resilience we built into our business is real, as demonstrated by the strength of our balance sheet, our cost control and our strong execution. We believe it will yield compelling opportunities for growth as this cycle plays out. And third, agricultural commodities bear different dynamics than many other commodities, and that's a fact that we believe has been overlooked amid the general commodity market pessimism. Cycles can turn more quickly in agriculture because of unpredictable weather and the consistent underlying global demand for food. We understand that cycles are inevitable, and that they are neither tidy nor predictable. We have always managed Mosaic for the long-term for success across the business cycle. That is a lot easier to say than it is to do. So let's explore the characteristics of our franchise that we believe will allow us to emerge ahead of our competition as the business improves.
First, the earnings we reported today show our resilience. We reported $0.44 per share or $0.53 per share, excluding notable items and a catch-up in our tax accruals. This catch-up was a result of higher accruals through the first 3 quarters of the year, and a true-up in this quarter, which resulted in a low effective tax rate in the quarter.
For the full year, we earned $1 billion. And our earnings per share of $2.78 were higher than the $2.68 per share Mosaic earned in 2014, reflecting both our execution and our capital allocation. It is important to note that Mosaic remains solidly profitable and free cash flow positive despite the very tough markets.
We've taken the actions necessary to ensure stability. We made tremendous progress on costs. We are well ahead of schedule on our initiatives to generate $500 million of cost savings by 2018. It's important to note that we began that work with Mosaic already occupying competitive cost positions on the global potash and phosphate cost curves. We've made tough decisions, including difficult moves to stop our MOP production at Carlsbad, New Mexico and decommission our potash mine in Hersey, Michigan. We've also saved significant cost through innovative decisions and by investing the necessary capital to improve processes for the long term.
We've made major progress towards a strong and efficient balance sheet. We've reached our leverage targets while maintaining enough cash to provide a buffer. That seems conservative to some no doubt, but it will prove prudent and provide flexibility others do not have in this environment.
In 2012, when potash prices were close to $450 per tonne, we indefinitely postponed a $3 billion potash expansion. 2 years ago, we had the opportunity to contract for ammonia with natural gas-based prices and decided to forego building a $1.2 billion ammonia plant. We took that capital and returned it to shareholders, retiring nearly a quarter of our outstanding shares since we were split off from Cargill.
And we're executing at a very high level. Our plants and mines are efficient. We've had very little unplanned downtime. And as an indicator of our effectiveness, we delivered another year of record low reportable injury frequency.
To put it simply, we have not built the company just to weather storms. We have built it to succeed across the cycles that we all know will come. We've also created a great deal of potential, and that's why we believe so strongly that Mosaic will emerge a winner. We expect to realize the value of our many growth initiatives across the cycle, and we believe we have created a tremendous amount of leverage for when better conditions arrive. We've covered our many growth initiatives in the past, so I'll provide you with a short update.
The Esterhazy K3 potash mine remains on schedule and on budget. When the project is completed, the mine will be amongst the lowest cost, most efficient mines in the world. It will give us important operating flexibility, including the ability at some point to fully eliminate material brine management costs. 
The CF phosphate acquisition has exceeded our expectations. Those facilities generated excellent margins for the first 18 months we owned them. 
The ADM acquisition in Brazil and Paraguay continues to hold significant promise. The current difficult economic and political situation in Brazil is temporarily muting the benefit we expect.
Our work to ensure stable, cost-effective access to our phosphate raw materials is nearing completion. We have finished the sulfur mill project in our New Wales facility in Florida, and our ammonia supply agreement with CF begins next year. While the economics in the near term are less attractive with $310 per tonne ammonia, long-term economics remain highly positive. 
Also at New Wales, our project to increase MicroEssentials capacity is nearing completion. We will have the ability to make 3.5 million tonnes of MicroEssentials, which provide significant value to the farmers, the retailers and to Mosaic.
The Wa’ad Al Shamal phosphate projects in Saudi Arabia is also progressing, and we expect initial production of ammonia later this year. Taken together, all this work gives Mosaic resilience and potential, which in turn gives us the opportunity to emerge from the weak part of the cycle in the lead. 
Now I will turn the call over to Rich Mack for insights into our financial results and our guidance. Rich?"
890498,298687372,932657,"The Mosaic Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","The Mosaic Company","Executives","Thank you, Joc, and good morning to you, all. To briefly reiterate Joc's commentary on the markets, our financial results are being impacted by a confluence of challenging factors. Global macroeconomic uncertainty; ongoing currency volatility and weakness",1413,"Thank you, Joc, and good morning to you, all. To briefly reiterate Joc's commentary on the markets, our financial results are being impacted by a confluence of challenging factors. Global macroeconomic uncertainty; ongoing currency volatility and weakness in key currencies against the U.S. dollar; the lack of sufficient credit in Brazil; and in potash, a recently completed Canpotex proving run that added supply in the seasonally slow part of the year.
Over the longer term though, we see cause for optimism, including a balanced supply-and-demand picture in phosphates, a manageable supply and demand picture in potash and good conditions for agriculture in Brazil, where the weak reais leads to high prices in local currency for grains and oilseeds.
Now I'll provide an overview of results in each of our 3 operating segments. In Phosphates, our margins were lower in the fourth quarter, primarily because of timing. We were selling fertilizer manufactured when raw material prices were higher than they are today. At the same time, prices dropped quickly as traders anticipated the impact of lower raw material costs and buyers' delayed purchasing. So for the near term, we are seeing seasonally limited sales volumes and softer prices before we can realize our lower raw material costs. These trends are expected to continue into the first quarter.
If we look longer term however, our stripping margin is expected to remain healthy, with much lower raw material prices offsetting lower fertilizer prices. We expect continued declines in sulfur, reflecting a number of curtailment announcements in China as well as our own. These low raw material costs, combined with a firming of phosphate prices in the spring, leads us to expect margin rates to rebound to normal levels after the first quarter.
In the first quarter, we expect the seasonally slow sales to continue and raw material costs to fall further. Last week, we announced that we are once again curtailing production to avoid the building of high-cost inventory. As a result, we expect our phosphate operating rates to be in the range of 70% to 80%. These factors are all embedded assumptions in our Phosphates guidance. It is noteworthy that sales volumes picked up after we announced our decision to reduce production.
For the full year, we expect margins to be similar to last year, underpinned by our constructive view of the industry. We expect to ship between 9 million and 10 million tonnes of phosphates, with global market shipments increasing yet again this year to a range of 65 million to 67 million tonnes. 
In the Potash segment, we remained solidly profitable despite the drop in prices. Our work to reduce costs as well as the tailwinds provided by the weak Canadian dollar, have enabled us to maintain reasonable margins.
Looking back at potash supply and demand. In the latter part of 2014, customers built significant inventories with the expectation of a drawdown in 2015. That inventory reduction occurred to some extent, but it was less pronounced than we had expected. Heading into the 2016 planting season in North America, we expect strong demand and good shipment levels, tempered by the fact that retailers continue to hold higher inventories. 
As a result of these factors, we have lowered our estimate of global potash shipments by 3 million tonnes to a range of 58 million to 60 million tonnes, consistent with 2015, which was the second highest year of shipments ever. We do not believe the potash supply-and-demand scenario is grossly out of balance. Many producers, including Mosaic, have cut back volumes in response to the seasonal lack of demand. Per our earlier production curtailment announcements, we reduced our operating rate in the fourth quarter by about 20 percentage points compared to last year.
In the first quarter, we plan to operate our potash mines at approximately 70% to 80% of capacity in order to meet global demand we expect to emerge during the second quarter. We expect pent-up demand to come from most of our major markets: China, Brazil, India, Southeast Asian and North America as well as from Europe, all at roughly the same time this year, which should provide a solid foundation for prices. In the meantime, we will maintain our disciplined approach to meeting our customers' demands. We have operational flexibility, a low cost structure, including the benefit of low natural gas prices at our Belle Plaine solution mine and the benefit of a weak Canadian dollar, which in 2015 was down as much as the Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar.
Our first quarter potash volume guidance anticipates demand emerging around the world toward the end of this quarter. And as a result, our expected operating rate is well below the same period last year. Margins are expected to be in the low to mid-20% range, reflecting both lower realized prices and our decision to produce only to expected market demand. We expect our shipments to North America to be about flat with last year's levels, with the reduction in volumes primarily a function of delayed demand in the export markets. Our full year volume guidance of 7.5 million to 8.5 million tonnes reflects an expected increase in Canpotex potash exports. 
In our International Distribution segment, we continue to be impacted by the difficult political and economic situation in Brazil. Fertilizer demand remains slower than usual, primarily because farmers are having difficulty finding appropriate access to credit. The credit situation is giving farmers incentive to acquire their inputs through barter, a system that can benefit Mosaic because of our strong relationships with key players in the Brazilian barter market. These arrangements also allow us to take a conservative approach to granting credit, which lowers overall credit losses.
Farmers in Brazil continue to plant for big crops. In fact, a high percentage of second-crop corn has already been sold in advance because of the favorable currency dynamics. So farmers need to plant their acres and maximize yields. We believe that will facilitate additional fertilizer demand.
Brazilian credit availability is the swing factor in our volume guidance assumptions for the first quarter and full year. Because of the relatively high proportion of fixed costs, higher volumes positively impact margins per tonne as does a higher proportion of MicroEssentials in our sales. 
Finally, I should note that our forecasted margins anticipate relative stability in the reais. For 2016, we expect our distribution volumes to range from 6 million to 7 million tonnes. 
For calendar 2016, our annual guidance ranges are as follows: Canadian resource taxes and royalties are expected to be in the range of $180 million to $220 million, down from $281 million in 2015. Brine management costs are expected to be consistent with 2015, in the range of $160 million to $180 million. Our SG&A expense is estimated to be $350 million to $370 million. We will continue to look for opportunities to take additional costs out of the system to increase cash flow and to manage the company for the inevitable cyclical upturn. 
Our effective tax rate is expected to be in the high-teen percentage range. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $900 million to $1.1 billion, plus around the $300 million for our interest in the Ma’aden Wa’ad Al Shamal Phosphate Company.
As we have previously guided, approximately $600 million of our capital expenditures is sustaining capital. And the majority of the remainder is for projects already well underway. We are prepared to calibrate capital spending further to reflect current market conditions. Given the current attractiveness of Mosaic's share price, new capital commitments must meet a very high risk-adjusted hurdle rate.
And one more note on capital. Today, we announced an accelerated share repurchase program of $75 million. As you know, cycles bring opportunities. And during the fourth quarter, we were evaluating some unique opportunities and did not affect additional share repurchases. We are pleased to be in a position to make today's announcement, and we will continue to embrace the capital management philosophy we have often articulated in the past.
To conclude, I would like to reiterate Joc's main points. There is no doubt that markets are challenging on several fronts, but Mosaic has made and will continue to make notable progress. We have the financial and operational resilience and discipline to succeed in weak markets. And we have significant leverage to outperform as conditions improve, which they always do in this sector.
With that, I'll return the call back to Joc for his closing comments. Joc?"

As I think was noted earlier, there have been some shutdowns in China. Those tonnes, we think will be lost. Our projection that we're using right now in our S&D is somewhere in that 10 million tonne range. We think it will be off a bit from the record last year. In terms of the first question, phosphate inventories and, Rick, you should comment as well. I think it varies from region to region. Certainly, continuing in China, we know that inventories have built up at the plant level. We think they're high there. Distributors in China are the same as distributors around the world in terms of when prices are trending down, they tend not to take positions. So we've seen a backup of inventories at the plant. But overall, we don't think inventories in China are excessive. The situation in India may be a little bit different. They had a 2.5 million tonne increase in imports last year, and we think that inventories there are certainly greater than what they had been the last couple of years, when they were pulled down to very low levels. North America, I think, is in good shape. And in terms of Brazil, inventories ended the year maybe a little bit above average, but I think we're seeing some positive signs there that things are beginning to move. So I'll let Rick provide his color commentary as well."

And we see the phosphate inventories, frankly, being drawn down. Mike described them as about even year-over-year. But the sales that are going on right now for the first quarter reflect farmers coming back into that marketplace. So I think those inventories get drawn down. And we just finished spending time this week with some of our larger North American customers. And I would say, their buying is probably lower than it's been for the last 3 years. They're going to wait and move hand to mouth, and so they're not sitting on a lot of inventories. There's not a lot of inventory sitting in North America. And so we expect when the season hits, this bodes very well. And volumes will move through the system."

That was a great opportunity for us. And just a couple of years ago, I would argue that we rolled up the CF phosphates business at a very attractive valuation. So as Joc noted, anything that we would do would go through a very strong filter. But the fact that we have a strong balance sheet, which I would argue would be the envy of many in the mining sector and ag sector today, is of great benefit to us.

The rest of the plant should be ready by, let's call it, late 2016 or early 2017, and then start commissioning at that stage.

We -- this year, we're at the tail end of Ma'aden, is what I would say. 2016 will represent the vast majority of our remaining expenditures there. I think we're suggesting about $300 million in 2016. There could be some spillover effect that goes into 2017. And that's yet to be determined, based on a variety of factors in terms of how the construction is progressing today. Joc noted, ammonia production comes online later this year. Phosphate production will come online sometime during 2017, but there will be a ramp-up period. And we're progressing, I would say, very quickly right now in terms of the construction process. And those time horizons are still generally consistent with what we thought about a couple of years ago. Your question about the -- or the positive contribution in the corporate segment really relates to intercompany eliminations between our Phosphates segment and our International Distribution segment. So when we sell phosphates to International Distribution, primarily Brazil, we do not take -- we back off the profit -- or the profit is recognized, I should say, in the Phosphate segment and then it's eliminated in the corporate segment until that product is sold by International Distribution. And so what you're seeing here is a product that moved in the fourth quarter out of International Distribution and, therefore, the profit is fully being recognized by Mosaic. And then I think your third question was an increase in other current assets. And I think the answer to that is primarily additional FPDs this year compared to the last relevant period. So I hope that's a response to your question."

How long that lasts -- and we've seen it before, where it allows inventory to be cleaned up in-country, and it allows them to reset the subsidy. We have no idea what the subsidy will be for P&K in India but it will be lower. And I think the other piece that -- the inventory built up for a couple of reasons. And I think the biggest one was that the expectations for demand last year were a little higher than people -- than what ended up happening. The impact of the drought in India impacted both P&K usage. And right now, what we're seeing in-country with our own in-country business, this product is moving from the distributor's shelf to the farmers. And so we have to separate what happens on the import side from what happens on the distributor's shelf. And frankly, this move of their's will help clean up some of that inventory.

Recall that in calendar year 2005, India imported 4 million tonnes of potash, off a little bit from 4.3 million the previous year, but up from 3 million tonnes in 2013. We think they'll be in that 3.7 million to 3.9 million range this year, so off a little bit. Phosphate may be a little bit different story, as we noted earlier. Imports surged to, like, 2.5 million tonnes last year from very low levels. Yes, we think they're probably be off maybe 0.5 million to 0.75 million tonnes this year.

So overall, the net money we're spending, I'm not sure the exact number, but it isn't -- the gross number is about $600 million. The think I'd point out is, once we do have that completed, once we have ramped up Esterhazy, if we can remove our total brine cost at some point, that is today costing us about $18 a tonne across the whole business. So we see the Esterhazy cost as being extremely competitive, probably some of the best and certainly, some of the best in North America, once we get this done. Rich, do you want to continue that?"

But that basically took their support price down from on big round numbers, $10 to $9. We expect that there will be further cuts in that, but it still keeps Chinese support prices for corn at relatively high levels compared to the rest of the world. So just in terms of farm economics, we think farm economics remain healthy in China. The drop that we're showing in, for example, in potash shipments relates more to the buildup of inventories than any drop in demand. I think the bigger concern there is making Chinese corn, for example, more competitive will cut into their imports of corn substitutes, whether it's DDGS, sorghum, barley or whatever.

So let me give my conclusions. To conclude our call, I just want to reiterate our key themes: First, we expect Mosaic to emerge as a stronger company from this challenging part of the cycle, because we've built a resilient business. And second, demand for agricultural commodities remains strong because global demand for food continues to grow. And I know we harp on that, but the reality is the whole thing is based on the food story, and it continues to grow.

Thank you for joining our call. Today we're going to focus on the actions Mosaic is taking so that we can continue to successfully navigate in this market environment.
The key concepts we want you to understand are: first, Mosaic's operational flexibility and solid balance sheet give us significant competitive advantages in a prolonged period of softer markets; second, we expect global demand for our products to be healthy, particularly, in the second half of the year; and third, this management team has been through a number of cycles, and we have the experience and discipline to position Mosaic for success across cycle.
I know that most of you understand the headwinds that we've been facing, so I won't spend a lot of time the business environment. Suffice it say, while the market environment has been challenging for crop nutrients in recent months, we fully understand and accept the cyclicality of our business.  And know from prior history, that this cycle too will turn for the better. It's our responsibility to be well-positioned when this happens. And to take advantage of opportunities the cycles present. Grain and oilseed prices up stabilized with the upper trend in recent weeks. In fact, both corn and soybean prices are higher today then they were 12 months ago. related weather conditions around the world are creating concern for the current crop, which is driving a rally in prices corn prices.
These improvements, along with expectations that U.S. farmers will plant a big crop, underpin our strong fertilizer demand outlook for the remainder of the year. Yet, fertilizer prices remain low, with our average realized prices for potash and phosphates coming in at $207 and $351 per tonne, respectively, in the first quarter. Our realized potash prices have fallen by over $80 per tonne compared with a year ago. Several factors continue to impact fertilizer prices, including the strong U.S. dollar especially against key currencies in potash-producing countries. Ample channel inventories, declining farm incomes, lower material cost, perceptional oversupply in potash, and the purchasing behavior, while the market awaits the bellwether potash contract with China.
Demand has been slower to materialize than we anticipated. A short period of warm dry weather in the corn belt in March created an expectation for an early spring, which just did not materialize as we progressed through the quarter. These conditions, taken together, led to a challenging start to the year as we expected. Mosaic earned $257 million or $0.73 per share on revenue of $1.7 billion in our first quarter. Adjusted earnings per share totaled $0.14. In the potash business, we generated $86 million in operating earnings and reported a gross margin rate of 30%, excluding resource taxes. Our phosphate operating earnings were $18 million with a gross margin rate of 7%. Phosphate margins were impacted by a smaller in-season rebound in prices than we and the timing of material costs, which Rich will address in more detail shortly.
We continue to expect a strong second half with improving global demand for the remainder of 2016. North American spring application is in full swing and we're good indications from other key regions. Demand is high in Brazil despite the political and economic turmoil. Similarly in India, a good monsoon season and a constructive nutrient resolution, including unchanged potash subsidies despite lower market prices, are driving strong application.
Our outlook for the remainder of the year includes rising demand and respectable shipment volumes, as well as traditional seasonal pricing behavior.
The recent run-up in agricultural commodity prices, combined with current due to prices, make our products very affordable. In fact, crop nutrients are more affordable today then they have been during the last 5 years. This gives us confidence in the second half outlook.
Now, let's discuss the affirmative steps we're taking to effectively manage our business and the levers that remain available. First, we are benefiting from our work to reduce expenses. Mosaic today is a low-cost producer. And we are building on this competitive advantage. Two years ago, when I was the plan to obtain $500 million in cost-savings. We are on track to achieve that goal. And we're working now to cut costs further. With the current softness in the industry, we plan to reduce support function expenses by an additional $75 million per year, and expect most of the benefit to be realized in 2017.
We're actively working on our plans in this area and intent to provide additional information and insights during our next earnings call. We also plan to reduce our capital expenditures for 2016. During our last call, we provided capital guidance of $900 million to $1.1 billion. We are reducing our 2016 guidance to $800 million to $900 million. This reduction will not compromise employee safety, or a critical sustaining capital needs. But we are deferring or elevating capital spending where we can.
In addition, we plan to continue our work to optimize our asset portfolio. We've made important progress over the last few years of my including a sale of and shutdown of MOP production at Carlsbad. We have exited underperforming businesses, regions, and assets. And we have curtailed production when the market softened. We will continue to manage our asset base to match supply with global demand environment. This is an area where we will provide more detail along with cost-saving and medium-term capital spending later this year.
At the same time, we are not just down the hatches. We're also looking for opportunities to invest and we will continue to drive a culture of innovation so that Mosaic will continue to lead the industry across all cycles.
With that, I will ask Rich Mack to provide insight as well as our guidance for the second quarter. Rich?"

I would like to reiterate Joc's key points. Mosaic is committed to maintaining a solid balance sheet because we understand the cyclicality of this business.We do have the ability to withstand difficult market conditions, seek opportunities",1628,"Thanks, Jock. I would like to reiterate Joc's key points. Mosaic is committed to maintaining a solid balance sheet because we understand the cyclicality of this business.
We do have the ability to withstand difficult market conditions, seek opportunities and emerge strong and ready to outperform in better markets.
And make no mistake, that our markets will materialize at some point. So today, I'd like to begin by providing an overview of our results in each segment.
In potash, our shipments volumes came in at the low end of our expectations. We shipped just over 1.5 million tonnes of potash, with demand in North America by weather and purchasing behavior by our customers. Potash prices drifted lower during the quarter, pressured by the seasonally slow demand, the lack of a China contract and additional product available in North America.
In light of the market dynamics, the potash gross margin rate of 30%, excluding resource taxes, was respectable. And it demonstrated our significant progress on cost control. We have made the difficult, but necessary decisions to stop higher cost production and curtail production elsewhere, and we have reduced spending across the business unit.
Our operating rate in potash was 77%, which was within our guidance range. We are continuing to manage our production to meet customer needs and global demand.
With the spring season finally in full swing in North America, demand is emerging. We expect global demand to surge that produces reach contracts with Chinese customers, which we expect to occur in the second quarter. Once that contract price has been set, we should see pent-up demand from other regions around the world, most notably, India. As a result, we now expect our global shipments for the year to be the range up 7.5 million to 8.0 million tonnes, which more than of their sales occurring in the second half of the year.
In fact, our Q2 volume guidance assumes minimal shipments to China and India. We expect prices to remain range bound, primarily due to the effects of the strong dollar and available global supply.
We anticipate average realized prices in the second quarter will be the range of $180 to $200 per tonne. Prices will continue to put pressure on margins, and our expectation for the second quarter is for the potash gross margin rate to be in the mid- to high-teens, excluding resource taxes.
The sequential decline in realized prices, the negative impact of reduced operating rates and a $50 dollar reduction in average realized prices are the main drivers of reduced segment profitability. In the Phosphate segment, shipment volumes came in at the high end of our guidance at 2.2 million tonnes.
Demand was good in Brazil and North America, while demand began to develop in India toward the end of the quarter. Market prices increased $40 per tonne in the first quarter, but we did not see quite the da magnitude of improvement we expected, mostly due to the timing of North America planting and an increase in competition from imported product.
Lower finished phosphate prices as well as the timing of raw material pricing caused our phosphate gross margin rate to fall below our expectations. We regularly discuss the impact of raw materials on our margin in phosphates. So I'd like to explain that in a bit more detail now.
There is a time lag between purchasing raw materials and selling finished phosphates. It generally takes 3 to 4 months toi raw materials to move through the finished goods inventory and cost of goods sold and to be recognized in our financials. Recently, finished phosphate prices declined faster than raw materials leading us to sell higher cost inventory at lower prices, which put pressure on margins. While raw material prices are more stable today and sales volume are picking up, phosphate prices are under pressure as Brazilians wait out the impact of the recently stranded real. While Indian importers are slow to purchase as they draw down inventories.
As a result, margins in the second quarter will remain at around 10%. We do expect both Brazil and India to import a sizable volumes later in the year, and also anticipate phosphate gross margins to return to the high-teens in the second half of 2016, where we will see the full benefits of the lower ammonia and sulfur surprises.
For the second quarter, we expect phosphate volumes to be in the range of 2.3 million to 2.6 million tonnes, with the sequential increase driven by rising seasonal demand. The year-over-year decline reflects our decision not to participate in certain geographies, most recently, for example, India, and to some extent Brazil, where current offers, in our view, do not reflect the favorable economics and ignore current global supply and demand dynamics.
Our full year volume expectations are now in the range of 9.0 million to 9.75 million tonnes with a decline driven by a slower start to 2016.
In the international distribution segment, volumes were slightly higher-than-expected. We experienced good demand in India and improving demand in Brazil, where access to farm credit began to improve last quarter. The economic and political situation in Brazil remains volatile, to say the least, and it is challenging to precisely forecast how it will affect farmers and farm credit in the months ahead. We are seeing evidence that farmers in Brazil aer continuing to plan for big crops, which bodes well for fertilizer demand.
We do not expect a meaningful improvement in international distribution profitability in the second quarter. In fact, our volume guidance reflects our decision not to pursue market share at these lower margins. The recent run-up in soybean prices, however, should help improve the profitability of our dissolution business later in the year.
Overall, we expect business conditions to improve in the second half of 2016. The three main drivers for this uptick include: one, as we said, we expect global demand for potash and phosphate to accelerate in the second half, in fact, we continue to expect a global shipments to be near all-time records; two, as a result of these saw volumes we're excited to see a higher operating rates driving lower costs in  both our potash and phosphate businesses; and three, we expect the competitive environment to level out as the robust U.S. dollar tapes in value compared to other currencies.  For example, we've already seeing the Brazilian real and the Russian ruble correct to a certain degree, and macroeconomic indicators such as that further strengthening of those the currencies is not out of the question.
Of course, that also means our higher dollar denominated operating cost for us and Canada. But we believe, we're well hedged against short-term Canadian dollar fluctuations. So, as Joc noted, in the current environment Mosaic is focused on optimizing cash flow by influencing key levers, which we have a degree of control over. This includes, producing or altogether eliminating capital spending, finding ways to further materially reduce operating and support function costs, optimizing Mosaic's portfolio of assets, driving working capital efficiency, and lastly, managing balance sheet targets relative to current liquidity requirements such as investments and/or limited.
So let's start with capital. As Joc noted, we intend to reduce capital expenditures further this year by differing, eliminating and reprioritizing investments. We expect CapEx to range from $800 million to $900 million, plus approximately $220 million for the modern project, which is down significantly from where we were projecting 3 months ago.
On a normalized basis, Mosaic will spend roughly $500 million to $550 million in sustaining capital projects. In some years this number may be higher, while in more challenging years, we will spend less. In addition to typical sustaining capital, today we have 3 distinct projects that increase our CapEx requirements to the revised range that I highlighted above.
These projects include as the K3, the joint venture and Mosaic's next-generation phosphate mine in Florida. Our modern spending will be concluded in 2017, and we will be allocating some capital for both K3 and the new phosphate mine for the next several years until completed.
Having said that, however, you should know that we are also evaluating further opportunities to reduce capital spending on the last 2 projects, as well as additional asset optimization scenarios across our entire organization. To Joc's points regarding expenses, we're moving quickly and aggressively to reduce support function cost.
We're targeting an annual run rate savings of $75 million, the majority of which should be captured in calendar year 2017. A portion will also be realized in 2016, which is in part driving a reduction in full year SG&A expenses, now expected to be the range up $340 million to $360 million, down from $350 million to $370 million provided earlier in the year.
We expect to have more detail on these initiatives on our second quarter earnings call.
Our balance sheet remains a source of strength and resilience. Our strong liquidity buffer of $2.5 billion exist for us to use when necessary, for protection in difficult parts of the cycle. Our balance sheet strength also allows us to remain committed to our dividend in today's market environment. 
So to summarize, we have a build Mosaic, it's operations, it's operations, it's talent base, and its financial foundation to succeed across cycles in a business that we know to be cyclical. We are taking the actions necessary to adapt to this environment and to ensure Mosaic remains in a strong position regardless of the market environment.
We will continue to actively assess and manage our balance sheet and we will adapt as necessary should the down part of the cycle be longer or more pronounced than expected. Now, I will turn the call back over to Joc for concluding remarks."

If you look around the globe, at some of the key markets, several positive developments there. In the case of India, I think there's a growing optimism as far as the demand prospects due to a forecast for an d above-normal monsoon event. We had some strengthening of the rupee, and we have a very workable subsidy scheme that was introduced at the end or the beginning of their fiscal year. When you look at country like Brazil, local currency prices of key commodities like soybeans, sugar, coffee are at all-time highs. We think that underpins very good demand. You look at, the fact that has been an early release of more credit. So farmers have greater flexibility, the product is moving to the farm. So lot of positive development that make us optimistic for second half demand. So what that means, Andrew, in terms of margin. Is yes, we expect some price improvement. We certainly, expect the raw material imports will benefit from that as they flow through our products. And just as importantly, you've seen our operating cost that we've really worked hard to reduce. And as operating go rates go back to more normal rates as demand picks up, our cost will further decline. So we expect to see as we said earlier, pretty normal margin rates in the second half."

One, I think we mentioned before that we think we mentioned before that we think there could be a pretty strong of demand. we think Brazil will be in the market, India will be in the market, and North America will be all active at pretty much the same time. So there is the potential for some strong seasonal pressures, we believe. I think the second point is that, raw material costs have come down a lot. And then that's been part of the reason for the drop in the phosphate prices. And those costs are beginning to stabilize. So I don't think there's going to be quite as many tailwinds from lower raw material costs. And then, a third point is, some of the currency changes that have taken place, is beginning to pinch margins for some of those producers, who greatly benefited from a depreciated currency. And then finally, as Joc mentioned, the subsidies that was announced in India, is a very workable subsidy. And I think it remains to be seen how the markets sort of sorts out the spoils of that subsidy. If there's a punching and you get some price pressure, certainly, the Indians can afford to pay more. We've done some real simple analysis that shows if retail prices drop slightly in India, certainly the Indians can afford to pay prices up into the 380s. So I think, there is the potential there for a lots of things combining to provide some uplift in price in the second half."

As far as our ids business, we did step in and tonnes outside of Canpotex is our primary supplier, in fact, our soul supplier. But we did step in during the period where they had less tonnes going into the market and bought some from third parties. That continues into the second quarter. It's not a huge amount of tonnes. And frankly, we've been able to manage through kind of a tightness in the marketplace. So that's first. There was some question of us buying up some tonnes in North America and trying to move them into this revision business taking an arbitration on the price spreads from the Senegal to move them into our Brazil business. That we could not recollect up enough to make that -- make it a vessel truly work. But that arbitration is there. And if prices remain lower in North America, that would surely be opportunity for somebody to play that game."

According to Chinese customs statistics, first quarter exports were down about 560,000 tonnes from a year ago. We think that that will continue in the last three quarters of the year. And our last estimate from our Chinese team indicates that, we believe, that Chinese exports will be down about 2 million tonnes for the year from a record 11.7 million last year to about 9.6 million tonnes this year. As you know, the Chinese have stopped building phosphate plants after this dramatic expansion over the past 10 years. And as Joc mentioned, we think that there will be some restructuring that takes place in what's a very heterogeneous industry there. And that over time, exports probably will stabilize somewhere in that 7 million to 8 million tonne range. There is an analog, if you look that what happened on the nitrogen side of the business, I think, 2015 was the first year were closures of ammonia capacity exceeded increases in capacity. And so, capacity in China can decline, and we think, that over the next 5 years, you'll see a significant restructuring, and China, becomes of certainly a large, but a more stable player in our market."

Our phosphate conversion costs are lower despite a significantly lower operating rate. And we held on phosphate rate flat for several years. And all this is part of the program.

I think all of that, and in terms of no growth, I think you'll see may be a reallocation of nutrients between from nitrogen into phosphate and especially potash.

I know at least one of the company reporting today. So we don't want to cut into their time. Look, we fully expect the markets to strengthen as the year progresses. With that said, year-to-date, our production rates are down, consistent with our intention to balance production with sales and global demand. I want to highlight some positive steps we've taken to reduce our spending for the Mosaic to weather this current environment, and drive across cycle. We've held our production cost flat year-over-year in potash despite a 16% reduction in our operating rate. This represents would cost management as well as some currency benefits. I want to point out our inflow focus. While somewhat depend on mother nature, these are down by $70 million to $90 million from the peak, largely due to would cost control, good technology application and some currency benefits. In phosphates, we've driven our conversion cost lower Despite a significant low operating rate. And we held the cash cost of our mining operations flat over several years. We actually both of those to good cost management. We've reduced of annual capital spending expectations this year by $200 million, plus deferred almost $100 million in spending Our SG&A costs are down 10% year-over-year as lower incentives are driven by our performance, and our performance reflect the challenging market environment. And we've lowered our full year SG&A guidance. This clearly demonstrates the benefits of our work to continue to be the low-cost producer in potash and phosphates. So with that, I want to conclude our call by reiterating our key messages. We have the operating flexibility and balance sheet, we need to weather the current market environment, we fully expect the markets to improve in the second half of this year, and we understand, and are prepared for the cyclical nature of this business. The long-term remains very promising, and we manage this company for long-term success. Thank you for joining the call. Have a great day. Thank you."

Thank you for joining our call. Today we're going to focus on the actions Mosaic is taking so that we can continue to successfully navigate in this market environment.
The key concepts we want you to understand are: first, Mosaic's operational flexibility and solid balance sheet give us significant competitive advantages in a prolonged period of softer markets; second, we expect global demand for our products to be healthy, particularly, in the second half of the year; and third, this management team has been through a number of cycles, and we have the experience and discipline to position Mosaic for success across the cycle.
I know that most of you understand the headwinds that we have been facing, so I won't spend a lot of time belaboring the business environment. Suffice it to say, while the market environment has been challenging for crop nutrients in recent months, we fully understand and accept the cyclicality of our business, and know from prior history, that this cycle too, will turn for the better. It's our responsibility to be well position when this happens and to take advantage of opportunities the cycles present. Grain and oilseed prices have stabilized with the upper trend in recent weeks. In fact, both corn and soybean prices are higher today than they were 12 months ago. El Niño-related weather conditions around the world are creating concern for the current crop, which is driving a rally in soybean prices and firming corn prices.
These improvements, along with expectations that U.S. farmers will plant a big crop, underpin our strong fertilizer demand outlook for the remainder of the year. Yet, fertilizer prices remain low, with our average realized prices for potash and phosphates coming in at $207 and $355 per tonne, respectively, in the first quarter. Our realized potash prices have fallen by over $80 per tonne compared with a year ago. Several factors continue to impact fertilizer prices, including the strong U.S. dollar especially against key currencies in potash-producing countries, ample channel inventories, declining farm incomes, lower raw material costs, perceptional oversupply in potash, and the fert purchasing behavior, while the market awaits the bellwether potash contract with China.
Demand has been slower to materialize than we anticipated. A short period of warm dry weather in the corn belt in March created an expectation for an early spring, which just did not materialize as we progressed through the quarter. These conditions, taken together, led to a challenging start to the year as we expected. Mosaic earned $257 million or $0.73 per share on revenue of $1.7 billion in our first quarter. Adjusted earnings per share totaled $0.14. In the potash business, we generated $86 million in operating earnings and reported a gross margin rate of 30%, excluding resource taxes. Our phosphate operating earnings were $18 million with a gross margin rate of 7%. Phosphate margins were impacted by a smaller in-season rebound in prices than we expected and the timing of raw material costs, which Rich will address in more detail shortly.
We continue to expect a strong second half with improving global demand for the remainder of 2016. North American spring application is in full swing and we're seeing good indications from other key regions. Demand is high in Brazil despite the political and economic turmoil. Similarly, in India, a good monsoon season and a constructive nutrient subsidy resolution, including unchanged potash subsidies despite lower market prices, are driving strong Kharif application.
Our outlook for the remainder of the year includes rising demand and respectable shipment volumes as well as traditional seasonal pricing behavior.
The recent run-up in agricultural commodity prices, combined with current nutrient prices, make our products very affordable. In fact, crop nutrients are more affordable today than they have been during the last 5 years. This gives us confidence in the second half outlook.
Now, let's discuss the affirmative steps we're taking to effectively manage our business and the levers that remain available. First, we are benefiting from our work to reduce expenses. Mosaic today is a low-cost producer. And we are building on this competitive advantage. Two years ago, we announced a plan to obtain $500 million in cost savings. We are on track to achieve that goal and we're working now to cut costs further. With the current softness in the industry, we plan to reduce support function expenses by an additional $75 million per year, and expect most of the benefit to be realized in 2017.
We're actively working on our plans in this area and intend to provide additional information and insights during our next earnings call. We also plan to reduce our capital expenditures for 2016. During our last call, we provided capital guidance of $900 million to $1.1 billion. We are reducing our 2016 guidance to $800 million to $900 million. This reduction will not compromise employee safety, or a critical sustaining capital needs. But we are deferring or eliminating capital spending where we can.
In addition, we plan to continue our work to optimize our asset portfolio. We've made important progress over the last few years including the sale of Hersey and shutdown of MOP production at Carlsbad. We have exited underperforming businesses, regions, and assets. And we have curtailed production when the market softened. We will continue to manage our asset base to match supply with global demand environment. This is an area where we will provide more detail along with cost-saving and medium-term capital spending later this year.
At the same time, we are not just battening down the hatches, we're also looking for opportunities to invest and we will continue to drive a culture of innovation so that Mosaic will continue to lead the industry across all cycles.
With that, I will ask Rich Mack to provide insight into our results for the quarter as well as our guidance for the second quarter. Rich?"
890498,317250246,972397,"The Mosaic Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","The Mosaic Company","Executives","Thanks, Joc. I would like to reiterate Joc's key points. Mosaic is committed to maintaining a solid balance sheet because we understand the cyclicality of this business.We do have the ability to withstand difficult market conditions, seek opportunities",1626,"Thanks, Joc. I would like to reiterate Joc's key points. Mosaic is committed to maintaining a solid balance sheet because we understand the cyclicality of this business.
We do have the ability to withstand difficult market conditions, seek opportunities and emerge strong and ready to outperform in better markets.
And make no mistake, better markets will materialize at some point. So today, I'd like to begin by providing an overview of our results in each segment.
In potash, our shipment volumes came in at the low end of our expectations. We shipped just over 1.5 million tonnes of potash, with demand in North America hampered by weather and cautious purchasing behavior by our customers. Potash prices drifted lower during the quarter, pressured by the seasonally slow demand, the lack of a China contract and additional product available in North America.
In light of the market dynamics, our potash gross margin rate of 30%, excluding resource taxes, was respectable. And it demonstrated our significant progress on cost control. We have made the difficult, but necessary decisions to stop higher cost production and curtail production elsewhere, and we have reduced spending across the business unit.
Our operating rate in potash was 77%, which was within our guidance range. We are continuing to manage our production to meet customer needs and global demand.
With the spring planting season finally in full swing in North America, demand is emerging. We expect global demand to surge when producers reach contracts with the Chinese customers, which we expect to occur in the second quarter. Once that contract price has been set, we should see pent-up demand from other regions around the world, most notably, India. As a result, we now expect our global shipments for the year to be in the range up 7.5 million to 8.0 million tonnes, with more of those sales occurring in the second half of the year.
In fact, our Q2 volume guidance assumes minimal shipments to China and India. We expect prices to remain range bound, primarily due to the effects of the strong dollar and available global supply.
We anticipate average realized prices in the second quarter will be the range of $180 to $200 per tonne. Prices will continue to put pressure on margins, and our expectation for the second quarter is for the potash gross margin rate to be in the mid- to high-teens, excluding resource taxes.
The sequential decline in realized prices, the negative impact of reduced operating rates and a $50 dollar reduction in average realized K-Mag prices are the main drivers of reduced segment profitability. In the Phosphate segment, shipment volumes came in at the high end of our guidance at 2.2 million tonnes.
Demand was good in Brazil and North America, while demand began to develop in India toward the end of the quarter. Market prices increased $40 per tonne in the first quarter, but we did not see quite the magnitude of improvements we expected, mostly due to the timing of North America planting and an increase in competition from imported product.
Lower finished phosphate prices as well as the timing of raw material pricing caused our phosphate gross margin rate to fall below our expectations. We regularly discuss the impact of raw materials on our margin in phosphates. So I'd like to explain that in a bit more detail now.
There is a time lag between purchasing raw materials and selling finished phosphates. It generally takes 3 to 4 months for raw materials to move through the finished goods inventory and cost of goods sold and to be recognized in our financials. Recently, finished phosphate prices declined faster than raw materials leading us to sell higher cost inventory at lower prices, which put pressure on margins. While raw material prices are more stable today and sales volume are picking up, phosphate prices are under pressure as Brazilians weighed out the impact of the recently strengthened real, while Indian importers are slow to purchase as they draw down inventories.
As a result, margins in the second quarter will remain around 10%. We do expect both Brazil and India to import sizable volumes later in the year, and also anticipate phosphate gross margins to return to the high-teens in the second half of 2016, where we will see the full benefits of the lower ammonia and sulfur prices.
For the second quarter, we expect phosphate volumes to be in a range of 2.3 million to 2.6 million tonnes, with the sequential increase driven by rising seasonal demand. The year-over-year decline reflects our decision not to participate in certain geographies, most recently, for example, India, and to some extent Brazil, where current offers, in our view, do not reflect favorable economics and ignore current global supply and demand dynamics.
Our full year volume expectations are now in the range of 9.0 million to 9.75 million tonnes with a decline driven by a slower start to 2016.
In the International Distribution segment, volumes were slightly higher-than-expected. We experienced good demand in India and improving demand in Brazil, where access to farm credit began to improve last quarter. The economic and political situation in Brazil remains volatile, to say the least, and it is challenging to precisely forecast how it will affect farmers and farm credit in the months ahead. We are seeing evidence that farmers in Brazil are continuing to plan for big crops, which bodes well for fertilizer demand.
We do not expect a meaningful improvement in international distribution profitability in the second quarter. In fact, our volume guidance reflects a decision not to pursue market share at these lower margins. The recent run-up in soybean prices, however, should help improve the profitability of our distribution business later in the year.
Overall, we expect business conditions to improve in the second half of 2016. The three main drivers for this uptick include: one, as we said, we expect global demand for potash and phosphate to accelerate in the second half. In fact, we continue to expect global shipments to be near all-time records. Two, as a result of the strong volumes, we expect to see higher operating rates driving lower costs in both our potash and phosphate businesses. And three, we expect the competitive environment to level out as the robust U.S. dollar tapers in value compared to other currencies.  For example, we've already seen the Brazilian real and the Russian ruble correct to a certain degree, and macroeconomic indicators suggest that further strengthening of those key currencies is not out of the question.
Of course, that also means higher dollar denominated operating costs for us in Canada. But we believe, we are well hedged against short-term Canadian dollar fluctuations. So, as Joc noted, in the current environment, Mosaic is focused on optimizing cash flow by influencing key levers, which we have a meaningful degree of control over. This includes, reducing or altogether eliminating capital spending, finding ways to further materially reduce operating and support function costs, optimizing Mosaic's portfolio of assets, driving working capital efficiency, and lastly, managing balance sheet targets relative to current liquidity requirements such as investments and/or dividend.
So let's start with capital. As Joc noted, we intend to reduce capital expenditures further this year by deferring, eliminating and reprioritizing investments. We expect CapEx to range from $800 million to $900 million, plus approximately $220 million for the Ma'aden project, which is down significantly from where we were projecting 3 months ago.
On a normalized basis, Mosaic will spend roughly $500 million to $550 million in sustaining capital projects. In some years, this number may be higher, while in more challenging years, we will spend less. In addition to typical sustaining capital, today we have 3 distinct projects that increase our CapEx requirements to the revised range that I highlighted above.
These projects include Esterhazy K3, the Ma'aden joint venture and Mosaic's next-generation phosphate mine in Florida. Our Ma'aden spending will be concluded in 2017, and we will be allocating some capital for both K3 and the new phosphate mine for the next several years until completed.
Having said that, however, you should know that we are also evaluating further opportunities to reduce capital spending on the last 2 projects, as well as additional asset optimization scenarios across our entire organization. To reiterate Joc's points regarding expenses, we're moving quickly and aggressively to reduce support function costs.
We're targeting an annual run rate savings of $75 million, the majority of which should be captured in calendar year 2017. A portion will also be realized in 2016, which is in part driving a reduction in full year SG&A expenses, now expected to be the range up $340 million to $360 million, down from $350 million to $370 million provided earlier in the year.
We expect to have more detail on these initiatives on our second quarter earnings call.
Our balance sheet remains a source of strength and resilience. Our strong liquidity buffer of $2.5 billion exists for us to use when necessary, for protection in difficult parts of the cycle. Our balance sheet strength also allows us to remain committed to our dividend in today's market environment. 
So to summarize, we have a built Mosaic, it's operations, it's talent base, and its financial foundation to succeed across cycles in a business that we know to be cyclical. We are taking the actions necessary to adapt to this environment and to ensure Mosaic remains in a strong position regardless of the market environment.
We will continue to actively assess and manage our balance sheet and we will adapt as necessary should the down part of the cycle be longer or more pronounced than expected. Now, I will turn the call back over to Joc for his concluding remarks."

In the case of India, I think there's a growing optimism as far as demand prospects due to a forecast for an above-normal monsoon. We've had some strengthening of the rupee, and we have a very workable subsidy scheme that was introduced at the end of or the beginning of their fiscal year. When you look at country like Brazil, local currency prices of key commodities like soybeans, sugar, coffee are at near all-time highs. We think that underpins very good demand. You look at the fact that there has been an early release of more credit, so farmers have greater flexibility. Their product is moving to the farm.

One, I think we mentioned before that we think there is -- there could be a pretty strong punching of demand. So we think Brazil will be in the market, India will be in the market, and North American fall -- fill will be all active at pretty much the same time. So there is the potential for some strong seasonal pressures, we believe. I think the second point is that, raw material costs have come down a lot. And then that's been part of the reason for the drop in phosphate prices. And those costs are beginning to stabilize. So I don't think there's going to be quite as many tailwinds from lower raw material costs. And then, a third point is, some of the currency changes that have taken place, is beginning to pinch margins for some of those producers, who greatly benefited from a depreciated currency. And then finally, as Joc mentioned, the subsidies that was announced in India, is a very workable subsidy. And I think it remains to be seen how the market sort of sorts out the spoils of that subsidy. If there is a punching and you get some price pressure, certainly, the Indians can afford to pay more. We've done some real simple analysis that shows if retail prices drop slightly in India, certainly the Indians can afford to pay prices up into the $380s. So I think, there is the potential there for a lots of things combining to provide some uplift in prices in the second half."

Recently, we've seen a precipitous decline, for example, in SOP and that results in some recalibrating for K-Mag prices, just to give 1 example. And then on Ma'aden, what you should assume there is, this is basically a timing issue with respect to capital. We would effectively guide exactly as we have in the past, and that is ammonia prices -- or I'm sorry, ammonia production will start in the fourth quarter of this year. I think we're anticipating somewhere in the vicinity of 300,000 tonnes of ammonia that will be produced out of the Ma'aden joint venture in 2016. Phosphate production will start sometime in the middle part of 2017. Both of those points in time are generally consistent with what we talked about previously.

According to Chinese custom statistics, first quarter exports were down about 560,000 tonnes from a year ago. We think that that will continue in the last three quarters of the year. And our last estimate from our Chinese team indicates that, we believe, that Chinese exports will be down about 2 million tonnes for the year from the record 11.7 million last year to about 9.6 million tonnes this year. As you know, the Chinese have stopped building phosphate plants after this dramatic expansion over the past 10 years. And as Joc mentioned, we think that there will be some restructuring that takes place in what's a very heterogeneous industry there. And that over time, exports probably will stabilize somewhere in that 7 million to 8 million tonne range. There is an analog, if you looked at what happened on the nitrogen side of the business, I think, 2015 was the first year where closures of ammonia capacity exceeded increases in capacity. And so, capacity in China can decline.

The $500 million program was a 5-year program to take out reoccurring costs over that time frame. We announced that 3 years ago. And I would say, we're probably -- certainly on track for it and probably a little bit of ahead of track. We still have some areas where we think we can get some further reductions in both G&A and operating costs. But you can see in our results that, a good chunk of that is flowing through our results today as you're well aware. I mean our potash costs are flat despite a 16% reduction in our operating rates. Our phosphate conversion costs are lower despite a significantly lower operating rate. And we've held on phosphate rock cost flat for several years and all this is part of the program. We've also -- you can see our SG&A cost this year down 10%. So overall, you can see the results as they flow through, but we still have some cost left to come, but its going very well. In terms of the sulfur melter, that sulfur is now running. We're about -- we'll probably have the biggest import impact and you've seen that sulfur prices in the Gulf come down recently. I think what it's done, is it forced the trade flow to go to what makes the best sense. And so what we will see in terms of costs, is probably not a significant decrease, but what we will see is the center Gulf liquid sulfur market going down to trading at a discount to solid market -- solid sulfur again as it has 5, 10 years ago."

In China, yes, I think your point is spot on. We expect that -- as you know, China has announced 0 growth policy after 2020. And they've also announced some changes in their crop support prices. And I think all of that, and in terms of no growth, I think you'll see may be a reallocation of nutrients between or from nitrogen into phosphate and especially potash. And I think there's some evidence of that taking place already, because last year, China had record potash imports of over 9 million tonnes, domestic production is up.

With that said, year-to-date, our production rates are down, consistent with our intention to balance production with sales and global demand. I want to highlight some positive steps we've taken to reduce our spending for the Mosaic and weather this current environment, and drive across the cycle. We've held our production costs flat year-over-year in potash despite a 16% reduction in our operating rate. This represents good cost management as well as some currency benefits. I want to point out our Bain inflow cost, while somewhat dependent on mother nature, these are down by $70 million to $90 million from the peak, largely due to good cost control, good technology application, and some currency benefits. In phosphates, we've driven our conversion costs lower despite a significant lower operating rate. And we've held the cash costs of our mining operations flat over several years, actually both of those to good cost management. We've reduced our annual capital spending expectations this year by $200 million, plus deferred almost $100 million in spending for Ma'aden. Our SG&A costs are down 10% year-over-year as lower incentives are driven by our performance, and our performance reflect the challenging market environment. And we've lowered our full year SG&A guidance. This clearly demonstrates the benefits of our work to continue to be the low-cost producer in potash and phosphates. So with that, I want to conclude our call by reiterating our key messages. We have the operating flexibility and balance sheet. We need to weather the current market environment. We fully expect the markets to improve in the second half of this year, and we understand, and are prepared for the cyclical nature of this business. The long-term remains very promising, and we manage this company for long-term success. Thank you for joining the call. Have a great day. Thank you."

Thank you for joining our call. Today we're going to focus on the actions Mosaic is taking so that we can continue to successfully navigate in this market environment.
The key concepts we want you to understand are: first, Mosaic's operational flexibility and solid balance sheet give us significant competitive advantages in a prolonged period of softer markets; second, we expect global demand for our products to be healthy, particularly, in the second half of the year; and third, this management team has been through a number of cycles, and we have the experience and discipline to position Mosaic for success across the cycle.
I know that most of you understand the headwinds that we have been facing, so I won't spend a lot of time belaboring the business environment. Suffice it to say, while the market environment has been challenging for crop nutrients in recent months, we fully understand and accept the cyclicality of our business, and know from prior history, that this cycle too, will turn for the better. It's our responsibility to be well positioned when this happens and to take advantage of opportunities the cycles present. Grain and oilseed prices have stabilized with the upward trend in recent weeks. In fact, both corn and soybean prices are higher today than they were 12 months ago. El Niño-related weather conditions around the world are creating concern for the current crop, which is driving a rally in soybean prices and firming corn prices.
These improvements, along with expectations that U.S. farmers will plant a big crop, underpin our strong fertilizer demand outlook for the remainder of the year. Yet, fertilizer prices remain low, with our average realized prices for potash and phosphates coming in at $207 and $355 per tonne, respectively, in the first quarter. Our realized potash prices have fallen by over $80 per tonne compared with a year ago. Several factors continue to impact fertilizer prices, including the strong U.S. dollar especially against key currencies in potash-producing countries, ample channel inventories, declining farm incomes, lower raw material costs, perception of oversupply in potash, and the fert purchasing behavior, while the market awaits the bellwether potash contract with China.
Demand has been slower to materialize than we anticipated. A short period of warm dry weather in the corn belt in March created an expectation for an early spring, which just did not materialize as we progressed through the quarter. These conditions, taken together, led to a challenging start to the year as we expected. Mosaic earned $257 million or $0.73 per share on revenue of $1.7 billion in our first quarter. Adjusted earnings per share totaled $0.14. In the potash business, we generated $86 million in operating earnings and reported a gross margin rate of 30%, excluding resource taxes. Our phosphate operating earnings were $18 million with a gross margin rate of 7%. Phosphate margins were impacted by a smaller in-season rebound in prices than we expected and the timing of raw material costs, which Rich will address in more detail shortly.
We continue to expect a strong second half with improving global demand for the remainder of 2016. North American spring application is in full swing and we're seeing good indications from other key regions. Demand is high in Brazil despite the political and economic turmoil. Similarly, in India, a good monsoon season and a constructive nutrient subsidy resolution, including unchanged potash subsidies despite lower market prices, are driving strong Kharif application.
Our outlook for the remainder of the year includes rising demand and respectable shipment volumes as well as traditional seasonal pricing behavior.
The recent run-up in agricultural commodity prices, combined with current nutrient prices, make our products very affordable. In fact, crop nutrients are more affordable today than they have been during the last 5 years. This gives us confidence in the second half outlook.
Now, let's discuss the affirmative steps we're taking to effectively manage our business and the levers that remain available. First, we are benefiting from our work to reduce expenses. Mosaic today is a low-cost producer. And we are building on this competitive advantage. Two years ago, we announced a plan to obtain $500 million in cost savings. We are on track to achieve that goal and we're working now to cut costs further. With the current softness in the industry, we plan to reduce support function expenses by an additional $75 million per year, and expect most of the benefit to be realized in 2017.
We're actively working on our plans in this area and intend to provide additional information and insights during our next earnings call. We also plan to reduce our capital expenditures for 2016. During our last call, we provided capital guidance of $900 million to $1.1 billion. We are reducing our 2016 guidance to $800 million to $900 million. This reduction will not compromise employee safety, or critical sustaining capital needs. But we are deferring or eliminating capital spending where we can.
In addition, we plan to continue our work to optimize our asset portfolio. We've made important progress over the last few years including the sale of Hersey and shutdown of MOP production at Carlsbad. We have exited underperforming businesses, regions, and assets. And we have curtailed production when the market softened. We will continue to manage our asset base to match supply with global demand environment. This is an area where we will provide more detail along with cost-saving and medium-term capital spending later this year.
At the same time, we are not just battening down the hatches, we're also looking for opportunities to invest and we will continue to drive a culture of innovation so that Mosaic will continue to lead the industry across all cycles.
With that, I will ask Rich Mack to provide insight into our results for the quarter as well as our guidance for the second quarter. Rich?"

I would like to reiterate Joc's key points.

I would like to reiterate Joc's key points. Mosaic is committed to maintaining a solid balance sheet because we understand the cyclicality of this business.
We do have the ability to withstand difficult market conditions, seek opportunities and emerge strong and ready to outperform in better markets.
And make no mistake, better markets will materialize at some point. So today, I'd like to begin by providing an overview of our results in each segment.
In potash, our shipment volumes came in at the low end of our expectations. We shipped just over 1.5 million tonnes of potash, with demand in North America hampered by weather and cautious purchasing behavior by our customers. Potash prices drifted lower during the quarter, pressured by the seasonally slow demand, the lack of a China contract and additional product available in North America.
In light of the market dynamics, our potash gross margin rate of 30%, excluding resource taxes, was respectable. And it demonstrated our significant progress on cost control. We have made the difficult, but necessary decisions to stop higher cost production and curtail production elsewhere, and we have reduced spending across the business unit.
Our operating rate in potash was 77%, which was within our guidance range. We are continuing to manage our production to meet customer needs and global demand.
With the spring planting season finally in full swing in North America, demand is emerging. We expect global demand to surge when producers reach contracts with the Chinese customers, which we expect to occur in the second quarter. Once that contract price has been set, we should see pent-up demand from other regions around the world, most notably, India. As a result, we now expect our global shipments for the year to be in the range up 7.5 million to 8.0 million tonnes, with more of those sales occurring in the second half of the year.
In fact, our Q2 volume guidance assumes minimal shipments to China and India. We expect prices to remain range bound, primarily due to the effects of the strong dollar and available global supply.
We anticipate average realized prices in the second quarter will be the range of $180 to $200 per tonne. Prices will continue to put pressure on margins, and our expectation for the second quarter is for the potash gross margin rate to be in the mid- to high-teens, excluding resource taxes.
The sequential decline in realized prices, the negative impact of reduced operating rates and a $50 dollar reduction in average realized K-Mag prices are the main drivers of reduced segment profitability. In the Phosphate segment, shipment volumes came in at the high end of our guidance at 2.2 million tonnes.
Demand was good in Brazil and North America, while demand began to develop in India toward the end of the quarter. Market prices increased $40 per tonne in the first quarter, but we did not see quite the magnitude of improvements we expected, mostly due to the timing of North America planting and an increase in competition from imported product.
Lower finished phosphate prices as well as the timing of raw material pricing caused our phosphate gross margin rate to fall below our expectations. We regularly discuss the impact of raw materials on our margin in phosphates. So I'd like to explain that in a bit more detail now.
There is a time lag between purchasing raw materials and selling finished phosphates. It generally takes 3 to 4 months for raw materials to move through the finished goods inventory and cost of goods sold and to be recognized in our financials. Recently, finished phosphate prices declined faster than raw materials leading us to sell higher cost inventory at lower prices, which put pressure on margins. While raw material prices are more stable today and sales volume are picking up, phosphate prices are under pressure as Brazilians wait out the impact of the recently strengthened real, while Indian importers are slow to purchase as they draw down inventories.
As a result, margins in the second quarter will remain around 10%. We do expect both Brazil and India to import sizable volumes later in the year, and also anticipate phosphate gross margins to return to the high-teens in the second half of 2016, where we will see the full benefits of the lower ammonia and sulfur prices.
For the second quarter, we expect phosphate volumes to be in a range of 2.3 million to 2.6 million tonnes, with the sequential increase driven by rising seasonal demand. The year-over-year decline reflects our decision not to participate in certain geographies, most recently, for example, India, and to some extent Brazil, where current offers, in our view, do not reflect favorable economics and ignore current global supply and demand dynamics.
Our full year volume expectations are now in the range of 9.0 million to 9.75 million tonnes with a decline driven by a slower start to 2016.
In the International Distribution segment, volumes were slightly higher-than-expected. We experienced good demand in India and improving demand in Brazil, where access to farm credit began to improve last quarter. The economic and political situation in Brazil remains volatile, to say the least, and it is challenging to precisely forecast how it will affect farmers and farm credit in the months ahead. We are seeing evidence that farmers in Brazil are continuing to plan for big crops, which bodes well for fertilizer demand.
We do not expect a meaningful improvement in international distribution profitability In the second quarter. In fact, our volume guidance reflects a decision not to pursue market share at these lower margins. The recent run-up in soybean prices, however, should help improve the profitability of our distribution business later in the year.
Overall, we expect business conditions to improve in the second half of 2016. The 3 main drivers for this uptick include: one, as we've said, we expect global demand for potash and phosphate to accelerate in the second half. In fact, we continue to expect global shipments to be near our all-time records. Two, as a result of the strong volumes, we expect to see higher operating rates driving lower costs in both our potash and phosphate businesses. And three, we expect the competitive environment to level out as the robust U.S. dollar tapers in value compared to other currencies. For example, we've already seen the Brazilian real and the Russian ruble correct to a certain degree, and macroeconomic indicators suggest that further strengthening of those key currencies is not out of the question.
Of course, that also means higher dollar denominated operating costs for us in Canada. But we believe, we are well hedged against short-term Canadian dollar fluctuations. So, as Joc noted, in the current environment, Mosaic is focused on optimizing cash flow by influencing key levers, which we have a meaningful degree of control over. This includes, reducing or altogether eliminating capital spending, finding ways to further materially reduce operating and support function costs, optimizing Mosaic's portfolio of assets, driving working capital efficiency, and lastly, managing balance sheet targets relative to current liquidity requirements such as investments and/or dividend.
So let's start with capital. As Joc noted, we intend to reduce capital expenditures further this year by deferring, eliminating and reprioritizing investments. We expect CapEx to range from $800 million to $900 million, plus approximately $220 million for the Ma'aden project, which is down significantly from where we were projecting 3 months ago.
On a normalized basis, Mosaic will spend roughly $500 million to $550 million in sustaining capital projects. In some years, this number may be higher, while in more challenging years, we will spend less. In addition to typical sustaining capital, today we have 3 distinct projects that increase our CapEx requirements to the revised range that I highlighted above.
These projects include Esterhazy K3, the Ma'aden joint venture and Mosaic's next-generation phosphate mine in Florida. Our Ma'aden spending will be concluded in 2017, and we will be allocating some capital for both K3 and the new phosphate mine for the next several years until completed.
Having said that, however, you should know that we are also evaluating further opportunities to reduce capital spending on the last 2 projects, as well as additional asset optimization scenarios across our entire organization. To reiterate Joc's points regarding expenses, we are moving quickly and aggressively to reduce support function costs.
We are targeting an annual run rate savings of $75 million, the majority of which should be captured in calendar year 2017. A portion will also be realized in 2016, which is, in part, driving a reduction in full year SG&A expenses, now expected to be the range up $340 million to $360 million, down from $350 million to $370 million provided earlier in the year.
We expect to have more detail on these initiatives on our second quarter earnings call.
Our balance sheet remains a source of strength and resilience. Our strong liquidity buffer of $2.5 billion exists for us to use when necessary, for protection in difficult parts of the cycle. Our balance sheet strength also allows us to remain committed to our dividend in today's market environment. 
So to summarize, we have a built Mosaic, its operations, its talent base, and its financial foundation to succeed across cycles in a business that we know to be cyclical. We are taking the actions necessary to adapt to this environment and to ensure Mosaic remains in a strong position regardless of the market environment.
We will continue to actively assess and manage our balance sheet and we will adapt as necessary should the down part of the cycle be longer or more pronounced than expected. Now, I will turn the call back over to Joc for his concluding remarks."

In the case of India, I think there's a growing optimism as far as demand prospects due to a forecast for an above-normal monsoon. We've had some strengthening of the rupee, and we have a very workable subsidy scheme that was introduced at the end of -- or the beginning of their fiscal year. When you look at countries like Brazil, local currency prices of key commodities like soybeans, sugar, coffee are at near all-time highs. We think that underpins very good demand. You look at the fact that there has been an early release of more credit, so farmers have greater flexibility. The product is moving to the farm. So a lot of positive development that make us optimistic for second half demand."

So we think Brazil will be in the market, India will be in the market, and North American fall -- fill will be all active at pretty much the same time. So there is the potential for some strong seasonal pressures, we believe. I think the second point is that, raw material costs have come down a lot. And then that's been part of the reason for the drop in phosphate prices. And those costs are beginning to stabilize. So I don't think there's going to be quite as many tailwinds from lower raw material costs. And then, a third point is, some of the currency changes that have taken place, is beginning to pinch margins for some of those producers, who greatly benefited from a depreciated currency. And then finally, as Joc mentioned, the subsidies that was announced in India, is a very workable subsidy. And I think it remains to be seen how the market sort of sorts out the spoils of that subsidy. If there is a bunching and you get some price pressure, certainly, the Indians can afford to pay more. We've done some real simple analysis that shows if retail prices drop slightly in India, certainly the Indians can afford to pay prices up into the $380s. So I think, there is the potential there for lots of things combining to provide some uplift in prices in the second half."

Recently, we've seen a precipitous decline, for example, in SOP and that results in some recalibrating for K-Mag prices, just to give one example. And then on Ma'aden, what you should assume there is, this is basically a timing issue with respect to capital. We would effectively guide exactly as we have in the past, and that is ammonia prices -- or I'm sorry, ammonia production will start in the fourth quarter of this year. I think we're anticipating somewhere in the vicinity of 300,000 tonnes of ammonia that will be produced out of the Ma'aden joint venture in 2016. Phosphate production will start sometime in the middle part of 2017. Both of those points in time are generally consistent with what we talked about previously. So think of the deferral in capital in 2016 related to Ma'aden to be something that will be picked up in 2017."

According to Chinese customs statistics, first quarter exports were down about 560,000 tonnes from a year ago. We think that, that will continue in the last 3 quarters of the year. And our last estimate from our Chinese team indicates that, we believe, that Chinese exports will be down about 2 million tonnes for the year from the record 11.7 million last year to about 9.6 million tonnes this year. As you know, the Chinese have stopped building phosphate plants after this dramatic expansion over the past 10 years. And as Joc mentioned, we think that there will be some restructuring that takes place in what's a very heterogeneous industry there. And that over time, exports probably will stabilize somewhere in that 7 million to 8 million tonne range. There is an analog, if you look at what happened on the nitrogen side of the business, I think, 2015 was the first year where closures of ammonia capacity exceeded increases in capacity. And so, capacity in China can decline.

We still have some areas where we think we can get some further reductions in both G&A and operating costs. But you can see in our results that, a good chunk of that is flowing through our results today as you're well aware. I mean our potash costs are flat despite a 16% reduction in our operating rates. Our phosphate conversion costs are lower despite a significantly lower operating rate. And we've held on phosphate rock cost flat for several years and all this is part of the program. We've also -- you can see our SG&A cost this year down 10%. So overall, you can see the results as they flow through, but we still have some cost left to come, but it’s going very well. In terms of the sulfur melter, that sulfur is now running. We're about -- we'll probably have the biggest import impact and you've seen that sulfur prices in the Gulf come down recently. I think what it's done, is it forced the trade flow to go to what makes the best sense.

And I think all of that, and in terms of no growth, I think you'll see may be a reallocation of nutrients between -- or from nitrogen into phosphate and especially potash.

You have a weak market today, because of cyclicality. You've also had the impact of seasonality. And the 2 have combined to create a situation that's pretty difficult for that market. That being said, we believe once the normal flow starts, i.e. once the Chinese contract is in place, once India starts buying and they get a contract in place, the demand gets sopped up pretty darn quickly, and that everybody goes back to more normal operating rates. So when you ask the long-term, Canpotex will continue to match our expectations or Canpotex and Mosaic will continue to match global demand with our available production as we have in the first quarter. And we don't see any reason for that to change at this point."

I know there is at least one other company reporting today. So we don't want to cut into their time. Look, we fully expect the markets to strengthen as the year progresses. With that said, year-to-date, our production rates are down, consistent with our intention to balance production with sales and global demand. I want to highlight some positive steps we've taken to reduce our spending so that Mosaic can weather this current environment, and thrive across the cycle. We've held our production costs flat year-over-year in potash despite a 16% reduction in our operating rate. This represents good cost management as well as some currency benefits. I want to point out our brine inflow cost, while somewhat dependent on Mother Nature, these are down by $70 million to $90 million from the peak, largely due to good cost control, good technology application, and some currency benefits. In phosphates, we've driven our conversion costs lower despite a significant lower operating rate. And we've held the cash costs of our mining operations flat over several years. We attribute both of those to good cost management. We've reduced our annual capital spending expectations this year by $200 million, plus deferred almost $100 million in spending for Ma'aden. Our SG&A costs are down 10% year-over-year as lower incentives are driven by our performance, and our performance reflect the challenging market environment. And we've lowered our full year SG&A guidance. This clearly demonstrates the benefits of our work to continue to be the low-cost producer in potash and phosphates. So with that, I want to conclude our call by reiterating our key messages. We have the operating flexibility and balance sheet. We need to weather the current market environment. We fully expect the markets to improve in the second half of this year, and we understand, and are prepared for the cyclical nature of this business. The long-term remains very promising, and we manage this company for long-term success. Thank you for joining the call. Have a great day. Thank you."

The drivers and the downturn range from a collap",969,"Thanks, Joc. Let me start by acknowledging the obvious. Industry phosphate and potash margins have declined significantly as evidenced in our earnings so far this year as well as our third quarter guidance. The drivers and the downturn range from a collapse of key phosphate and potash currencies to the deferral of demand this year to elevate the channel inventories, to the start-up or even the expectation of the start up of new capacity. 
Buyer sentiment remains cautious for several reasons, such as volatile crop prices and exchange rate on uncertainties. But we do think the global supply and demand balance is not as far out of kilter as current prices indicate. More importantly, low prices are causing material adjustments on both the supply and demand side of the ledger. High cost production is moving off-line and demand is accelerating, especially in key growth markets.
On the demand side, prospects remain solid. In fact, we have not changed our P&K shipment guidance for 2016.  We still Project that global phosphate shipments will total 65 million to 66 million tonnes this year and global MOP shipments will total 59 million to 60 million tonnes despite the long delays in settling contracts with Chinese and Indian buyers. 
Furthermore, we see a high likelihood of seasonal bunching of demand for both P&K in the second half of the year. Our first look at 2017 indicates that phosphate shipments are forecast decline to 66 million to 68 million tonnes and global MOP shipments are projected to increase to 61 million to 63 million tonnes next year. 
Several economic and agronomic factors underpin this constructive outlook. First, plant nutrients remain affordable despite lower and volatile crop prices. In fact, our affordability metric at the end of July indicated that plant nutrients were 21% more affordable than the average since 2010. It's worth noting that our affordability metric is calculated using only corn, soybean and wheat prices and crop prices are that moving in lockstep. Corn, soybean and wheat prices have fallen, while either prices including sugar, cotton and coffee have increased significantly this year.
Second, shipment prospects are bolstered by the pull down of channel inventory so far this year, especially throughout the Americas. Our sales team tells us that channel inventories side are thin, heading into what is expected to be another very good fall application season in North America. 
In Brazil, the most recent statistics show that phosphate and potash inventories throughout the distribution channel shrunk nearly 600,000 tonnes and almost 200,000 tonnes, respectively, during the first half of this year. 
Third, Brazilian demand forecast just keep getting revised higher and higher despite the chaotic political backdrop, a volatile exchange rate and tight farm credit. That is not a surprise, given record high local currency prices for soybeans, corn, sugar, cotton and coffee. Based on record first half shipments, our team now projects that total fertilizer shipments will top 32 million tonnes this year, up 10% from forecast just 6 months ago. Shipments this year could best the previous high mark of 32.2 million in 2014.
Fourth, demand in India looks to be back on a solid growth trajectory. The monsoon is delivering above average rainfall across nearly all of the country for the first time in 3 years. In addition, the combination of lower international prices, modest cuts in subsidies and the relatively stable  rupee has resulted in declines in retail debt and MOP prices of roughly 15% and 30%, respectively, and sets the stage for strong P&K use. 
Demand prospects in other Latin American and Asian countries, such as Argentina and Pakistan, remained positive. Furthermore, significant demand is emerging from other regions, such as the former Soviet Union and Africa that are not necessarily on most radar screens. On the supply-side of the ledger, several adjustments have occurred and more are under way today. In the case of phosphate, China has shattered capacity as evidenced by the 1.5 million tonne decline in debt, MOP, and TSP exports during the first half of this year. Restructuring of China's large phosphate sector is beginning to take place, and plans outlined at the national Phosphate and Compound Fertilizer Industry Association's Annual Conference in May call for the permanent closure of outdated facilities with capacity of 3 million tonnes of P205  or the equivalent of 6.5 million  tonnes of DAP by the end of this decade.
In the case of potash, large producers continue to optimize operations by idling or shutting the higher cost facilities and maximizing operating rates at lower cost facilities in order to complete with produces who have benefited from a collapse of their currencies. For example, all of the North American facilities that were at the right end of every estimate of the industry cost curve had closed. The closure of 6 North American mines has resulted in a net loss of 2.25 million tonnes of capacity.
Finally, foreign exchange tailwinds are beginning to diminish for some producers. Currencies like the ruble are recovering along with the price of oil. Inflation, as expected, is picking up in this countries and most importantly, P&K prices have come down significantly. 
In our view, the large drop in potash prices is more the result of the collapse of key potash currencies rather than a surge of new capacity. This is an important part of our thesis that fundamentals are in better balance than current P&K prices would indicate. 
In summary, adjustments are taking place in response to low prices and margins. Demand is beginning to accelerate and high costs capacity are shutting them. As a result, we project relatively stable global phosphate and potash operating rates through the rest of this decade. While we're not widely bullish, we see some positive developments that market seem to be ignoring or discounting for now. Joc?"

Clearly, the current environment is very challenging even with a strong global demand Mike describe. While this weak part of the cycle's been more pronounced than we anticipated, we do understand commodity businesses are cyclical and that the trough can be difficult. We also understand the imperative to navigate the trough for enhancing our ability to outperform in better times. We are taking the necessary actions to do just that. We're conserving cash and protecting our balance sheet, so that we can continue to meet our customer's needs and seek opportunities to drive future shareholder value. 
We've taken a number of steps to reduce costs. First, we're well on our way to achieving the 5-year $500 million expense reduction goal we established almost 3 years ago. The cuts have been implemented across the business. 
Second, on our last earnings call, we told you that we are targeting an additional $75 million in savings in our support functions. With the actions we took in June, we are well on our way to achieving that goal.
Third, we are continuing to optimize our assets so that we can produce enough crop nutrients to meet our customers' demand, while reducing our cost per tonne.
With the decision to idle our potash mine for the remainder of 2016, we will be able to meet market demands with our lower cost bill play in mines as well as our existing potash inventory.
And fourth, we're managing our capital carefully with without starving our operations or risking employees' safety. We are differing or permanently eliminating capital spending when and where we can. All of these decisions have reduced our cost. Our MOP cash production cost per tonne came in this quarter at $98 per tonne, which included $21 per tonne of brine management cost. For the first half of 2016, our MOP cash cost came in at $93 per tonne, which is $74 of direct production costs and $19 per tonne of brand management cost. This was comparable to last year despite a much lower operating rate. It is important to highlight that every big producer has its own cost curve mine by mine, and you can see ours on the slide.
When we run our Esterhazy and Belle Plaine mines at optimal rates as we intend to do in the second half of 2016 with down, we can achieve significantly lower cost. Esterhazy is capable of achieving direct production cash cost per tonne close to $50 when we eliminate management cost in the mid-2020s, and Belle Plaine can produce at approximately $70 per tonne.
As a reminder, we look at our cost excluding Brian expenses because Brian management is largely a fixed cost. As you know, we have a plan to eliminate Brian expenses over time. Our costs are also well controlled in phosphate even with lower operating rates. 
So we are making good progress, but we're not conserving cash just to weather the market storm. We are mindful that opportunities arise at the low points of the cycle and especially when the low point last longer than usual. Of course, we will maintain our strategic discipline as we consider potential opportunities. 
In total, yes, the business environment is challenging, but we believe in the bright future of this industry and of Mosaic. We are managing aggressively to ensure the company's competitiveness for now and for better markets. It is in times like this that management can make a real difference. 
Now before we take your questions, I'll ask Rich Mack to provide a bit more detail on the quarter as well as our guidance."

No doubt, our markets are challenging right now with prices failing to rise even with strong global demand. That said, though, we do expect conditions to improve in the second half of the year. 
Mosaic has the ability to withstand challenging conditions longer if necessary and to thrive as market prices improve. As a reminder, Mosaic has a $2.5 billion liquidity buffer, which remains untapped so we continue to have ample financial flexibility even during this down part of the  cycle. 
The notable items this quarter, which netted out to a negative $37 million or $0.09 a share, included $69 million in after-tax charges that reflect our deliberate focus on reducing spend and preserving cash. We recorded charges for severance, the write-down of the initial construction of a second ammonia barge and for our share of the decision not to pursue Encanto Canpotex port project at Prince Rupert. 
Now I'd like to provide a brief review of our results and our expectations for each segment.
In potash, our sales volumes for the second quarter were within our guidance range, which anticipated a lack of shipments to India and China. Prices fell further during the quarter with Mosaic recording an average realized price of $178 per tonne. With uncertainty in China and India now resolved, we expect that the pricing floor is now established with the third quarter potash prices to be in the range of $160 to $175 per tonne, which reflects a heavier mix of lower-priced exports sales.
As Joc noted, the shutdown will be to a lower operating of around 65%. Not withstanding , however, we're maintaining our annual sales guidance of 7.5 million to 8.0 million  tonnes of potash.
In the second quarter, our potash gross margin rate was 12% and 20% excluding Canadian resource taxes. As you know, we have been relentlessly focused on costs, which has helped us maintain reasonable margins during the downturn. 
In the third quarter, we expect gross margin rate to decline as a result of lower prices and the impact of a lower operating rate.
In phosphate, second quarter sales volumes were well within our guidance ranges as global demand remains strong. Our average realized price came in at the low end of our guidance range, while raw material costs also declined. The result was a gross margin rate of 10%, which was in line with our expectations.
We expect the gross margin rate in phosphates to stay around 10% with additional benefit from lower sulfur and ammonia costs, offsetting expected lower realized prices and higher phosphate rock costs. We plan to run our phosphate facilities at a relatively high operating rate in order to meet North American fall demand. Our guidance for third quarter phosphate sales is 2.4 million to 2.7 million tonnes. 
In the International Distribution segment, as Mike noted, demand is strong in Brazil and India, and the agricultural situation in both of these key regions remains promising. Our margins in International Distribution continue to be muted by lower fertilizer prices. For the third quarter, we expect International Distribution sales to be in a range of 2.1 million to 2.4 million tonnes and a sequential improvement in profitability, with the gross margin dollars per tonne in the $15 to $20 range, which assumes a stable real.
We have lowered again our full year SG&A guidance to be in the range of $330 million to $350 million, down from the initial guidance of $350 million to $370 million. Just as a reminder, SG&A at Mosaic was $394 million in 2013, prior to the CF and EDM acquisitions.
We have also lowered our capital expenditures by an additional $50 million this quarter to a range of $750 million to $850 million, which is in addition to our investment in the joint venture, which was $220 million in 2016.
The cost of the lower expected earnings, we are revising our effective tax rate guidance to be around 10% for 2016. We have also lowered our expected full year brine management costs from $150 million to $170 million compared to our prior estimate of $160 million to $180 million.
Finally, we expect Canadian resource taxes to range from $95 million to $110 million in 2016. 
To summarize, we continue to benefit from our strong financial foundation, and we are pulling the necessary levers to ensure that we can compete across the cycle. We now have the long desired clarity on China and India potash needs and, along with strong global demand and supply adjustments, we believe potash prices have bottomed and we see potential for modest price increases in the second half of the year. 
In what we believe will be an improving environment, we will continue to assess the market and our respective balance sheet in capital management positions, and we will adapt come as necessary as the business environment evolves. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Joc to moderate our Q&A session."

Any of those type cost, yes, we will consider, but we are being very cognizant that we want to maintain the critical path of the K3 project. So on that basis, we're taking out cost we believe we can defer, but making sure we're not compromising the integrity of our business."

And let me take them one at a time, and I'll probably hand the India second quarter over to Rick and Mike. But let me talk on rock cost. Clearly, on the long term, we've been able to manage our rock costs extremely well in our Phosphate business. What's happening today is we've run into some what I would call short-term geology changes that have meant that the great or the amount of 4 that will be able to pull per tonne of mining is decreased at our Four Corners mine as 1 portion of the mine. We're talking about a decade-long reserves, and sometimes all those are variable. Sometimes we hit areas where the rock qualities much higher than we expect and other times we have rock quality that's maybe lower than what we expect. We do expect them to be transitory and in the long term, we hold it with our expectations of superior rock cost. In terms of the ammonia barge, we -- yes, we certainly can move volumes with the 1 ammonia barge. We have a little less buffer, I guess, would be the way I would put it. And maybe 5 or 6 years from now when we have to have some statue statutory shutdowns of those barges for repairs, there may be short periods of time where we have to come up with different plans. But overall, we believe we've managed the risk very well while still conserving as much cash as we can. Now in terms of the India second half, I'm just going to hand the straight over to Mike and let him talk about that."

Why don't I give you some numbers, and Rick, you can provide some color commentary here. Yes. In general, the outlook in India remains very positive. As you know, the monsoon is delivering above average rainfall. Retail prices or DAPR are up about 15%. The rupee has been very stable compared to other currencies and finally, imported margins, given all those parameters, are profitable. So all the stars and moons are lined up to make important economics work. We're projecting about 5.6 million tons of imports this calendar year in India. First half of the year, they imported 1.8. That would leave about 3.8 million tonnes second half of the year that we think they need to import into the country. And so that's a big number. It's 500,000 tonnes more than what they did last year, which was a very good second half for them. And on the comments here, we mentioned the bunching of demand in the second half of the year. I guess, when you put the 3.8 million  tons that India has to import alongside the 2.9 million tonnes we think Brazil needs to import plus the prospects were good North American season, we do believe that there will be some pretty strong seasonal posts on shipments second half of the year."

So with the shutdown of and less production there, more production coming out of Esterhazy and in particular leads to a slightly higher Canadian resource taxes this quarter, which I would expect to fall back to what I'll call more normal levels in the Q3 and Q4.

And frankly, I think, there's something going on there in terms of potash consumption. I think all the numbers would suggest that maybe potash consumption is a little bit better than anyone is giving China credit for. Just to review some of the numbers, China are importer of record 9.4 million tonnes last year. We think they produced about 6.6 million tonnes and shipments probably in that 16 million tonnes range, so there's a little bit of an inventory build last year. We think that's getting pulled down. Our shipment number this year is 12.9 million tonnes. With think that will increase to 13.9 million tonnes next year. So imports, we think imports this year probably will be in that 8 million tonnes range, so down from last year and it probably stays in that range for 2017. The other factor, you mentioned Shanghai Salt Lake. Our team in Beijing believes that production has dropped this year, probably closer to 6 million to -- 6.2 million tonnes. So while there's some additional capacity coming on, I think there's been some adjustment in terms of domestic production in response to the current price environment as well. But I think the bottom line is, yes, we don't have a record shipment number factored in for China next year, and we think imports are going to be relatively stable at about 8 million tonnes."

But at this stage, we are expecting we will bring up Colonsay in January. In terms of the dividend, look, at this point, we don't plan to cut our dividend as you've said. We see the fundamentals improving in the second half of the year, which mitigates the need for a dividend cut. Now if the markets don't improve or if they deteriorate, we may have to revisit the affordability of our dividend. However, just let me point out in the first half of the year, we generated sufficient cash to cover all of our commitments, including capital and our dividend. So our $1 billion of cash is still intact and our $2.5 billion liquidity buffer is still intact. So we don't see an impending need to review our dividend at this stage. We leave that open, but we may in the future. And Rich, do you just want to add anything to that?"

Having said that, fertilizers very affordable to the farmer right now. Our fertilizer-to-crop price ratio is probably as good as it's been in a long long time. But recognize that the impact, the soft crops prices are driven by higher risk. And those higher yields means higher fertilizer removed from the soil and so that in itself tends to drive higher demand. The other thing I want to highlight on that is we talk about soft crop prices, we normally are talking about corn. If corn acres goes down in the U.S., for instance, they will probably be replaced by soybean acres. And so likely for us, there won't be that big an impact. And also remember, only 30% of fertilizers are used on the corn, wheat, bean complex. The rest is crops like sugar, coffee, which are doing very well. So with that, Mike, did you want to add anything to that?"

I think one of the things, yes, we had a very good run in prices in June, and our intelligence tells us that farmers sold pretty heavily into that as well as probably forward price some of their 2016 crop. So I don't think you want us to focus too much on current spot prices. Clearly, there's a big crop that's coming in shortly and that's impacting prices now. But there's still a fair amount of uncertainty about what happens in the southern hemisphere, particularly with the expectation of the La Niña event and the negative consequence that typically has for the Southern Hemisphere harvest. So if you look at the 2017 new crop prices, they're still at levels that are that we think underpin the decent demand. And as Joc said, we're very much corn, soybean, wheat focused. And the 30% number Joc referred to is a 30% of the potash worldwide is applied to those 3 crops. The phosphates is about 40%. So the fact that you're seeing dramatic increase in sugar prices, cotton prices, coffee prices, fruits and vegetables, those are the ones that are going to I think provide a very good demand base."

890498,317250259,1021601,"The Mosaic Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","The Mosaic Company","Executives","Thanks, Joc. Let me start by acknowledging the obvious. Industry phosphate and potash margins have declined significantly as evidenced in our earnings so far this year as well as our third quarter guidance. The drivers of the downturn range from a collaps",962,"Thanks, Joc. Let me start by acknowledging the obvious. Industry phosphate and potash margins have declined significantly as evidenced in our earnings so far this year as well as our third quarter guidance. The drivers of the downturn range from a collapse of key phosphate and potash currencies to the deferral of demand this year to elevate the channel inventories, to the startup or even the expectation of the startup of new capacity. 
Buyer sentiment remains cautious for several reasons, such as volatile crop prices and exchange rate uncertainties. But we do think the global supply and demand balance is not as far out of kilter as current prices indicate. More importantly, low prices are causing material adjustments on both the supply and demand side of the ledger. High-cost production is moving off-line and demand is accelerating, especially in key growth markets.
On the demand side, prospects remain solid. In fact, we have not changed our P&K shipment guidance for 2016.  We still project that global phosphate shipments will total 65 million to 66 million tonnes this year and global MOP shipments will total 59 million to 60 million tonnes despite the long delays in settling contracts with Chinese and Indian buyers. 
Furthermore, we see a high likelihood of seasonal bunching of demand for both P&K in the second half of the year. Our first look at 2017 indicates that phosphate shipments are forecast to climb to 66 million to 68 million tonnes and global MOP shipments are projected to increase to 61 million to 63 million tonnes next year. 
Several economic and agronomic factors underpin this constructive outlook. First, plant nutrients remain affordable despite lower and volatile crop prices. In fact, our affordability metric at the end of July indicated that plant nutrients were 21% more affordable than the average since 2010. It is worth noting that our affordability metric is calculated using only corn, soybean and wheat prices, and crop prices are not moving in lockstep. Corn, soybean and wheat prices have fallen, while other prices, including sugar, cotton and coffee, have increased significantly this year.
Second, shipment prospects are bolstered by the pull down of channel inventory so far this year, especially throughout the Americas. Our sales team tells us that channel inventories are thin, heading into what is expected to be another very good fall application season in North America. 
In Brazil, the most recent statistics show that phosphate and potash inventories throughout the distribution channel shrunk nearly 600,000 tonnes and almost 200,000 tonnes, respectively, during the first half of this year. 
Third, Brazilian demand forecasts just keep getting revised higher and higher despite the chaotic political backdrop, a volatile exchange rate and tight farm credit. That is not a surprise, given record-high local currency prices for soybeans, corn, sugar, cotton and coffee. Based on record first half shipments, our team now projects that total fertilizer shipments will top 32 million tonnes this year, up 10% from forecast just 6 months ago. Shipments this year could best the previous high mark of 32.2 million in 2014.
Fourth, demand in India looks to be back on a solid growth trajectory. The monsoon is delivering above-average rainfall across nearly all of the country for the first time in 3 years. In addition, the combination of lower international prices, modest cuts in subsidies and the relatively stable  rupee has resulted in declines in retail DAP and MOP prices of roughly 15% and 30%, respectively, and sets the stage for strong P&K use.
Demand prospects in other Latin American and Asian countries, such as Argentina and Pakistan, remained positive. Furthermore, significant demand is emerging from other regions, such as the former Soviet Union and Africa that are not necessarily on most radar screens. On the supply side of the ledger, several adjustments have occurred and more are under way today. In the case of phosphate, China has shuttered capacity, as evidenced by the 1.5 million-tonne decline in DAP, MOP and TSP exports during the first half of this year. Restructuring of China's large phosphate sector is beginning to take place, and plans outlined at the National Phosphate and Compound Fertilizer Industry Association's annual conference in May called for the permanent closure of outdated facilities with capacity of 3 million tonnes of P205  or the equivalent of 6.5 million  tonnes of DAP by the end of this decade.
In the case of potash, large producers continue to optimize operations by idling or shutting down higher-cost facilities and maximizing operating rates at lower-cost facilities in order to compete with produces who have benefited from the collapse of their currencies. For example, all of the North American facilities that were at the right end of every estimate of the industry cost curve have closed. The closure of 6 North American mines has resulted in a net loss of 2.25 million tonnes of capacity.
Finally, foreign exchange tailwinds are beginning to diminish for some producers. Currencies like the ruble are recovering along with the price of oil. Inflation, as expected, is picking up in these countries, and most importantly, P&K prices have come down significantly. 
In our view, the large drop in potash prices is more the result of the collapse of key potash currencies rather than a surge of new capacity. This is an important part of our thesis that fundamentals are in better balance than current P&K prices would indicate. 
In summary, adjustments are taking place in response to low prices and margins. Demand is beginning to accelerate and high-cost capacity is shutting them. As a result, we project relatively stable global phosphate and potash operating rates through the rest of this decade. While we're not widely bullish, we see some positive developments that market seem to be ignoring or discounting for now. Joc?"
890498,317250259,1021601,"The Mosaic Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","The Mosaic Company","Executives","Thanks for that insight, Mike.

Clearly, the current environment is very challenging even with the strong global demand Mike described. While this weak part of the cycle has been more pronounced than we anticipated, we do understand commodity businesses are cyclical and that the trough can be difficult. We also understand the imperative to navigate the troughs while enhancing our ability to outperform in better times. We are taking the necessary actions to do just that. We're conserving cash and protecting our balance sheet so that we can continue to meet our customers' needs and seek opportunities to drive future shareholder value. 
We've taken a number of steps to reduce costs. First, we're well on our way to achieving the 5-year $500 million expense reduction goal we established almost 3 years ago. The cuts have been implemented across the business. 
Second, on our last earnings call, we told you that we are targeting an additional $75 million in savings in our support functions. With the actions we took in June, we are well on our way to achieving that goal.
Third, we're continuing to optimize our assets so that we can produce enough crop nutrients to meet our customers' demand, while reducing our cost per tonne.
With the decision to idle our Colonsay potash mine for the remainder of 2016, we will be able to meet market demands with our lower-cost Bell Plaine and Esterhazy mines as well as our existing potash inventory.
And fourth, we're managing our capital carefully without starving our operations or risking employees' safety. We are deferring or permanently eliminating capital spending when and where we can. All of these decisions have reduced our cost. Our MOP cash production cost per tonne came in this quarter at $98 per tonne, which included $21 per tonne of brine management cost. For the first half of 2016, our MOP cash cost came in at $93 per tonne, which is $74 of direct production costs and $19 per tonne of brine management cost. This was comparable to last year despite a much lower operating rate. It is important to highlight that every big producer has its own cost curve, mine by mine, and you can see ours on the slide.
When we run our Esterhazy and Belle Plaine mines at optimal rates, as we intend to do in the second half of 2016, with Colonsay down, we can achieve significantly lower cost. Esterhazy is capable of achieving direct production cash cost per tonne close to $50 when we eliminate brine management cost in the mid-2020s, and Belle Plaine can produce at approximately $70 per tonne.
As a reminder, we look at our cost excluding brine expenses because brine management is largely a fixed cost. As you know, we have a plan to eliminate brine expenses over time. Our costs are also well controlled in phosphate even with lower operating rates. 
So we are making good progress, but we're not conserving cash just to weather the market storm. We are mindful that opportunities arise at the low points of the cycle and especially when the low point lasts longer than usual. Of course, we will maintain our strategic discipline as we consider potential opportunities. 
In total, yes, the business environment is challenging, but we believe in the bright future of this industry and of Mosaic. We are managing aggressively to ensure the company's competitiveness for now and for better markets. It is in times like this that management can make a real difference. 
Now before we take your questions, I'll ask Rich Mack to provide a bit more detail on the quarter as well as our guidance."

No doubt, our markets are challenging right now, with prices failing to rise even with strong global demand. That said, though, we do expect conditions to improve in the second half of the year.
Mosaic has the ability to withstand challenging conditions longer if necessary and to thrive as market prices improve. As a reminder, Mosaic has a $2.5 billion liquidity buffer, which remains untapped, so we continue to have ample financial flexibility even during this down part of the  cycle. 
The notable items this quarter, which netted out to a negative $37 million or $0.09 a share, included $69 million in after-tax charges that reflect our deliberate focus on reducing spend and preserving cash. We recorded charges for severance, the write-down of the initial construction of a second ammonia barge and for our share of the decision not to pursue a Canpotex port project at Prince Rupert. 
Now I'd like to provide a brief review of our results and our expectations for each segment.
In potash, our sales volumes for the second quarter were within our guidance range, which anticipated a lack of shipments to India and China. Prices fell further during the quarter, with Mosaic recording an average realized price of $178 per tonne. With the uncertainty in China and India now resolved, we expect that the pricing floor is now established, with the third quarter potash prices to be in the range of $160 to $175 per tonne, which reflects a heavier mix of lower-priced exports sales.
As Joc noted, the Colonsay shutdown will be to a lower operating rate of around 65%. Notwithstanding Colonsay, however, we are maintaining our annual sales guidance of 7.5 million to 8.0 million  tonnes of potash.
In the second quarter, our potash gross margin rate was 12% and 20% excluding Canadian resource taxes. As you know, we have been relentlessly focused on costs, which has helped us maintain reasonable margins during the downturn. 
In the third quarter, we expect gross margin rate to decline as a result of lower prices and the impact of a lower operating rate.
In phosphates, second quarter sales volumes were well within our guidance ranges as global demand remains strong. Our average realized price came in at the low end of our guidance range, while raw material costs also declined. The result was a gross margin rate of 10%, which was in line with our expectations.
We expect the gross margin rate in phosphates to stay around 10% in the third quarter, with additional benefit from lower sulfur and ammonia costs, offsetting expected lower realized prices and higher phosphate rock costs. We plan to run our phosphate facilities at a relatively high operating rate in order to meet North American fall demand. Our guidance for third quarter phosphate sales is 2.4 million to 2.7 million tonnes.
In the International Distribution segment, as Mike noted, demand is strong in Brazil and India, and the agricultural situation in both of these key regions remains promising. Our margins in International Distribution continued to be muted by lower fertilizer prices. For the third quarter, we expect International Distribution sales to be in a range of 2.1 million to 2.4 million tonnes and a sequential improvement in profitability, with the gross margin dollars per tonne in the $15 to $20 range, which assumes a stable real.
We have lowered again our full year SG&A guidance to be in the range of $330 million to $350 million, down from the initial guidance of $350 million to $370 million. Just as a reminder, SG&A at Mosaic was $394 million in 2013, prior to the CF and EDM acquisitions.
We have also lowered our capital expenditures by an additional $50 million this quarter to a range of $750 million to $850 million, which is in addition to our investment in the Ma'aden joint venture, which was $220 million in 2016.
Because of the lower expected earnings, we are revising our effective tax rate guidance to be around 10% for 2016. We have also lowered our expected full year brine management cost from $150 million to $170 million compared to our prior estimate of $160 million to $180 million.
Finally, we expect Canadian resource taxes to range from $95 million to $110 million in 2016. 
To summarize, we continue to benefit from our strong financial foundation, and we are pulling the necessary levers to ensure that we can compete across the cycle. We now have the long-desired clarity on China and India potash needs and, along with strong global demand and supply adjustments, we believe potash prices have bottomed and we see potential for modest price increases in the second half of the year. 
In what we believe will be an improving environment, we will continue to assess the market and our respective balance sheet and capital management positions, and we will adapt as necessary as the business environment evolves. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Joc to moderate our Q&A session."

And let me take them one at a time, and I'll probably hand the India second quarter over to Rick and Mike. But let me talk on rock costs. Clearly, on the long term, we've been able to manage our rock costs extremely well in our phosphate business. What's happening today is we've run into some, what I would call, short-term geology changes that have meant that the grade or the amount of ore that we're able to pull per tonne of mining is decreased at our Four Corners mine, it's one portion of the mine. We're talking about a decade-long reserves, and sometimes, those are variable. Sometimes, we hit areas where the rock quality is much higher than we expect and other times, we hit rock quality that's maybe lower than what we expect. We do expect it to be transitory and on the long term, we hold with our expectations of superior rock costs. In terms of the ammonia barge, we -- yes, we certainly can move full volumes with the one ammonia barge. We have a little less buffer, I guess, would be the way I would put it. And maybe 5 or 6 years from now, when we have to have some statue statutory shutdowns of those barges for repairs, there may be short periods of time when we'll have to come up with different plans. But overall, we believe we've managed the risk very well while still conserving as much cash as we can.

Yes, in general, the outlook in India remains very positive. As you know, the monsoon is delivering above-average rainfall. Retail prices for DAP are off about 15%. The rupee has been very stable compared to other currencies and finally, imported margins, given all those parameters, are profitable. So all the stars and moons are lined up to make import economics work. We're projecting about 5.6 million tonnes of imports this calendar year in India. First half of the year, they imported 1.8 million . That would leave about 3.8 million tonnes second half of the year that we think they need to import into the country. And so that's a big number. It's 500,000 tonnes more than what they did last year, which was a very good second half for them. And on the comments here, we've mentioned the bunching of demand in the second half of the year. I guess, when you put the 3.8 million tonnes that India has to import alongside the 2.9 million tonnes we think Brazil needs to import, plus the prospects for a good North American season, we do believe that there will be some pretty strong seasonal pulls on shipments second half of the year."

The -- There's an elimination of profit in inventory in the corporate segment that really relates to the buildup of inventory in Brazil in anticipation of a large season coming up there. And then with respect to the Canadian resource taxes, the increase this quarter was generally related to a catch-up accrual of about $10 million. And also, you have to take into account where the production is occurring and what the profitability is on a mine-by-mine basis. And so with the shutdown of Colonsay and less production there, more production coming out of Esterhazy and Bell Plaine, in particular, leads to a slightly higher Canadian resource taxes this quarter, which I would expect to fall back to what I'll call more normal levels in the Q3 and Q4. And just as a reminder, this year, or year-to-date, Canadian resource taxes are just slightly more than, I'll say, $50 million compared to last year, where they were about $130 million to $140 million."

A good indicator of South American demand is the fact that our distribution business took $300 million in prepayments from customers for all fertilizer products, which means that farmers there, it underpins the 32 million-tonne overall demand forecast that we've talked about for Brazil. So as we go through the quarter, and through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter, we see margins improving as we -- as demand starts to bunch up in all of those markets, India, Brazil, Argentina and North America."

Barge prices have increased, C&F price in Brazil has moved up here recently, and we know that raw material prices for sulfur in the third quarter have come down $5. Ammonia price is at $270 for August and we don't see much of a threat in terms of any uptick in those and potentially, more downside as well.

We think 2016 will end the year with a million tonnes and probably another reduction in 2017, largely because of the big price discount in North America that's just not as attractive to move tonnes into North America now.

And frankly, I think, there's something going on there in terms of potash consumption. I think all the numbers would suggest that maybe potash consumption is a little bit better than everyone is giving China credit for. Just to review some of the numbers, China, our importer of record, 9.4 million tonnes last year. We think they produced about 6.6 million tonnes and shipments, probably in that 16 million tonnes range, so a little bit of an inventory build last year. We think that's getting pulled down. Our shipment number this year is 12.9 million tonnes. We think it'll increase to 13.9 million tonnes next year. So imports, we think imports this year, probably, will be in that 8 million tonne range, so down from last year and it probably stays in that range in 2017. The other factor, you mentioned Qinghai Salt Lake. Our team in Beijing believes that production has dropped this year, probably closer to 6 million to  6.2 million tonnes. So while there's some additional capacity coming on, I think there's been some adjustment in terms of domestic production in response to the current price environment as well. But I think the bottom line is, yes, we don't have a record shipment number factored in for China next year, and we think imports are going to be relatively stable at about 8 million tonnes."

In terms of the capital requirements left for K3, we are largely finished the shaft sinking on K3. Our incremental costs, going forward, not including what the save in taxes because of the write-downs of capital, would be in the range of $600 million, and those are for mine development infrastructure and conveyor ways between K3, K1 and K2.

Having said that, fertilizer is very affordable to the farmer right now. Our fertilizer-to-crop price ratio is probably as good as it's been in a long, long time. But recognize that the impact, the soft crops prices are driven by higher yields. And those higher yields means higher fertilizer removed from the soil, and so that in itself tends to drive higher demand. The other thing I want to highlight on that is we talk about soft crop prices, we normally are talking about corn. If corn acres goes down in the U.S., for instance, they'll probably be replaced by soybean acres. And so likely, for us, there won't be that big an impact. And also, remember, only 30% of fertilizers are used on the corn, wheat, bean complex. The rest is crops like sugar, coffee, which are doing very well. So with that, Mike, did you want to add anything to that?"

I think one of the things, yes, we had a very good run in prices in June, and our intelligence tells us that farmers sold pretty heavily into that as well as probably forward priced some of their 2016 crop. So I don't think you want us focused too much on current spot prices. Clearly, there's a big crop that's coming in shortly, and that's impacting prices now. But there's still a fair amount of uncertainty about what happens in the southern hemisphere, particularly with the expectation of a La Niña event and the negative consequence that typically has for the Southern Hemisphere harvest. So if you look at the 2017 new crop prices, they're still at levels that are -- that we think underpin decent demand. And as Joc said, we're very much corn, soybean, wheat focused. And the 30% number Joc referred to is that 30% of the potash worldwide is applied to those 3 crops, where phosphates is about 40%. So the fact that you're seeing dramatic increase in sugar prices, cotton prices, coffee prices, fruits and vegetables, those are the ones that are going to, I think, provide a very good demand base."

890498,317250259,1022004,"The Mosaic Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","The Mosaic Company","Executives","Thanks, Joc. Let me start by acknowledging the obvious. Industry phosphate and potash margins have declined significantly as evidenced in our earnings so far this year as well as our third quarter guidance. The drivers of the downturn range from a collaps",962,"Thanks, Joc. Let me start by acknowledging the obvious. Industry phosphate and potash margins have declined significantly as evidenced in our earnings so far this year as well as our third quarter guidance. The drivers of the downturn range from a collapse of key phosphate and potash currencies to the deferral of demand this year to elevate the channel inventories, to the startup or even the expectation of the startup of new capacity. 
Buyer sentiment remains cautious for several reasons, such as volatile crop prices and exchange rate uncertainties. But we do think the global supply and demand balance is not as far out of kilter as current prices indicate. More importantly, low prices are causing material adjustments on both the supply and demand side of the ledger. High-cost production is moving off-line and demand is accelerating, especially in key growth markets.
On the demand side, prospects remain solid. In fact, we have not changed our P&K shipment guidance for 2016.  We still project that global phosphate shipments will total 65 million to 66 million tonnes this year and global MOP shipments will total 59 million to 60 million tonnes despite the long delays in settling contracts with Chinese and Indian buyers. 
Furthermore, we see a high likelihood of seasonal bunching of demand for both P&K in the second half of the year. Our first look at 2017 indicates that phosphate shipments are forecast to climb to 66 million to 68 million tonnes and global MOP shipments are projected to increase to 61 million to 63 million tonnes next year. 
Several economic and agronomic factors underpin this constructive outlook. First, plant nutrients remain affordable despite lower and volatile crop prices. In fact, our affordability metric at the end of July indicated that plant nutrients were 21% more affordable than the average since 2010. It is worth noting that our affordability metric is calculated using only corn, soybean and wheat prices, and crop prices are not moving in lockstep. Corn, soybean and wheat prices have fallen, while other prices, including sugar, cotton and coffee, have increased significantly this year.
Second, shipment prospects are bolstered by the pull down of channel inventory so far this year, especially throughout the Americas. Our sales team tells us that channel inventories are thin, heading into what is expected to be another very good fall application season in North America. 
In Brazil, the most recent statistics show that phosphate and potash inventories throughout the distribution channel shrunk nearly 600,000 tonnes and almost 200,000 tonnes, respectively, during the first half of this year. 
Third, Brazilian demand forecasts just keep getting revised higher and higher despite the chaotic political backdrop, a volatile exchange rate and tight farm credit. That is not a surprise, given record-high local currency prices for soybeans, corn, sugar, cotton and coffee. Based on record first half shipments, our team now projects that total fertilizer shipments will top 32 million tonnes this year, up 10% from forecast just 6 months ago. Shipments this year could best the previous high mark of 32.2 million in 2014.
Fourth, demand in India looks to be back on a solid growth trajectory. The monsoon is delivering above-average rainfall across nearly all of the country for the first time in 3 years. In addition, the combination of lower international prices, modest cuts in subsidies and the relatively stable  rupee has resulted in declines in retail DAP and MOP prices of roughly 15% and 30%, respectively, and sets the stage for strong P&K use.
Demand prospects in other Latin American and Asian countries, such as Argentina and Pakistan, remained positive. Furthermore, significant demand is emerging from other regions, such as the former Soviet Union and Africa that are not necessarily on most radar screens. On the supply side of the ledger, several adjustments have occurred and more are under way today. In the case of phosphate, China has shuttered capacity, as evidenced by the 1.5 million-tonne decline in DAP, MAP and TSP exports during the first half of this year. Restructuring of China's large phosphate sector is beginning to take place, and plans outlined at the National Phosphate and Compound Fertilizer Industry Association's annual conference in May called for the permanent closure of outdated facilities with capacity of 3 million tonnes of P205  or the equivalent of 6.5 million  tonnes of DAP by the end of this decade.
In the case of potash, large producers continue to optimize operations by idling or shutting down higher-cost facilities and maximizing operating rates at lower-cost facilities in order to compete with produces who have benefited from the collapse of their currencies. For example, all of the North American facilities that were at the right end of every estimate of the industry cost curve have closed. The closure of 6 North American mines has resulted in a net loss of 2.25 million tonnes of capacity.
Finally, foreign exchange tailwinds are beginning to diminish for some producers. Currencies like the ruble are recovering along with the price of oil. Inflation, as expected, is picking up in these countries, and most importantly, P&K prices have come down significantly. 
In our view, the large drop in potash prices is more the result of the collapse of key potash currencies rather than a surge of new capacity. This is an important part of our thesis that fundamentals are in better balance than current P&K prices would indicate. 
In summary, adjustments are taking place in response to low prices and margins. Demand is beginning to accelerate and high-cost capacity is shutting down. As a result, we project relatively stable global phosphate and potash operating rates through the rest of this decade. While we're not widely bullish, we see some positive developments that market seem to be ignoring or discounting for now. Joc?"
890498,317250259,1022004,"The Mosaic Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","The Mosaic Company","Executives","Thanks for that insight, Mike.

Clearly, the current environment is very challenging even with the strong global demand Mike described. While this weak part of the cycle has been more pronounced than we anticipated, we do understand commodity businesses are cyclical and that the trough can be difficult. We also understand the imperative to navigate the troughs while enhancing our ability to outperform in better times. We are taking the necessary actions to do just that. We're conserving cash and protecting our balance sheet so that we can continue to meet our customers' needs and seek opportunities to drive future shareholder value. 
We've taken a number of steps to reduce costs. First, we're well on our way to achieving the 5-year $500 million expense reduction goal we established almost 3 years ago. The cuts have been implemented across the business. 
Second, on our last earnings call, we told you that we are targeting an additional $75 million in savings in our support functions. With the actions we took in June, we are well on our way to achieving that goal.
Third, we're continuing to optimize our assets so that we can produce enough crop nutrients to meet our customers' demand, while reducing our cost per tonne.
With the decision to idle our Colonsay potash mine for the remainder of 2016, we will be able to meet market demands with our lower-cost Bell Plaine and Esterhazy mines as well as our existing potash inventory.
And fourth, we're managing our capital carefully without starving our operations or risking employees' safety. We are deferring or permanently eliminating capital spending when and where we can. All of these decisions have reduced our cost. Our MOP cash production cost per tonne came in this quarter at $98 per tonne, which included $21 per tonne of brine management cost. For the first half of 2016, our MOP cash cost came in at $93 per tonne, which is $74 of direct production costs and $19 per tonne of brine management cost. This was comparable to last year despite a much lower operating rate. It is important to highlight that every big producer has its own cost curve, mine by mine, and you can see ours on the slide.
When we run our Esterhazy and Belle Plaine mines at optimal rates, as we intend to do in the second half of 2016, with Colonsay down, we can achieve significantly lower cost. Esterhazy is capable of achieving direct production cash cost per tonne close to $50 when we eliminate brine management cost in the mid-2020s, and Belle Plaine can produce at approximately $70 per tonne.
As a reminder, we look at our cost excluding brine expenses because brine management is largely a fixed cost. As you know, we have a plan to eliminate brine expenses over time. Our costs are also well controlled in phosphate even with lower operating rates. 
So we are making good progress, but we're not conserving cash just to weather the market storm. We are mindful that opportunities arise at the low points of the cycle and especially when the low point lasts longer than usual. Of course, we will maintain our strategic discipline as we consider potential opportunities. 
In total, yes, the business environment is challenging, but we believe in the bright future of this industry and of Mosaic. We are managing aggressively to ensure the company's competitiveness for now and for better markets. It is in times like this that management can make a real difference. 
Now before we take your questions, I'll ask Rich Mack to provide a bit more detail on the quarter as well as our guidance."

No doubt, our markets are challenging right now, with prices failing to rise even with strong global demand. That said, though, we do expect conditions to improve in the second half of the year.
Mosaic has the ability to withstand challenging conditions longer if necessary and to thrive as market prices improve. As a reminder, Mosaic has a $2.5 billion liquidity buffer, which remains untapped, so we continue to have ample financial flexibility even during this down part of the  cycle. 
The notable items this quarter, which netted out to a negative $37 million or $0.09 a share, included $69 million in after-tax charges that reflect our deliberate focus on reducing spend and preserving cash. We recorded charges for severance, the write-down of the initial construction of a second ammonia barge and for our share of the decision not to pursue a Canpotex port project at Prince Rupert. 
Now I'd like to provide a brief review of our results and our expectations for each segment.
In potash, our sales volumes for the second quarter were within our guidance range, which anticipated a lack of shipments to India and China. Prices fell further during the quarter, with Mosaic recording an average realized price of $178 per tonne. With the uncertainty in China and India now resolved, we expect that the pricing floor is now established, with the third quarter potash prices to be in the range of $160 to $175 per tonne, which reflects a heavier mix of lower-priced exports sales.
As Joc noted, the Colonsay shutdown will be to a lower operating rate of around 65%. Notwithstanding Colonsay, however, we are maintaining our annual sales guidance of 7.5 million to 8.0 million  tonnes of potash.
In the second quarter, our potash gross margin rate was 12% and 20% excluding Canadian resource taxes. As you know, we have been relentlessly focused on costs, which has helped us maintain reasonable margins during the downturn. 
In the third quarter, we expect gross margin rate to decline as a result of lower prices and the impact of a lower operating rate.
In phosphates, second quarter sales volumes were well within our guidance ranges as global demand remains strong. Our average realized price came in at the low end of our guidance range, while raw material costs also declined. The result was a gross margin rate of 10%, which was in line with our expectations.
We expect the gross margin rate in phosphates to stay around 10% in the third quarter, with additional benefit from lower sulfur and ammonia costs, offsetting expected lower realized prices and higher phosphate rock costs. We plan to run our phosphate facilities at a relatively high operating rate in order to meet North American fall demand. Our guidance for third quarter phosphate sales is 2.4 million to 2.7 million tonnes.
In the International Distribution segment, as Mike noted, demand is strong in Brazil and India, and the agricultural situation in both of these key regions remains promising. Our margins in International Distribution continued to be muted by lower fertilizer prices. For the third quarter, we expect International Distribution sales to be in a range of 2.1 million to 2.4 million tonnes and a sequential improvement in profitability, with the gross margin dollars per tonne in the $15 to $20 range, which assumes a stable real.
We have lowered again our full year SG&A guidance to be in the range of $330 million to $350 million, down from the initial guidance of $350 million to $370 million. Just as a reminder, SG&A at Mosaic was $394 million in 2013, prior to the CF and EDM acquisitions.
We have also lowered our capital expenditures by an additional $50 million this quarter to a range of $750 million to $850 million, which is in addition to our investment in the Ma'aden joint venture, which was $220 million in 2016.
Because of the lower expected earnings, we are revising our effective tax rate guidance to be around 10% for 2016. We have also lowered our expected full year brine management cost from $150 million to $170 million compared to our prior estimate of $160 million to $180 million.
Finally, we expect Canadian resource taxes to range from $95 million to $110 million in 2016. 
To summarize, we continue to benefit from our strong financial foundation, and we are pulling the necessary levers to ensure that we can compete across the cycle. We now have the long-desired clarity on China and India potash needs and, along with strong global demand and supply adjustments, we believe potash prices have bottomed and we see potential for modest price increases in the second half of the year. 
In what we believe will be an improving environment, we will continue to assess the market and our respective balance sheet and capital management positions, and we will adapt as necessary as the business environment evolves. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Joc to moderate our Q&A session."

It may incur slightly higher cost in terms of operating over a short term, but we believe that the cash conservation is valuable. In terms of K3, our thinking has been ancillary equipment, any of those type costs, yes, we will consider, but we are being very cognizant that we want to maintain the critical path of the K3 project.

And let me take them one at a time, and I'll probably hand the India second quarter over to Rick and Mike. But let me talk on rock costs. Clearly, on the long term, we've been able to manage our rock costs extremely well in our phosphate business. What's happening today is we've run into some, what I would call, short-term geology changes that have meant that the grade or the amount of ore that we're able to pull per tonne of mining is decreased at our Four Corners mine, it's one portion of the mine. We're talking about a decade-long reserves, and sometimes, those are variable. Sometimes, we hit areas where the rock quality is much higher than we expect and other times, we hit rock quality that's maybe lower than what we expect. We do expect it to be transitory and on the long term, we hold with our expectations of superior rock costs. In terms of the ammonia barge, we -- yes, we certainly can move full volumes with the one ammonia barge. We have a little less buffer, I guess, would be the way I would put it. And maybe 5 or 6 years from now, when we have to have some statutory shutdowns of those barges for repairs, there may be short periods of time when we'll have to come up with different plans. But overall, we believe we've managed the risk very well while still conserving as much cash as we can. Now in terms of India's second half, I'm just going to hand the straight over to Mike and let him talk about that."

Yes, in general, the outlook in India remains very positive. As you know, the monsoon is delivering above-average rainfall. Retail prices for DAP are off about 15%. The rupee has been very stable compared to other currencies and finally, imported margins, given all those parameters, are profitable. So all the stars and moons are lined up to make import economics work. We're projecting about 5.6 million tonnes of imports this calendar year in India. First half of the year, they imported 1.8 million . That would leave about 3.8 million tonnes second half of the year that we think they need to import into the country. And so that's a big number. It's 500,000 tonnes more than what they did last year, which was a very good second half for them. And on the comments here, we've mentioned the bunching of demand in the second half of the year. I guess, when you put the 3.8 million tonnes that India has to import alongside the 2.9 million tonnes we think Brazil needs to import, plus the prospects for a good North American season, we do believe that there will be some pretty strong seasonal pulls on shipments second half of the year."

And also, you have to take into account where the production is occurring and what the profitability is on a mine-by-mine basis. And so with the shutdown of Colonsay and less production there, more production coming out of Esterhazy and Bell Plaine, in particular, leads to a slightly higher Canadian resource taxes this quarter, which I would expect to fall back to what I'll call more normal levels in the Q3 and Q4.

Ammonia price is at $270 for August and we don't see much of a threat in terms of any uptick in those and potentially, more downside as well.

We think 2016 will end the year with a million tonnes and probably another reduction in 2017, largely because of the big price discount in North America that's just not as attractive to move tonnes into North America now.

And frankly, I think, there's something going on there in terms of potash consumption. I think all the numbers would suggest that maybe potash consumption is a little bit better than everyone is giving China credit for. Just to review some of the numbers, China imported a record 9.4 million tonnes last year. We think they produced about 6.6 million tonnes and shipments, probably in that 16 million tonnes range, so a little bit of an inventory build last year. We think that's getting pulled down. Our shipment number this year is 12.9 million tonnes. We think it'll increase to 13.9 million tonnes next year. So imports, we think imports this year, probably, will be in that 8 million tonne range, so down from last year and it probably stays in that range in 2017. The other factor, you mentioned Qinghai Salt Lake. Our team in Beijing believes that production has dropped this year, probably closer to 6 million to  6.2 million tonnes. So while there's some additional capacity coming on, I think there's been some adjustment in terms of domestic production in response to the current price environment as well. But I think the bottom line is, yes, we don't have a record shipment number factored in for China next year, and we think imports are going to be relatively stable at about 8 million tonnes."

Now if the markets don't improve or if they deteriorate, we may have to revisit the affordability of our dividend. However, just let me point out, in the first half of the year, we generated sufficient cash to cover all of our commitments, including capital and our dividend.

Having said that, fertilizer is very affordable to the farmer right now. Our fertilizer-to-crop price ratio is probably as good as it's been in a long, long time. But recognize that the impact, the soft crops prices are driven by higher yields. And those higher yields means higher fertilizer removed from the soil, and so that in itself tends to drive higher demand. The other thing I want to highlight on that is we talk about soft crop prices, we normally are talking about corn. If corn acres goes down in the U.S., for instance, they'll probably be replaced by soybean acres. And so likely, for us, there won't be that big an impact. And also, remember, only 30% of fertilizers are used on the corn, wheat, bean complex. The rest is crops like sugar, coffee, which are doing very well. So with that, Mike, did you want to add anything to that?"

I think that's a good question and certainly a concern that we have and monitor. I think one of the things, yes, we had a very good run in prices in June, and our intelligence tells us that farmers sold pretty heavily into that as well as probably forward priced some of their 2016 crop. So I don't think you want us focused too much on current spot prices. Clearly, there's a big crop that's coming in shortly, and that's impacting prices now. But there's still a fair amount of uncertainty about what happens in the southern hemisphere, particularly with the expectation of a La Niña event and the negative consequence that typically has for the Southern Hemisphere harvest. So if you look at the 2017 new crop prices, they're still at levels that are -- that we think underpin decent demand. And as Joc said, we're very much corn, soybean, wheat focused. And the 30% number Joc referred to is that 30% of the potash worldwide is applied to those 3 crops, where phosphates is about 40%. So the fact that you're seeing dramatic increase in sugar prices, cotton prices, coffee prices, fruits and vegetables, those are the ones that are going to, I think, provide a very good demand base."

890498,317250259,1022486,"The Mosaic Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","The Mosaic Company","Executives","Thanks, Joc. Let me start by acknowledging the obvious. Industry phosphate and potash margins have declined significantly as evidenced in our earnings so far this year as well as our third quarter guidance. The drivers of the downturn range from a collaps",962,"Thanks, Joc. Let me start by acknowledging the obvious. Industry phosphate and potash margins have declined significantly as evidenced in our earnings so far this year as well as our third quarter guidance. The drivers of the downturn range from a collapse of key phosphate and potash currencies to the deferral of demand this year to elevate the channel inventories, to the startup or even the expectation of the startup of new capacity. 
Buyer sentiment remains cautious for several reasons, such as volatile crop prices and exchange rate uncertainties. But we do think the global supply and demand balance is not as far out of kilter as current prices indicate. More importantly, low prices are causing material adjustments on both the supply and demand side of the ledger. High-cost production is moving off-line and demand is accelerating, especially in key growth markets.
On the demand side, prospects remain solid. In fact, we have not changed our P&K shipment guidance for 2016. We still project that global phosphate shipments will total 65 million to 66 million tonnes this year and global MOP shipments will total 59 million to 60 million tonnes despite the long delays in settling contracts with Chinese and Indian buyers. 
Furthermore, we see a high likelihood of seasonal bunching of demand for both P&K in the second half of the year. Our first look at 2017 indicates that phosphate shipments are forecast to climb to 66 million to 68 million tonnes and global MOP shipments are projected to increase to 61 million to 63 million tonnes next year. 
Several economic and agronomic factors underpin this constructive outlook. First, plant nutrients remain affordable despite lower and volatile crop prices. In fact, our affordability metric at the end of July indicated that plant nutrients were 21% more affordable than the average since 2010. It is worth noting that our affordability metric is calculated using only corn, soybean and wheat prices, and crop prices are not moving in lockstep. Corn, soybean and wheat prices have fallen, while other prices, including sugar, cotton and coffee, have increased significantly this year.
Second, shipment prospects are bolstered by the pull down of channel inventory so far this year, especially throughout the Americas. Our sales team tells us that channel inventories are thin, heading into what is expected to be another very good fall application season in North America. 
In Brazil, the most recent statistics show that phosphate and potash inventories throughout the distribution channel shrunk nearly 600,000 tonnes and almost 200,000 tonnes, respectively, during the first half of this year. 
Third, Brazilian demand forecasts just keep getting revised higher and higher despite the chaotic political backdrop, a volatile exchange rate and tight farm credit. That is not a surprise, given record-high local currency prices for soybeans, corn, sugar, cotton and coffee. Based on record first half shipments, our team now projects that total fertilizer shipments will top 32 million tonnes this year, up 10% from forecast just 6 months ago. Shipments this year could best the previous high mark of 32.2 million in 2014.
Fourth, demand in India looks to be back on a solid growth trajectory. The monsoon is delivering above-average rainfall across nearly all of the country for the first time in 3 years. In addition, the combination of lower international prices, modest cuts in subsidies and the relatively stable rupee has resulted in declines in retail DAP and MOP prices of roughly 15% and 30%, respectively, and sets the stage for strong P&K use.
Demand prospects in other Latin American and Asian countries, such as Argentina and Pakistan, remained positive. Furthermore, significant demand is emerging from other regions, such as the former Soviet Union and Africa that are not necessarily on most radar screens. On the supply side of the ledger, several adjustments have occurred and more are under way today. In the case of phosphate, China has shuttered capacity, as evidenced by the 1.5 million-tonne decline in DAP, MAP and TSP exports during the first half of this year. Restructuring of China's large phosphate sector is beginning to take place, and plans outlined at the National Phosphate and Compound Fertilizer Industry Association's annual conference in May called for the permanent closure of outdated facilities with capacity of 3 million tonnes of P205 or the equivalent of 6.5 million tonnes of DAP by the end of this decade.
In the case of potash, large producers continue to optimize operations by idling or shutting down higher-cost facilities and maximizing operating rates at lower-cost facilities in order to compete with produces who have benefited from the collapse of their currencies. For example, all of the North American facilities that were at the right end of every estimate of the industry cost curve have closed. The closure of 6 North American mines has resulted in a net loss of 2.25 million tonnes of capacity.
Finally, foreign exchange tailwinds are beginning to diminish for some producers. Currencies like the ruble are recovering along with the price of oil. Inflation, as expected, is picking up in these countries, and most importantly, P&K prices have come down significantly. 
In our view, the large drop in potash prices is more the result of the collapse of key potash currencies rather than a surge of new capacity. This is an important part of our thesis that fundamentals are in better balance than current P&K prices would indicate. 
In summary, adjustments are taking place in response to low prices and margins. Demand is beginning to accelerate and high-cost capacity is shutting down. As a result, we project relatively stable global phosphate and potash operating rates through the rest of this decade. While we're not widely bullish, we see some positive developments that market seem to be ignoring or discounting for now. Joc?"
890498,317250259,1022486,"The Mosaic Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","The Mosaic Company","Executives","Thanks for that insight, Mike.

Clearly, the current environment is very challenging even with the strong global demand Mike described. While this weak part of the cycle has been more pronounced than we anticipated, we do understand commodity businesses are cyclical and that the trough can be difficult. We also understand the imperative to navigate the troughs while enhancing our ability to outperform in better times. We are taking the necessary actions to do just that. We're conserving cash and protecting our balance sheet so that we can continue to meet our customers' needs and seek opportunities to drive future shareholder value. 
We've taken a number of steps to reduce costs. First, we're well on our way to achieving the 5-year $500 million expense reduction goal we established almost 3 years ago. The cuts have been implemented across the business. 
Second, on our last earnings call, we told you that we are targeting an additional $75 million in savings in our support functions. With the actions we took in June, we are well on our way to achieving that goal.
Third, we're continuing to optimize our assets so that we can produce enough crop nutrients to meet our customers' demand, while reducing our cost per tonne.
With the decision to idle our Colonsay potash mine for the remainder of 2016, we will be able to meet market demands with our lower-cost Bell Plaine and Esterhazy mines as well as our existing potash inventory.
And fourth, we're managing our capital carefully without starving our operations or risking employees' safety. We are deferring or permanently eliminating capital spending when and where we can. All of these decisions have reduced our cost. Our MOP cash production cost per tonne came in this quarter at $98 per tonne, which included $21 per tonne of brine management cost. For the first half of 2016, our MOP cash cost came in at $93 per tonne, which is $74 of direct production costs and $19 per tonne of brine management cost. This was comparable to last year despite a much lower operating rate. It is important to highlight that every big producer has its own cost curve, mine by mine, and you can see ours on the slide.
When we run our Esterhazy and Belle Plaine mines at optimal rates, as we intend to do in the second half of 2016, with Colonsay down, we can achieve significantly lower cost. Esterhazy is capable of achieving direct production cash cost per tonne close to $50 when we eliminate brine management cost in the mid-2020s, and Belle Plaine can produce at approximately $70 per tonne.
As a reminder, we look at our cost excluding brine expenses because brine management is largely a fixed cost. As you know, we have a plan to eliminate brine expenses over time. Our costs are also well controlled in phosphate even with lower operating rates. 
So we are making good progress, but we're not conserving cash just to weather the market storm. We are mindful that opportunities arise at the low points of the cycle and especially when the low point lasts longer than usual. Of course, we will maintain our strategic discipline as we consider potential opportunities. 
In total, yes, the business environment is challenging, but we believe in the bright future of this industry and of Mosaic. We are managing aggressively to ensure the company's competitiveness for now and for better markets. It is in times like this that management can make a real difference. 
Now before we take your questions, I'll ask Rich Mack to provide a bit more detail on the quarter as well as our guidance."

No doubt, our markets are challenging right now, with prices failing to rise even with strong global demand. That said, though, we do expect conditions to improve in the second half of the year.
Mosaic has the ability to withstand challenging conditions longer if necessary and to thrive as market prices improve. As a reminder, Mosaic has a $2.5 billion liquidity buffer, which remains untapped, so we continue to have ample financial flexibility even during this down part of the cycle. 
The notable items this quarter, which netted out to a negative $37 million or $0.09 a share, included $69 million in after-tax charges that reflect our deliberate focus on reducing spend and preserving cash. We recorded charges for severance, the write-down of the initial construction of a second ammonia barge and for our share of the decision not to pursue a Canpotex port project at Prince Rupert. 
Now I'd like to provide a brief review of our results and our expectations for each segment.
In potash, our sales volumes for the second quarter were within our guidance range, which anticipated a lack of shipments to India and China. Prices fell further during the quarter, with Mosaic recording an average realized price of $178 per tonne. With the uncertainty in China and India now resolved, we expect that the pricing floor is now established, with the third quarter potash prices to be in the range of $160 to $175 per tonne, which reflects a heavier mix of lower-priced exports sales.
As Joc noted, the Colonsay shutdown will be to a lower operating rate of around 65%. Notwithstanding Colonsay, however, we are maintaining our annual sales guidance of 7.5 million to 8.0 million tonnes of potash.
In the second quarter, our potash gross margin rate was 12% and 20% excluding Canadian resource taxes. As you know, we have been relentlessly focused on costs, which has helped us maintain reasonable margins during the downturn. 
In the third quarter, we expect gross margin rate to decline as a result of lower prices and the impact of a lower operating rate.
In phosphates, second quarter sales volumes were well within our guidance ranges as global demand remains strong. Our average realized price came in at the low end of our guidance range, while raw material costs also declined. The result was a gross margin rate of 10%, which was in line with our expectations.
We expect the gross margin rate in phosphates to stay around 10% in the third quarter, with additional benefit from lower sulfur and ammonia costs, offsetting expected lower realized prices and higher phosphate rock costs. We plan to run our phosphate facilities at a relatively high operating rate in order to meet North American fall demand. Our guidance for third quarter phosphate sales is 2.4 million to 2.7 million tonnes.
In the International Distribution segment, as Mike noted, demand is strong in Brazil and India, and the agricultural situation in both of these key regions remains promising. Our margins in International Distribution continued to be muted by lower fertilizer prices. For the third quarter, we expect International Distribution sales to be in a range of 2.1 million to 2.4 million tonnes and a sequential improvement in profitability, with the gross margin dollars per tonne in the $15 to $20 range, which assumes a stable real.
We have lowered again our full year SG&A guidance to be in the range of $330 million to $350 million, down from the initial guidance of $350 million to $370 million. Just as a reminder, SG&A at Mosaic was $394 million in 2013, prior to the CF and EDM acquisitions.
We have also lowered our capital expenditures by an additional $50 million this quarter to a range of $750 million to $850 million, which is in addition to our investment in the Ma'aden joint venture, which was $220 million in 2016.
Because of the lower expected earnings, we are revising our effective tax rate guidance to be around 10% for 2016. We have also lowered our expected full year brine management cost from $150 million to $170 million compared to our prior estimate of $160 million to $180 million.
Finally, we expect Canadian resource taxes to range from $95 million to $110 million in 2016. 
To summarize, we continue to benefit from our strong financial foundation, and we are pulling the necessary levers to ensure that we can compete across the cycle. We now have the long-desired clarity on China and India potash needs and, along with strong global demand and supply adjustments, we believe potash prices have bottomed and we see potential for modest price increases in the second half of the year.

Let me start by describing how we think about CapEx in general. We prioritize all of our capital based on what is most critical to maintaining our operations and, of course, what's critical to maintaining the safety of all of our employees. That, we certainly will not compromise. What we have looked at is capital that we feel we can defer with limited risk to operational continuity. It may incur slightly higher cost in terms of operating over a short term, but we believe that the cash conservation is valuable. In terms of K3, our thinking has been ancillary equipment, any of those type costs, yes, we will consider, but we are being very cognizant that we want to maintain the critical path of the K3 project. So on that basis, we're taking out cost we believe we can defer, but making sure we're not compromising the integrity of our business."

And let me take them one at a time, and I'll probably hand the India second quarter over to Rick and Mike. But let me talk on rock costs. Clearly, on the long term, we've been able to manage our rock costs extremely well in our phosphate business. What's happening today is we've run into some, what I would call, short-term geology changes that have meant that the grade or the amount of ore that we're able to pull per tonne of mining is decreased at our Four Corners mine, it's one portion of the mine. We're talking about a decade-long reserves, and sometimes, those are variable. Sometimes, we hit areas where the rock quality is much higher than we expect and other times, we hit rock quality that's maybe lower than what we expect. We do expect it to be transitory and on the long term, we hold with our expectations of superior rock costs. In terms of the ammonia barge, we -- yes, we certainly can move full volumes with the one ammonia barge. We have a little less buffer, I guess, would be the way I would put it. And maybe 5 or 6 years from now, when we have to have some statutory shutdowns of those barges for repairs, there may be short periods of time when we'll have to come up with different plans. But overall, we believe we've managed the risk very well while still conserving as much cash as we can. Now in terms of India's second half, I'm just going to hand the straight over to Mike and let him talk about that."

Yes, in general, the outlook in India remains very positive. As you know, the monsoon is delivering above-average rainfall. Retail prices for DAP are off about 15%. The rupee has been very stable compared to other currencies and finally, imported margins, given all those parameters, are profitable. So all the stars and moons are lined up to make import economics work. We're projecting about 5.6 million tonnes of imports this calendar year in India. First half of the year, they imported 1.8 million . That would leave about 3.8 million tonnes second half of the year that we think they need to import into the country. And so that's a big number. It's 500,000 tonnes more than what they did last year, which was a very good second half for them. And on the comments here, we've mentioned the bunching of demand in the second half of the year. I guess, when you put the 3.8 million tonnes that India has to import alongside the 2.9 million tonnes we think Brazil needs to import, plus the prospects for a good North American season, we do believe that there will be some pretty strong seasonal pulls on shipments second half of the year."

And then with respect to the Canadian resource taxes, the increase this quarter was generally related to a catch-up accrual of about $10 million. And also, you have to take into account where the production is occurring and what the profitability is on a mine-by-mine basis. And so with the shutdown of Colonsay and less production there, more production coming out of Esterhazy and Bell Plaine, in particular, leads to a slightly higher Canadian resource taxes this quarter, which I would expect to fall back to what I'll call more normal levels in the Q3 and Q4. And just as a reminder, this year, or year-to-date, Canadian resource taxes are just slightly more than, I'll say, $50 million compared to last year, where they were about $130 million to $140 million."

A good indicator of South American demand is the fact that our distribution business took $300 million in prepayments from customers for all fertilizer products, which means that farmers there, it underpins the 32 million-tonne overall demand forecast that we've talked about for Brazil.

So as I said, despite the political chaos, exchange rate concerns, credit concerns, they're getting fertilizer to the farm."

And frankly, I think, there's something going on there in terms of potash consumption. I think all the numbers would suggest that maybe potash consumption is a little bit better than everyone is giving China credit for. Just to review some of the numbers, China imported a record 9.4 million tonnes last year. We think they produced about 6.6 million tonnes and shipments, probably in that 16 million tonnes range, so a little bit of an inventory build last year. We think that's getting pulled down. Our shipment number this year is 12.9 million tonnes. We think it'll increase to 13.9 million tonnes next year. So imports, we think imports this year, probably, will be in that 8 million tonne range, so down from last year and it probably stays in that range in 2017. The other factor, you mentioned Qinghai Salt Lake. Our team in Beijing believes that production has dropped this year, probably closer to 6 million to 6.2 million tonnes. So while there's some additional capacity coming on, I think there's been some adjustment in terms of domestic production in response to the current price environment as well. But I think the bottom line is, yes, we don't have a record shipment number factored in for China next year, and we think imports are going to be relatively stable at about 8 million tonnes."

We see the fundamentals improving in the second half of the year, which mitigates the need for a dividend cut. Now if the markets don't improve or if they deteriorate, we may have to revisit the affordability of our dividend. However, just let me point out, in the first half of the year, we generated sufficient cash to cover all of our commitments, including capital and our dividend. So our $1 billion of cash is still intact and our $2.5 billion liquidity buffer is still intact. So we don't see an impending need to review our dividend at this stage.

But in general, I would say, if times are tougher, it would push you more towards moving from K1 and K2 to K3 earlier to reduce the brine inflow cost. But I think that decision is a ways out.

Having said that, fertilizer is very affordable to the farmer right now. Our fertilizer-to-crop price ratio is probably as good as it's been in a long, long time. But recognize that the impact, the soft crops prices are driven by higher yields. And those higher yields means higher fertilizer removed from the soil, and so that in itself tends to drive higher demand. The other thing I want to highlight on that is we talk about soft crop prices, we normally are talking about corn. If corn acres goes down in the U.S., for instance, they'll probably be replaced by soybean acres. And so likely, for us, there won't be that big an impact. And also, remember, only 30% of fertilizers are used on the corn, wheat, bean complex. The rest is crops like sugar, coffee, which are doing very well. So with that, Mike, did you want to add anything to that?"

I think one of the things, yes, we had a very good run in prices in June, and our intelligence tells us that farmers sold pretty heavily into that as well as probably forward priced some of their 2016 crop. So I don't think you want us focused too much on current spot prices. Clearly, there's a big crop that's coming in shortly, and that's impacting prices now. But there's still a fair amount of uncertainty about what happens in the southern hemisphere, particularly with the expectation of a La Niña event and the negative consequence that typically has for the Southern Hemisphere harvest. So if you look at the 2017 new crop prices, they're still at levels that are -- that we think underpin decent demand. And as Joc said, we're very much corn, soybean, wheat focused. And the 30% number Joc referred to is that 30% of the potash worldwide is applied to those 3 crops, where phosphates is about 40%. So the fact that you're seeing dramatic increase in sugar prices, cotton prices, coffee prices, fruits and vegetables, those are the ones that are going to, I think, provide a very good demand base."

On the same note, if you talk about bunching of demand into 2H 2016, why is your phosphate price or DAP price range at the top of its range flat with current pricing, and actually shows a potential for a drop in 10% to $310 per tonne?"

Thank you for joining our Third Quarter Earnings Call. This morning, I will give you an overview of our results, then Mike Rahm will discuss market conditions before Rich Mack takes you through some details on our performance for the quarter.

The key concepts that we want you to understand from this call are: First, we anticipated improvements in the business in the second half of the year, and those improvements have begun to materialize. We continue to maintain a constructive outlook for the industry. 
Second, the actions we've taken to lower costs and optimize assets, combined with our scale and secure market access positioned us to maximize the benefits in improving market dynamics. 
And third, our Brazil-centered growth strategy is clearly paying off. Our investment in MicroEssentials capacity expansion and the acquisition of ADM's distribution business came together to allow our International Distribution business to meaningfully exceed expectations this quarter.
Now let's discuss the markets. Mike?"
890498,404682029,1068031,"The Mosaic Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","The Mosaic Company","Executives","Thanks, Joc, and good morning, everyone.

One, on-farm demand remained solid worldwi",604,"Thanks, Joc, and good morning, everyone. Markets during the third quarter played out close to our expectations. 
Let's start with potash. Three positive developments are taking place in the global potash market. One, on-farm demand remained solid worldwide. Two, large channel inventories are getting worked down. And three, producers are optimizing operations in order to meet demand and compete profitably in this new market environment.
On the demand side, statistics continue to point to a bunching of demand during the second half, exactly what we had highlighted on the last earnings call. Canpotex has announced that it is sold out for the rest of the year. Its second half shipments are expected to top the 2014 record. We also project that second half North American shipments will rank as the second highest during the last 5 years.
As you can see on the slide, North American producer inventories are shrinking rapidly as a result of not only this demand surge, but also production cutbacks during the first half, normal summer turnarounds and the temporary closure of our Colonsay facility.
Current momentum is expected to carry over into next year. We project that global MOP shipments will climb to 61 million to 63 million tonnes in 2017, with a current point estimate of around 62 million. That computes to a 4% or 2.5 million-tonne jump in shipments from our 2016 estimate of just less than 60 million.
The projected increase is driven by continued solid on-farm demand and leaner channel inventories worldwide. Thus, shipments are expected to more closely approximate use next year. All of the big 6 consuming regions are forecast to post gains in 2017. 
In the case of phosphates, the DAP margin turned up during the third quarter as a result of improved fundamentals. The benchmark increased, but the sharp drop in raw material cost resulted in stable or only moderately higher prices in most regions, and that is helping to fuel broad-based demand growth. We estimate that global shipments will increase by 800,000 tonnes to 65 million to 66 million tonnes this year. 
China and India remain drags on growth, but gains from all corners of the globe are projected to more than make up the shortfall in the 2 largest phosphate-consuming countries. In addition to increases in the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Pakistan, the former Soviet Union and Africa are expected to post solid gains this year. 
Just like potash, several supply-side changes are taking place. China year-to-date exports through September are down 29% or 2.4 million tonnes from last year. We project that exports will drop from a record 11.6 million tonnes in 2015 to about 8.6 million tonnes this year. 
A restructuring of the Chinese industry is widely expected, with publicly announced plans to close outdated plants with capacity of 3.0 million tonnes of phosphate capacity by the end of this decade. That is the equivalent to 12% of industry capacity or 6.5 million tonnes of DAP, roughly the amount of new capacity expected to start up in Morocco and Saudi Arabia during the next year or 2.
Looking ahead to 2017, we forecast that global shipments will increase by approximately 2.5% to 66 million to 68 million tonnes. China and India are expected to register modest gains next year, and continued growth is projected for most other regions, especially the Americas.
Finally, we do expect a typical seasonal slowdown late fourth quarter and early first quarter. And 2 key factors we are continuing to watch closely are Chinese exports and the pace of new capacity ramp up. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Rich Mack."

As Mike's assessment indicates, we expect the recent potash price and phosphate margin to remain fairly stable, seasonality aside. We also expect demand to remain strong and limited additional price appreciation in the near term. 
Mosaic's performance for the quarter reflects the incrementally improved market environment, but it also reflects the resilience we've built into our business. We are maintaining our focus on the long term and controlling the things we can control, most notably our execution, our operational costs and our capital.
For the quarter, we reported earnings per diluted share of $0.11, which included a negative $0.30 impact from notable items that brought adjusted earnings per share to $0.41. Earnings also included a benefit of $0.08 per share from adjusting the full year effective tax rate accrual.
Our cost reduction efforts are evident in the bottom line across our segments. You can see that we are achieving meaningful cost savings. And keep in mind that we made 2 acquisitions over this period. Our SG&A today is lower than it was before those acquisitions, and in fact, third quarter SG&A is the lowest in the last 9 years. We continue to be on track to meet our combined expense reduction goals of $575 million by 2018.
We are demonstrating similar discipline with respect to our capital. We are continuing key strategic projects, and we are investing to ensure the safety of our employees as well as the mechanical integrity of our assets. As part of our strategic planning process, we took a very critical look at our CapEx requirements over the next 5 years. We are considering every capital decision very carefully. And as a result, we expect CapEx to come down meaningfully after 2017 to a level of approximately $800 million per year, down from earlier expectations of approximately $1.2 billion.
With meaningful changes to our 5-year capital program and significantly reduced operating costs, as well as expectations of an improving environment, we have maintained our dividend, which we will continue to review as market conditions evolve.
We have also changed our target leverage range, now at 2.0 to 2.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. We are also in the process of upsizing our revolving line of credit from $1.5 billion to $2 billion, maintaining our targeted liquidity at $2.5 billion. Going forward, we will continue to assess our cash generation and cash uses in light of our firm commitment to maintaining an investment grade credit rating.
Now I'd like to provide a brief review of our results and our expectations for each segment. In Potash, our sales volumes for the third quarter came in slightly above the top end of our guidance range at 2.2 million tonnes. The volumes reflect the pent-up demand that came to fruition during the quarter, which in turn drew down producer and channel inventories. Prices responded accordingly, though they remain low compared with a year ago and earlier periods.
In the fourth quarter, we continue to expect positive pricing trends, and our guidance is $160 to $175 per tonne. With our volume expectations in the fourth quarter of 1.9 million to 2.1 million tonnes, we believe the second half reflects the strong bunching of demand we talked about earlier this year. The narrower-than-normal ranges reflect Mosaic's essentially sold out position for the fourth quarter.
Our Potash gross margin rate for the quarter was 9%, above our guidance despite an operating rate in the low 60% range and prices at the low end of our guidance range. The improvement reflects the benefits of our ongoing and aggressive work to reduce costs and optimize our operations.
We expect fourth quarter margins to improve further with tailwinds from higher prices, higher operating rates to meet demand and continued cost reduction efforts. We also will be expensing some turnaround work during the quarter and expect our gross margin rate to be in the midteens. Our margin rate guidance also incorporates further weakness in K-Mag prices, reflective of the softer SOP market dynamics.
Moving on to Phosphates. Our business performed as expected. The Phosphate gross margin rate continued to expand as raw material cost reductions benefited our cost of goods sold and with rock costs returning to more normal levels. Blended costs of rock declined to $60 per tonne during the quarter. 
Going forward, we expect slightly more variability in quarterly rock cost than in years past. However, our teams have done an outstanding job of mitigating some of the issues we encountered in the second quarter, and our goal is to maintain rock cost at or near current levels.
Our average Phosphates realized price and shipment volumes were in the middle of our guidance range, with strong global demand persisting and with prices stabilizing despite falling raw material costs.
As Mike said, the fourth quarter is seasonally slower, but we expect volumes to remain fairly robust at 2.1 million to 2.4 million tonnes, and DAP prices to seasonally weaken to a range of $300 to $330 per tonne. We expect relatively stable margins, with a gross margin rate in the upper single digits, as lower input costs largely offset expected weakness in realized prices. We plan to run our Phosphates facilities at approximately 85% of capacity.
Before I leave Phosphates, I'd like to briefly discuss our ammonia contract with CF Industries. As you know, the contract, which begins in 2017, allowed us to forgo the construction of a $1.2 billion ammonia manufacturing plant. We've worked with CF to align on the logistics and we expect our barge to be completed in mid-2017. Given the long-term nature of the contract, the impact to our P&L will fluctuate based on nitrogen production economics. We fully expect there will be times we'll be benefiting from it and times that we will not.
Moving on now to International Distribution, which was a bright spot during the quarter. Excellent farm economics in Brazil drove strong demand and improving prices. In addition, our unique position allowed us to capitalize on improving pricing trends, with a meaningful improvement in International Distribution segment operating earnings. Gross margin per tonne came in well ahead of expectations as a result of higher volumes and higher per tonne margins of MicroEssentials, as well as better fixed cost absorption.
As a reference point, sales of MicroEssentials in Brazil are up over 70% year-to-date. With a more stable operating environment in Brazil, we expect gross margins to be around $20 per tonne and volumes to be in the range of 1.7 million to 1.9 million tonnes during the fourth quarter. As in Potash, the narrower-than-normal volume range reflects Mosaic's sold out position for the fourth quarter.
Finally, the effective tax rate in the quarter was negative. The provision for income taxes in the third quarter included a $28 million benefit related to the expected reduction of the full year effective tax rate. The low effective tax rate is a function of tax deductions that remain fairly constant, primarily depletion combined with a currently low taxable income. In the near term and in 2017, we expect more variability in our effective tax rate. Our other full year guidance numbers can be seen on the slide.
To summarize, we are seeing incremental improvements in the business climate, but we are continuing to plan for whatever the markets may bring. Mosaic has the financial strength and management discipline to adapt and take advantage of opportunities as conditions change.
With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Joc for his closing thoughts and to moderate our Q&A session. Joc?"

Before we move on, I would like to address the situation at our New Wales Phosphate facility in Florida. As you probably know, a sinkhole developed in one cell of a gyp stack on the site, resulting in the loss of process water that was atop that portion of the stack. This is an unfortunate situation, but I would like to commend the excellent around-the-clock work our teams in Florida are performing to resolve it. 
The key points for investors to understand are first and foremost, we have performed over 1,000 well tests, and we have not identified any offset impacts from the water loss. Collection wells are retaining the water and we are pumping that water back up to the another area of the gyp stack. We have done and will continue to do extensive water testing around the site, and we do not expect that there will be any off-site impact.
Second, phosphate production at New Wales has not been impacted, and we do not anticipate any impacts. 
And third, based on the work we completed so far and the consent order reached with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, we are comfortable that the cost to repair the sinkhole will be manageable.
Now to summarize our thoughts on the quarter and the business environment. Agricultural commodity fundamentals, including fertilizer fundamentals are improving, albeit slowly, and Mosaic is benefiting from those improvements.
Just as important, our work to reduce cost is driving better results now. And we are going to maintain this focus as conditions improve so that we can outperform across the cycle. And we are maintaining our solid financial foundation by managing our liquidity and capital spending carefully. Mosaic is performing well, and we remain in an excellent position to thrive as conditions continue to improve.
Now we would be happy to take your questions."

First, on the leverage ratio, the way that we currently look at it is we're adapting our balance sheet philosophy, our capital management philosophy, to the current market environment. And if you go back and you look at history, this is really a vestige of the years after the Cargill split-off transaction. We first rolled out our capital management philosophy in 2013, and it hasn't meaningfully changed since that point in time. Where we're at right now, we're not changing our overall liquidity buffer, we're keeping that at $2.5 billion. We're simply changing the mix of that by upsizing our revolver from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. And as you noted, we're moving our target leverage ratio from 2 to 2.5x. And I think it's important to note that we take a look at that on a through-cycle basis. We're a cyclical industry, and there are going to be times where we're going to be over it and there are times where we're going to be under it. I think it's all guided by the guidepost of a strong investment-grade credit rating. And we believe that the ratios and the liquidity buffer that we have articulated will meet just that. And then moving on to your second question on the dividend. Obviously, a topical issue in the environment that we're in right now. Obviously, it's something that we continue to monitor very closely. As you've seen in our results, we've aggressively and proactively reduced our spend both in capital and in operating costs. Earlier this year, we indicated that the second half was going to be better than the first half, and we're starting to see that particularly in the Potash business and also within the good results in our ID business this quarter. And with the $2.5 billion, we certainly have ample liquidity and we can use this for a short period of time, but it's not something that you would use for a long period to cover your dividend. So what I would simply say in summary is that this is something that we're going to continue to watch. It will be dependent on where the market goes and it's going to be dependent on the tradeoffs between capital, operating expenses and cash available for dividends."

However, in Brazil, where we have what we believe to be a great market opportunity with our own distribution business and the acquisition of the ADM business, this year alone, we've seen a 60% increase in MicroEssentials sale.

Your correct that we've seen some slippage in phosphate rock prices. As you probably know, rock is transacted a little bit differently than the finished products, in that if you're running a plant that's not integrated and relies on rock, you typically contract for a period of time. So as fundamentals change, there is a lag in terms of when rock prices adjust. That said, we haven't seen a draconian drop in rock prices. I think in terms of the structure of that market, rock prices have held up reasonably well in the current environment. With respect to how that plays into the stripping margin, our stripping margin is calculated based on a finished phosphate price DAP plus the cost of ammonia and sulfur, so it doesn't come into play in terms of the stripping margin that you might see coming from us. And I think as we've indicated earlier, our actual rock costs have varied a little bit over time but remain fairly constant in terms of trend costs."

And I think what's exciting, I think there's a very good and underappreciated story in potash shaping out for 2017, we're finally going to see I think growth in global potash shipments next year to the tune of 2 million to 2.5 million tonnes or so due to the fact that we can't live off of the pipeline anymore. And secondly, we're seeing some very significant adjustments on the supply side with North America alone about 2.25 million tonnes of capacity get permanently closed.

And the difference between the upper end of $50 million and the $60 million was more testing and water treatment for a longer period of time than was originally anticipated. And just to be clear, I think this is a reserve, this is not an outflow at this stage. This is a reserve that will cover the cost over the next 14 to 20 months, so it's not a cost to date.

It's a good question and something that we're watching very carefully. As you saw from the statistics, if you look at year-to-date exports out of China, they're down 29%, it's 2.4 million tonnes.

As you saw from the statistics, if you look at year-to-date exports out of China, they're down 29%, it's 2.4 million tonnes. We think that is clearly on track for our projection for quite a while here that we'd see about a 3 million tonne drop. I think just to kind of look at the big picture of phosphates, we see a very constructive longer-term outlook, but there are some uncertainties in the near term. And I think one of those is how quickly we see restructuring take place in China. When you look at global phosphate shipments, they really have flattened a bit. And they flattened due largely to declines that have taken place in China and India. And fortunately, all of those declines have been offset by gains in other parts of the world. But the fact that we've seen declines in China and India has really hit the Chinese industry very hard. And as a consequence, we've seen Asian prices in particular get hit. And as a result, I think that will accelerate the restructuring taking place. And with respect to the industry cost curve, as you know, the Chinese industry is a very heterogeneous industry, they are high-cost players but we think will get driven out. And as we've indicated that the Chinese make no bones about the fact that they too believe that restructuring is needed. And I guess the bottom line is, when we look ahead, we see decent demand growth of 2%, 2.5% per year. And if you look at shipments of 65 million tonnes, 2% growth is 1.3 million per year. Over 5 years, that's 6.5 million tonnes, which is roughly equal to the additional capacity coming on in Morocco and Saudi Arabia. So I think then that will happen. And in China, we would expect that there will be restructuring. And at the end of this decade, China will be operating a smaller, more efficient and a bit more competitive industry. So I guess a long-winded answer that we do see a very constructive long-term outlook for potash phosphate. And then in the near term, a few adjustments that I think the market will go through to set itself up for a very good medium-term outlook."

Canpotex has announced that it is sold out for the rest of the year. Its second half shipments are expected to top the 2014 record. We also project that second half North American shipments will rank as the second highest during the last 5 years.
As you can see on the slide, North American producer inventories are shrinking rapidly as a result of not only this demand surge, but also production cutbacks during the first half, normal summer turnarounds and the temporary closure of our Colonsay facility.
Current momentum is expected to carry over into next year. We project that global MOP shipments will climb to 61 million to 63 million tonnes in 2017, with a current point estimate of around 62 million. That computes to a 4% or 2.5 million-tonne jump in shipments from our 2016 estimate of just less than 60 million.
The projected increase is driven by continued solid on-farm demand and leaner channel inventories worldwide. Thus, shipments are expected to more closely approximate use next year. All of the big 6 consuming regions are forecast to post gains in 2017. 
In the case of phosphates, the DAP margin turned up during the third quarter as a result of improved fundamentals. The benchmark increased, but the sharp drop in raw material cost resulted in stable or only moderately higher prices in most regions, and that is helping to fuel broad-based demand growth. We estimate that global shipments will increase by 800,000 tonnes to 65 million to 66 million tonnes this year. 
China and India remain drags on growth, but gains from all corners of the globe are projected to more than make up the shortfall in the 2 largest phosphate-consuming countries. In addition to increases in the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Pakistan, the former Soviet Union and Africa are expected to post solid gains this year. 
Just like potash, several supply-side changes are taking place. China year-to-date exports through September are down 29% or 2.4 million tonnes from last year. We project that exports will drop from a record 11.6 million tonnes in 2015 to about 8.6 million tonnes this year. 
A restructuring of the Chinese industry is widely expected, with publicly announced plans to close outdated plants with capacity of 3.0 million tonnes of phosphate capacity by the end of this decade. That is the equivalent to 12% of industry capacity or 6.5 million tonnes of DAP, roughly the amount of new capacity expected to start up in Morocco and Saudi Arabia during the next year or 2.
Looking ahead to 2017, we forecast that global shipments will increase by approximately 2.5% to 66 million to 68 million tonnes. China and India are expected to register modest gains next year, and continued growth is projected for most other regions, especially the Americas.
Finally, we do expect a typical seasonal slowdown late fourth quarter and early first quarter. And 2 key factors we are continuing to watch closely are Chinese exports and the pace of new capacity ramp up. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Rich Mack."

As Mike's assessment indicates, we expect the recent potash price and phosphate margin to remain fairly stable, seasonality aside. We also expect demand to remain strong and limited additional price appreciation in the near term. 
Mosaic's performance for the quarter reflects the incrementally improved market environment, but it also reflects the resilience we've built into our business. We are maintaining our focus on the long term and controlling the things we can control, most notably our execution, our operational costs and our capital.
For the quarter, we reported earnings per diluted share of $0.11, which included a negative $0.30 impact from notable items that brought adjusted earnings per share to $0.41. Earnings also included a benefit of $0.08 per share from adjusting the full year effective tax rate accrual.
Our cost reduction efforts are evident in the bottom line across our segments. You can see that we are achieving meaningful cost savings. And keep in mind that we made 2 acquisitions over this period. Our SG&A today is lower than it was before those acquisitions, and in fact, third quarter SG&A is the lowest in the last 9 years. We continue to be on track to meet our combined expense reduction goals of $575 million by 2018.
We are demonstrating similar discipline with respect to our capital. We are continuing key strategic projects, and we are investing to ensure the safety of our employees as well as the mechanical integrity of our assets. As part of our strategic planning process, we took a very critical look at our CapEx requirements over the next 5 years. We are considering every capital decision very carefully. And as a result, we expect CapEx to come down meaningfully after 2017 to a level of approximately $800 million per year, down from earlier expectations of approximately $1.2 billion.
With meaningful changes to our 5-year capital program and significantly reduced operating costs, as well as expectations of an improving environment, we have maintained our dividend, which we will continue to review as market conditions evolve.
We have also changed our target leverage range, now at 2.0 to 2.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. We are also in the process of upsizing our revolving line of credit from $1.5 billion to $2 billion, maintaining our targeted liquidity at $2.5 billion. Going forward, we will continue to assess our cash generation and cash uses in light of our firm commitment to maintaining an investment grade credit rating.
Now I'd like to provide a brief review of our results and our expectations for each segment. In Potash, our sales volumes for the third quarter came in slightly above the top end of our guidance range at 2.2 million tonnes. The volumes reflect the pent-up demand that came to fruition during the quarter, which in turn drew down producer and channel inventories. Prices responded accordingly, though they remain low compared with a year ago and earlier periods.
In the fourth quarter, we continue to expect positive pricing trends, and our guidance is $160 to $175 per tonne. With our volume expectations in the fourth quarter of 1.9 million to 2.1 million tonnes, we believe the second half reflects the strong bunching of demand we talked about earlier this year. The narrower-than-normal ranges reflect Mosaic's essentially sold out position for the fourth quarter.
Our Potash gross margin rate for the quarter was 9%, above our guidance despite an operating rate in the low 60% range and prices at the low end of our guidance range. The improvement reflects the benefits of our ongoing and aggressive work to reduce costs and optimize our operations.
We expect fourth quarter margins to improve further with tailwinds from higher prices, higher operating rates to meet demand and continued cost reduction efforts. We also will be expensing some turnaround work during the quarter and expect our gross margin rate to be in the midteens. Our margin rate guidance also incorporates further weakness in K-Mag prices, reflective of the softer SOP market dynamics.
Moving on to Phosphates. Our business performed as expected. The Phosphate gross margin rate continued to expand as raw material cost reductions benefited our cost of goods sold and with rock costs returning to more normal levels. Blended costs of rock declined to $60 per tonne during the quarter. 
Going forward, we expect slightly more variability in quarterly rock cost than in years past. However, our teams have done an outstanding job of mitigating some of the issues we encountered in the second quarter, and our goal is to maintain rock cost at or near current levels.
Our average Phosphates realized price and shipment volumes were in the middle of our guidance range, with strong global demand persisting and with prices stabilizing despite falling raw material costs.
As Mike said, the fourth quarter is seasonally slower, but we expect volumes to remain fairly robust at 2.1 million to 2.4 million tonnes, and DAP prices to seasonally weaken to a range of $300 to $330 per tonne. We expect relatively stable margins, with a gross margin rate in the upper single digits, as lower input costs largely offset expected weakness in realized prices. We plan to run our Phosphates facilities at approximately 85% of capacity.
Before I leave Phosphates, I'd like to briefly discuss our ammonia contract with CF Industries. As you know, the contract, which begins in 2017, allowed us to forgo the construction of a $1.2 billion ammonia manufacturing plant. We've worked with CF to align on the logistics and we expect our barge to be completed in mid-2017. Given the long-term nature of the contract, the impact to our P&L will fluctuate based on nitrogen production economics. We fully expect there will be times we'll be benefiting from it and times that we will not.
Moving on now to International Distribution, which was a bright spot during the quarter. Excellent farm economics in Brazil drove strong demand and improving prices. In addition, our unique position allowed us to capitalize on improving pricing trends, with a meaningful improvement in International Distribution segment operating earnings. Gross margin per tonne came in well ahead of expectations as a result of higher volumes and higher per tonne margins of MicroEssentials, as well as better fixed cost absorption.
As a reference point, sales of MicroEssentials in Brazil are up over 70% year-to-date. With a more stable operating environment in Brazil, we expect gross margins to be around $20 per tonne and volumes to be in the range of 1.7 million to 1.9 million tonnes during the fourth quarter. As in Potash, the narrower-than-normal volume range reflects Mosaic's sold out position for the fourth quarter.
Finally, the effective tax rate in the quarter was negative. The provision for income taxes in the third quarter included a $28 million benefit related to the expected reduction of the full year effective tax rate. The low effective tax rate is a function of tax deductions that remain fairly constant, primarily depletion combined with a currently low taxable income. In the near term and in 2017, we expect more variability in our effective tax rate. Our other full year guidance numbers can be seen on the slide.
To summarize, we are seeing incremental improvements in the business climate, but we are continuing to plan for whatever the markets may bring. Mosaic has the financial strength and management discipline to adapt and take advantage of opportunities as conditions change.
With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Joc for his closing thoughts and to moderate our Q&A session. Joc?"

Before we move on, I would like to address the situation at our New Wales Phosphate facility in Florida. As you probably know, a sinkhole developed in one cell of a gyp stack on the site, resulting in the loss of process water that was atop that portion of the stack. This is an unfortunate situation, but I would like to commend the excellent around-the-clock work our teams in Florida are performing to resolve it. 
The key points for investors to understand are first and foremost, we have performed over 1,000 well tests, and we have not identified any offset impacts from the water loss. Collection wells are retaining the water and we are pumping that water back up to the another area of the gyp stack. We have done and will continue to do extensive water testing around the site, and we do not expect that there will be any off-site impact.
Second, phosphate production at New Wales has not been impacted, and we do not anticipate any impacts. 
And third, based on the work we completed so far and the consent order reached with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, we are comfortable that the cost to repair the sinkhole will be manageable.
Now to summarize our thoughts on the quarter and the business environment. Agricultural commodity fundamentals, including fertilizer fundamentals are improving, albeit slowly, and Mosaic is benefiting from those improvements.
Just as important, our work to reduce cost is driving better results now. And we are going to maintain this focus as conditions improve so that we can outperform across the cycle. And we are maintaining our solid financial foundation by managing our liquidity and capital spending carefully. Mosaic is performing well, and we remain in an excellent position to thrive as conditions continue to improve.
Now we would be happy to take your questions."

First, on the leverage ratio, the way that we currently look at it is we're adapting our balance sheet philosophy, our capital management philosophy, to the current market environment. And if you go back and you look at history, this is really a vestige of the years after the Cargill split-off transaction. We first rolled out our capital management philosophy in 2013, and it hasn't meaningfully changed since that point in time. Where we're at right now, we're not changing our overall liquidity buffer, we're keeping that at $2.5 billion. We're simply changing the mix of that by upsizing our revolver from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. And as you noted, we're moving our target leverage ratio from 2 to 2.5x. And I think it's important to note that we take a look at that on a through-cycle basis. We're a cyclical industry, and there are going to be times where we're going to be over it and there are times where we're going to be under it. I think it's all guided by the guidepost of a strong investment-grade credit rating. And we believe that the ratios and the liquidity buffer that we have articulated will meet just that. And then moving on to your second question on the dividend. Obviously, a topical issue in the environment that we're in right now. Obviously, it's something that we continue to monitor very closely. As you've seen in our results, we've aggressively and proactively reduced our spend both in capital and in operating costs. Earlier this year, we indicated that the second half was going to be better than the first half, and we're starting to see that particularly in the Potash business and also within the good results in our ID business this quarter. And with the $2.5 billion, we certainly have ample liquidity and we can use this for a short period of time, but it's not something that you would use for a long period to cover your dividend. So what I would simply say in summary is that this is something that we're going to continue to watch. It will be dependent on where the market goes and it's going to be dependent on the tradeoffs between capital, operating expenses and cash available for dividends."

So it's only been a very short period of time we've had new capacity available. In North America, our shipments of MicroEssentials will be up, although the growth rate of MicroEssentials in North America are still fairly low or now slowing down. However, in Brazil, where we have what we believe to be a great market opportunity with our own distribution business and the acquisition of the ADM business, this year alone, we've seen a 60% increase in MicroEssentials sale. And that's all due to higher availability. So with where we're sitting, I think this is a great story and one that will continue with the new capacity.

Your correct that we've seen some slippage in phosphate rock prices. As you probably know, rock is transacted a little bit differently than the finished products, in that if you're running a plant that's not integrated and relies on rock, you typically contract for a period of time. So as fundamentals change, there is a lag in terms of when rock prices adjust. That said, we haven't seen a draconian drop in rock prices. I think in terms of the structure of that market, rock prices have held up reasonably well in the current environment. With respect to how that plays into the stripping margin, our stripping margin is calculated based on a finished phosphate price DAP plus the cost of ammonia and sulfur, so it doesn't come into play in terms of the stripping margin that you might see coming from us. And I think as we've indicated earlier, our actual rock costs have varied a little bit over time but remain fairly constant in terms of trend costs."

And I think what's exciting, and I think there's a very good and underappreciated story in potash shaping out for 2017: We are finally going to see, I think, growth in global potash shipments next year to the tune of 2.5 million tonnes or so due to the fact that we can't live off the pipeline anymore. And secondly, we've seen some very significant adjustments on the supply side, with -- in North America alone, about 2.25 million tonnes of capacity get permanently closed. So you add that all together. And I think they projected producer inventories that we're showing for North America are probably similar for most producers around the globe.

In terms of New Wales, and I'll let Rich -- Rick talk a little bit more about Colonsay in a second and the potash market in North America. But in terms of New Wales, yes, we certainly guided to, I think, $30 million to $50 million. And the difference between the upper end of $50 million and the $60 million was more testing and water treatment for a longer period of time than was originally anticipated. And just to be clear, I think this is a reserve. This is not an outflow at this stage. This is a reserve that will cover the cost over the next 14 to 20 months, so it's not a cost to date.

It's a good question and something that we're watching very carefully. As you saw from the statistics, if you look at year-to-date exports out of China, they're down 29%, it's 2.4 million tonnes.

As you saw from the statistics, if you look at year-to-date exports out of China, they're down 29%, it's 2.4 million tonnes. We think that is clearly on track for our projection for quite a while here that we'd see about a 3 million tonne drop. I think, just to kind of look at the big picture of phosphate, we see a very constructive longer-term outlook, but there are some uncertainties in the near term. And I think one of those is how quickly we see restructuring take place in China. When you look at global phosphate shipments, they really have flattened a bit. And they flattened due largely to declines that have taken place in China and India. And fortunately, all of those declines have been offset by gains in other parts of the world. But the fact that we've seen declines in China and India has really hit the Chinese industry very hard. And as a consequence, we've seen Asian prices in particular get hit. And as a result, I think that will accelerate the restructuring taking place. And with respect to the industry cost curve, as you know, the Chinese industry is a very heterogeneous industry. There are high-cost players that we think will get driven out. And as we've indicated, the Chinese make no bones about the fact that they, too, believe that restructuring is needed. And I guess the bottom line is, when we look ahead, we see decent demand growth of 2%, 2.5% per year. And if you look at shipments of 65 million tonnes, 2% growth is 1.3 million tonnes per year. Over 5 years, it's 6.5 million tonnes, which is roughly equal to the additional capacity coming on in Morocco and Saudi Arabia. So we think that, that will happen. And in China, we would expect that there will be restructuring. And at the end of this decade, China will be operating a smaller, more efficient and a bit more competitive industry. So I guess a long-winded answer that we do see a very constructive long-term outlook for phosphate. And in the near term, a few adjustments that, I think, the market will go through to set itself up for a very good medium-term outlook."

So with better utilization and making use of how we move product into the country and now we move it out to the customer, we're able to increase margins. The biggest portion driving the margin increase is us being able to deliver a premium product like MicroEssentials in those marketplaces."

That is underpinning good on-farm demand, which has resulted in -- or is resulting in a pull down of channel inventories, especially at kind of that retail level. As we go forward, I think there's a great opportunity for India to try to address the imbalance between nitrogen phosphate and potash use. And I think what they've done so far with the subsidy is conducive to trying to achieve a better balance. So I wouldn't see any major change in that. I think, given where international prices are headed, given a stable outlook for the rupee, there will be a subsidy in place that continues to encourage P&K consumption in India."

890498,404682029,1068459,"The Mosaic Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","The Mosaic Company","Executives","Thanks, Joc, and good morning, everyone. Markets during the third quarter played out close to our expectations. Let's start with potash. Three positive developments are taking place in the global potash market. One, on-farm demand remained solid worldwi",603,"Thanks, Joc, and good morning, everyone. Markets during the third quarter played out close to our expectations. 
Let's start with potash. Three positive developments are taking place in the global potash market. One, on-farm demand remained solid worldwide. Two, large channel inventories are getting worked down. And three, producers are optimizing operations in order to meet demand and compete profitably in this new market environment.
On the demand side, statistics continue to point to a bunching of demand during the second half, exactly what we had highlighted on the last earnings call. Canpotex has announced that it is sold out for the rest of the year. Its second half shipments are expected to top the 2014 record. We also project that second half North American shipments will rank as the second-highest during the last 5 years.
As you can see on the slide, North American producer inventories are shrinking rapidly as a result of not only this demand surge, but also production cutbacks during the first half, normal summer turnarounds and the temporary closure of our Colonsay facility.
Current momentum is expected to carry over into next year. We project that global MOP shipments will climb to 61 million to 63 million tonnes in 2017, with a current point estimate of around 62 million. That computes to a 4% or 2.5 million tonne jump in shipments from our 2016 estimate of just less than 60 million.
The projected increase is driven by continued solid on-farm demand and leaner channel inventories worldwide. Thus, shipments are expected to more closely approximate use next year. All of the big 6 consuming regions are forecast to post gains in 2017. 
In the case of phosphates, the DAP margin turned up during the third quarter as a result of improved fundamentals. The benchmark increased, but the sharp drop in raw material cost resulted in stable or only moderately higher prices in most regions, and that is helping to fuel broad-based demand growth. We estimate that global shipments will increase by 800,000 tonnes to 65 million to 66 million tonnes this year. 
China and India remain drags on growth, but gains from all corners of the globe are projected to more than make up the shortfall in the 2 largest phosphate-consuming countries. In addition to increases in the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Pakistan, the former Soviet Union and Africa are expected to post solid gains this year. 
Just like potash, several supply-side changes are taking place. China year-to-date exports through September are down 29% or 2.4 million tonnes from last year. We project that exports will drop from a record 11.6 million tonnes in 2015 to about 8.6 million tonnes this year. 
A restructuring of the Chinese industry is widely expected, with publicly announced plans to close outdated plants with capacity of 3.0 million tonnes of phosphate capacity by the end of this decade. That is the equivalent to 12% of industry capacity or 6.5 million tonnes of DAP, roughly the amount of new capacity expected to start up in Morocco and Saudi Arabia during the next year or 2.
Looking ahead to 2017, we forecast that global shipments will increase by approximately 2.5% to 66 million to 68 million tonnes. China and India are expected to register modest gains next year, and continued growth is projected for most other regions, especially the Americas.
Finally, we do expect a typical seasonal slowdown late fourth quarter and early first quarter. And 2 key factors we are continuing to watch closely are Chinese exports and the pace of new capacity ramp-up. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Rich Mack."
890498,404682029,1068459,"The Mosaic Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","The Mosaic Company","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good morning to you all.

As Mike's assessment indicates, we expect the recent potash price and phosphate margin to remain fairly stable, seasonality aside. We also expect demand to remain strong and limited additional price appreciation in the near term. 
Mosaic's performance for the quarter reflects the incrementally improved market environment, but it also reflects the resilience we've built into our business. We are maintaining our focus on the long term and controlling the things we can control, most notably our execution, our operational costs and our capital.
For the quarter, we reported earnings per diluted share of $0.11, which included a negative $0.30 impact from notable items that brought adjusted earnings per share to $0.41. Earnings also included a benefit of $0.08 per share from adjusting the full year effective tax rate accrual.
Our cost reduction efforts are evident in the bottom line across our segments. You can see that we are achieving meaningful cost savings. And keep in mind that we made 2 acquisitions over this period. Our SG&A today is lower than it was before those acquisitions, and in fact, third quarter SG&A is the lowest in the last 9 years. We continue to be on track to meet our combined expense reduction goals of $575 million by 2018.
We are demonstrating similar discipline with respect to our capital. We are continuing key strategic projects, and we are investing to ensure the safety of our employees as well as the mechanical integrity of our assets. As part of our strategic planning process, we took a very critical look at our CapEx requirements over the next 5 years. We are considering every capital decision very carefully. And as a result, we expect CapEx to come down meaningfully after 2017 to a level of approximately $800 million per year, down from earlier expectations of approximately $1.2 billion.
With meaningful changes to our 5-year capital program and significantly reduced operating costs, as well as expectations of an improving environment, we have maintained our dividend, which we will continue to review as market conditions evolve.
We have also changed our target leverage range, now at 2.0 to 2.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. We are also in the process of upsizing our revolving line of credit from $1.5 billion to $2 billion, maintaining our targeted liquidity at $2.5 billion. Going forward, we will continue to assess our cash generation and cash uses in light of our firm commitment to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating.
Now I'd like to provide a brief review of our results and our expectations for each segment. In Potash, our sales volumes for the third quarter came in slightly above the top end of our guidance range at 2.2 million tonnes. The volumes reflect the pent-up demand that came to fruition during the quarter, which in turn drew down producer and channel inventories. Prices responded accordingly, though they remain low compared with a year ago and earlier periods.
In the fourth quarter, we continue to expect positive pricing trends, and our guidance is $160 to $175 per tonne. With our volume expectations in the fourth quarter of 1.9 million to 2.1 million tonnes, we believe the second half reflects the strong bunching of demand we talked about earlier this year. The narrower-than-normal ranges reflect Mosaic's essentially sold-out position for the fourth quarter.
Our Potash gross margin rate for the quarter was 9%, above our guidance despite an operating rate in the low 60% range and prices at the low end of our guidance range. The improvement reflects the benefits of our ongoing and aggressive work to reduce costs and optimize our operations.
We expect fourth quarter margins to improve further with tailwinds from higher prices, higher operating rates to meet demand and continued cost reduction efforts. We also will be expensing some turnaround work during the quarter and expect our gross margin rate to be in the mid-teens. Our margin rate guidance also incorporates further weakness in K-Mag prices, reflective of the softer SOP market dynamics.
Moving on to Phosphates. Our business performed as expected. The Phosphate gross margin rate continued to expand as raw material cost reductions benefited our cost of goods sold and with rock costs returning to more normal levels. Blended costs of rock declined to $60 per tonne during the quarter. 
Going forward, we expect slightly more variability in quarterly rock cost than in years past. However, our teams have done an outstanding job of mitigating some of the issues we encountered in the second quarter, and our goal is to maintain rock cost at or near current levels.
Our average Phosphates realized price and shipment volumes were in the middle of our guidance range, with strong global demand persisting and with prices stabilizing despite falling raw material costs.
As Mike said, the fourth quarter is seasonally slower, but we expect volumes to remain fairly robust at 2.1 million to 2.4 million tonnes, and DAP prices to seasonally weaken to a range of $300 to $330 per tonne. We expect relatively stable margins, with a gross margin rate in the upper single digits, as lower input costs largely offset expected weakness in realized prices. We plan to run our Phosphates facilities at approximately 85% of capacity.
Before I leave Phosphates, I'd like to briefly discuss our ammonia contract with CF Industries. As you know, the contract, which begins in 2017, allowed us to forgo the construction of a $1.2 billion ammonia manufacturing plant. We've worked with CF to align on the logistics, and we expect our barge to be completed in mid-2017. Given the long-term nature of the contract, the impact to our P&L will fluctuate based on nitrogen production economics. We fully expect there will be times we'll be benefiting from it and times that we will not.
Moving on now to International Distribution, which was a bright spot during the quarter. Excellent farm economics in Brazil drove strong demand and improving prices. In addition, our unique position allowed us to capitalize on improving pricing trends, with a meaningful improvement in International Distribution segment operating earnings. Gross margin per tonne came in well ahead of expectations as a result of higher volumes and higher per tonne margins of MicroEssentials, as well as better fixed cost absorption.
As a reference point, sales of MicroEssentials in Brazil are up over 70% year-to-date. With a more stable operating environment in Brazil, we expect gross margins to be around $20 per tonne and volumes to be in the range of 1.7 million to 1.9 million tonnes during the fourth quarter. As in Potash, the narrower-than-normal volume range reflects Mosaic's sold-out position for the fourth quarter.
Finally, the effective tax rate in the quarter was negative. The provision for income taxes in the third quarter included a $28 million benefit related to the expected reduction of the full year effective tax rate. The low effective tax rate is a function of tax deductions that remain fairly constant, primarily depletion, combined with a currently low taxable income. In the near term and in 2017, we expect more variability in our effective tax rate. Our other full year guidance numbers can be seen on the slide.
To summarize, we are seeing incremental improvements in the business climate, but we are continuing to plan for whatever the markets may bring. Mosaic has the financial strength and management discipline to adapt and take advantage of opportunities as conditions change.
With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Joc for his closing thoughts and to moderate our Q&A session. Joc?"

Before we move on, I would like to address the situation at our New Wales Phosphate facility in Florida. As you probably know, a sinkhole developed in one cell of a gyp stack on the site, resulting in the loss of process water that was atop that portion of the stack. This is an unfortunate situation, but I would like to commend the excellent around-the-clock work our teams in Florida are performing to resolve it. 
The key points for investors to understand are, first and foremost, we have performed over 1,000 well tests, and we have not identified any offset impacts from the water loss. Collection wells are retaining the water, and we are pumping that water back up to another area of the gyp stack. We have done and will continue to do extensive water testing around the site, and we do not expect that there will be any off-site impact.
Second, phosphate production at New Wales has not been impacted, and we do not anticipate any impacts. 
And third, based on the work we completed so far and the consent order reached with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, we are comfortable that the cost to repair the sinkhole will be manageable.
Now to summarize our thoughts on the quarter and the business environment. Agricultural commodity fundamentals, including fertilizer fundamentals, are improving, albeit slowly, and Mosaic is benefiting from those improvements.
Just as important, our work to reduce cost is driving better results now. And we are going to maintain this focus as conditions improve so that we can outperform across the cycle. And we are maintaining our solid financial foundation by managing our liquidity and capital spending carefully. Mosaic is performing well, and we remain in an excellent position to thrive as conditions continue to improve.
Now we would be happy to take your questions."

So while we do have capital still required, we're generating good cash flows. And of course, we will continue to assess how those 2 fit together.

First, on the leverage ratio, the way that we currently look at it is we're adapting our balance sheet philosophy, our capital management philosophy, to the current market environment. And if you go back and you look at history, this is really a vestige of the years after the Cargill split-off transaction. We first rolled out our capital management philosophy in 2013, and it hasn't meaningfully changed since that point in time. Where we're at right now, we're not changing our overall liquidity buffer. We're keeping that at $2.5 billion. We're simply changing the mix of that by upsizing our revolver from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. And as you noted, we're moving our target leverage ratio from 2 to 2.5x. And I think it's important to note that we take a look at that on a through-cycle basis. We're a cyclical industry, and there are going to be times where we're going to be over it and there are times where we're going to be under it. I think it's all guided by the guidepost of a strong investment-grade credit rating. And we believe that the ratios and the liquidity buffer that we have articulated will meet just that. And then moving on to your second question on the dividend. Obviously, a topical issue in the environment that we're in right now. Obviously, it's something that we continue to monitor very closely. As you've seen in our results, we've aggressively and proactively reduced our spend both in capital and in operating costs. Earlier this year, we indicated that the second half was going to be better than the first half, and we're starting to see that, particularly in the Potash business and also with the good results in our ID business this quarter. And with the $2.5 billion, we certainly have ample liquidity and we can use this for a short period of time, but it's not something that you would use for a long period to cover your dividend. So what I would simply say in summary is that this is something that we're going to continue to watch. It will be dependent on where the market goes, and it's going to be dependent on the tradeoffs between capital, operating expenses and cash available for dividends."

So it's only been a very short period of time we've had new capacity available. In North America, our shipments of MicroEssentials will be up, although the growth rate of MicroEssentials in North America are still fairly low or now slowing down. However, in Brazil, where we have what we believe to be a great market opportunity with our own distribution business and the acquisition of the ADM business, this year alone, we've seen a 60% increase in MicroEssentials sale. And that's all due to higher availability. So with where we're sitting, I think this is a great story and one that will continue with the new capacity.

As you probably know, rock is transacted a little bit differently than the finished products, in that if you're running a plant that's not integrated and relies on rock, you typically contract for a period of time. So as fundamentals change, there is a lag in terms of when rock prices adjust. That said, we haven't seen a draconian drop in rock prices. I think in terms of the structure of that market, rock prices have held up reasonably well in the current environment. With respect to how that plays into the stripping margin, our stripping margin is calculated based on a finished phosphate price DAP plus the cost of ammonia and sulfur, so it doesn't come into play in terms of the stripping margin that you might see coming from us.

It's taken a couple of years to work that down. And I think what's exciting, and I think there's a very good and underappreciated story in potash shaping out for 2017: We are finally going to see, I think, growth in global potash shipments next year to the tune of 2.5 million tonnes or so due to the fact that we can't live off the pipeline anymore. And secondly, we've seen some very significant adjustments on the supply side, with -- in North America alone, about 2.25 million tonnes of capacity get permanently closed. So you add that all together. And I think the projected producer inventories that we're showing for North America are probably similar for most producers around the globe. So bottom line is I think there's some -- there have been some very positive developments take place in the global potash market."

As we go into 2017, we're frankly expecting a pretty good spring for all the reasons that Mike Rahm has just explained. So we're believing that it will probably be necessary for us to be starting up Colonsay in the early new year as per the original expectations that we set. In terms of New Wales, and I'll let Rich -- Rick talk a little bit more about Colonsay in a second and the potash market in North America. But in terms of New Wales, yes, we certainly guided to, I think, $30 million to $50 million. And the difference between the upper end, the $50 million, and the $60 million was more testing and water treatment for a longer period of time than was originally anticipated. And just to be clear, I think this is a reserve. This is not an outflow at this stage. This is a reserve that will cover the cost over the next 14 to 20 months, so it's not a cost to date. As per the original expectations, we expect that repairing the hole will take around the $30 million. Other treatment and whatnot around the plant will take the second $30 million.

It's a good question and something that we're watching very carefully. As you saw from the statistics, if you look at year-to-date exports out of China, they're down 29%. It's 2.4 million tonnes.

As you saw from the statistics, if you look at year-to-date exports out of China, they're down 29%. It's 2.4 million tonnes. We think that is clearly on track for our projection for quite a while here that we'd see about a 3 million tonne drop. I think, just to kind of look at the big picture of phosphate, we see a very constructive longer-term outlook, but there are some uncertainties in the near term. And I think one of those is how quickly we see restructuring take place in China. When you look at global phosphate shipments, they really have flattened a bit. And they flattened due largely to declines that have taken place in China and India. And fortunately, all of those declines have been offset by gains in other parts of the world. But the fact that we've seen declines in China and India has really hit the Chinese industry very hard. And as a consequence, we've seen Asian prices in particular get hit. And as a result, I think that will accelerate the restructuring taking place. And with respect to the industry cost curve, as you know, the Chinese industry is a very heterogeneous industry. There are high-cost players that we think will get driven out. And as we've indicated, the Chinese make no bones about the fact that they, too, believe that restructuring is needed. And I guess the bottom line is, when we look ahead, we see decent demand growth of 2%, 2.5% per year. And if you look at shipments of 65 million tonnes, 2% growth is 1.3 million tonnes per year. Over 5 years, it's 6.5 million tonnes, which is roughly equal to the additional capacity coming on in Morocco and Saudi Arabia. So we think that, that will happen. And in China, we would expect that there will be restructuring. And at the end of this decade, China will be operating a smaller, more efficient and a bit more competitive industry. So I guess a long-winded answer that we do see a very constructive long-term outlook for phosphate. And in the near term, a few adjustments that, I think, the market will go through to set itself up for a very good medium-term outlook."

The key concepts that we want you to understand from this call are: First, we anticipated improvements in the business in the second half of the year, and those improvements have begun to materialize. We continue to maintain a constructive outlook for the industry. 
Second, the actions we've taken to lower costs and optimize assets, combined with our scale and secure market access, positioned us to maximize the benefits of improving market dynamics. 
And third, our Brazil-centered growth strategy is clearly paying off. Our investment in MicroEssentials capacity expansion and the acquisition of ADM's distribution business came together to allow our International Distribution business to meaningfully exceed expectations this quarter.

890498,404682029,1069481,"The Mosaic Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","The Mosaic Company","Executives","Thanks, Joc, and good morning, everyone.

Let's start with potash. Three positive developments are taking place in the global potash market. One, on-farm demand remained solid worldwide. Two, large channel inventories are getting worked down. And three, producers are optimizing operations in order to meet demand and compete profitably in this new market environment.
On the demand side, statistics continue to point to a bunching of demand during the second half, exactly what we had highlighted on the last earnings call. Canpotex has announced that it is sold out for the rest of the year. Its second half shipments are expected to top the 2014 record. We also project that second half North American shipments will rank as the second-highest during the last 5 years.
As you can see on the slide, North American producer inventories are shrinking rapidly as a result of not only this demand surge, but also production cutbacks during the first half, normal summer turnarounds and the temporary closure of our Colonsay facility.
Current momentum is expected to carry over into next year. We project that global MOP shipments will climb to 61 million to 63 million tonnes in 2017, with a current point estimate of around 62 million. That computes to a 4% or 2.5 million tonne jump in shipments from our 2016 estimate of just less than 60 million.
The projected increase is driven by continued solid on-farm demand and leaner channel inventories worldwide. Thus, shipments are expected to more closely approximate use next year. All of the big 6 consuming regions are forecast to post gains in 2017. 
In the case of phosphates, the DAP margin turned up during the third quarter as a result of improved fundamentals. The benchmark increased, but the sharp drop in raw material cost resulted in stable or only moderately higher prices in most regions, and that is helping to fuel broad-based demand growth. We estimate that global shipments will increase by 800,000 tonnes to 65 million to 66 million tonnes this year. 
China and India remain drags on growth, but gains from all corners of the globe are projected to more than make up the shortfall in the 2 largest phosphate-consuming countries. In addition to increases in the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Pakistan, the former Soviet Union and Africa are expected to post solid gains this year. 
Just like potash, several supply-side changes are taking place. China year-to-date exports through September are down 29% or 2.4 million tonnes from last year. We project that exports will drop from a record 11.6 million tonnes in 2015 to about 8.6 million tonnes this year. 
A restructuring of the Chinese industry is widely expected, with publicly announced plans to close outdated plants with capacity of 3.0 million tonnes of phosphate capacity by the end of this decade. That is the equivalent to 12% of industry capacity or 6.5 million tonnes of DAP, roughly the amount of new capacity expected to start up in Morocco and Saudi Arabia during the next year or 2.
Looking ahead to 2017, we forecast that global shipments will increase by approximately 2.5% to 66 million to 68 million tonnes. China and India are expected to register modest gains next year, and continued growth is projected for most other regions, especially the Americas.
Finally, we do expect a typical seasonal slowdown late fourth quarter and early first quarter. And 2 key factors we are continuing to watch closely are Chinese exports and the pace of new capacity ramp-up. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Rich Mack."

As Mike's assessment indicates, we expect the recent potash price and phosphate margin to remain fairly stable, seasonality aside. We also expect demand to remain strong and limited additional price appreciation in the near term. 
Mosaic's performance for the quarter reflects the incrementally improved market environment, but it also reflects the resilience we've built into our business. We are maintaining our focus on the long term and controlling the things we can control, most notably our execution, our operational costs and our capital.
For the quarter, we reported earnings per diluted share of $0.11, which included a negative $0.30 impact from notable items that brought adjusted earnings per share to $0.41. Earnings also included a benefit of $0.08 per share from adjusting the full year effective tax rate accrual.
Our cost reduction efforts are evident in the bottom line across our segments. You can see that we are achieving meaningful cost savings. And keep in mind that we made 2 acquisitions over this period. Our SG&A today is lower than it was before those acquisitions, and in fact, third quarter SG&A is the lowest in the last 9 years. We continue to be on track to meet our combined expense reduction goals of $575 million by 2018.
We are demonstrating similar discipline with respect to our capital. We are continuing key strategic projects, and we are investing to ensure the safety of our employees as well as the mechanical integrity of our assets. As part of our strategic planning process, we took a very critical look at our CapEx requirements over the next 5 years. We are considering every capital decision very carefully. And as a result, we expect CapEx to come down meaningfully after 2017 to a level of approximately $800 million per year, down from earlier expectations of approximately $1.2 billion.
With meaningful changes to our 5-year capital program and significantly reduced operating costs, as well as expectations of an improving environment, we have maintained our dividend, which we will continue to review as market conditions evolve.
We have also changed our target leverage range, now at 2.0 to 2.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. We are also in the process of upsizing our revolving line of credit from $1.5 billion to $2 billion, maintaining our targeted liquidity at $2.5 billion. Going forward, we will continue to assess our cash generation and cash uses in light of our firm commitment to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating.
Now I'd like to provide a brief review of our results and our expectations for each segment. In Potash, our sales volumes for the third quarter came in slightly above the top end of our guidance range at 2.2 million tonnes. The volumes reflect the pent-up demand that came to fruition during the quarter, which in turn drew down producer and channel inventories. Prices responded accordingly, though they remain low compared with a year ago and earlier periods.
In the fourth quarter, we continue to expect positive pricing trends, and our guidance is $160 to $175 per tonne. With our volume expectations in the fourth quarter of 1.9 million to 2.1 million tonnes, we believe the second half reflects the strong bunching of demand we talked about earlier this year. The narrower-than-normal ranges reflect Mosaic's essentially sold-out position for the fourth quarter.
Our Potash gross margin rate for the quarter was 9%, above our guidance despite an operating rate in the low 60% range and prices at the low end of our guidance range. The improvement reflects the benefits of our ongoing and aggressive work to reduce costs and optimize our operations.
We expect fourth quarter margins to improve further with tailwinds from higher prices, higher operating rates to meet demand and continued cost reduction efforts. We also will be expensing some turnaround work during the quarter and expect our gross margin rate to be in the mid-teens. Our margin rate guidance also incorporates further weakness in K-Mag prices, reflective of the softer SOP market dynamics.
Moving on to Phosphates. Our business performed as expected. The Phosphate gross margin rate continued to expand as raw material cost reductions benefited our cost of goods sold and with rock costs returning to more normal levels. Blended costs of rock declined to $60 per tonne during the quarter. 
Going forward, we expect slightly more variability in quarterly rock cost than in years past. However, our teams have done an outstanding job of mitigating some of the issues we encountered in the second quarter, and our goal is to maintain rock cost at or near current levels.
Our average Phosphates realized price and shipment volumes were in the middle of our guidance range, with strong global demand persisting and with prices stabilizing despite falling raw material costs.
As Mike said, the fourth quarter is seasonally slower, but we expect volumes to remain fairly robust at 2.1 million to 2.4 million tonnes, and DAP prices to seasonally weaken to a range of $300 to $330 per tonne. We expect relatively stable margins, with a gross margin rate in the upper single digits, as lower input costs largely offset expected weakness in realized prices. We plan to run our Phosphates facilities at approximately 85% of capacity.
Before I leave Phosphates, I'd like to briefly discuss our ammonia contract with CF Industries. As you know, the contract, which begins in 2017, allowed us to forgo the construction of a $1.2 billion ammonia manufacturing plant. We've worked with CF to align on the logistics, and we expect our barge to be completed in mid-2017. Given the long-term nature of the contract, the impact to our P&L will fluctuate based on nitrogen production economics. We fully expect there will be times we'll be benefiting from it and times that we will not.
Moving on now to International Distribution, which was a bright spot during the quarter. Excellent farm economics in Brazil drove strong demand and improving prices. In addition, our unique position allowed us to capitalize on improving pricing trends, with a meaningful improvement in International Distribution segment operating earnings. Gross margin per tonne came in well ahead of expectations as a result of higher volumes and higher per tonne margins of MicroEssentials, as well as better fixed cost absorption.
As a reference point, sales of MicroEssentials in Brazil are up over 70% year-to-date. With a more stable operating environment in Brazil, we expect gross margins to be around $20 per tonne and volumes to be in the range of 1.7 million to 1.9 million tonnes during the fourth quarter. As in Potash, the narrower-than-normal volume range reflects Mosaic's sold-out position for the fourth quarter.
Finally, the effective tax rate in the quarter was negative. The provision for income taxes in the third quarter included a $28 million benefit related to the expected reduction of the full year effective tax rate. The low effective tax rate is a function of tax deductions that remain fairly constant, primarily depletion, combined with a currently low taxable income. In the near term and in 2017, we expect more variability in our effective tax rate. Our other full year guidance numbers can be seen on the slide.
To summarize, we are seeing incremental improvements in the business climate, but we are continuing to plan for whatever the markets may bring. Mosaic has the financial strength and management discipline to adapt and take advantage of opportunities as conditions change.
With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Joc for his closing thoughts and to moderate our Q&A session. Joc?"

Before we move on, I would like to address the situation at our New Wales Phosphate facility in Florida. As you probably know, a sinkhole developed in one cell of a gyp stack on the site, resulting in the loss of process water that was atop that portion of the stack. This is an unfortunate situation, but I would like to commend the excellent around-the-clock work our teams in Florida are performing to resolve it. 
The key points for investors to understand are, first and foremost, we have performed over 1,000 well tests, and we have not identified any offset impacts from the water loss. Collection wells are retaining the water, and we are pumping that water back up to another area of the gyp stack. We have done and will continue to do extensive water testing around the site, and we do not expect that there will be any off-site impact.
Second, phosphate production at New Wales has not been impacted, and we do not anticipate any impacts. 
And third, based on the work we completed so far and the consent order reached with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, we are comfortable that the cost to repair the sinkhole will be manageable.
Now to summarize our thoughts on the quarter and the business environment. Agricultural commodity fundamentals, including fertilizer fundamentals, are improving, albeit slowly, and Mosaic is benefiting from those improvements.
Just as important, our work to reduce cost is driving better results now. And we are going to maintain this focus as conditions improve so that we can outperform across the cycle. And we are maintaining our solid financial foundation by managing our liquidity and capital spending carefully. Mosaic is performing well, and we remain in an excellent position to thrive as conditions continue to improve.
Now we would be happy to take your questions."

First, on the leverage ratio, the way that we currently look at it is we're adapting our balance sheet philosophy, our capital management philosophy, to the current market environment. And if you go back and you look at history, this is really a vestige of the years after the Cargill split-off transaction. We first rolled out our capital management philosophy in 2013, and it hasn't meaningfully changed since that point in time. Where we're at right now, we're not changing our overall liquidity buffer. We're keeping that at $2.5 billion. We're simply changing the mix of that by upsizing our revolver from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. And as you noted, we're moving our target leverage ratio from 2 to 2.5x. And I think it's important to note that we take a look at that on a through-cycle basis. We're a cyclical industry, and there are going to be times where we're going to be over it and there are times where we're going to be under it. I think it's all guided by the guidepost of a strong investment-grade credit rating. And we believe that the ratios and the liquidity buffer that we have articulated will meet just that. And then moving on to your second question on the dividend. Obviously, a topical issue in the environment that we're in right now. Obviously, it's something that we continue to monitor very closely. As you've seen in our results, we've aggressively and proactively reduced our spend both in capital and in operating costs. Earlier this year, we indicated that the second half was going to be better than the first half, and we're starting to see that, particularly in the Potash business and also with the good results in our ID business this quarter. And with the $2.5 billion, we certainly have ample liquidity and we can use this for a short period of time, but it's not something that you would use for a long period to cover your dividend. So what I would simply say in summary is that this is something that we're going to continue to watch. It will be dependent on where the market goes, and it's going to be dependent on the tradeoffs between capital, operating expenses and cash available for dividends."

But a great lead-in for, I think, what is a great story, which is our MicroEssentials story. First of all, yes, we did increase capacity. If you'll remember, we spent $250 million to increase the capacity of MicroEssentials at our New Wales plant. That largely got completed at the end of the second quarter. So it's only been a very short period of time we've had new capacity available. In North America, our shipments of MicroEssentials will be up, although the growth rate of MicroEssentials in North America are still fairly low or now slowing down. However, in Brazil, where we have what we believe to be a great market opportunity with our own distribution business and the acquisition of the ADM business, this year alone, we've seen a 60% increase in MicroEssentials sale. And that's all due to higher availability. So with where we're sitting, I think this is a great story and one that will continue with the new capacity. And sorry, I think I might have said Rich's name, but I will hand it to Rick to give us more detail, Rick McLellan."

You're correct that we've seen some slippage in phosphate rock prices. As you probably know, rock is transacted a little bit differently than the finished products, in that if you're running a plant that's not integrated and relies on rock, you typically contract for a period of time. So as fundamentals change, there is a lag in terms of when rock prices adjust. That said, we haven't seen a draconian drop in rock prices. I think in terms of the structure of that market, rock prices have held up reasonably well in the current environment. With respect to how that plays into the stripping margin, our stripping margin is calculated based on a finished phosphate price DAP plus the cost of ammonia and sulfur, so it doesn't come into play in terms of the stripping margin that you might see coming from us. And I think as we've indicated earlier, our actual rock costs have varied a little bit over time but remain fairly constant in terms of trend costs."

And I think what's exciting, and I think there's a very good and underappreciated story in potash shaping out for 2017: We are finally going to see, I think, growth in global potash shipments next year to the tune of 2.5 million tonnes or so due to the fact that we can't live off the pipeline anymore. And secondly, we've seen some very significant adjustments on the supply side, with -- in North America alone, about 2.25 million tonnes of capacity get permanently closed.

As you saw from the statistics, if you look at year-to-date exports out of China, they're down 29%. It's 2.4 million tonnes. We think that is clearly on track for our projection for quite a while here that we'd see about a 3 million tonne drop. I think, just to kind of look at the big picture of phosphate, we see a very constructive longer-term outlook, but there are some uncertainties in the near term. And I think one of those is how quickly we see restructuring take place in China. When you look at global phosphate shipments, they really have flattened a bit. And they flattened due largely to declines that have taken place in China and India. And fortunately, all of those declines have been offset by gains in other parts of the world. But the fact that we've seen declines in China and India has really hit the Chinese industry very hard. And as a consequence, we've seen Asian prices in particular get hit. And as a result, I think that will accelerate the restructuring taking place. And with respect to the industry cost curve, as you know, the Chinese industry is a very heterogeneous industry. There are high-cost players that we think will get driven out. And as we've indicated, the Chinese make no bones about the fact that they, too, believe that restructuring is needed. And I guess the bottom line is, when we look ahead, we see decent demand growth of 2%, 2.5% per year. And if you look at shipments of 65 million tonnes, 2% growth is 1.3 million tonnes per year. Over 5 years, it's 6.5 million tonnes, which is roughly equal to the additional capacity coming on in Morocco and Saudi Arabia. So we think that, that will happen. And in China, we would expect that there will be restructuring. And at the end of this decade, China will be operating a smaller, more efficient and a bit more competitive industry. So I guess a long-winded answer that we do see a very constructive long-term outlook for phosphate. And in the near term, a few adjustments that, I think, the market will go through to set itself up for a very good medium-term outlook."

And then as the cycle continues to turn in 2018 and later, a normalized level for us would be approximately 20%."

As we go forward, I think there's a great opportunity for India to try to address the imbalance between nitrogen phosphate and potash use. And I think what they've done so far with the subsidy is conducive to trying to achieve a better balance. So I wouldn't see any major change in that.

Thank you for joining our Third Quarter Earnings Call. This morning, I will give you an overview of our results, then Mike Rahm will discuss market conditions before Rich Mack takes you through some details on our performance for the quarter. I will have some final thoughts before we take your questions.
The key concepts that we want you to understand from this call are: First, we anticipated improvements in the business in the second half of the year, and those improvements have begun to materialize. We continue to maintain a constructive outlook for the industry. 
Second, the actions we've taken to lower costs and optimize assets, combined with our scale and secure market access, positioned us to maximize the benefits of improving market dynamics. 
And third, our Brazil-centered growth strategy is clearly paying off. Our investment in MicroEssentials capacity expansion and the acquisition of ADM's distribution business came together to allow our International Distribution business to meaningfully exceed expectations this quarter.
Now let's discuss the markets. Mike?"
890498,404682029,1364466,"The Mosaic Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","The Mosaic Company","Executives","Thanks, Joc, and good morning, everyone.

Let's start with potash. Three positive developments are taking place in the global potash market. One, on-farm demand remained solid worldwide. Two, large channel inventories are getting worked down. And three, producers are optimizing operations in order to meet demand and compete profitably in this new market environment.
On the demand side, statistics continue to point to a bunching of demand during the second half, exactly what we had highlighted on the last earnings call. Canpotex has announced that it is sold out for the rest of the year. Its second half shipments are expected to top the 2014 record. We also project that second half North American shipments will rank as the second-highest during the last 5 years.
As you can see on the slide, North American producer inventories are shrinking rapidly as a result of not only this demand surge, but also production cutbacks during the first half, normal summer turnarounds and the temporary closure of our Colonsay facility.
Current momentum is expected to carry over into next year. We project that global MOP shipments will climb to 61 million to 63 million tonnes in 2017, with a current point estimate of around 62 million. That computes to a 4% or 2.5 million tonne jump in shipments from our 2016 estimate of just less than 60 million.
The projected increase is driven by continued solid on-farm demand and leaner channel inventories worldwide. Thus, shipments are expected to more closely approximate use next year. All of the big 6 consuming regions are forecast to post gains in 2017. 
In the case of phosphates, the DAP margin turned up during the third quarter as a result of improved fundamentals. The benchmark increased, but the sharp drop in raw material cost resulted in stable or only moderately higher prices in most regions, and that is helping to fuel broad-based demand growth. We estimate that global shipments will increase by 800,000 tonnes to 65 million to 66 million tonnes this year. 
China and India remain drags on growth, but gains from all corners of the globe are projected to more than make up the shortfall in the 2 largest phosphate-consuming countries. In addition to increases in the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Pakistan, the former Soviet Union and Africa are expected to post solid gains this year. 
Just like potash, several supply-side changes are taking place. China year-to-date exports through September are down 29% or 2.4 million tonnes from last year. We project that exports will drop from a record 11.6 million tonnes in 2015 to about 8.6 million tonnes this year. 
A restructuring of the Chinese industry is widely expected, with publicly announced plans to close outdated plants with capacity of 3.0 million tonnes of phosphate capacity by the end of this decade. That is the equivalent to 12% of industry capacity or 6.5 million tonnes of DAP, roughly the amount of new capacity expected to start up in Morocco and Saudi Arabia during the next year or 2.
Looking ahead to 2017, we forecast that global shipments will increase by approximately 2.5% to 66 million to 68 million tonnes. China and India are expected to register modest gains next year, and continued growth is projected for most other regions, especially the Americas.
Finally, we do expect a typical seasonal slowdown late fourth quarter and early first quarter. And 2 key factors we are continuing to watch closely are Chinese exports and the pace of new capacity ramp-up. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Rich Mack."

As Mike's assessment indicates, we expect the recent potash price and phosphate margin to remain fairly stable, seasonality aside. We also expect demand to remain strong and limited additional price appreciation in the near term. 
Mosaic's performance for the quarter reflects the incrementally improved market environment, but it also reflects the resilience we've built into our business. We are maintaining our focus on the long term and controlling the things we can control, most notably our execution, our operational costs and our capital.
For the quarter, we reported earnings per diluted share of $0.11, which included a negative $0.30 impact from notable items that brought adjusted earnings per share to $0.41. Earnings also included a benefit of $0.08 per share from adjusting the full year effective tax rate accrual.
Our cost reduction efforts are evident in the bottom line across our segments. You can see that we are achieving meaningful cost savings. And keep in mind that we made 2 acquisitions over this period. Our SG&A today is lower than it was before those acquisitions, and in fact, third quarter SG&A is the lowest in the last 9 years. We continue to be on track to meet our combined expense reduction goals of $575 million by 2018.
We are demonstrating similar discipline with respect to our capital. We are continuing key strategic projects, and we are investing to ensure the safety of our employees as well as the mechanical integrity of our assets. As part of our strategic planning process, we took a very critical look at our CapEx requirements over the next 5 years. We are considering every capital decision very carefully. And as a result, we expect CapEx to come down meaningfully after 2017 to a level of approximately $800 million per year, down from earlier expectations of approximately $1.2 billion.
With meaningful changes to our 5-year capital program and significantly reduced operating costs, as well as expectations of an improving environment, we have maintained our dividend, which we will continue to review as market conditions evolve.
We have also changed our target leverage range, now at 2.0 to 2.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. We are also in the process of upsizing our revolving line of credit from $1.5 billion to $2 billion, maintaining our targeted liquidity at $2.5 billion. Going forward, we will continue to assess our cash generation and cash uses in light of our firm commitment to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating.
Now I'd like to provide a brief review of our results and our expectations for each segment. In Potash, our sales volumes for the third quarter came in slightly above the top end of our guidance range at 2.2 million tonnes. The volumes reflect the pent-up demand that came to fruition during the quarter, which in turn drew down producer and channel inventories. Prices responded accordingly, though they remain low compared with a year ago and earlier periods.
In the fourth quarter, we continue to expect positive pricing trends, and our guidance is $160 to $175 per tonne. With our volume expectations in the fourth quarter of 1.9 million to 2.1 million tonnes, we believe the second half reflects the strong bunching of demand we talked about earlier this year. The narrower-than-normal ranges reflect Mosaic's essentially sold-out position for the fourth quarter.
Our Potash gross margin rate for the quarter was 9%, above our guidance despite an operating rate in the low 60% range and prices at the low end of our guidance range. The improvement reflects the benefits of our ongoing and aggressive work to reduce costs and optimize our operations.
We expect fourth quarter margins to improve further with tailwinds from higher prices, higher operating rates to meet demand and continued cost reduction efforts. We also will be expensing some turnaround work during the quarter and expect our gross margin rate to be in the mid-teens. Our margin rate guidance also incorporates further weakness in K-Mag prices, reflective of the softer SOP market dynamics.
Moving on to Phosphates. Our business performed as expected. The Phosphate gross margin rate continued to expand as raw material cost reductions benefited our cost of goods sold and with rock costs returning to more normal levels. Blended costs of rock declined to $60 per tonne during the quarter. 
Going forward, we expect slightly more variability in quarterly rock cost than in years past. However, our teams have done an outstanding job of mitigating some of the issues we encountered in the second quarter, and our goal is to maintain rock cost at or near current levels.
Our average Phosphates realized price and shipment volumes were in the middle of our guidance range, with strong global demand persisting and with prices stabilizing despite falling raw material costs.
As Mike said, the fourth quarter is seasonally slower, but we expect volumes to remain fairly robust at 2.1 million to 2.4 million tonnes, and DAP prices to seasonally weaken to a range of $300 to $330 per tonne. We expect relatively stable margins, with a gross margin rate in the upper single digits, as lower input costs largely offset expected weakness in realized prices. We plan to run our Phosphates facilities at approximately 85% of capacity.
Before I leave Phosphates, I'd like to briefly discuss our ammonia contract with CF Industries. As you know, the contract, which begins in 2017, allowed us to forgo the construction of a $1.2 billion ammonia manufacturing plant. We've worked with CF to align on the logistics, and we expect our barge to be completed in mid-2017. Given the long-term nature of the contract, the impact to our P&L will fluctuate based on nitrogen production economics. We fully expect there will be times we'll be benefiting from it and times that we will not.
Moving on now to International Distribution, which was a bright spot during the quarter. Excellent farm economics in Brazil drove strong demand and improving prices. In addition, our unique position allowed us to capitalize on improving pricing trends, with a meaningful improvement in International Distribution segment operating earnings. Gross margin per tonne came in well ahead of expectations as a result of higher volumes and higher per tonne margins of MicroEssentials, as well as better fixed cost absorption.
As a reference point, sales of MicroEssentials in Brazil are up over 70% year-to-date. With a more stable operating environment in Brazil, we expect gross margins to be around $20 per tonne and volumes to be in the range of 1.7 million to 1.9 million tonnes during the fourth quarter. As in Potash, the narrower-than-normal volume range reflects Mosaic's sold-out position for the fourth quarter.
Finally, the effective tax rate in the quarter was negative. The provision for income taxes in the third quarter included a $28 million benefit related to the expected reduction of the full year effective tax rate. The low effective tax rate is a function of tax deductions that remain fairly constant, primarily depletion, combined with a currently low taxable income. In the near term and in 2017, we expect more variability in our effective tax rate. Our other full year guidance numbers can be seen on the slide.
To summarize, we are seeing incremental improvements in the business climate, but we are continuing to plan for whatever the markets may bring. Mosaic has the financial strength and management discipline to adapt and take advantage of opportunities as conditions change.
With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Joc for his closing thoughts and to moderate our Q&A session. Joc?"

Before we move on, I would like to address the situation at our New Wales Phosphate facility in Florida. As you probably know, a sinkhole developed in one cell of a gyp stack on the site, resulting in the loss of process water that was atop that portion of the stack. This is an unfortunate situation, but I would like to commend the excellent around-the-clock work our teams in Florida are performing to resolve it. 
The key points for investors to understand are, first and foremost, we have performed over 1,000 well tests, and we have not identified any offset impacts from the water loss. Collection wells are retaining the water, and we are pumping that water back up to another area of the gyp stack. We have done and will continue to do extensive water testing around the site, and we do not expect that there will be any off-site impact.
Second, phosphate production at New Wales has not been impacted, and we do not anticipate any impacts. 
And third, based on the work we completed so far and the consent order reached with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, we are comfortable that the cost to repair the sinkhole will be manageable.
Now to summarize our thoughts on the quarter and the business environment. Agricultural commodity fundamentals, including fertilizer fundamentals, are improving, albeit slowly, and Mosaic is benefiting from those improvements.
Just as important, our work to reduce cost is driving better results now. And we are going to maintain this focus as conditions improve so that we can outperform across the cycle. And we are maintaining our solid financial foundation by managing our liquidity and capital spending carefully. Mosaic is performing well, and we remain in an excellent position to thrive as conditions continue to improve.
Now we would be happy to take your questions."

So I'm going to hand most of this over to Rich, but let me just reemphasize: We do take a conservative view with respect to our balance sheet. But also, we don't take a 1-quarter view with respect to any of this. And I want to highlight that while the operating cash flow was relatively low this month -- this quarter at $96 million, if you take it over 2 quarters, we were $679 million over 2 quarters, which was down only 14% from last year. So while we do have capital still required, we're generating good cash flows. And of course, we will continue to assess how those 2 fit together. Rich, do you want to talk a little more about our CapEx?"

First, on the leverage ratio, the way that we currently look at it is we're adapting our balance sheet philosophy, our capital management philosophy, to the current market environment. And if you go back and you look at history, this is really a vestige of the years after the Cargill split-off transaction. We first rolled out our capital management philosophy in 2013, and it hasn't meaningfully changed since that point in time. Where we're at right now, we're not changing our overall liquidity buffer. We're keeping that at $2.5 billion. We're simply changing the mix of that by upsizing our revolver from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. And as you noted, we're moving our target leverage ratio from 2 to 2.5x. And I think it's important to note that we take a look at that on a through-cycle basis. We're a cyclical industry, and there are going to be times where we're going to be over it and there are times where we're going to be under it. I think it's all guided by the guidepost of a strong investment-grade credit rating. And we believe that the ratios and the liquidity buffer that we have articulated will meet just that. And then moving on to your second question on the dividend. Obviously, a topical issue in the environment that we're in right now. Obviously, it's something that we continue to monitor very closely. As you've seen in our results, we've aggressively and proactively reduced our spend both in capital and in operating costs. Earlier this year, we indicated that the second half was going to be better than the first half, and we're starting to see that, particularly in the Potash business and also with the good results in our ID business this quarter. And with the $2.5 billion, we certainly have ample liquidity and we can use this for a short period of time, but it's not something that you would use for a long period to cover your dividend. So what I would simply say in summary is that this is something that we're going to continue to watch. It will be dependent on where the market goes, and it's going to be dependent on the tradeoffs between capital, operating expenses and cash available for dividends."

So it's only been a very short period of time we've had new capacity available. In North America, our shipments of MicroEssentials will be up, although the growth rate of MicroEssentials in North America are still fairly low or now slowing down. However, in Brazil, where we have what we believe to be a great market opportunity with our own distribution business and the acquisition of the ADM business, this year alone, we've seen a 60% increase in MicroEssentials sale. And that's all due to higher availability. So with where we're sitting, I think this is a great story and one that will continue with the new capacity.

You're correct that we've seen some slippage in phosphate rock prices. As you probably know, rock is transacted a little bit differently than the finished products, in that if you're running a plant that's not integrated and relies on rock, you typically contract for a period of time. So as fundamentals change, there is a lag in terms of when rock prices adjust. That said, we haven't seen a draconian drop in rock prices. I think in terms of the structure of that market, rock prices have held up reasonably well in the current environment. With respect to how that plays into the stripping margin, our stripping margin is calculated based on a finished phosphate price DAP plus the cost of ammonia and sulfur, so it doesn't come into play in terms of the stripping margin that you might see coming from us. And I think as we've indicated earlier, our actual rock costs have varied a little bit over time but remain fairly constant in terms of trend costs."

It's taken a couple of years to work that down. And I think what's exciting, and I think there's a very good and underappreciated story in potash shaping out for 2017: We are finally going to see, I think, growth in global potash shipments next year to the tune of 2.5 million tonnes or so due to the fact that we can't live off the pipeline anymore. And secondly, we've seen some very significant adjustments on the supply side, with -- in North America alone, about 2.25 million tonnes of capacity get permanently closed. So you add that all together. And I think the projected producer inventories that we're showing for North America are probably similar for most producers around the globe.

And the difference between the upper end, the $50 million, and the $60 million was more testing and water treatment for a longer period of time than was originally anticipated. And just to be clear, I think this is a reserve. This is not an outflow at this stage. This is a reserve that will cover the cost over the next 14 to 20 months, so it's not a cost to date.

It's a good question and something that we're watching very carefully. As you saw from the statistics, if you look at year-to-date exports out of China, they're down 29%. It's 2.4 million tonnes.

As you saw from the statistics, if you look at year-to-date exports out of China, they're down 29%. It's 2.4 million tonnes. We think that is clearly on track for our projection for quite a while here that we'd see about a 3 million tonne drop. I think, just to kind of look at the big picture of phosphate, we see a very constructive longer-term outlook, but there are some uncertainties in the near term. And I think one of those is how quickly we see restructuring take place in China. When you look at global phosphate shipments, they really have flattened a bit. And they flattened due largely to declines that have taken place in China and India. And fortunately, all of those declines have been offset by gains in other parts of the world. But the fact that we've seen declines in China and India has really hit the Chinese industry very hard. And as a consequence, we've seen Asian prices in particular get hit. And as a result, I think that will accelerate the restructuring taking place. And with respect to the industry cost curve, as you know, the Chinese industry is a very heterogeneous industry. There are high-cost players that we think will get driven out. And as we've indicated, the Chinese make no bones about the fact that they, too, believe that restructuring is needed. And I guess the bottom line is, when we look ahead, we see decent demand growth of 2%, 2.5% per year. And if you look at shipments of 65 million tonnes, 2% growth is 1.3 million tonnes per year. Over 5 years, it's 6.5 million tonnes, which is roughly equal to the additional capacity coming on in Morocco and Saudi Arabia. So we think that, that will happen. And in China, we would expect that there will be restructuring. And at the end of this decade, China will be operating a smaller, more efficient and a bit more competitive industry. So I guess a long-winded answer that we do see a very constructive long-term outlook for phosphate. And in the near term, a few adjustments that, I think, the market will go through to set itself up for a very good medium-term outlook."

It's very unfortunate. And our goal is to make it right. We take it very seriously, and we will make the -- make it as per before. We will treat the water and we will spend the money that it requires to do a great job at that. That's our social commitment."

So we wouldn't see any incremental capital beyond what you've heard earlier today. You asked a question about taxes in 2017. I think that taxes, at least in the short term, with a lower level of profitability because of just simply the lower pricing environment you have for phosphate and potash, you should expect that in 2017, a good proxy for our effective tax rate would be around 10%. And then as the cycle continues to turn in 2018 and later, a normalized level for us would be approximately 20%."

Let me start by acknowledging the obvious. Industry phosphate and potash margins have declined significantly as evidenced in our earnings so far this year as well as our third quarter guidance. The drivers of the downturn range from a collaps",962,"Thanks, Joc. Let me start by acknowledging the obvious. Industry phosphate and potash margins have declined significantly as evidenced in our earnings so far this year as well as our third quarter guidance. The drivers of the downturn range from a collapse of key phosphate and potash currencies to the deferral of demand this year to elevate the channel inventories, to the startup or even the expectation of the startup of new capacity. 
Buyer sentiment remains cautious for several reasons, such as volatile crop prices and exchange rate uncertainties. But we do think the global supply and demand balance is not as far out of kilter as current prices indicate. More importantly, low prices are causing material adjustments on both the supply and demand side of the ledger. High-cost production is moving off-line and demand is accelerating, especially in key growth markets.
On the demand side, prospects remain solid. In fact, we have not changed our P&K shipment guidance for 2016. We still project that global phosphate shipments will total 65 million to 66 million tonnes this year and global MOP shipments will total 59 million to 60 million tonnes despite the long delays in settling contracts with Chinese and Indian buyers. 
Furthermore, we see a high likelihood of seasonal bunching of demand for both P&K in the second half of the year. Our first look at 2017 indicates that phosphate shipments are forecast to climb to 66 million to 68 million tonnes and global MOP shipments are projected to increase to 61 million to 63 million tonnes next year. 
Several economic and agronomic factors underpin this constructive outlook. First, plant nutrients remain affordable despite lower and volatile crop prices. In fact, our affordability metric at the end of July indicated that plant nutrients were 21% more affordable than the average since 2010. It is worth noting that our affordability metric is calculated using only corn, soybean and wheat prices, and crop prices are not moving in lockstep. Corn, soybean and wheat prices have fallen, while other prices, including sugar, cotton and coffee, have increased significantly this year.
Second, shipment prospects are bolstered by the pull down of channel inventory so far this year, especially throughout the Americas. Our sales team tells us that channel inventories are thin, heading into what is expected to be another very good fall application season in North America. 
In Brazil, the most recent statistics show that phosphate and potash inventories throughout the distribution channel shrunk nearly 600,000 tonnes and almost 200,000 tonnes, respectively, during the first half of this year. 
Third, Brazilian demand forecasts just keep getting revised higher and higher despite the chaotic political backdrop, a volatile exchange rate and tight farm credit. That is not a surprise, given record-high local currency prices for soybeans, corn, sugar, cotton and coffee. Based on record first half shipments, our team now projects that total fertilizer shipments will top 32 million tonnes this year, up 10% from forecast just 6 months ago. Shipments this year could best the previous high mark of 32.2 million in 2014.
Fourth, demand in India looks to be back on a solid growth trajectory. The monsoon is delivering above-average rainfall across nearly all of the country for the first time in 3 years. In addition, the combination of lower international prices, modest cuts in subsidies and the relatively stable rupee has resulted in declines in retail DAP and MOP prices of roughly 15% and 30%, respectively, and sets the stage for strong P&K use.
Demand prospects in other Latin American and Asian countries, such as Argentina and Pakistan, remained positive. Furthermore, significant demand is emerging from other regions, such as the former Soviet Union and Africa that are not necessarily on most radar screens. On the supply side of the ledger, several adjustments have occurred and more are under way today. In the case of phosphate, China has shuttered capacity, as evidenced by the 1.5 million-tonne decline in DAP, MAP and TSP exports during the first half of this year. Restructuring of China's large phosphate sector is beginning to take place, and plans outlined at the National Phosphate and Compound Fertilizer Industry Association's annual conference in May called for the permanent closure of outdated facilities with capacity of 3 million tonnes of P205 or the equivalent of 6.5 million tonnes of DAP by the end of this decade.
In the case of potash, large producers continue to optimize operations by idling or shutting down higher-cost facilities and maximizing operating rates at lower-cost facilities in order to compete with produces who have benefited from the collapse of their currencies. For example, all of the North American facilities that were at the right end of every estimate of the industry cost curve have closed. The closure of 6 North American mines has resulted in a net loss of 2.25 million tonnes of capacity.
Finally, foreign exchange tailwinds are beginning to diminish for some producers. Currencies like the ruble are recovering along with the price of oil. Inflation, as expected, is picking up in these countries, and most importantly, P&K prices have come down significantly. 
In our view, the large drop in potash prices is more the result of the collapse of key potash currencies rather than a surge of new capacity. This is an important part of our thesis that fundamentals are in better balance than current P&K prices would indicate. 
In summary, adjustments are taking place in response to low prices and margins. Demand is beginning to accelerate and high-cost capacity is shutting down. As a result, we project relatively stable global phosphate and potash operating rates through the rest of this decade. While we're not widely bullish, we see some positive developments that market seem to be ignoring or discounting for now. Joc?"

Second, on our last earnings call, we told you that we are targeting an additional $75 million in savings in our support functions. With the actions we took in June, we are well on our way to achieving that goal.
Third, we're continuing to optimize our assets so that we can produce enough crop nutrients to meet our customers' demand, while reducing our cost per tonne.
With the decision to idle our Colonsay potash mine for the remainder of 2016, we will be able to meet market demands with our lower-cost Bell Plaine and Esterhazy mines as well as our existing potash inventory.
And fourth, we're managing our capital carefully without starving our operations or risking employees' safety. We are deferring or permanently eliminating capital spending when and where we can. All of these decisions have reduced our cost. Our MOP cash production cost per tonne came in this quarter at $98 per tonne, which included $21 per tonne of brine management cost. For the first half of 2016, our MOP cash cost came in at $93 per tonne, which is $74 of direct production costs and $19 per tonne of brine management cost. This was comparable to last year despite a much lower operating rate. It is important to highlight that every big producer has its own cost curve, mine by mine, and you can see ours on the slide.
When we run our Esterhazy and Belle Plaine mines at optimal rates, as we intend to do in the second half of 2016, with Colonsay down, we can achieve significantly lower cost. Esterhazy is capable of achieving direct production cash cost per tonne close to $50 when we eliminate brine management cost in the mid-2020s, and Belle Plaine can produce at approximately $70 per tonne.
As a reminder, we look at our cost excluding brine expenses because brine management is largely a fixed cost. As you know, we have a plan to eliminate brine expenses over time. Our costs are also well controlled in phosphate even with lower operating rates. 
So we are making good progress, but we're not conserving cash just to weather the market storm. We are mindful that opportunities arise at the low points of the cycle and especially when the low point lasts longer than usual. Of course, we will maintain our strategic discipline as we consider potential opportunities. 
In total, yes, the business environment is challenging, but we believe in the bright future of this industry and of Mosaic. We are managing aggressively to ensure the company's competitiveness for now and for better markets. It is in times like this that management can make a real difference. 
Now before we take your questions, I'll ask Rich Mack to provide a bit more detail on the quarter as well as our guidance."

No doubt, our markets are challenging right now, with prices failing to rise even with strong global demand. That said, though, we do expect conditions to improve in the second half of the year.
Mosaic has the ability to withstand challenging conditions longer if necessary and to thrive as market prices improve. As a reminder, Mosaic has a $2.5 billion liquidity buffer, which remains untapped, so we continue to have ample financial flexibility even during this down part of the cycle. 
The notable items this quarter, which netted out to a negative $37 million or $0.09 a share, included $69 million in after-tax charges that reflect our deliberate focus on reducing spend and preserving cash. We recorded charges for severance, the write-down of the initial construction of a second ammonia barge and for our share of the decision not to pursue a Canpotex port project at Prince Rupert. 
Now I'd like to provide a brief review of our results and our expectations for each segment.
In potash, our sales volumes for the second quarter were within our guidance range, which anticipated a lack of shipments to India and China. Prices fell further during the quarter, with Mosaic recording an average realized price of $178 per tonne. With the uncertainty in China and India now resolved, we expect that the pricing floor is now established, with the third quarter potash prices to be in the range of $160 to $175 per tonne, which reflects a heavier mix of lower-priced exports sales.
As Joc noted, the Colonsay shutdown will be to a lower operating rate of around 65%. Notwithstanding Colonsay, however, we are maintaining our annual sales guidance of 7.5 million to 8.0 million tonnes of potash.
In the second quarter, our potash gross margin rate was 12% and 20% excluding Canadian resource taxes. As you know, we have been relentlessly focused on costs, which has helped us maintain reasonable margins during the downturn. 
In the third quarter, we expect gross margin rate to decline as a result of lower prices and the impact of a lower operating rate.
In phosphates, second quarter sales volumes were well within our guidance ranges as global demand remains strong. Our average realized price came in at the low end of our guidance range, while raw material costs also declined. The result was a gross margin rate of 10%, which was in line with our expectations.
We expect the gross margin rate in phosphates to stay around 10% in the third quarter, with additional benefit from lower sulfur and ammonia costs, offsetting expected lower realized prices and higher phosphate rock costs. We plan to run our phosphate facilities at a relatively high operating rate in order to meet North American fall demand. Our guidance for third quarter phosphate sales is 2.4 million to 2.7 million tonnes.
In the International Distribution segment, as Mike noted, demand is strong in Brazil and India, and the agricultural situation in both of these key regions remains promising. Our margins in International Distribution continued to be muted by lower fertilizer prices. For the third quarter, we expect International Distribution sales to be in a range of 2.1 million to 2.4 million tonnes and a sequential improvement in profitability, with the gross margin dollars per tonne in the $15 to $20 range, which assumes a stable real.
We have lowered again our full year SG&A guidance to be in the range of $330 million to $350 million, down from the initial guidance of $350 million to $370 million. Just as a reminder, SG&A at Mosaic was $394 million in 2013, prior to the CF and EDM acquisitions.
We have also lowered our capital expenditures by an additional $50 million this quarter to a range of $750 million to $850 million, which is in addition to our investment in the Ma'aden joint venture, which was $220 million in 2016.
Because of the lower expected earnings, we are revising our effective tax rate guidance to be around 10% for 2016. We have also lowered our expected full year brine management cost from $150 million to $170 million compared to our prior estimate of $160 million to $180 million.
Finally, we expect Canadian resource taxes to range from $95 million to $110 million in 2016. 
To summarize, we continue to benefit from our strong financial foundation, and we are pulling the necessary levers to ensure that we can compete across the cycle. We now have the long-desired clarity on China and India potash needs and, along with strong global demand and supply adjustments, we believe potash prices have bottomed and we see potential for modest price increases in the second half of the year. 
In what we believe will be an improving environment, we will continue to assess the market and our respective balance sheet and capital management positions, and we will adapt as necessary as the business environment evolves. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Joc to moderate our Q&A session."

It may incur slightly higher cost in terms of operating over a short term, but we believe that the cash conservation is valuable. In terms of K3, our thinking has been ancillary equipment, any of those type costs, yes, we will consider, but we are being very cognizant that we want to maintain the critical path of the K3 project.

And let me take them one at a time, and I'll probably hand the India second quarter over to Rick and Mike. But let me talk on rock costs. Clearly, on the long term, we've been able to manage our rock costs extremely well in our phosphate business. What's happening today is we've run into some, what I would call, short-term geology changes that have meant that the grade or the amount of ore that we're able to pull per tonne of mining is decreased at our Four Corners mine, it's one portion of the mine. We're talking about a decade-long reserves, and sometimes, those are variable. Sometimes, we hit areas where the rock quality is much higher than we expect and other times, we hit rock quality that's maybe lower than what we expect. We do expect it to be transitory and on the long term, we hold with our expectations of superior rock costs. In terms of the ammonia barge, we -- yes, we certainly can move full volumes with the one ammonia barge. We have a little less buffer, I guess, would be the way I would put it. And maybe 5 or 6 years from now, when we have to have some statutory shutdowns of those barges for repairs, there may be short periods of time when we'll have to come up with different plans. But overall, we believe we've managed the risk very well while still conserving as much cash as we can. Now in terms of India's second half, I'm just going to hand the straight over to Mike and let him talk about that."

Yes, in general, the outlook in India remains very positive. As you know, the monsoon is delivering above-average rainfall. Retail prices for DAP are off about 15%. The rupee has been very stable compared to other currencies and finally, imported margins, given all those parameters, are profitable. So all the stars and moons are lined up to make import economics work. We're projecting about 5.6 million tonnes of imports this calendar year in India. First half of the year, they imported 1.8 million . That would leave about 3.8 million tonnes second half of the year that we think they need to import into the country. And so that's a big number. It's 500,000 tonnes more than what they did last year, which was a very good second half for them. And on the comments here, we've mentioned the bunching of demand in the second half of the year. I guess, when you put the 3.8 million tonnes that India has to import alongside the 2.9 million tonnes we think Brazil needs to import, plus the prospects for a good North American season, we do believe that there will be some pretty strong seasonal pulls on shipments second half of the year."

And also, you have to take into account where the production is occurring and what the profitability is on a mine-by-mine basis. And so with the shutdown of Colonsay and less production there, more production coming out of Esterhazy and Bell Plaine, in particular, leads to a slightly higher Canadian resource taxes this quarter, which I would expect to fall back to what I'll call more normal levels in the Q3 and Q4.

But I think the important point there is when you look at the imports, imports surge to, by our account, about 1.4 million metric tonnes in calendar 2015. Those have come down. We think 2016 will end the year with a million tonnes and probably another reduction in 2017, largely because of the big price discount in North America that's just not as attractive to move tonnes into North America now.

And frankly, I think, there's something going on there in terms of potash consumption. I think all the numbers would suggest that maybe potash consumption is a little bit better than everyone is giving China credit for. Just to review some of the numbers, China imported a record 9.4 million tonnes last year. We think they produced about 6.6 million tonnes and shipments, probably in that 16 million tonnes range, so a little bit of an inventory build last year. We think that's getting pulled down. Our shipment number this year is 12.9 million tonnes. We think it'll increase to 13.9 million tonnes next year. So imports, we think imports this year, probably, will be in that 8 million tonne range, so down from last year and it probably stays in that range in 2017. The other factor, you mentioned Qinghai Salt Lake. Our team in Beijing believes that production has dropped this year, probably closer to 6 million to 6.2 million tonnes. So while there's some additional capacity coming on, I think there's been some adjustment in terms of domestic production in response to the current price environment as well. But I think the bottom line is, yes, we don't have a record shipment number factored in for China next year, and we think imports are going to be relatively stable at about 8 million tonnes."

We see the fundamentals improving in the second half of the year, which mitigates the need for a dividend cut. Now if the markets don't improve or if they deteriorate, we may have to revisit the affordability of our dividend. However, just let me point out, in the first half of the year, we generated sufficient cash to cover all of our commitments, including capital and our dividend.

Having said that, fertilizer is very affordable to the farmer right now. Our fertilizer-to-crop price ratio is probably as good as it's been in a long, long time. But recognize that the impact, the soft crops prices are driven by higher yields. And those higher yields means higher fertilizer removed from the soil, and so that in itself tends to drive higher demand. The other thing I want to highlight on that is we talk about soft crop prices, we normally are talking about corn. If corn acres goes down in the U.S., for instance, they'll probably be replaced by soybean acres. And so likely, for us, there won't be that big an impact. And also, remember, only 30% of fertilizers are used on the corn, wheat, bean complex. The rest is crops like sugar, coffee, which are doing very well.

So I don't think you want us focused too much on current spot prices. Clearly, there's a big crop that's coming in shortly, and that's impacting prices now. But there's still a fair amount of uncertainty about what happens in the southern hemisphere, particularly with the expectation of a La Niña event and the negative consequence that typically has for the Southern Hemisphere harvest. So if you look at the 2017 new crop prices, they're still at levels that are -- that we think underpin decent demand. And as Joc said, we're very much corn, soybean, wheat focused. And the 30% number Joc referred to is that 30% of the potash worldwide is applied to those 3 crops, where phosphates is about 40%. So the fact that you're seeing dramatic increase in sugar prices, cotton prices, coffee prices, fruits and vegetables, those are the ones that are going to, I think, provide a very good demand base."

Thank you for joining our call. Today we're going to focus on the actions Mosaic is taking so that we can continue to successfully navigate in this market environment.
The key concepts we want you to understand are: first, Mosaic's operational flexibility and solid balance sheet give us significant competitive advantages in a prolonged period of softer markets; second, we expect global demand for our products to be healthy, particularly, in the second half of the year; and third, this management team has been through a number of cycles, and we have the experience and discipline to position Mosaic for success across the cycle.
I know that most of you understand the headwinds that we have been facing, so I won't spend a lot of time belaboring the business environment. Suffice it to say, while the market environment has been challenging for crop nutrients in recent months, we fully understand and accept the cyclicality of our business, and know from prior history, that this cycle too, will turn for the better. It's our responsibility to be well positioned when this happens and to take advantage of opportunities the cycles present. Grain and oilseed prices have stabilized with the upward trend in recent weeks. In fact, both corn and soybean prices are higher today than they were 12 months ago. El Niño-related weather conditions around the world are creating concern for the current crop, which is driving a rally in soybean prices and firming corn prices.
These improvements, along with expectations that U.S. farmers will plant a big crop, underpin our strong fertilizer demand outlook for the remainder of the year. Yet, fertilizer prices remain low, with our average realized prices for potash and phosphates coming in at $207 and $355 per tonne, respectively, in the first quarter. Our realized potash prices have fallen by over $80 per tonne compared with a year ago. Several factors continue to impact fertilizer prices, including the strong U.S. dollar especially against key currencies in potash-producing countries, ample channel inventories, declining farm incomes, lower raw material costs, perception of oversupply in potash, and the fert purchasing behavior, while the market awaits the bellwether potash contract with China.
Demand has been slower to materialize than we anticipated. A short period of warm dry weather in the corn belt in March created an expectation for an early spring, which just did not materialize as we progressed through the quarter. These conditions, taken together, led to a challenging start to the year as we expected. Mosaic earned $257 million or $0.73 per share on revenue of $1.7 billion in our first quarter. Adjusted earnings per share totaled $0.14. In the potash business, we generated $86 million in operating earnings and reported a gross margin rate of 30%, excluding resource taxes. Our phosphate operating earnings were $18 million with a gross margin rate of 7%. Phosphate margins were impacted by a smaller in-season rebound in prices than we expected and the timing of raw material costs, which Rich will address in more detail shortly.
We continue to expect a strong second half with improving global demand for the remainder of 2016. North American spring application is in full swing and we're seeing good indications from other key regions. Demand is high in Brazil despite the political and economic turmoil. Similarly, in India, a good monsoon season and a constructive nutrient subsidy resolution, including unchanged potash subsidies despite lower market prices, are driving strong Kharif application.
Our outlook for the remainder of the year includes rising demand and respectable shipment volumes as well as traditional seasonal pricing behavior.
The recent run-up in agricultural commodity prices, combined with current nutrient prices, make our products very affordable. In fact, crop nutrients are more affordable today than they have been during the last 5 years. This gives us confidence in the second half outlook.
Now, let's discuss the affirmative steps we're taking to effectively manage our business and the levers that remain available. First, we are benefiting from our work to reduce expenses. Mosaic today is a low-cost producer. And we are building on this competitive advantage. Two years ago, we announced a plan to obtain $500 million in cost savings. We are on track to achieve that goal and we're working now to cut costs further. With the current softness in the industry, we plan to reduce support function expenses by an additional $75 million per year, and expect most of the benefit to be realized in 2017.
We're actively working on our plans in this area and intend to provide additional information and insights during our next earnings call. We also plan to reduce our capital expenditures for 2016. During our last call, we provided capital guidance of $900 million to $1.1 billion. We are reducing our 2016 guidance to $800 million to $900 million. This reduction will not compromise employee safety, or critical sustaining capital needs. But we are deferring or eliminating capital spending where we can.
In addition, we plan to continue our work to optimize our asset portfolio. We've made important progress over the last few years including the sale of Hersey and shutdown of MOP production at Carlsbad. We have exited underperforming businesses, regions, and assets. And we have curtailed production when the market softened. We will continue to manage our asset base to match supply with global demand environment. This is an area where we will provide more detail along with cost-saving and medium-term capital spending later this year.
At the same time, we are not just battening down the hatches, we're also looking for opportunities to invest and we will continue to drive a culture of innovation so that Mosaic will continue to lead the industry across all cycles.
With that, I will ask Rich Mack to provide insight into our results for the quarter as well as our guidance for the second quarter. Rich?"

I would like to reiterate Joc's key points. Mosaic is committed to maintaining a solid balance sheet because we understand the cyclicality of this business.We do have the ability to withstand difficult market conditions, seek opportunities",1629,"Thanks, Joc. I would like to reiterate Joc's key points. Mosaic is committed to maintaining a solid balance sheet because we understand the cyclicality of this business.
We do have the ability to withstand difficult market conditions, seek opportunities and emerge strong and ready to outperform in better markets.
And make no mistake, better markets will materialize at some point. So today, I'd like to begin by providing an overview of our results in each segment.
In potash, our shipment volumes came in at the low end of our expectations. We shipped just over 1.5 million tonnes of potash, with demand in North America hampered by weather and cautious purchasing behavior by our customers. Potash prices drifted lower during the quarter, pressured by the seasonally slow demand, the lack of a China contract and additional product available in North America.
In light of the market dynamics, our potash gross margin rate of 30%, excluding resource taxes, was respectable. And it demonstrated our significant progress on cost control. We have made the difficult, but necessary decisions to stop higher cost production and curtail production elsewhere, and we have reduced spending across the business unit.
Our operating rate in potash was 77%, which was within our guidance range. We are continuing to manage our production to meet customer needs and global demand.
With the spring planting season finally in full swing in North America, demand is emerging. We expect global demand to surge when producers reach contracts with the Chinese customers, which we expect to occur in the second quarter. Once that contract price has been set, we should see pent-up demand from other regions around the world, most notably, India. As a result, we now expect our global shipments for the year to be in the range up 7.5 million to 8.0 million tonnes, with more of those sales occurring in the second half of the year.
In fact, our Q2 volume guidance assumes minimal shipments to China and India. We expect prices to remain range bound, primarily due to the effects of the strong dollar and available global supply.
We anticipate average realized prices in the second quarter will be the range of $180 to $200 per tonne. Prices will continue to put pressure on margins, and our expectation for the second quarter is for the potash gross margin rate to be in the mid- to high-teens, excluding resource taxes.
The sequential decline in realized prices, the negative impact of reduced operating rates and a $50 dollar reduction in average realized K-Mag prices are the main drivers of reduced segment profitability. In the Phosphate segment, shipment volumes came in at the high end of our guidance at 2.2 million tonnes.
Demand was good in Brazil and North America, while demand began to develop in India toward the end of the quarter. Market prices increased $40 per tonne in the first quarter, but we did not see quite the magnitude of improvements we expected, mostly due to the timing of North America planting and an increase in competition from imported product.
Lower finished phosphate prices as well as the timing of raw material pricing caused our phosphate gross margin rate to fall below our expectations. We regularly discuss the impact of raw materials on our margin in phosphates. So I'd like to explain that in a bit more detail now.
There is a time lag between purchasing raw materials and selling finished phosphates. It generally takes 3 to 4 months for raw materials to move through the finished goods inventory and cost of goods sold and to be recognized in our financials. Recently, finished phosphate prices declined faster than raw materials leading us to sell higher cost inventory at lower prices, which put pressure on margins. While raw material prices are more stable today and sales volume are picking up, phosphate prices are under pressure as Brazilians wait out the impact of the recently strengthened real, while Indian importers are slow to purchase as they draw down inventories.
As a result, margins in the second quarter will remain around 10%. We do expect both Brazil and India to import sizable volumes later in the year, and also anticipate phosphate gross margins to return to the high-teens in the second half of 2016, where we will see the full benefits of the lower ammonia and sulfur prices.
For the second quarter, we expect phosphate volumes to be in a range of 2.3 million to 2.6 million tonnes, with the sequential increase driven by rising seasonal demand. The year-over-year decline reflects our decision not to participate in certain geographies, most recently, for example, India, and to some extent Brazil, where current offers, in our view, do not reflect favorable economics and ignore current global supply and demand dynamics.
Our full year volume expectations are now in the range of 9.0 million to 9.75 million tonnes with a decline driven by a slower start to 2016.
In the International Distribution segment, volumes were slightly higher-than-expected. We experienced good demand in India and improving demand in Brazil, where access to farm credit began to improve last quarter. The economic and political situation in Brazil remains volatile, to say the least, and it is challenging to precisely forecast how it will affect farmers and farm credit in the months ahead. We are seeing evidence that farmers in Brazil are continuing to plan for big crops, which bodes well for fertilizer demand.
We do not expect a meaningful improvement in international distribution profitability In the second quarter. In fact, our volume guidance reflects a decision not to pursue market share at these lower margins. The recent run-up in soybean prices, however, should help improve the profitability of our distribution business later in the year.
Overall, we expect business conditions to improve in the second half of 2016. The 3 main drivers for this uptick include: one, as we've said, we expect global demand for potash and phosphate to accelerate in the second half. In fact, we continue to expect global shipments to be near our all-time records. Two, as a result of the strong volumes, we expect to see higher operating rates driving lower costs in both our potash and phosphate businesses. And three, we expect the competitive environment to level out as the robust U.S. dollar tapers in value compared to other currencies. For example, we've already seen the Brazilian real and the Russian ruble correct to a certain degree, and macroeconomic indicators suggest that further strengthening of those key currencies is not out of the question.
Of course, that also means higher dollar denominated operating costs for us in Canada. But we believe, we are well hedged against short-term Canadian dollar fluctuations. So, as Joc noted, in the current environment, Mosaic is focused on optimizing cash flow by influencing key levers, which we have a meaningful degree of control over. This includes, reducing or altogether eliminating capital spending, finding ways to further materially reduce operating and support function costs, optimizing Mosaic's portfolio of assets, driving working capital efficiency, and lastly, managing balance sheet targets relative to current liquidity requirements such as investments and/or dividend.
So let's start with capital. As Joc noted, we intend to reduce capital expenditures further this year by deferring, eliminating and reprioritizing investments. We expect CapEx to range from $800 million to $900 million, plus approximately $220 million for the Ma'aden project, which is down significantly from where we were projecting 3 months ago.
On a normalized basis, Mosaic will spend roughly $500 million to $550 million in sustaining capital projects. In some years, this number may be higher, while in more challenging years, we will spend less. In addition to typical sustaining capital, today we have 3 distinct projects that increase our CapEx requirements to the revised range that I highlighted above.
These projects include Esterhazy K3, the Ma'aden joint venture and Mosaic's next-generation phosphate mine in Florida. Our Ma'aden spending will be concluded in 2017, and we will be allocating some capital for both K3 and the new phosphate mine for the next several years until completed.
Having said that, however, you should know that we are also evaluating further opportunities to reduce capital spending on the last 2 projects, as well as additional asset optimization scenarios across our entire organization. To reiterate Joc's points regarding expenses, we are moving quickly and aggressively to reduce support function costs.
We are targeting an annual run rate savings of $75 million, the majority of which should be captured in calendar year 2017. A portion will also be realized in 2016, which is, in part, driving a reduction in full year SG&A expenses, now expected to be the range up $340 million to $360 million, down from $350 million to $370 million provided earlier in the year.
We expect to have more detail on these initiatives on our second quarter earnings call.
Our balance sheet remains a source of strength and resilience. Our strong liquidity buffer of $2.5 billion exists for us to use when necessary, for protection in difficult parts of the cycle. Our balance sheet strength also allows us to remain committed to our dividend in today's market environment. 
So to summarize, we have a built Mosaic, its operations, its talent base, and its financial foundation to succeed across cycles in a business that we know to be cyclical. We are taking the actions necessary to adapt to this environment and to ensure Mosaic remains in a strong position regardless of the market environment.
We will continue to actively assess and manage our balance sheet and we will adapt as necessary should the down part of the cycle be longer or more pronounced than expected. Now, I will turn the call back over to Joc for his concluding remarks."

And we narrowed our range from 65 million to 67 million, to 65 million to 66 million. If you look around the globe, at some of the key markets, several positive developments there. In the case of India, I think there's a growing optimism as far as demand prospects due to a forecast for an above-normal monsoon. We've had some strengthening of the rupee, and we have a very workable subsidy scheme that was introduced at the end of -- or the beginning of their fiscal year. When you look at countries like Brazil, local currency prices of key commodities like soybeans, sugar, coffee are at near all-time highs. We think that underpins very good demand. You look at the fact that there has been an early release of more credit, so farmers have greater flexibility. The product is moving to the farm. So a lot of positive development that make us optimistic for second half demand."

One, I think we mentioned before that we think there is -- there could be a pretty strong bunching of demand. So we think Brazil will be in the market, India will be in the market, and North American fall -- fill will be all active at pretty much the same time. So there is the potential for some strong seasonal pressures, we believe. I think the second point is that, raw material costs have come down a lot. And then that's been part of the reason for the drop in phosphate prices. And those costs are beginning to stabilize. So I don't think there's going to be quite as many tailwinds from lower raw material costs. And then, a third point is, some of the currency changes that have taken place, is beginning to pinch margins for some of those producers, who greatly benefited from a depreciated currency. And then finally, as Joc mentioned, the subsidies that was announced in India, is a very workable subsidy. And I think it remains to be seen how the market sort of sorts out the spoils of that subsidy. If there is a bunching and you get some price pressure, certainly, the Indians can afford to pay more. We've done some real simple analysis that shows if retail prices drop slightly in India, certainly the Indians can afford to pay prices up into the $380s. So I think, there is the potential there for lots of things combining to provide some uplift in prices in the second half."

Recently, we've seen a precipitous decline, for example, in SOP and that results in some recalibrating for K-Mag prices, just to give one example. And then on Ma'aden, what you should assume there is, this is basically a timing issue with respect to capital. We would effectively guide exactly as we have in the past, and that is ammonia prices -- or I'm sorry, ammonia production will start in the fourth quarter of this year. I think we're anticipating somewhere in the vicinity of 300,000 tonnes of ammonia that will be produced out of the Ma'aden joint venture in 2016.

According to Chinese customs statistics, first quarter exports were down about 560,000 tonnes from a year ago. We think that, that will continue in the last 3 quarters of the year. And our last estimate from our Chinese team indicates that, we believe, that Chinese exports will be down about 2 million tonnes for the year from the record 11.7 million last year to about 9.6 million tonnes this year. As you know, the Chinese have stopped building phosphate plants after this dramatic expansion over the past 10 years. And as Joc mentioned, we think that there will be some restructuring that takes place in what's a very heterogeneous industry there. And that over time, exports probably will stabilize somewhere in that 7 million to 8 million tonne range. There is an analog, if you look at what happened on the nitrogen side of the business, I think, 2015 was the first year where closures of ammonia capacity exceeded increases in capacity. And so, capacity in China can decline.

And we have said before, we would go beyond our normal 2:1 debt-to-EBITDA ratio for the right investment, but realize that we are very conscious of our credit rating.

We still have some areas where we think we can get some further reductions in both G&A and operating costs. But you can see in our results that, a good chunk of that is flowing through our results today as you're well aware. I mean our potash costs are flat despite a 16% reduction in our operating rates. Our phosphate conversion costs are lower despite a significantly lower operating rate. And we've held on phosphate rock cost flat for several years and all this is part of the program. We've also -- you can see our SG&A cost this year down 10%. So overall, you can see the results as they flow through, but we still have some cost left to come, but it’s going very well. In terms of the sulfur melter, that sulfur is now running. We're about -- we'll probably have the biggest import impact and you've seen that sulfur prices in the Gulf come down recently. I think what it's done, is it forced the trade flow to go to what makes the best sense.

In China, yes, I think your point is spot on. We expect that -- as you know, China has announced 0 growth policy after 2020. And they've also announced some changes in their crop support prices. And I think all of that, and in terms of no growth, I think you'll see may be a reallocation of nutrients between -- or from nitrogen into phosphate and especially potash. And I think there's some evidence of that taking place already, because last year, China had record potash imports of over 9 million tonnes, domestic production is up.

I know there is at least one other company reporting today. So we don't want to cut into their time. Look, we fully expect the markets to strengthen as the year progresses. With that said, year-to-date, our production rates are down, consistent with our intention to balance production with sales and global demand. I want to highlight some positive steps we've taken to reduce our spending so that Mosaic can weather this current environment, and thrive across the cycle. We've held our production costs flat year-over-year in potash despite a 16% reduction in our operating rate. This represents good cost management as well as some currency benefits. I want to point out our brine inflow cost, while somewhat dependent on Mother Nature, these are down by $70 million to $90 million from the peak, largely due to good cost control, good technology application, and some currency benefits. In phosphates, we've driven our conversion costs lower despite a significant lower operating rate. And we've held the cash costs of our mining operations flat over several years. We attribute both of those to good cost management. We've reduced our annual capital spending expectations this year by $200 million, plus deferred almost $100 million in spending for Ma'aden. Our SG&A costs are down 10% year-over-year as lower incentives are driven by our performance, and our performance reflect the challenging market environment. And we've lowered our full year SG&A guidance. This clearly demonstrates the benefits of our work to continue to be the low-cost producer in potash and phosphates. So with that, I want to conclude our call by reiterating our key messages. We have the operating flexibility and balance sheet. We need to weather the current market environment. We fully expect the markets to improve in the second half of this year, and we understand, and are prepared for the cyclical nature of this business. The long-term remains very promising, and we manage this company for long-term success. Thank you for joining the call. Have a great day. Thank you."

Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. It seems clear to us that you all understand the market-related challenges we face. To summarize, we're experiencing a major decline in the broader commodities",1182,"Good morning. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. It seems clear to us that you all understand the market-related challenges we face. To summarize, we're experiencing a major decline in the broader commodities markets as well as global economic uncertainty and unprecedented strength of the U.S. dollar.
In agriculture, the grain and oilseed supply and demand situation remains relatively balanced even after 3 consecutive huge harvests. And despite the severe price decline across other commodities, crop prices have been relatively stable. Unlike hard commodities, we do not see a structural imbalance in agriculture, so we have a positive outlook for the 2016 global shipments in both potash and phosphates. We believe recent price declines in potash and phosphates have been driven more by macroeconomic trend than by the current supply and demand balance. Weak currency valuations against the U.S. dollar are lowering production costs for exporting nations and raising prices for importing nations. Normal seasonal pressures are exacerbating the fertilizer price trends. As a result, our realized prices were down in the fourth quarter and have been under increasing pressure since the beginning of this year.
We see several factors that are giving farmers around the globe incentives to use fertilizer to maximize yield and revenue per acre. The price declines in fertilizer have led to high crop nutrient affordability. Farmers are experiencing lower energy costs. Currency valuations are providing tailwinds for non-U.S. growers selling U.S. dollar-priced crops. And the recent big harvests have withdrawn large amounts of nutrients from the soil, which must be replenished. As a result, demand is expected to remain strong. 
With that operating environment as a backdrop, we have 3 important concepts to discuss today. First, we expect Mosaic to emerge a stronger company from this difficult period. Second, the resilience we built into our business is real, as demonstrated by the strength of our balance sheet, our cost control and our strong execution. We believe it will yield compelling opportunities for growth as this cycle plays out. And third, agricultural commodities bear different dynamics than many other commodities, and that's a fact that we believe has been overlooked amid the general commodity market pessimism. Cycles can turn more quickly in agriculture because of unpredictable weather and the consistent underlying global demand for food. We understand that cycles are inevitable, and that they are neither tidy nor predictable. We have always managed Mosaic for the long-term for success across the business cycle. That is a lot easier to say than it is to do. So let's explore the characteristics of our franchise that we believe will allow us to emerge ahead of our competition as the business improves.
First, the earnings we reported today show our resilience. We reported $0.44 per share or $0.53 per share, excluding notable items and a catch-up in our tax accruals. This catch-up was a result of higher accruals through the first 3 quarters of the year, and a true-up in this quarter, which resulted in a low effective tax rate in the quarter.
For the full year, we earned $1 billion. And our earnings per share of $2.78 were higher than the $2.68 per share Mosaic earned in 2014, reflecting both our execution and our capital allocation. It is important to note that Mosaic remains solidly profitable and free cash flow positive despite the very tough markets.
We've taken the actions necessary to ensure stability. We made tremendous progress on costs. We are well ahead of schedule on our initiatives to generate $500 million of cost savings by 2018. It's important to note that we began that work with Mosaic already occupying competitive cost positions on the global potash and phosphate cost curves. We've made tough decisions, including difficult moves to stop our MOP production at Carlsbad, New Mexico and decommission our potash mine in Hersey, Michigan. We've also saved significant cost through innovative decisions and by investing the necessary capital to improve processes for the long term.
We've made major progress towards a strong and efficient balance sheet. We've reached our leverage targets while maintaining enough cash to provide a buffer. That seems conservative to some no doubt, but it will prove prudent and provide flexibility others do not have in this environment.
In 2012, when potash prices were close to $450 per tonne, we indefinitely postponed a $3 billion potash expansion. 2 years ago, we had the opportunity to contract for ammonia with natural gas-based prices and decided to forego building a $1.2 billion ammonia plant. We took that capital and returned it to shareholders, retiring nearly a quarter of our outstanding shares since we were split off from Cargill.
And we're executing at a very high level. Our plants and mines are efficient. We've had very little unplanned downtime. And as an indicator of our effectiveness, we delivered another year of record low reportable injury frequency.
To put it simply, we have not built the company just to weather storms. We have built it to succeed across the cycles that we all know will come. We've also created a great deal of potential, and that's why we believe so strongly that Mosaic will emerge a winner. We expect to realize the value of our many growth initiatives across the cycle, and we believe we have created a tremendous amount of leverage for when better conditions arrive. We've covered our many growth initiatives in the past, so I'll provide you with a short update.
The Esterhazy K3 potash mine remains on schedule and on budget. When the project is completed, the mine will be amongst the lowest cost, most efficient mines in the world. It will give us important operating flexibility, including the ability at some point to fully eliminate material brine management costs. 
The CF phosphate acquisition has exceeded our expectations. Those facilities generated excellent margins for the first 18 months we owned them. 
The ADM acquisition in Brazil and Paraguay continues to hold significant promise. The current difficult economic and political situation in Brazil is temporarily muting the benefit we expect.
Our work to ensure stable, cost-effective access to our phosphate raw materials is nearing completion. We have finished the sulfur mill project in our New Wales facility in Florida, and our ammonia supply agreement with CF begins next year. While the economics in the near term are less attractive with $310 per tonne ammonia, long-term economics remain highly positive. 
Also at New Wales, our project to increase MicroEssentials capacity is nearing completion. We will have the ability to make 3.5 million tonnes of MicroEssentials, which provide significant value to the farmers, the retailers and to Mosaic.
The Wa’ad Al Shamal phosphate projects in Saudi Arabia is also progressing, and we expect initial production of ammonia later this year. Taken together, all this work gives Mosaic resilience and potential, which in turn gives us the opportunity to emerge from the weak part of the cycle in the lead. 
Now I will turn the call over to Rich Mack for insights into our financial results and our guidance. Rich?"

To briefly reiterate Joc's commentary on the markets, our financial results are being impacted by a confluence of challenging factors. Global macroeconomic uncertainty; ongoing currency volatility and weakness",1413,"Thank you, Joc, and good morning to you, all. To briefly reiterate Joc's commentary on the markets, our financial results are being impacted by a confluence of challenging factors. Global macroeconomic uncertainty; ongoing currency volatility and weakness in key currencies against the U.S. dollar; the lack of sufficient credit in Brazil; and in potash, a recently completed Canpotex proving run that added supply in the seasonally slow part of the year.
Over the longer term though, we see cause for optimism, including a balanced supply-and-demand picture in phosphates, a manageable supply and demand picture in potash and good conditions for agriculture in Brazil, where the weak reais leads to high prices in local currency for grains and oilseeds.
Now I'll provide an overview of results in each of our 3 operating segments. In Phosphates, our margins were lower in the fourth quarter, primarily because of timing. We were selling fertilizer manufactured when raw material prices were higher than they are today. At the same time, prices dropped quickly as traders anticipated the impact of lower raw material costs and buyers' delayed purchasing. So for the near term, we are seeing seasonally limited sales volumes and softer prices before we can realize our lower raw material costs. These trends are expected to continue into the first quarter.
If we look longer term however, our stripping margin is expected to remain healthy, with much lower raw material prices offsetting lower fertilizer prices. We expect continued declines in sulfur, reflecting a number of curtailment announcements in China as well as our own. These low raw material costs, combined with a firming of phosphate prices in the spring, leads us to expect margin rates to rebound to normal levels after the first quarter.
In the first quarter, we expect the seasonally slow sales to continue and raw material costs to fall further. Last week, we announced that we are once again curtailing production to avoid the building of high-cost inventory. As a result, we expect our phosphate operating rates to be in the range of 70% to 80%. These factors are all embedded assumptions in our Phosphates guidance. It is noteworthy that sales volumes picked up after we announced our decision to reduce production.
For the full year, we expect margins to be similar to last year, underpinned by our constructive view of the industry. We expect to ship between 9 million and 10 million tonnes of phosphates, with global market shipments increasing yet again this year to a range of 65 million to 67 million tonnes. 
In the Potash segment, we remained solidly profitable despite the drop in prices. Our work to reduce costs as well as the tailwinds provided by the weak Canadian dollar, have enabled us to maintain reasonable margins.
Looking back at potash supply and demand. In the latter part of 2014, customers built significant inventories with the expectation of a drawdown in 2015. That inventory reduction occurred to some extent, but it was less pronounced than we had expected. Heading into the 2016 planting season in North America, we expect strong demand and good shipment levels, tempered by the fact that retailers continue to hold higher inventories. 
As a result of these factors, we have lowered our estimate of global potash shipments by 3 million tonnes to a range of 58 million to 60 million tonnes, consistent with 2015, which was the second highest year of shipments ever. We do not believe the potash supply-and-demand scenario is grossly out of balance. Many producers, including Mosaic, have cut back volumes in response to the seasonal lack of demand. Per our earlier production curtailment announcements, we reduced our operating rate in the fourth quarter by about 20 percentage points compared to last year.
In the first quarter, we plan to operate our potash mines at approximately 70% to 80% of capacity in order to meet global demand we expect to emerge during the second quarter. We expect pent-up demand to come from most of our major markets: China, Brazil, India, Southeast Asian and North America as well as from Europe, all at roughly the same time this year, which should provide a solid foundation for prices. In the meantime, we will maintain our disciplined approach to meeting our customers' demands. We have operational flexibility, a low cost structure, including the benefit of low natural gas prices at our Belle Plaine solution mine and the benefit of a weak Canadian dollar, which in 2015 was down as much as the Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar.
Our first quarter potash volume guidance anticipates demand emerging around the world toward the end of this quarter. And as a result, our expected operating rate is well below the same period last year. Margins are expected to be in the low to mid-20% range, reflecting both lower realized prices and our decision to produce only to expected market demand. We expect our shipments to North America to be about flat with last year's levels, with the reduction in volumes primarily a function of delayed demand in the export markets. Our full year volume guidance of 7.5 million to 8.5 million tonnes reflects an expected increase in Canpotex potash exports. 
In our International Distribution segment, we continue to be impacted by the difficult political and economic situation in Brazil. Fertilizer demand remains slower than usual, primarily because farmers are having difficulty finding appropriate access to credit. The credit situation is giving farmers incentive to acquire their inputs through barter, a system that can benefit Mosaic because of our strong relationships with key players in the Brazilian barter market. These arrangements also allow us to take a conservative approach to granting credit, which lowers overall credit losses.
Farmers in Brazil continue to plant for big crops. In fact, a high percentage of second-crop corn has already been sold in advance because of the favorable currency dynamics. So farmers need to plant their acres and maximize yields. We believe that will facilitate additional fertilizer demand.
Brazilian credit availability is the swing factor in our volume guidance assumptions for the first quarter and full year. Because of the relatively high proportion of fixed costs, higher volumes positively impact margins per tonne as does a higher proportion of MicroEssentials in our sales. 
Finally, I should note that our forecasted margins anticipate relative stability in the reais. For 2016, we expect our distribution volumes to range from 6 million to 7 million tonnes. 
For calendar 2016, our annual guidance ranges are as follows: Canadian resource taxes and royalties are expected to be in the range of $180 million to $220 million, down from $281 million in 2015. Brine management costs are expected to be consistent with 2015, in the range of $160 million to $180 million. Our SG&A expense is estimated to be $350 million to $370 million. We will continue to look for opportunities to take additional costs out of the system to increase cash flow and to manage the company for the inevitable cyclical upturn. 
Our effective tax rate is expected to be in the high-teen percentage range. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $900 million to $1.1 billion, plus around the $300 million for our interest in the Ma’aden Wa’ad Al Shamal Phosphate Company.
As we have previously guided, approximately $600 million of our capital expenditures is sustaining capital. And the majority of the remainder is for projects already well underway. We are prepared to calibrate capital spending further to reflect current market conditions. Given the current attractiveness of Mosaic's share price, new capital commitments must meet a very high risk-adjusted hurdle rate.
And one more note on capital. Today, we announced an accelerated share repurchase program of $75 million. As you know, cycles bring opportunities. And during the fourth quarter, we were evaluating some unique opportunities and did not affect additional share repurchases. We are pleased to be in a position to make today's announcement, and we will continue to embrace the capital management philosophy we have often articulated in the past.
To conclude, I would like to reiterate Joc's main points. There is no doubt that markets are challenging on several fronts, but Mosaic has made and will continue to make notable progress. We have the financial and operational resilience and discipline to succeed in weak markets. And we have significant leverage to outperform as conditions improve, which they always do in this sector.
With that, I'll return the call back to Joc for his closing comments. Joc?"

In terms of Chinese exports, I'm sure you're all aware that exports spiked in 2015 to -- I believe the China customs numbers is in the 11.6 million tonne range. As I think was noted earlier, there have been some shutdowns in China. Those tonnes, we think will be lost. Our projection that we're using right now in our S&D is somewhere in that 10 million tonne range. We think it will be off a bit from the record last year. In terms of the first question, phosphate inventories and, Rick, you should comment as well. I think it varies from region to region. Certainly, continuing in China, we know that inventories have built up at the plant level. We think they're high there. Distributors in China are the same as distributors around the world in terms of when prices are trending down, they tend not to take positions. So we've seen a backup of inventories at the plant. But overall, we don't think inventories in China are excessive. The situation in India may be a little bit different. They had a 2.5 million tonne increase in imports last year, and we think that inventories there are certainly greater than what they had been the last couple of years, when they were pulled down to very low levels. North America, I think, is in good shape. And in terms of Brazil, inventories ended the year maybe a little bit above average, but I think we're seeing some positive signs there that things are beginning to move. So I'll let Rick provide his color commentary as well."

I just spent some time going through, with our Brazilian team, some things that are happening in the marketplace there. And we've seen over the -- since the start of the year, some pretty significant moves of volumes that had waited to come to market. So these are blender volumes that are going out. And we see the phosphate inventories, frankly, being drawn down. Mike described them as about even year-over-year. But the sales that are going on right now for the first quarter reflect farmers coming back into that marketplace. So I think those inventories get drawn down. And we just finished spending time this week with some of our larger North American customers. And I would say, their buying is probably lower than it's been for the last 3 years. They're going to wait and move hand to mouth, and so they're not sitting on a lot of inventories. There's not a lot of inventory sitting in North America. And so we expect when the season hits, this bodes very well. And volumes will move through the system."

That was a great opportunity for us. And just a couple of years ago, I would argue that we rolled up the CF phosphates business at a very attractive valuation. So as Joc noted, anything that we would do would go through a very strong filter. But the fact that we have a strong balance sheet, which I would argue would be the envy of many in the mining sector and ag sector today, is of great benefit to us. And so we'll continue to balance between repurchasing our shares and looking for opportunities out there. And if there's something that is extraordinarily compelling, it's something that we could act on."

They were just adding gas and starting to commission the boilers for the ammonia plant. And recognize, a big piece of the value of the Ma'aden joint venture will be that ammonia plant. And that'll come on midyear this year and probably commit -- finish commissioning somewhere around the third quarter. The rest of the plant should be ready by, let's call it, late 2016 or early 2017, and then start commissioning at that stage.

We -- this year, we're at the tail end of Ma'aden, is what I would say. 2016 will represent the vast majority of our remaining expenditures there. I think we're suggesting about $300 million in 2016. There could be some spillover effect that goes into 2017. And that's yet to be determined, based on a variety of factors in terms of how the construction is progressing today. Joc noted, ammonia production comes online later this year. Phosphate production will come online sometime during 2017, but there will be a ramp-up period. And we're progressing, I would say, very quickly right now in terms of the construction process. And those time horizons are still generally consistent with what we thought about a couple of years ago. Your question about the -- or the positive contribution in the corporate segment really relates to intercompany eliminations between our Phosphates segment and our International Distribution segment. So when we sell phosphates to International Distribution, primarily Brazil, we do not take -- we back off the profit -- or the profit is recognized, I should say, in the Phosphate segment and then it's eliminated in the corporate segment until that product is sold by International Distribution. And so what you're seeing here is a product that moved in the fourth quarter out of International Distribution and, therefore, the profit is fully being recognized by Mosaic. And then I think your third question was an increase in other current assets. And I think the answer to that is primarily additional FPDs this year compared to the last relevant period. So I hope that's a response to your question."

But late in January, the Indian government stopped allowing shipments to be moved from ports in-country. So inventory had built up. It will get cleaned out to quicker. How long that lasts -- and we've seen it before, where it allows inventory to be cleaned up in-country, and it allows them to reset the subsidy. We have no idea what the subsidy will be for P&K in India but it will be lower. And I think the other piece that -- the inventory built up for a couple of reasons. And I think the biggest one was that the expectations for demand last year were a little higher than people -- than what ended up happening. The impact of the drought in India impacted both P&K usage. And right now, what we're seeing in-country with our own in-country business, this product is moving from the distributor's shelf to the farmers. And so we have to separate what happens on the import side from what happens on the distributor's shelf. And frankly, this move of their's will help clean up some of that inventory. And we look forward to -- the back half of the year will be very good going into India, but it won't be at the level we experienced last year. Mike, do you want to add something there?"

Obviously, there are a lot of uncertainties there with respect to how good or bad the monsoon will be this year, what happens to exchange rates, what if any changes to subsidies. So a lot of moving parts there. But bottom line, our best guess at this point is, in terms of MOP imports, we think they'll be off a little bit. Recall that in calendar year 2005, India imported 4 million tonnes of potash, off a little bit from 4.3 million the previous year, but up from 3 million tonnes in 2013. We think they'll be in that 3.7 million to 3.9 million range this year, so off a little bit. Phosphate may be a little bit different story, as we noted earlier. Imports surged to, like, 2.5 million tonnes last year from very low levels. Yes, we think they're probably be off maybe 0.5 million to 0.75 million tonnes this year.

Let me just highlight with Esterhazy, it's a little difficult to give an absolute CapEx number because much of it will be, going forward, will be development money that we spend, developing the add-its [ph] and the mining area in -- underground at Esterhazy. And that is money we will not be spending at K2 or K1. So there's a trade-off there. We have probably about $300 million to $600 million to spend over the next 3 years at Esterhazy for the other equipment, like the conveyors, the shaft and development around the shaft. So I would say those are the expected. And then there's a net tax effect. So overall, the net money we're spending, I'm not sure the exact number, but it isn't -- the gross number is about $600 million. The think I'd point out is, once we do have that completed, once we have ramped up Esterhazy, if we can remove our total brine cost at some point, that is today costing us about $18 a tonne across the whole business.

And yes, Steve, I think that I expressed earlier that our team in Brazil is reporting for the second crop corn and second crop period that we've seen demand increases from the 1st of January. And that credit being freed up by the government is very good to see. It's not new credit. It's credit that was -- that had been announced in last year's budget, but the fact that they freed it up is really quite significant, and we see that as positive. Farmers are still having issues with access to credit, but from our own business, we're doing a nice job of managing credit, helping farmers connect themselves with either banks or with barter opportunities. Mike, do you want to take the China question?"

But that basically took their support price down from on big round numbers, $10 to $9. We expect that there will be further cuts in that, but it still keeps Chinese support prices for corn at relatively high levels compared to the rest of the world. So just in terms of farm economics, we think farm economics remain healthy in China. The drop that we're showing in, for example, in potash shipments relates more to the buildup of inventories than any drop in demand. I think the bigger concern there is making Chinese corn, for example, more competitive will cut into their imports of corn substitutes, whether it's DDGS, sorghum, barley or whatever. But by and large, we think Chinese farm economics and the demand drivers there are still okay."

Before I even start my concluding remarks, I just want to point out, maybe a bit of a -- Graeme reminded me of a point that we haven't made much of lately. Which is, we are now at 2,600 feet deep in our 2 potash shafts on our way to 3,100 feet. So those projects are getting very near to completion in terms of the 2 shafts. It's been a very well-executed project from our perspective. Continues to run right on budget and right on schedule. So just to call out to our potash team, that has really done an extraordinary job of a very complicated big project. 
So let me give my conclusions. To conclude our call, I just want to reiterate our key themes: First, we expect Mosaic to emerge as a stronger company from this challenging part of the cycle, because we've built a resilient business. And second, demand for agricultural commodities remains strong because global demand for food continues to grow. And I know we harp on that, but the reality is the whole thing is based on the food story, and it continues to grow. So we have created significant potential to accelerate when business conditions improve, and we know the business conditions will improve. 
So thank you very much for joining us today. Have a great and safe day. Thank you."
