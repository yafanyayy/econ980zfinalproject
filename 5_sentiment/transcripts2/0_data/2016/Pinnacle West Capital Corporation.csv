Pinnacle West delivered a solid 2015 with earnings near to high end of our guidance range with Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station having a record year, and with the balance sheet that remains one",978,"Thanks, Paul, and thank you, all, for joining us today. Pinnacle West delivered a solid 2015 with earnings near to high end of our guidance range with Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station having a record year, and with the balance sheet that remains one of the strongest in the industry. Jim will discuss the financial results and outlook, will focus mostly on the year ahead.
Our fleet performed very well in 2015, highlighted by Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Stations, high output every equating to a capacity factor of 94.3%. One of Palo Verde's key strengths is the ability of the team to perform at an excellent level, but also to drive continuous improvement in each year.
2016 marks the beginning of a new period for our feet. In total, we're planning to invest over $3.6 billion in capital over the next 3 years. We're investing in 2 large projects in our fossil fleet as well as a few innovative investments and some IT systems to prepare our operations for the long term. The 2 large fossil projects are the modernization project, and the selective catalytic reduction pollution controls or SCR, as they call at the Four Corners Generating Plant.
Four Corners Units 5 entered a major outage in January to make several upgrades, and begin laying the groundwork for the SCR installations. The innovative investments, I will outline, are designed to increase customers and system reliability, and meet future resource needs. In November, we announced a partnership with the Department of The Navy to develop a 25 megawatts project at Marine Air Station, Newmont. This is APS's first micro braid project in the first military base to secure 100% backup power.
We also plan to install a 40-megawatt solar facility this year on behalf of some of our larger customers. This amount has been reflected in our 2016 CapEx budget.
The Solar Partner program, which is planned for 1500 APS-owned rooftop solar installations, is on track to be fully installed and operational by mid-2016. And just this month, we officially launched our solar innovation study, a 75 demand rate laboratory, here in the Metro Phoenix area, which will determine how customers can use various combinations of distributed energy, resources such as solar panels, battery storage, smart and high efficiency HVAC systems to better manage their energy environments. These customers will also be placed on our existing residential demand rate, and the study will provide valuable information on customer's ability to use technology to manage the peak demand and lower their bills.
In addition to generation investments, we're upgrading several IT systems to improve our customer interface, facilitate operation of our transmission and distribution systems, and enable participation in the California ISO energy in balance market.
These investments along with our advanced meter programs, which is fully deployed, are enabling integration of the technology, while also allowing us to maintain stability.
2016 also represents an important year under regulatory calendar with the APS rate case said to be filed on June 1. APS submitted the notice of intent to file on January 29, which gives notice to the ACC and stakeholders, and outlines a primary topics, we will propose in June rate filing.
APS will propose the new rates going into effect in July 1, 2017, based on the test year-ended December 31, 2015 with certain adjustments.
To help achieve this outcome, we have held a series of stakeholder meetings to provide clarity and transparency with the stakeholders.
We're also planning to submit an extensive list of standard discovery questions and responses with the June 1st filing.
Let me outline a few of the central topics from the notice of intent to filing. Residential rate design is an area where we will propose changes to better align cost with prices and incentivize cost-reducing technologies. And we will be proposing universal demand rate, as well as shifting our time of used periods to later in the day. We will also propose a revenue per customer decoupling mechanism that will be adjusted annually to replace the existing laws fixed-cost recover mechanism. That decoupling mechanism will be proposed on a trial basis until the next rate case to act as a rate stabilizing mechanism during the transition period to the new rates structure.
The last item, I'll mention is, we'll request the deferral of cost related to 2 large CapEx projects, we're investing in, the SCR's at Four Corners, and the first ramping natural gas modernization project at. These investments total over $900 million over the next few years, within service states of 2018 and 2019, respectively.
And in the case of the SCR's, since the timing of the installations, will be close to the end of this rate case, we'll also propose a step mechanism to reflect the deferred SCR cost similar to the treatment of the Four Corners acquisition.
The on value and cost of distributed generation has testimony due on February 25. There also 4 other electric rate cases in process. UNS electric is the first in line with hearings set to begin on March 1 in. We are an active intervenor in the UNS case since it is an important forum to discuss rate design. The testimony we filed supports the concept of 3-part rate design, which incorporates a fixed service charge and energy charge and the demand charge. This concept was also proposed and supported by UNS electric and the ACC staff.
Related topics including methodologies for determining the cost to serve customers with solar and the value of solar will be a central focus in the value and cost of distributed generation docket.
In closing, we delivered on our commitments in 2015. And we are well positioned for 2016 in the long-term with a clear plan on the strong leadership team in place to deliver on the plan.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

Be",1338,"Thank you, Don, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. As you can see, on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a solid year and ended on a strong note. Before I review the details of our 2015 results, let me touch on a few highlights from the quarter.
For the fourth quarter of 2015, we earned $0.37 per share, compared to $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Slide 4 outlines the variances, which drove the increase in our quarterly earnings per share. Looking at gross margin, higher retail sales, favorable weather and the assessment mechanism were all positive contributors. Also, as we anticipated, lower operational and maintenance in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 2014 improved earnings largely due to lower plant averages.
Now turning to Slide 5, let's review some of the details of our full year results. We delivered positive results in the top 10 of our guidance range, earning $3.92 per share compared to $3.58 per share in 2014, and consolidated ROU of 9.77%, which was in line with our goal of achieving more the 9.5%.
Gross margin was a positive driver for the year, including favorable year-over-year weather. The adjustment mechanisms were also earning accretive in 2015 including the lost fixed cost recovery revenue, transmission and our Arizona program. The Four Corners that went into effect in January 1, 2015, was the largest driver in gross margin, however, keep in mind that the Four Corners was was largely offset in D&A.
by APS customers in 2015 versus 2014 contributed to earnings. Weather normalized retail kilowatt hour sales after taxes energy efficiency, customer behavior and distributed generation were up 1%, year-over-year.
2015 was our strongest year for retail sales growth since 2008, including 3 of our Four Corners, in which combined customers and usage growth outweighed the impact of energy efficiency and distributed generation.
Operations and maintenance was lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due in part due our ongoing cost management efforts. The largest reductions include a decrease in employee benefit cost, and the lower cost related to fossil plant averages.
Lower interest expense net of was another benefit to earnings to 2015, compared to 2014. The decrease included reduce charges resulting from refinancing long-term debt and lower rates, and higher construction working progress balances, benefiting.
Higher depreciation and amortization expense was a primary headwind to 2015 earnings as compared to 2014.
As we reported all year, higher D&A decreased earnings due impart to the absence of the 2014 Four Corners cost, and related 2015 amortization of the deferrals in the cost associated with the Four Corners acquisition in 2013. Additional planting service also reduced year-over-year earnings.
Because Arizona is common part of our business story, let me highlight few of the trends we are seeing in our local economy, in particular, the Metro Phoenix area.
By and large, when we see on Slide 6, is the continuation of the consistent growth trends we've been describing for you the last couple of years. Job growth in the fourth quarter in the Metro Phoenix area remained above the national average, as it has for the past 18 quarters. As seen on the upper panel, Metro Phoenix added jobs at a 2.8% year-over-year rate. This job growth is broad-based with the construction, healthcare, tourism, financial, business sectors, Consumer Services sectors, each adding jobs at a rate about 3%. Notably, the construction sector, at when adding jobs in the last 2 quarters at a rate of about 7%, growth in consumer Phoenix is robust, and as the market strengthened.
Our expectation for the Metro Phoenix can be seen on the lower panel.
In 2015, the housing market recorded it's best year since 2007, from both total permits and has been family sector, by itself, with almost 22,000 permits and 15,000 respectively.  This level of single-family permit activity represents an increase over the prior year of almost 50%. As you can see on the slide, we expect to have the market to improve in 2016 with total housing permits within the range of 25,000 to 32,000.
In summary, the Metro Phoenix economy continues to grow steadily and is positioned for stronger growth in the next couple of years.
As I mentioned before, Arizona and the Metro Phoenix remains attractive places to lives and do business, especially as it is situated relative to the high-cost California market. 2015 was better than 2014 in terms of job growth, income growth, consumer spending and new construction and we expect to see 2016 to be better than 2015.
Reflecting the steady improvement in the economic conditions, APS's retain customer base grew 1.3%, compared with the fourth quarter last year and 1.2% year-over-year. We expect that this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth, and the economic development in Arizona appeared to be in place.
Now, I'll review our earnings guidance and financial outlook.
Last quarter, we issued Pinnacle West consolidated ongoing earnings for 2016, which we continue to expect to be the range of $3.90 to $4.10 per share.
The adjusted mechanism, particularly transmission and the LFCR, along with modest sales growth in normal weather remained the key gross margin drivers. O&M is above trend in 2016. However, non-outage O&M spend remains flat. As you may recall, last year, we reported that we have moved a plant Four Corners unit from 2015 to 2016. 2016 includes major planned of both Four Corners and. The planned 82-day major Four Corners Units 5 started in January, which creates a Q1 2016 earnings headwind of about $0.13 quarter-over-quarter. Keep in mind, this was factored into our guidance.
Overall,, our focus remains on our cost management efforts as we look through 2016 and beyond, but the averages are our priority for us this year. One other comment on O&M, the status of our pension plans remains strong at 88%, as of year-end 2015. The continued implementation of our liability driven Investment Strategy has helped us keep cost down. There is a slide in the appendix, which additional details on our pension plan.
You will find a complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance in the Phoenix to slides which are unchanged.
As Don mentioned, our balance sheet remains strong. I will outline our financial plan and how the impact of bonus depreciation has factored in. We have already assumed a two-year bonus depreciation and that was incorporated to our rate basis closure in the last earnings call. Our updated estimates can be found in the appendix, which show an incremental reduction in rate base of approximately $200 million in 2018 as a result of the depreciation.
However, the extension also resulted in approximately $550 million of total cash benefit through 2019, which provides financing flexibility over that time horizon. In terms of capital expenditures, we anticipate APS's spend average around $1.2 billion annually from 2016 to 2018, which will be primarily funded through internally generated cash flow. With this capital spending level taking into account the depreciation, we continue to expect our rate base to grow at average annual rate of 6% to 7% through 2018.
Turning to 2016 financing, we planned to refinance a $250 million maturity in August, and anticipate additional long-term debt. Overall, the quarter remains very strong. At the end of 2015, neither Pinnacle West or APS had any short-term debt outstanding.
In summary, given the strength of our balance sheet, coupled with the extensive of bonus depreciation, we no longer forecast the need for additional equity. The net effect of bonus depreciation and the removal of equity leads a relatively new from earnings perspective.
We will continue to review our capital forecast to identify additional investment opportunities as we move forward.
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

296957,321990055,937181,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2016",2016-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Paul, and thank you all for joining us today.Pinnacle West delivered a solid 2015 with earnings near the high end of our guidance range with Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station having a record year and with the balance sheet that remains one o",991,"Thanks, Paul, and thank you all for joining us today.
Pinnacle West delivered a solid 2015 with earnings near the high end of our guidance range with Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station having a record year and with the balance sheet that remains one of the strongest in the industry. Jim will discuss the financial results and outlook. My comments will focus mostly on the year ahead.
Our fleet performed very well in 2015, highlighted by Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Stations highest output every, equating to a capacity factor of 94.3%. One of Palo Verde's key strengths is the ability of the team to perform at an excellent level but to also drive continuous improvement in each year.
2016 marks the beginning of a new period for our feet. In total, we are planning to invest over $3.6 billion in capital over the next 3 years. We're investing in 2 large projects in our fossil fleet as well as a few innovative investments and some IT systems to prepare our operations for the long term. The 2 large fossil projects are the Ocotillo Modernization Project and the selective catalytic reduction pollution controls, or SCR as they're called, at the Four Corners generating plant.
Four Corners Unit 5 entered a major outage in January to make several upgrades and begin laying the groundwork for the SCR installations. The innovative investments I will outline are designed to increase customer and system reliability and meet future resource needs. In November, we announced the partnership with the Department of The Navy to develop a 25-megawatt microgrid project at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma. This is APS's first microgrid project in the first military base to secure 100% backup power.
We also plan to install a 40-megawatt solar facility this year on behalf of some of our larger customers. This amount has been reflected in our 2016 CapEx budget.
The Solar Partner Program, which is planned for 1500 APS-owned rooftop solar installations, is on track to be fully installed and operational by mid-2016. And just this month, we officially launched our solar innovation study, a 75-home demand rate laboratory here in the Metro Phoenix area, which will determine how customers can use various combinations of distributed energy resources such as solar panels, battery storage, smart thermostats and high-efficiency HVAC systems to better manage their energy environments. These customers will also be placed on our existing residential demand rate, and the study will provide valuable information on a customer's ability to use technology to manage the peak demand and lower their bills.
In addition to generation investments, we're upgrading several IT systems to improve our customer interface, facilitate active operation of our transmission and distribution systems and enable participation in the California ISO - Energy Imbalance Market. These investments along with our advanced meter program, which is fully deployed, are enabling integration of advanced technologies while also allowing us to maintain grid stability.
2016 also represents an important year on the regulatory calendar with the APS rate case set to be filed on June 1. APS submitted the notice of intent to file on January 29, which gives notice to the ACC and stakeholders and outlines primary topics we will propose in the June rate filing. APS will propose the new rates go into effect July 1, 2017, based on the test year ended December 31, 2015, with certain adjustments.
To help achieve this outcome, we have held a series of stakeholder meetings to provide clarity and transparency with the stakeholders. We're also planning to submit an extensive list of standard discovery questions and responses with the June 1st filing.
Let me outline a few of the central topics from the notice of intent to filing. Residential rate design is an area where we will propose changes to better align costs with prices and incentivize cost-reducing technologies. And we will be proposing universal demand rates as well as shifting our time of use periods to later in the day. We will also propose a revenue per customer decoupling mechanism that will be adjusted annually to replace the existing lost fixed-cost recovery mechanism. The decoupling mechanism will be proposed on a trial basis until the next rate case to act as a rate-stabilizing mechanism during the transition period to the new rate structure.
The last item I'll mention is we will request the deferral of costs related to 2 large CapEx projects we're investing in the SCs -- excuse me, SCRs at Four Corners and the first ramping natural gas modernization project at Ocotillo. These investments total over $900 million over the next few years, with in-service dates of 2018 and 2019, respectively.
And in the case of the SCRs, since the timing of installations will be close to the end of this rate case, we'll also propose a step mechanism to reflect the deferred SCR cost similar to the treatment of the Four Corners acquisition.
The docket on value and cost of distributed generation has testimony due on February 25. There also 4 other electric rate cases in process. UNS Electric is the first in line with hearings set to begin on March 1 in Tucson. We are an active intervenor in the UNS case since it is an important forum to discuss rate design. The testimony we filed supports the concept of 3-part rate design, which incorporates a fixed service charge and energy charge and a demand charge. This concept was also proposed and supported by UNS Electric and the ACC staff. Related topics including methodologies for determining the cost to serve customers with solar and the value of solar will be a central focus in the value and cost of distributed generation docket.
In closing, we delivered on our commitments in 2015. And we are well-positioned for 2016 in the long-term, with a clear plan and a strong leadership team in place to deliver on the plan.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a solid year and ended on a strong note.
Before I review the details of our 2015 results, let me touch on a few highlights from the quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2015, we earned $0.37 per share, compared to $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Slide 4 outlines the variances which drove the increase in our quarterly earnings per share. Looking at gross margin, higher retail sales, favorable weather and the adjustment mechanism were all positive contributors. Also, as we anticipated, lower operations in maintenance business in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 2014 improved earnings largely due to lower planned fossil outages.
Now turning to Slide 5, let's review some of the details of our full year results. We delivered positive results in the top 10 of our guidance range, earning $3.92 per share compared to $3.58 per share in 2014, and [indiscernible] a consolidated ROE of 9.77%, which was in line with our goal of achieving more the 9.5%.
Gross margin was a positive driver for the year, including favorable year-over-year weather. The adjustment mechanisms were also earnings accretive in 2015, including the lost fixed cost recovery mechanism, transmission and our AZ Sun Program. The Four Corners rate change that went into effect on January 1, 2015, was the largest driver in gross margin. However, keep in mind that the Four Corners rate change was largely offset in D&A.
Power usage by APS customers in 2015 versus 2014 contributed to earnings. Weather normalized, retail kilowatt hour sales, updated effects of energy efficiency, customer behavior and distributed generation were up 7/10 to 1%, year-over-year.
2015 was our strongest year for retail sales growth since 2008, including 3 on Four Corners, in which combined customer and usage growth outweighed the impacts of energy efficiency and distributed generation.
Operations and maintenance expense was lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due in part to our ongoing cost management efforts. The largest reductions include a decrease in employee benefit costs and lower costs related to fossil plant outages.
Lower interest expense net of AFUDC was another benefit to earnings in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease included reduce charges resulting from refinancing long-term debt and a lower rate and higher construction in work-in-progress balances, benefiting AFUDC.
Higher depreciation and amortization expense was the primary headwind to 2015 earnings as compared to 2014.
As we reported all year, higher D&A decreased earnings due in part to the absence of the 2014 Four Corners cost deferrals and related 2015 amortization of the deferrals in the costs associated with the Four Corners acquisition in 2013. Additional planting service also reduced year-over-year earnings.
Because Arizona is [indiscernible] commonly as an integral part of our business story, let me highlight to you the trends we are seeing in our local economy and in particular, the Metro Phoenix area.
By and large, what you see on Slide 6 is the continuation of the consistent growth trends we have been describing for you the last couple of years. Job growth in the fourth quarter in the Metro Phoenix area remained above the national average as it has for the past 18 quarters. As seen on the upper panel, Metro Phoenix added jobs at a 2.8% year-over-year rate. This job growth is broad-based with the construction, healthcare, tourism, financial, business sectors, consumer services sectors each adding jobs at a rate above 3%. Notably, the construction sector has been adding jobs in the last 2 quarters at a rate of above 7%. Growth in consumer spending remains robust, and the healthy market continues to strengthen.
Our expectation for the Metro Phoenix housing permits can be seen on the lower panel. In 2015, the housing market recorded it's best year since 2007, from both total permits and the single-family sector by itself, with almost 22,000 permits and 15,000 permits, respectively. This level of single-family permit activity represents an increase over the prior year of almost 50%. As you can see on the slide, we expect the housing market to improve in 2016, with total housing permits within a range of 25,000 to 32,000.
In summary, the Metro Phoenix economy continues to grow steadily and is positioned for stronger growth in the next couple of years.
As I had mentioned before, Arizona and the Metro Phoenix remain attractive places to live and do business, especially as it is situated relative to the high-cost California market. 2015 was better than 2014 in terms of job growth, income growth, consumer spending and new construction, and we expect to see 2016 to be better than 2015.
Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retain customer base grew 1.3%, compared with the fourth quarter last year and 1.2% year-over-year. We expect that this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place.
Now, I'll review our earnings guidance and financial outlook.
Last quarter, we issued Pinnacle West consolidated ongoing earnings for 2016, which we continue to expect to be the range of $3.90 to $4.10 per share. The adjusted mechanism, particularly transmission and the LFCR along with modest sales growth and normal weather, remained the key gross margin drivers. O&M is above trend in 2016. However, non-outage O&M spend remains flat. As you may recall, last year we reported that we had moved a planned Four Corners unit outage from 2015 to 2016. 2016 includes major planned outages of both Four Corners and Toya [ph]. The planned 82-day major overhaul at Four Corners Unit 5 started in January, which creates a Q1 2016 earnings headwind of about $0.13 quarter-over-quarter. Keep in mind, this was factored into our guidance.
Overall,, our focus remains on our cost management efforts as we look through 2016 and beyond, but the outages are a priority for us this year. One other comment on O&M, the funded status of our pension plan remains strong at 88%, as of year-end 2015. The continued implementation of our liability-driven investment strategy has helped us keep costs down. There is a slide in the appendix with additional details on our pension plan.
You'll find a complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance in the appendix to our slides which are unchanged.
As Don mentioned, our balance sheet remains strong. I will outline our financial plan and how the impact of bonus depreciation has factored in. We had already assumed a two-year extension of bonus depreciation that was incorporated to our rate base disclosures in the last earnings call. Our updated estimates can be found in the appendix would show an incremental reduction in rate base of approximately $200 million in 2018 as a result of the bonus depreciation.
However, the extension also resulted in approximately $550 million of total cash benefits to 2019, which provides financing flexibility over that time horizon. In terms of capital expenditures, we anticipate APS's spend to average around $1.2 billion annually from 2016 to 2018, which will be primarily funded through internally generated cash flow. With this capital spending level taking into account the bonus depreciation, we continue to expect our rate base to grow at a average annual rate of 6% to 7% through 2018.
Turning to 2016 financing, we plan to refinance the $250-million maturity in August and anticipate issuance of [indiscernible] of additional long-term debt. Overall, the quarter remains very strong. At the end of 2015, neither Pinnacle West nor APS had any short-term debt outstanding.
In summary, given the strength of our balance sheet coupled with the extension of bonus depreciation, we no longer forecast the need for additional equity. The net effect of bonus depreciation and the removal of equity leaves us relatively neutral from an earnings perspective. We will continue to review our capital forecast to identify additional investment opportunities as we move forward.
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

296957,321990055,937200,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2016",2016-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Paul, and thank you all for joining us today.Pinnacle West delivered a solid 2015 with earnings near the high end of our guidance range with Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station having a record year and with the balance sheet that remains one o",990,"Thanks, Paul, and thank you all for joining us today.
Pinnacle West delivered a solid 2015 with earnings near the high end of our guidance range with Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station having a record year and with the balance sheet that remains one of the strongest in the industry. Jim will discuss the financial results and outlook. My comments will focus mostly on the year ahead.
Our fleet performed very well in 2015, highlighted by Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Stations highest output every, equating to a capacity factor of 94.3%. One of Palo Verde's key strengths is the ability of the team to perform at an excellent level but to also drive continuous improvement in each year.
2016 marks the beginning of a new period for our fleet. In total, we are planning to invest over $3.6 billion in capital over the next 3 years. We're investing in 2 large projects in our fossil fleet, as well as a few innovative investments and some IT systems to prepare our operations for the long term. The 2 large fossil projects are the Ocotillo Modernization Project and the selective catalytic reduction pollution controls, or SCRs as they're called, at the Four Corners generating plant.
Four Corners Unit 5 entered a major outage in January to make several upgrades and begin laying the groundwork for the SCR installations. The innovative investments I will outline are designed to increase customer and system reliability and meet future resource needs. In November, we announced the partnership with the Department of The Navy to develop a 25-megawatt microgrid project at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma. This is APS's first microgrid project, and the first military base to secure 100% backup power.
We also plan to install a 40-megawatt solar facility this year on behalf of some of our larger customers. This amount has been reflected in our 2016 CapEx budget.
The Solar Partner Program, which is planned for 1500 APS-owned rooftop solar installations, is on track to be fully installed and operational by mid-2016. And just this month, we officially launched our solar innovation study, a 75-home demand rate laboratory here in the Metro Phoenix area, which will determine how customers can use various combinations of distributed energy resources such as solar panels, battery storage, smart thermostats and high-efficiency HVAC systems to better manage their energy environments. These customers will also be placed on our existing residential demand rate, and the study will provide valuable information on a customer's ability to use technology to manage the peak demand and lower their bills.
In addition to generation investments, we're upgrading several IT systems to improve our customer interface, facilitate active operation of our transmission and distribution systems and enable participation in the California ISO - Energy Imbalance Market. These investments along with our advanced meter program, which is fully deployed, are enabling integration of advanced technologies while also allowing us to maintain grid stability.
2016 also represents an important year on the regulatory calendar with the APS rate case set to be filed on June 1. APS submitted the notice of intent to file on January 29, which gives notice to the ACC and stakeholders and outlines the primary topics we will propose in the June rate filing. APS will propose the new rates go into effect July 1, 2017, based on the test year ended December 31, 2015, with certain adjustments.
To help achieve this outcome, we have held a series of stakeholder meetings to provide clarity and transparency with the stakeholders. We're also planning to submit an extensive list of standard discovery questions and responses with the June 1st filing.
Let me outline a few of the central topics from the notice of intent to filing. Residential rate design is an area where we will propose changes to better align costs with prices and incentivize cost-reducing technologies. And we will be proposing universal demand rates as well as shifting our time-of-use periods to later in the day. We will also propose a revenue per customer decoupling mechanism that will be adjusted annually to replace the existing lost fixed-cost recovery mechanism. The decoupling mechanism will be proposed on a trial basis until the next rate case to act as a rate-stabilizing mechanism during the transition period to the new rate structure.
The last item I'll mention is we will request the deferral of costs related to 2 large CapEx projects we're investing in the SCs -- excuse me, SCRs at Four Corners and the first ramping natural gas modernization project at Ocotillo. These investments total over $900 million over the next few years, with in-service dates of 2018 and 2019, respectively.
And in the case of the SCRs, since the timing of installations will be close to the end of this rate case, we'll also propose a step mechanism to reflect the deferred SCR costs, similar to the treatment of the Four Corners acquisition.
The docket on value and cost of distributed generation has testimony due on February 25. There also 4 other electric rate cases in process. UNS Electric is the first in line, with hearings set to begin on March 1 in Tucson. We are an active intervenor in the UNS case since it is an important forum to discuss rate design. The testimony we filed supports the concept of 3-part rate design, which incorporates a fixed service charge, an energy charge and a demand charge. This concept was also proposed and supported by UNS Electric and the ACC staff. Related topics, including methodologies for determining the cost to serve customers with solar and the value of solar, will be a central focus in the value and cost of distributed generation docket.
In closing, we delivered on our commitments in 2015. And we are well-positioned for 2016 in the long-term, with a clear plan and a strong leadership team in place to deliver on the plan.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a solid year and ended on a strong note.
Before I review the details of our 2015 results, let me touch on a few highlights from the quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2015, we earned $0.37 per share, compared to $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Slide 4 outlines the variances which drove the increase in our quarterly earnings per share. Looking at gross margin, higher retail sales, favorable weather and the adjustment mechanism were all positive contributors. Also, as we anticipated, lower operations in maintenance business in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 2014 improved earnings, largely due to lower planned fossil outages.
Now turning to Slide 5, let's review some of the details of our full year results. We delivered positive results in the top 10 of our guidance range, earning $3.92 per share compared to $3.58 per share in 2014, and earned a consolidated ROE of 9.77%, which was in line with our goal of achieving more the 9.5%.
Gross margin was a positive driver for the year, including favorable year-over-year weather. The adjustment mechanisms were also earnings accretive in 2015, including the lost fixed cost recovery mechanism, transmission and our AZ Sun Program. The Four Corners rate change that went into effect on January 1, 2015, was the largest driver in gross margin. However, keep in mind that the Four Corners rate change was largely offset in D&A.
Power usage by APS customers in 2015 versus 2014 contributed to earnings. Weather normalized, retail kilowatt hour sales, updated effects of energy efficiency, customer behavior and distributed generation were up .07 to 1%, year-over-year.
2015 was our strongest year for retail sales growth since 2008, including 3 on Four Corners, in which combined customer and usage growth outweighed the impacts of energy efficiency and distributed generation.
Operations and maintenance expense was lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due in part to our ongoing cost management efforts. The largest reductions include a decrease in employee benefit costs and lower costs related to fossil plant outages.
Lower interest expense net of AFUDC was another benefit to earnings in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease included reduce charges resulting from refinancing long-term debt and a lower rate and higher construction in work-in-progress balances, benefiting AFUDC.
Higher depreciation and amortization expense was the primary headwind to 2015 earnings as compared to 2014.
As we reported all year, higher D&A decreased earnings due in part to the absence of the 2014 Four Corners cost deferrals and related 2015 amortization of the deferrals in the costs associated with the Four Corners acquisition in 2013. Additional planting service also reduced year-over-year earnings.
Because Arizona's economy is an integral part of our business story, let me highlight to you the trends we are seeing in our local economy and in particular, the Metro Phoenix area.
By and large, what you see on Slide 6 is the continuation of the consistent growth trends we have been describing for you the last couple of years. Job growth in the fourth quarter in the Metro Phoenix area remained above the national average, as it has for the past 18 quarters. As seen on the upper panel, Metro Phoenix added jobs at a 2.8% year-over-year rate. This job growth is broad-based with the construction, healthcare, tourism, financial, business sectors, consumer services sectors, each adding jobs at a rate above 3%. Notably, the construction sector has been adding jobs in the last 2 quarters at a rate of above 7%. Growth in consumer spending remains robust, and the healthy market continues to strengthen.
Our expectation for the Metro Phoenix housing permits can be seen on the lower panel. In 2015, the housing market recorded it's best year since 2007, from both total permits and the single-family sector by itself, with almost 22,000 permits and 15,000 permits, respectively. This level of single-family permit activity represents an increase over the prior year of almost 50%. As you can see on the slide, we expect the housing market to improve in 2016, with total housing permits within a range of 25,000 to 32,000.
In summary, the Metro Phoenix economy continues to grow steadily and is positioned for stronger growth in the next couple of years.
As I had mentioned before, Arizona and the Metro Phoenix remain attractive places to live and do business, especially as it is situated relative to the high-cost California market. 2015 was better than 2014 in terms of job growth, income growth, consumer spending and new construction, and we expect to see 2016 to be better than 2015.
Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retain customer base grew 1.3%, compared with the fourth quarter last year and 1.2% year-over-year. We expect that this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place.
Now, I'll review our earnings guidance and financial outlook.
Last quarter, we issued Pinnacle West consolidated ongoing earnings for 2016, which we continue to expect to be the range of $3.90 to $4.10 per share. The adjusted mechanism, particularly transmission and the LFCR along with modest sales growth and normal weather, remained the key gross margin drivers. O&M is above trend in 2016. However, non-outage O&M spend remains flat. As you may recall, last year we reported that we had moved a planned Four Corners unit outage from 2015 to 2016. 2016 includes major planned outages of both Four Corners and Toya [ph]. The planned 82-day major overhaul at Four Corners Unit 5 started in January, which creates a Q1 2016 earnings headwind of about $0.13 quarter-over-quarter. Keep in mind, this was factored into our guidance.
Overall, our focus remains on our cost management efforts as we look through 2016 and beyond, but the outages are a priority for us this year. One other comment on O&M, the funded status of our pension plan remains strong at 88%, as of year-end 2015. The continued implementation of our liability-driven investment strategy has helped us keep costs down. There is a slide in the appendix with additional details on our pension plan.
You'll find a complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance in the appendix to our slides which are unchanged.
As Don mentioned, our balance sheet remains strong. I will outline our financial plan and how the impact of bonus depreciation has factored in. We already assumed a two-year extension of bonus depreciation that was incorporated to our rate base disclosures in the last earnings call. Our updated estimates can be found in the appendix would show an incremental reduction in rate base of approximately $200 million in 2018 as a result of the bonus depreciation.
However, the extension also resulted in approximately $550 million of total cash benefits to 2019, which provides financing flexibility over that time horizon. In terms of capital expenditures, we anticipate APS's spend to average around $1.2 billion annually from 2016 to 2018, which will be primarily funded through internally generated cash flow. With this capital spending level taking into account the bonus depreciation, we continue to expect our rate base to grow at a average annual rate of 6% to 7% through 2018.
Turning to 2016 financing, we plan to refinance the $250-million maturity in August and anticipate issuance of $400 million of additional long-term debt. Overall, the quarter remains very strong. At the end of 2015, neither Pinnacle West nor APS had any short-term debt outstanding.
In summary, given the strength of our balance sheet coupled with the extension of bonus depreciation, we no longer forecast the need for additional equity. The net effect of bonus depreciation and the removal of equity leaves us relatively neutral from an earnings perspective. We will continue to review our capital forecast to identify additional investment opportunities as we move forward.
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

Dan, so there was a extensive discussion in Arizona a few years ago around decoupling mechanisms in general.

296957,321990055,937565,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 19, 2016",2016-02-19,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Paul, and thank you all for joining us today.Pinnacle West delivered a solid 2015 with earnings near the high end of our guidance range with Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station having a record year and with the balance sheet that remains one o",990,"Thanks, Paul, and thank you all for joining us today.
Pinnacle West delivered a solid 2015 with earnings near the high end of our guidance range with Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station having a record year and with the balance sheet that remains one of the strongest in the industry. Jim will discuss the financial results and outlook. My comments will focus mostly on the year ahead.
Our fleet performed very well in 2015, highlighted by Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Stations highest output every, equating to a capacity factor of 94.3%. One of Palo Verde's key strengths is the ability of the team to perform at an excellent level but to also drive continuous improvement in each year.
2016 marks the beginning of a new period for our fleet. In total, we are planning to invest over $3.6 billion in capital over the next 3 years. We're investing in 2 large projects in our fossil fleet, as well as a few innovative investments and some IT systems to prepare our operations for the long term. The 2 large fossil projects are the Ocotillo Modernization Project and the selective catalytic reduction pollution controls, or SCRs as they're called, at the Four Corners generating plant.
Four Corners Unit 5 entered a major outage in January to make several upgrades and begin laying the groundwork for the SCR installations. The innovative investments I will outline are designed to increase customer and system reliability and meet future resource needs. In November, we announced the partnership with the Department of The Navy to develop a 25-megawatt microgrid project at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma. This is APS's first microgrid project, and the first military base to secure 100% backup power.
We also plan to install a 40-megawatt solar facility this year on behalf of some of our larger customers. This amount has been reflected in our 2016 CapEx budget.
The Solar Partner Program, which is planned for 1500 APS-owned rooftop solar installations, is on track to be fully installed and operational by mid-2016. And just this month, we officially launched our solar innovation study, a 75-home demand rate laboratory here in the Metro Phoenix area, which will determine how customers can use various combinations of distributed energy resources such as solar panels, battery storage, smart thermostats and high-efficiency HVAC systems to better manage their energy environments. These customers will also be placed on our existing residential demand rate, and the study will provide valuable information on a customer's ability to use technology to manage the peak demand and lower their bills.
In addition to generation investments, we're upgrading several IT systems to improve our customer interface, facilitate active operation of our transmission and distribution systems and enable participation in the California ISO - Energy Imbalance Market. These investments along with our advanced meter program, which is fully deployed, are enabling integration of advanced technologies while also allowing us to maintain grid stability.
2016 also represents an important year on the regulatory calendar with the APS rate case set to be filed on June 1. APS submitted the notice of intent to file on January 29, which gives notice to the ACC and stakeholders and outlines the primary topics we will propose in the June rate filing. APS will propose the new rates go into effect July 1, 2017, based on the test year ended December 31, 2015, with certain adjustments.
To help achieve this outcome, we have held a series of stakeholder meetings to provide clarity and transparency with the stakeholders. We're also planning to submit an extensive list of standard discovery questions and responses with the June 1st filing.
Let me outline a few of the central topics from the notice of intent to filing. Residential rate design is an area where we will propose changes to better align costs with prices and incentivize cost-reducing technologies. And we will be proposing universal demand rates as well as shifting our time-of-use  periods to later in the day. We will also propose a revenue per customer decoupling mechanism that will be adjusted annually to replace the existing lost fixed-cost recovery mechanism. The decoupling mechanism will be proposed on a trial basis until the next rate case to act as a rate-stabilizing mechanism during the transition period to the new rate structure.
The last item I'll mention is we will request the deferral of costs related to 2 large CapEx projects we're investing in the SCs -- excuse me, SCRs at Four Corners and the first ramping natural gas modernization project at Ocotillo. These investments total over $900 million over the next few years, with in-service dates of 2018 and 2019, respectively.
And in the case of the SCRs, since the timing of installations will be close to the end of this rate case, we'll also propose a step mechanism to reflect the deferred SCR costs, similar to the treatment of the Four Corners acquisition.
The docket on value and cost of distributed generation has testimony due on February 25. There also 4 other electric rate cases in process. UNS Electric is the first in line, with hearings set to begin on March 1 in Tucson. We are an active intervenor in the UNS case since it is an important forum to discuss rate design. The testimony we filed supports the concept of 3-part rate design, which incorporates a fixed service charge, an energy charge and a demand charge. This concept was also proposed and supported by UNS Electric and the ACC staff. Related topics, including methodologies for determining the cost to serve customers with solar and the value of solar, will be a central focus in the value and cost of distributed generation docket.
In closing, we delivered on our commitments in 2015. And we are well-positioned for 2016 in the long-term, with a clear plan and a strong leadership team in place to deliver on the plan.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, we had a solid year and ended on a strong note.
Before I review the details of our 2015 results, let me touch on a few highlights from the quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2015, we earned $0.37 per share, compared to $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Slide 4 outlines the variances which drove the increase in our quarterly earnings per share. Looking at gross margin, higher retail sales, favorable weather and the adjustment mechanism were all positive contributors. Also, as we anticipated, lower operations in maintenance business in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 2014 improved earnings, largely due to lower planned fossil outages.
Now turning to Slide 5, let's review some of the details of our full year results. We delivered positive results in the top 10 of our guidance range, earning $3.92 per share compared to $3.58 per share in 2014, and earned a consolidated ROE of 9.77%, which was in line with our goal of achieving more the 9.5%.
Gross margin was a positive driver for the year, including favorable year-over-year weather. The adjustment mechanisms were also earnings accretive in 2015, including the lost fixed cost recovery mechanism, transmission and our AZ Sun Program. The Four Corners rate change that went into effect on January 1, 2015, was the largest driver in gross margin. However, keep in mind that the Four Corners rate change was largely offset in D&A.
Power usage by APS customers in 2015 versus 2014 contributed to earnings. Weather normalized, retail kilowatt hour sales, updated effects of energy efficiency, customer behavior and distributed generation were up 0.7% to 1%, year-over-year.
2015 was our strongest year for retail sales growth since 2008, including 3 on Four Corners, in which combined customer and usage growth outweighed the impacts of energy efficiency and distributed generation.
Operations and maintenance expense was lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due in part to our ongoing cost management efforts. The largest reductions include a decrease in employee benefit costs and lower costs related to fossil plant outages.
Lower interest expense net of AFUDC was another benefit to earnings in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease included reduce charges resulting from refinancing long-term debt and a lower rate and higher construction in work-in-progress balances, benefiting AFUDC.
Higher depreciation and amortization expense was the primary headwind to 2015 earnings as compared to 2014.
As we reported all year, higher D&A decreased earnings due in part to the absence of the 2014 Four Corners cost deferrals and related 2015 amortization of the deferrals in the costs associated with the Four Corners acquisition in 2013. Additional planting service also reduced year-over-year earnings.
Because Arizona's economy is  an integral part of our business story, let me highlight to you the trends we are seeing in our local economy and in particular, the Metro Phoenix area.
By and large, what you see on Slide 6 is the continuation of the consistent growth trends we have been describing for you the last couple of years. Job growth in the fourth quarter in the Metro Phoenix area remained above the national average as it has for the past 18 quarters. As seen on the upper panel, Metro Phoenix added jobs at a 2.8% year-over-year rate. This job growth is broad-based with the construction, healthcare, tourism, financial, business sectors, consumer services sectors, each adding jobs at a rate above 3%. Notably, the construction sector has been adding jobs in the last 2 quarters at a rate of above 7%. Growth in consumer spending remains robust, and the healthy market continues to strengthen.
Our expectation for the Metro Phoenix housing permits can be seen on the lower panel. In 2015, the housing market recorded its best year since 2007, from both total permits and the single-family sector by itself, with almost 22,000 permits and 15,000 permits, respectively. This level of single-family permit activity represents an increase over the prior year of almost 50%. As you can see on the slide, we expect the housing market to improve in 2016, with total housing permits within a range of 25,000 to 32,000.
In summary, the Metro Phoenix economy continues to grow steadily and is positioned for stronger growth in the next couple of years.
As I had mentioned before, Arizona and the Metro Phoenix remain attractive places to live and do business, especially as it is situated relative to the high-cost California market. 2015 was better than 2014 in terms of job growth, income growth, consumer spending and new construction, and we expect to see 2016 to be better than 2015.
Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retain customer base grew 1.3%, compared with the fourth quarter last year and 1.2% year-over-year. We expect that this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place.
Now, I'll review our earnings guidance and financial outlook.
Last quarter, we issued Pinnacle West consolidated ongoing earnings for 2016, which we continue to expect to be the range of $3.90 to $4.10 per share. The adjusted mechanism, particularly transmission and the LFCR along with modest sales growth and normal weather, remained the key gross margin drivers. O&M is above trend in 2016. However, non-outage O&M spend remains flat. As you may recall, last year we reported that we had moved a planned Four Corners unit outage from 2015 to 2016. 2016 includes major planned outages of both Four Corners and Cholla. The planned 82-day major overhaul at Four Corners Unit 5 started in January, which creates a Q1 2016 earnings headwind of about $0.13 quarter-over-quarter. Keep in mind, this was factored into our guidance.
 Overall, our focus remains on our cost management efforts as we look through 2016 and beyond, but the outages are a priority for us this year. One other comment on O&M, the funded status of our pension plan remains strong at 88%, as of year-end 2015. The continued implementation of our liability-driven investment strategy has helped us keep costs down. There is a slide in the appendix with additional details on our pension plan.
You'll find a complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance in the appendix to our slides which are unchanged.
As Don mentioned, our balance sheet remains strong. I will outline our financial plan and how the impact of bonus depreciation has factored in. We  already assumed a two-year extension of bonus depreciation that was incorporated to our rate base disclosures in the last earnings call. Our updated estimates can be found in the appendix would show an incremental reduction in rate base of approximately $200 million in 2018 as a result of the bonus depreciation.
However, the extension also resulted in approximately $550 million of total cash benefits to 2019, which provides financing flexibility over that time horizon. In terms of capital expenditures, we anticipate APS's spend to average around $1.2 billion annually from 2016 to 2018, which will be primarily funded through internally generated cash flow. With this capital spending level taking into account the bonus depreciation, we continue to expect our rate base to grow at an average annual rate of 6% to 7% through 2018.
  Turning to 2016 financing, we plan to refinance the $250-million maturity in August and anticipate issuance of $400 million of additional long-term debt. Overall, the quarter remains very strong. At the end of 2015, neither Pinnacle West nor APS had any short-term debt outstanding.
In summary, given the strength of our balance sheet coupled with the extension of bonus depreciation, we no longer forecast the need for additional equity. The net effect of bonus depreciation and the removal of equity leaves us relatively neutral from an earnings perspective. We will continue to review our capital forecast to identify additional investment opportunities as we move forward.
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

First, we need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available in our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Today's comments on our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Our first quarter Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as the risk factors and M&DA sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures.

I will now turn the call over to Don."
296957,329868312,967491,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2016",2016-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Paul, and thank you all for joining us today. 2016 has started off with a solid first quarter, very much in line with our expectations, and we remain well positioned to meet our financial commitments this year.

We're focused on operational execution and APS's rate case filing plan for June 1. We had planned outages at both unit at the Four Corners generating fossil plant and at the Palo Verde nuclear generating station. Jim will discuss the financial impacts, but the Four Corners plant outages were the primary headwind in our first quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2015. The Four Corners Unit 5 major outage begin in January, while Unit 4 outage started in March, with both expected online very soon. 
Palo Verde's planned Unit 1 refueling outage began on April 10. Palo Verde continues to perform exceptionally well. The site recently completed a peer evaluation by the World Association of Nuclear operations or WANO, as it's known, and by the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations or INPO, and received exceptionally positive feedback from this evaluation. On a related note, Maria Lacao, who's been instrumental in Palo Verde's success, has been promoted to Senior Vice President of Regulatory and Oversight for Palo Verde. Maria, I know you are listening, so thank you for all you've done to make Palo Verde one of the safest and best-performing nuclear plans in the nation. 
We're making progress in our capital investment program. We're building a 40-megawatt utility scale solar facility known as Red Rock Solar, where our major customers, ASU and PayPal, have agreed to buy the power and will also receive the renewable energy credits. We signed an agreement with the data center that construct the micro grid at their location in North Phoenix. This will be the second micro grid APS is partnering on in our service territory. The first is with the Department of the Navy's Marine Corps Air Station Yuma. The Red Rock Solar and micro grid projects represent unique opportunities to develop innovative solutions for our customers. Additionally, as part of the APS Solar Partner program, we were the first utility in the nation to use advanced technology to manage solar generation through the use of advanced inverters. The inverters APS is using recently received underwriters laboratory certification. This is an important milestone since we require that all equipment on the grid be certified by UL. The advanced inverters allow us full command and control of the devices we own, which includes ramping up or curtailing power and enabling two-way power flows. 
Turning to the regulatory calendar. The Arizona Corporation Commission and staff have been managing a full schedule. The UNS rate case hearings took place in March. We were engaged in the residential rate design portion of that docket. The discussion centered on the deployment of 3-part [ph] rates, which includes an energy component, a demand component and a customer charge. A final decision is expected this summer. We also filed testimony in the value and cost of distributed generation docket. Hearings began on April 18 and are expected to conclude in early May. There is not a set timetable for a decision. The outcome of this docket is anticipated to outline a statewide methodology of how the cost of service for solar customers will be handled as well as how the value of solar will be determined. We do not expect to have decisions on these 2 dockets before our June 1 rate case filing date, but our engagement in each process has provided insight on rate design. Residential rate design is an area where we will propose changes to better align costs with prices, including proposing three-part rates for most potential customers as well as shifting our time of use periods to later in the day. We'll also request the deferral of costs related to 2 large capital projects that we'll be investing in: The selective catalytic reduction controls or SCRs as they're known at Four Corners; and the first ramping natural gas modernization project at our Ocotillo site. These investments total over $900 million over the next few years with in-service dates of 2018 and 2019 prospectively. And in the case of the SCRs, since the timing of installations will be close to the end of this rate case, we'll also propose a step mechanism to reflect the deferred SCR costs similar to the treatment of the Four Corners acquisition. 
Our overall rate filing theme centers on clean energy, sustainability, innovation and technological options for customers. Lastly, I'll comment on a recent development. Earlier this month, a constitutional ballot initiatives supported by SolarCity that was related to distributed generation and ratemaking was filed with the Arizona Secretary of State in an effort to put the initiative on the November 2016 ballot. In response, 2 bills were introduced this week in the Arizona legislature that would have offered competing referendums for Arizona voters to consider. Very late yesterday, the SolarCity ballot initiative and the 2 bills were pulled from consideration. The Arizona utility industry and SolarCity agreed to further dialogue in the future to seek a constructive outcome on net metering. 
In closing, we're delivering on our commitments and continue to be well positioned for a solid year and 2016. We're focused on operational excellence and positioning APS is a sustainable leader through a strategic capital investments and a forward-thinking rate filing. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2016, which were in line with our expectations. As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, for the first q",902,"Thank you, Don, and thank you again, everyone, for joining us on the call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2016, which were in line with our expectations. As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, for the first quarter of 2016, we earned $0.04 per share compared to $0.14 per share in the first quarter of 2015. The primary drivers were a higher gross margin offset by higher operations and maintenance expense. Several factors contributed to the gross margin in the first quarter, including favorable weather. The net effect of weather variations increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Although weather on both 2016 and 2015 first quarter were less favorable than the normal 10-year averages, heating degree days were 57% higher in the first quarter of this year compared to last year. Higher usage by APS's customers compared to the first quarter a year ago added $0.01 to gross margin. Weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales increased 1.3% in the first quarter of 2016 versus 2015. The transmission adjustment mechanism in the Arizona Sun Program also added to the first quarter gross margin. We still expect the lost fixed cost recovery mechanism or LFCR to be a positive driver for the year, but favorability will be more heavily weighted in the second half of the year. 
Now turning to O&M. As Don mentioned earlier, higher O&M was a primary headwind to first quarter 2016 earnings compared to 2015, largely driven by the major planned outages at Four Corners Unit 5 that began in late January. In line with our expectations, the average cost decreased earnings by about $0.13 quarter-over-quarter. The Four Corners Unit 4 and 5 plant outages were both concluded in the second quarter, will provide a headwind similar to the first quarter consistent with guidance. 
Lastly, a brief note on depreciation and amortization expenses. Lower D&A increased earnings by $0.01 in the first quarter. This variance includes higher expenses resulting from additional plant service, which were offset by lower depreciation related to the extension of the Palo Verde's sale leaseback. As Arizona's economy continues to be an integral part of our business story, I'll highlight next the trends we are seeing in the local economy, and in particular, the Metro Phoenix area. 
What you see on Slide 4 is a continuation of the consistent growth trend we have been describing for you the last couple of years. Job growth in the first quarter of 2016 in the Metro Phoenix area remained above the national average as it has for nearly 5 years. As seen on the upper panel, Metro Phoenix added jobs at a 3.6% year-over-year rate. This job growth is broad-based with construction, business services, financial services and health care showing strong sectoral strength, adding jobs at a clip above 4% year-over-year. The job growth in Phoenix economy is driving robust population migration. Of the 15 largest U.S. Metro areas, Phoenix ranked third in nation in 2015 population growth, behind only Houston and Dallas, which has influenced some trends in the Metro Phoenix housing permits as can be seen in the lower panel of Slide 4. In 2015, Phoenix solar housing market record its best year since 2007 for both total permits and the single-family sector by itself at almost 22,000 permits and 15,000 permits, respectively. This growth trend continued in the first [ph] quarter of 2016 as single-family permits grew nearly 35% over last year's first quarter. We expect the housing market to continue to improve throughout this year with annual total housing permits falling in the range of 25,000 to 32,000. 
In summary, the Metro Phoenix economy continues to grow steadily and is positioned for stronger growth over the next couple of years. Additionally, Arizona and Metro Phoenix remain attractive places to live and do business, especially as they are situated relative to the large, but higher cost California market. 
Reflecting the steady improvement and economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.3% compared with the first quarter last year. We expect that this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
In closing, I will review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated ongoing earnings for 2016 will be in the range of $3.90 to $41.0 per share. The adjustment mechanisms, particularly transmission and the LFCR along with modest sales growth and normal weather, remained the key gross margin drivers. You will find a complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance included on Slide 5, which are unchanged from last year. 
Looking ahead to 2016 financing, we plan to refinance a $250 [ph] million August maturities and anticipate issuing up to $400 million of additional long-term debt. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity remains very strong. During the first quarter, APS increased its commercial paper program to $250 million to $500 million. At end of the quarter, Pinnacle West had no short-term borrowings and APS had $262 million of commercial paper outstanding.  Finally, our rate case growth outlook remains 6% to 7% through [ph] 2018 and our forecast does not include the need for additional equity. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

First, we need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available in our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Today's comments on our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Our first quarter Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as the risk factors and M&DA sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures.

I will now turn the call over to Don."
296957,329868312,967649,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2016",2016-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Paul, and thank you all for joining us today. 2016 has started off with a solid first quarter, very much in line with our expectations, and we remain well positioned to meet our financial commitments this year.

We're focused on operational execution and APS's rate case filing plan for June 1. We had planned outages at both units at the Four Corners generating fossil plant and at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station. Jim will discuss the financial impacts, but the Four Corners plant outages were the primary headwind in our first quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2015. The Four Corners Unit 5 major outage begin in late January, while Unit 4 outage started in March, with both expected online very soon. 
Palo Verde's planned Unit 1 refueling outage on -- began on April 10. Palo Verde continues to perform exceptionally well. The site recently completed a peer evaluation by the World Association of Nuclear operations or WANO, as it's known, and by the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations or INPO, and received exceptionally positive feedback from this evaluation. On a related note, Maria Lacao, who's been instrumental in Palo Verde's success, has been promoted to Senior Vice President of Regulatory and Oversight for Palo Verde. Maria, I know you are listening, so thank you for all you've done to make Palo Verde one of the safest and best-performing nuclear plans in the nation.
We're making progress on our capital investment program. We're building a 40-megawatt utility scale solar facility known as Red Rock Solar, where our major customers, ASU and PayPal, have agreed to buy the power and will also receive the renewable energy credits. We signed an agreement with the data center that construct the micro grid at their location in North Phoenix. This will be the second micro grid, APS is partnering on, in our service territory. The first is with the Department of the Navy's Marine Corps Air Station Yuma. The Red Rock Solar and micro grid projects represent unique opportunities to develop innovative solutions for our customers. Additionally, as part of the APS Solar Partner program, we are the first utility in the nation to use advanced technology to manage solar generation through the use of advanced inverters. The inverters APS is using recently received underwriters laboratory certification. This is an important milestone since we require that all equipment on the grid be certified by UL. The advanced inverters allow us full command and control of the devices we own, which includes ramping up or curtailing power and enabling two-way power flows.
Turning to the regulatory calendar. The Arizona Corporation Commission and staff have been managing a full schedule. The UNS rate case hearings took place in March. We were engaged in the residential rate design portion of that docket. The discussion centered on the deployment of three-part rates, which include an energy component, a demand component and a customer charge. A final decision is expected this summer. We also filed testimony in the value and cost of distributed generation docket. Hearings began on April 18 and are expected to conclude in early May. There is not a set timetable for a decision. The outcome of this docket is anticipated to outline a statewide methodology of how the cost of service for solar customers will be handled as well as how the value of solar will be determined. We do not expect to have decisions on these 2 dockets before our June 1 rate case filing date, but our engagement in each process has provided insight on rate design. Residential rate design is an area where we will propose changes to better align costs with prices, including proposing three-part rates for most residential customers as well as shifting our time of used periods to later in the day. We'll also request the deferral of costs related to 2 large capital projects that we'll be investing in: the selective catalytic reduction controls or SCRs, as they're known, at Four Corners; and the first ramping natural gas modernization project at our Ocotillo site. These investments total over $900 million over the next few years with in-service dates of 2018 and 2019 respectively. And in the case of the SCRs, since the timing of installations will be close to the end of this rate case, we'll also propose a step mechanism to reflect the deferred SCR costs similar to the treatment of the Four Corners acquisition.
Our overall rate filing theme centers on clean energy, sustainability, innovation and technological options for customers. Lastly, I'll comment on a recent development. Earlier this month, a constitutional ballot initiative supported by SolarCity that was related to distributed generation and ratemaking was filed with the Arizona Secretary of State in an effort to put the initiative on the November 2016 ballot. In response, 2 bills were introduced this week in the Arizona legislature that would have offered competing referendums for Arizona voters to consider. Very late yesterday, the SolarCity ballot initiative and the 2 bills were pulled from consideration. The Arizona utility industry and SolarCity agreed to further dialogue in the future to seek a constructive outcome on net metering.
In closing, we're delivering on our commitments and continue to be well positioned for a solid year in 2016. We're focused on operational excellence and positioning APS as a sustainable leader through a strategic capital investments and a forward-thinking rate filing. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2016, which were in line with our expectations. As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, for the first q",903,"Thank you, Don, and thank you again, everyone, for joining us on the call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2016, which were in line with our expectations. As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, for the first quarter of 2016, we earned $0.04 per share compared to $0.14 per share in the first quarter of 2015. The primary drivers were a higher gross margin offset by higher operations and maintenance expense. Several factors contributed to the gross margin in the first quarter, including favorable weather. The net effect of weather variations increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Although weather on both 2016 and 2015 first quarters were less favorable than the normal 10-year averages, heating degree days were 57% higher in the first quarter of this year compared to last year. Higher usage by APS's customers compared to the first quarter a year ago added $0.01 to gross margin. Weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales increased 1.3% in the first quarter of 2016 versus 2015. The transmission adjustment mechanism in the Arizona Sun Program also added to the first quarter gross margin. We still expect the lost fixed cost recovery mechanism or LFCR to be a positive driver for the year, but favorability will be more heavily weighted in the second half of the year.
Now turning to O&M. As Don mentioned earlier, higher O&M was a primary headwind to first quarter 2016 earnings compared to 2015, largely driven by the major planned outages at Four Corners Unit 5 that began in late January. In line with our expectations, the average cost decreased earnings by about $0.13 quarter-over-quarter. The Four Corners Unit 4 and 5 plant outages were both concluded in the second quarter, which will provide a headwind similar to the first quarter consistent with guidance.
Lastly, a brief note on depreciation and amortization expenses. Lower D&A increased earnings by $0.01 in the first quarter. This variance includes higher expenses resulting from additional plant service, which were offset by lower depreciation related to the extension of the Palo Verde's sale leaseback. As Arizona's economy continues to be an integral part of our business story, I'll highlight next, the trends we are seeing in the local economy, and in particular, the Metro Phoenix area.
What you see on Slide 4 is a continuation of the consistent growth trend we have been describing for you the last couple of years. Job growth in the first quarter of 2016 in the Metro Phoenix area remained above the national average as it has for nearly 5 years. As seen on the upper panel, Metro Phoenix added jobs at a 3.6% year-over-year rate. This job growth is broad-based with construction, business services, financial services and health care showing strong sectoral strength, adding jobs at a clip above 4% year-over-year. The job growth in Phoenix economy is driven -- is driving robust population migration. Of the 15 largest U.S. Metro areas, Phoenix ranked third in nation in 2015 population growth, behind only Houston and Dallas, which has influenced some trends in the Metro Phoenix housing permits as can be seen in the lower panel of Slide 4. In 2015, Phoenix solar housing market record its best year since 2007 for both total permits and the single-family sector by itself at almost 22,000 permits and 15,000 permits, respectively. This growth trend continued in the first quarter of 2016 as single-family permits grew nearly 35% over last year's first quarter. We expect the housing market to continue to improve throughout this year with annual total housing permits falling in the range of 25,000 to 32,000.
In summary, the Metro Phoenix economy continues to grow steadily and is positioned for stronger growth over the next couple of years. Additionally, Arizona and Metro Phoenix remain attractive places to live and do business, especially as they are situated relative to the large, but higher cost California market.
Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.3% compared with the first quarter last year. We expect that this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place.
In closing, I will review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated ongoing earnings for 2016 will be in the range of $3.90 to $4.10 per share. The adjustment mechanisms, particularly transmission and the LFCR along with modest sales growth and normal weather, remained the key gross margin drivers. You will find a complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance included on Slide 5, which are unchanged from last year.
Looking ahead to 2016 financing, we plan to refinance a $250 million August maturity and anticipate issuing up to $400 million of additional long-term debt. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity remains very strong. During the first quarter, APS increased its commercial paper program from $250 million to $500 million. At end of the quarter, Pinnacle West had no short-term borrowings and APS had $262 million of commercial paper outstanding.  Finally, our rate case growth outlook remains 6% to 7% through 2018 and our forecast does not include the need for additional equity. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

First, we need to cover a few details with you. The slides that we will be using are available in our Investor Relations website, along with our earnings release and related information. Note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Today's comments on our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Our first quarter Form 10-Q was filed this morning. Please refer to that document for forward-looking statements, cautionary language as well as the risk factors and M&DA sections, which identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our disclosures.

I will now turn the call over to Don."
296957,329868312,967797,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2016",2016-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Paul, and thank you all for joining us today. 2016 has started off with a solid first quarter, very much in line with our expectations, and we remain well positioned to meet our financial commitments this year.

We're focused on operational execution and APS's rate case filing planned for June 1. We have had planned outages at both units at the Four Corners generating fossil plant and at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station. Jim will discuss the financial impacts, but the Four Corners plant outages were the primary headwind in our first quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2015. The Four Corners Unit 5 major outage begin in late January, while Unit 4's outage started in March, with both expected online very soon. 
Palo Verde's planned Unit 1 refueling outage on -- began on April 10. Palo Verde continues to perform exceptionally well. The site recently completed a peer evaluation by the World Association of Nuclear operations, or WANO as it's known, and by the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, or INPO, and received exceptionally positive feedback from this evaluation. On a related note, Maria Lacao, who's been instrumental in Palo Verde's success, has been promoted to Senior Vice President of Regulatory and Oversight for Palo Verde. Maria, I know you are listening, so thank you for all you've done to make Palo Verde one of the safest and best-performing nuclear plants in the nation.
We're making progress on our capital investment program. We're building a 40-megawatt utility scale solar facility known as Red Rock Solar, where our major customers, ASU and PayPal, have agreed to buy the power and will also receive the renewable energy credits. We signed an agreement with the data center to construct the micro grid at their location in North Phoenix. This will be the second micro grid APS is partnering on in our service territory. The first is with the Department of the Navy's Marine Corps Air Station Yuma. The Red Rock Solar and micro grid projects represent unique opportunities to develop innovative solutions for our customers. Additionally, as part of the APS Solar Partner program, we are the first utility in the nation to use advanced technology to manage solar generation through the use of advanced inverters. The inverters APS is using recently received Underwriters Laboratory certification. This is an important milestone since we require that all equipment on the grid be certified by UL. The advanced inverters allow us full command and control of the devices we own, which includes ramping up or curtailing power and enabling two-way power flows.
Turning to the regulatory calendar. The Arizona Corporation Commission and staff have been managing a full schedule. The UNS rate case hearings took place in March. We were engaged in the residential rate design portion of that docket. The discussion centered on the deployment of three-part rates, which include an energy component, a demand component and a customer charge. A final decision is expected this summer. We also filed testimony in the value and cost of distributed generation docket. Hearings began on April 18 and are expected to conclude in early May. There is not a set timetable for a decision. The outcome of this docket is anticipated to outline a statewide methodology of how the cost of service for solar customers will be handled as well as how the value of solar will be determined. We do not expect to have decisions on these 2 dockets before our June 1 rate case filing date, but our engagement in each process has provided insight on rate design. Residential rate design is an area where we will propose changes to better align costs with prices, including proposing three-part rates for most residential customers as well as shifting our time of use periods to later in the day. We'll also request the deferral of costs related to 2 large capital projects that we'll be investing in: the selective catalytic reduction controls or SCRs, as they're known, at Four Corners; and the fast ramping natural gas modernization project at our Ocotillo site. These investments total over $900 million over the next few years with in-service dates of 2018 and 2019 respectively. And in the case of the SCRs, since the timing of installations will be close to the end of this rate case, we'll also propose a step mechanism to reflect the deferred SCR costs similar to the treatment of the Four Corners acquisition.
Our overall rate filing theme centers on clean energy, sustainability, innovation and technological options for customers. Lastly, I'll comment on a recent development. Earlier this month, a constitutional ballot initiative supported by SolarCity that was related to distributed generation and ratemaking was filed with the Arizona Secretary of State in an effort to put the initiative on the November 2016 ballot. In response, 2 bills were introduced this week in the Arizona legislature that would have offered competing referendums for Arizona voters to consider. Very late yesterday, the SolarCity ballot initiative and the 2 bills were pulled from consideration. The Arizona utility industry and SolarCity agreed to further dialogue in the future to seek a constructive outcome on net metering.
In closing, we're delivering on our commitments and continue to be well positioned for a solid year in 2016. We're focused on operational excellence and positioning APS as a sustainable leader through strategic capital investments and a forward-thinking rate filing. I'll now turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2016, which were in line with our expectations. As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, for the first q",903,"Thank you, Don, and thank you again, everyone, for joining us on the call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the first quarter of 2016, which were in line with our expectations. As you can see on Slide 3 of the materials, for the first quarter of 2016, we earned $0.04 per share compared to $0.14 per share in the first quarter of 2015. The primary drivers were a higher gross margin offset by higher operations and maintenance expense. Several factors contributed to the gross margin in the first quarter, including favorable weather. The net effect of weather variations increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Although weather in both 2016 and 2015 first quarters were less favorable than the normal 10-year averages, heating degree days were 57% higher in the first quarter of this year compared to last year. Higher usage by APS's customers compared to the first quarter a year ago added $0.01 to gross margin. Weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales increased 1.3% in the first quarter of 2016 versus 2015. The transmission adjustment mechanism in the Arizona Sun Program also added to the first quarter gross margin. We still expect the lost fixed cost recovery mechanism or LFCR to be a positive driver for the year, but favorability will be more heavily weighted in the second half of the year.
Now turning to O&M. As Don mentioned earlier, higher O&M was a primary headwind to first quarter 2016 earnings compared to 2015, largely driven by the major planned outage at Four Corners Unit 5 that began in late January. In line with our expectations, the average cost decreased earnings by about $0.13 quarter-over-quarter. The Four Corners Unit 4 and 5 plant outages were both concluded in the second quarter, which will provide a headwind similar to the first quarter consistent with guidance.
Lastly, a brief note on depreciation and amortization expenses. Lower D&A increased earnings by $0.01 in the first quarter. This variance includes higher expenses resulting from additional planned service, which were offset by lower depreciation related to the extension of the Palo Verde's sale leaseback. As Arizona's economy continues to be an integral part of our business story, I'll highlight next the trends we are seeing in the local economy, and in particular, the Metro Phoenix area.
What you see on Slide 4 is a continuation of the consistent growth trend we have been describing for you the last couple of years. Job growth in the first quarter of 2016 in the Metro Phoenix area remained above the national average as it has for nearly 5 years. As seen on the upper panel, Metro Phoenix added jobs at a 3.6% year-over-year rate. This job growth is broad-based with construction, business services, financial services and health care showing strong sectoral strength, adding jobs at a clip above 4% year-over-year. The job growth in Phoenix economy is driven -- is driving robust population migration. Of the 15 largest U.S. Metro areas, Phoenix ranked third in nation in 2015 population growth, behind only Houston and Dallas, which has influenced some trends in the Metro Phoenix housing permits as can be seen in the lower panel of Slide 4. In 2015, Phoenix solar housing market record its best year since 2007 for both total permits and the single-family sector by itself, with almost 22,000 permits and 15,000 permits, respectively. This growth trend continued in the first quarter of 2016 as single-family permits grew nearly 35% over last year's first quarter. We expect the housing market to continue to improve throughout this year with annual total housing permits falling in the range of 25,000 to 32,000.
In summary, the Metro Phoenix economy continues to grow steadily and is positioned for stronger growth over the next couple of years. Additionally, Arizona and Metro Phoenix remain attractive places to live and do business, especially as they are situated relative to the large, but higher cost California market.
Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.3% compared with the first quarter last year. We expect that this growth rate will gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place.
In closing, I will review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West consolidated ongoing earnings for 2016 will be in the range of $3.90 to $4.10 per share. The adjustment mechanisms, particularly transmission and the LFCR along with modest sales growth and normal weather, remained the key gross margin drivers. You will find a complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance included on Slide 5, which are unchanged from last year.
Looking ahead to 2016 financing, we plan to refinance a $250 million August maturity and anticipate issuing up to $400 million of additional long-term debt. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity remains very strong. During the first quarter, APS increased its commercial paper program from $250 million to $500 million. At end of the quarter, Pinnacle West had no short-term borrowings and APS had $262 million of commercial paper outstanding.  Finally, our rate case growth outlook remains 6% to 7% through 2018 and our forecast does not include the need for additional equity. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

Before Jim discusses the details of our second quarter results, I'll provide a few update on our recent regulatory and operational developments. 
On June 1, APS filed its first rate review in 5 years. Our proposal moves Arizona forward with continued investments and an advanced energy grid, a cleaner energy mix and new technologies that will enable our customers to have more choices and control. Today, I'll highlight the key requests of the filing and their benefits. For your reference, those items as well as key  underlying assumptions are summarized in the appendix to today's presentation. 
The rate review provisions contain a number of benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. The requested regulatory treatment will build upon the constructive the regulatory framework established in the 2009 and 2012 settlements. Through this rate review, APS is asking for a change in the way customer rates are designed and an overall 5.74% bill increase or $166 million annually. APS has asked for an effective date for the new rates on July 1, 2017. Many of the key provisions in our rate review proposal are focused on constructive regulatory treatment that mitigate the regulatory lag. For example, we're seeking post test year plant additions for the period between the end of the test year and the date new rates take effect. This process has been used to mitigate regulatory lag in our last 2 weeks settlements and in other case in Arizona. APS was also requesting a deferral order for our investment in the Ocotillo Modernization Project, which will come into service after the rate case; and a deferral on step increase for the selective catalytic reduction technology equipment now being installed at the Four Corners Power Plant. This type of step increase would be similar to the structure agreed to in our last rate settlement regarding the acquisition by APS of Southern California Edison's interest in the Four Corners Power Plant. In addition, APS also propose changes to the rate options it offers to customers, ensuring that the price a customer pays more accurately reflects the way the customer uses the electric grid. A 3-part bill with a demand component in addition to making the basic service charge itself more cost based will reduce interclass subsidies, better reflect the actual cost of service and enable the sustainable deployment of new customer technologies. APS already has more than 120,000 residential customers on demand rates today, and our proposal expands this rate element to most residential customers. 
Our proposal also benefits customers by reducing the subsidy currently paid to support rooftop solar industry by the 96% of residential customers who do not have rooftop solar. This change would not affect the 45,000 customers who already have rooftop solar or new solar customers who submit a completed interconnection application before July 1, 2017. We want to continue Arizona's solar leadership the right way with more solar for more customers without driving up the energy bills paid by non-solar customers. 
The administrative law judge has set a procedural schedule for the rate proceedings. The ACC staff and intervenors would begin filing their direct testimony on December 21, and the hearing would commence on March 22, 2017. The commission staff supports completing the case within 12 months. 
In addition to the APS rate review filing, the Arizona Corporation Commission is managing a very full schedule. On June 13, hearings concluded in the value and cost of solar generic docket. Final legal briefs are due on August 5, and we expect a recommended opinion in order later t his year. While the initial round of testimony has recently been filed in the Tucson Electric rate case, hearings are now complete in UniSource Electric case and a recommended opinion on order was recently issued, recommending a 9.6% nonfuel rate increase. 
Turning to operational developments. We concluded plant outages at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station and both units at the Four Corners generating plant. Jim will discuss the financial impact, but the extend the duration of the Four Corners plant outages was a headwind in the second quarter results compared to the second quarter of 2015. Palo Verde, which is America's largest carbon-free energy source, had a solid first half in the year, including successfully completing the Unit 1 planned refueling outages in 35 days. On a related note, APS recently announced changes to its senior leadership team at Palo Verde. Bob Bement, who has been instrumental in Palo Verde's success, has been promoted to Executive Vice President, nuclear. Bob will continue reporting to Randy Edington, Executive Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer, until October 31, when Bob will then take over as Chief Nuclear Officer, while Randy transitions to Executive Vice President and adviser to me. Jack Cadogan, currently Vice President, nuclear engineering, has been named to replace Bob as Senior Vice President, side operations. And completing the leadership team at Palo Verde, Chuck Carl has been named Vice President, side operations and general plant manager; and Mike McLaughlin has been named Vice President, operations support. In addition, Bruce Rasch is joining Palo Verde from Exelon Corporation in the position as Vice President of nuclear engineering. These changes ensure Palo Verde will continue to have the strongest nuclear leadership team in the industry. 
Looking to our capital investment program, we continue making good progress on both the Ocotillo Modernization Project and the installation of selective catalytic reduction technology at Four Corners. Our 40-megawatt utility scale solar plant red rock is more than 50% complete and on schedule for completion later this year. APS recently issued an all-source request for proposals seeking 400 to 600 megawatts of capacity resources to help meet customer peak energy needs. We're now evaluating the proposals with an expected decision later this year. Last May, APS announced plans to participate in the energy imbalance market. We're currently performing parallel operations and expect to go live on October 1st. Participation in this 5-minute energy market is expected to offer economic savings to our customers and improve the integration of renewable resources. 
Let me conclude by saying we're excited about the opportunities ahead for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. In April, APS celebrated 130 years of providing its customers with reliable electricity at an affordable cost. One month later, we filed a historic rate review, which builds on the foundation established in previous rate reviews. The investments and proposals discussed in this filing provide a clear and compelling vision for the future. In many respects, this case serves as the transition from the challenges of the present to the opportunities of the future. Meanwhile, we are delivering on our commitments and continue to be well positioned for the balance of the year. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2016, which were in line with our expectations. As summarized on Slide 3 of the materials for the second q",1048,"Thank you, Don, and thank you again, everyone, for joining us on the call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2016, which were in line with our expectations. As summarized on Slide 3 of the materials for the second quarter of 2016, we earned $1.08 per share compared to $1.10 per share in the second quarter of 2015. 
Slide 4 outlines the variances in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share, the key drivers being higher gross margin, which is primarily offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses. Looking at gross margin, there were several factors that contributed to the $0.21 increase, including favorable weather. June's weather was the hottest on record and when paired with the mild conditions in the second quarter of last year, the net effect of weather variations increased earnings by $0.09 per share. Higher sales in the second quarter this year compared to the second quarter in 2015 added $0.04 to gross margin. In total, weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales were flat compared to last year, but the sales trend by customer class or mix ended up yielding a positive gross margin effect. More specifically, sales to higher-margin residential customers increased 1.8% in the second quarter, but this growth was partially offset by a 1.5% reduction in sales to lower-margin business customers. Collectively, the adjustment mechanisms continued to add incremental growth to our gross margin as designed, contributing $0.04 per share. 
A final comment on gross margin. In April, APS completed the sale of a 50% ownership stake in an existing 230 kV transmission line, which resulted in a $0.03 [ph] contribution to gross margin. 
Now turning to operating expenses. As I mentioned earlier, higher O&M was a primary offset to ongoing earnings per share in the second quarter. Included in guidance and in line with our expectations, the major planned outages at Four Corners Units 4 and 5 that concluded in the second quarter were a headwork to quarterly activity compared to 2015. Another key factor that contributed to an increase in O&M to the second quarter of this year relative to last year was higher employee benefit cost, including stock compensation cost. Higher D&A [indiscernible] increased [ph] earnings by $0.02 in the second quarter. This variance includes higher expenses resulting from additional planned service, which which were partially offset by lower depreciation related to the extension of the Palo Verde sale-leaseback. The gross margin and D&A variances exclude operating revenues on expenses related to Palo Verde Unit 2 decommissioning recovered through a system benefits charge. The drivers I discussed exclude these items as there was no net impact on second quarter results. 
As the Arizona economy continues to be an integral part of our business story, I'll highlight next the trends we are seeing in our local economy and in particular, the Metro Phoenix area. Job growth in the second quarter in the 2000 Metro Phoenix area remained at about double the national average, continuing the trend we have seen for nearly 5 years. As seen in the upper panel of Slide 5, Metro Phoenix added jobs at a 3.4% year-over-year rate. This job growth is broad-based with construction, business services, financial services and health care showing strong sectoral strength, adding jobs at a clip above [ph] 4% year-over-year. Strong job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets. Absorption of vacant commercial space remains steady in the second quarter with a combined 2 million square foot of office and retail space occupied by new tenants. Vacancy rates in both markets have fallen to levels last seen in 2008 and almost 3 million square feet of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will in turn support continued commercial development. 
The residential real estate market reflects those trends as well. As you can see on the lower panel Slide 5, housing construction is on pace to have its best year since 2007, driven primarily by the single-family market and overall, the amount of vacant housing in Phoenix is solidly back to pre-recession levels. Record lower apartment vacancies and absorption assumption of available single-family homes is providing meaningful support to home prices, which have returned to levels last seen in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth, low mortgage rates and the opening up of credit to the wave of households who suffered from foreclosures during the recession should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and economy more generally to expand in a healthy pace over the next couple of years. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS has retail customer base grew 1.4% compared with the second quarter of last year. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
In closing, I will review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2016 will be in the range of $3.90 to $4.10 per share. You will find a complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance included on Slide 6, which remain unchanged. In terms of recent financing, on May 6, APS issued$350 million of 3.75% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds from the sale were used to redeem and cancel certain pollution control bonds and to repay commercial paper and replenish cash temporarily used to fund capital expenditures. Additionally, on August 1, APS repaid a maturity $250 [ph] million of 6.25% senior unsecured notes. We anticipate issuing up to $350 million of additional long-term debt this year. 
Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity continue to remain very strong. At the end of the quarter, Pinnacle West had no short-term borrowings and APS had $64 [ph] million of commercial paper outstanding. Finally, our rate base growth outlook remains  6% to 7% through 2018, and our forecast does not include the need for additional equity. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

One is traditionally, when do we get in the window where we can start to potentially settle certain items in the case?

We do and are doing right now technical conferences to help both understand the filing itself, and so we'll continue that through the testimony piece. On the other issue, is, obviously, rate design has been a pretty major topic in most of the cases. And while it's certainly helpful in seeing what some of those issues are, one of the things I'd be cautious off of is the utilities in the state are coming from a slightly different position. And so you probably seen the UNS quarter, the recommended order is out in the UNS case and it's proposing a move to tear new rates. We have also suggested in our testimony in that case that they move more towards the demand rates, which is similar to our proposal. But they're not in the same position as we are, and so one way that we're viewing that case now is that's a good step in overall rate modernization because they're moving customers out of TOU. We're in a better position with that with half our customers on TOU and about 11% of the customers on demand rates, residential demand rates today. And so that's helpful in seeing what some of the issues and discussions are, but the cases are all going to be different as they ultimately move forward."

So one of the ways to think of the difference between demand rate and fixed charges is with the demand rate, the customer can still control that. So  one of the challenges if folks are just talking about moving to higher fixed charges that don't vary with demand, there's essentially nothing a customer can do to manage that. And so what we've seen with our residential customers who are on a demand rate and particularly with customers who transitioned from a more traditional or kind of loose rate a demand rate, is that they actually can do things both behaviorally and with technology that can manage demand. And so there's a lot of value in moving to something that sends a better pricing that can actually send some technology or some behavioral adaptation from customers that help us manage peak demand. And with all the solar we see in the Southwest, that's the major transition that we've got to start looking at. And so when you look at the other utilities, we have done more -- I think, we have more customers on residential demand rates than anyone in the U.S. So we're in a better position to understand the dynamics of those rates, how the rate design matters and make those changes. And I think, there's a recognition of that from the folks who are involved in the hearings here. But overall in the Southwest, rate modernization is something that has to happen. And so what you're seeing in UNS is a transition out of timing use. We've done a timing use rate for over 30 years, and so we're at a slightly different place. Our metering technology is more advanced, and so you have to be careful in looking at other cases for direct precedent, but they're certainly instructive on what some of the issues are."

Before Jim discusses the details of our second quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments.
On June 1, APS filed its first rate review in 5 years. Our proposal moves Arizona forward with continued investments and an advanced energy grid, a cleaner energy mix and new technologies that will enable our customers to have more choices and control. Today, I'll highlight the key request of the filing and their benefits. For your reference, those items as well as key underlying assumptions are summarized in the appendix to today's presentation.
The rate review provisions contain a number of benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. The requested regulatory treatment will build upon the constructive the regulatory framework established in the 2009 and 2012 settlements. Through this rate review, APS is asking for a change in the way customer rates are designed and an overall 5.74% bill increase or $166 million annually. APS has asked for an effective date of the new rates of July 1, 2017. Many of the key provisions in our rate review proposal are focused on constructive regulatory treatment that mitigates regulatory lag. For example, we're seeking post-test year plant additions for the period between the end of the test year and the date new rates take effect. This process has been used to mitigate regulatory lag in our last 2 rate settlements and in other cases in Arizona. APS is also requesting a deferral order for our investment in the Ocotillo Modernization Project, which will come into service after the rate case; and a deferral on step increase for the selective catalytic reduction technology equipment now being installed at the Four Corners Power Plant. This type of step increase would be similar to the structure agreed to in our last rate settlement regarding the acquisition by APS of Southern California Edison's interest in the Four Corners Power Plant. In addition, the APS also propose changes to the rate options it offers to customers, ensuring that the price a customer pays more accurately reflects the way that customer uses the electric grid. A 3-part bill with a demand component in addition to making the basic service charge itself more cost based will reduce interclass subsidies, better reflect the actual cost of service and enable the sustainable deployment of new customer technologies. APS already has more than 120,000 residential customers on demand rates today, and our proposal expands this rate element to most residential customers.
Our proposal also benefits customers by reducing the subsidy currently paid to support the rooftop solar industry by the 96% of residential customers who do not have rooftop solar. This change would not affect the 45,000 customers who already have rooftop solar or new solar customers who submit a completed interconnection application before July 1, 2017. We want to continue Arizona's solar leadership the right way with more solar for more customers without driving up the energy bills paid by non-solar customers.
The administrative law judge has set a procedural schedule for the rate proceedings. The ACC staff and intervenors would begin filing their direct testimony on December 21, and the hearing would commence on March 22, 2017. The commission staff supports completing the case within 12 months.
In addition to the APS rate review filing, the Arizona Corporation Commission is managing a very full schedule. On June 13, hearings concluded in the value and cost of solar generic docket. Final legal briefs are due on August 5, and we expect a recommended opinion in order later this year. While the initial round of testimony has recently been filed in the Tucson Electric rate case, hearings are now complete in UniSource electric case and a recommended opinion and order was recently issued, recommending a 9.6% nonfuel rate increase.
Turning to operational developments. We concluded plant outages at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station and both units at the Four Corners generating plant. Jim will discuss the financial impact, but the extended duration of the Four Corners plant outages was a headwind in the second quarter results compared to the second quarter of 2015. Palo Verde, which is America's largest carbon-free energy source, had a solid first half of the year, including successfully completing the Unit 1 planned refueling outage in 35 days. On a related note, APS recently announced changes to its senior leadership team at Palo Verde. Bob Bement, who has been instrumental in Palo Verde's success, has been promoted to Executive Vice President, nuclear. Bob will continue reporting to Randy Edington, Executive Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer, until October 31, when Bob will then take over as Chief Nuclear Officer, while Randy transitions to Executive Vice President and adviser to me. Jack Cadogan, currently Vice President, Nuclear Engineering, has been named to replace Bob as Senior Vice President, Site Operations. And completing the leadership team at Palo Verde, Chuck Kharrl has been named Vice President, Site Operations and General Plant Manager; and Mike McLaughlin has been named Vice President, Operations Support. In addition, Bruce Rash is joining Palo Verde from Exelon Corporation in the position as Vice President of Nuclear Engineering. These changes ensure Palo Verde will continue to have the strongest nuclear leadership team in the industry.
Looking to our capital investment program, we continue making good progress on both the Ocotillo Modernization Project and the installation of selective catalytic reduction technology at Four Corners. Our 40-megawatt utility scale solar plant red rock is more than 50% complete and on schedule for completion later this year. APS recently issued an all-source request for proposals seeking 400 to 600 megawatts of capacity resources to help meet customer peak energy needs. We're now evaluating the proposals with an expected decision later this year. Last May, APS announced plans to participate in the energy imbalance market. We're currently performing parallel operations and expect to go live on October 1st. Participation in this 5-minute energy market is expected to offer economic savings to our customers and improve the integration of renewable resources.
Let me conclude by saying we're excited about the opportunities ahead for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. In April, APS celebrated 130 years of providing its customers with reliable electricity at an affordable cost. One month later, we filed a historic rate review, which builds on the foundation established in previous rate reviews. The investments and proposals discussed in this filing provide a clear and compelling vision for the future. In many respects, this case serves as a transition from the challenges of the present to the opportunities of the future. Meanwhile, we are delivering on our commitments and continue to be well positioned for the balance of the year.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2016, which were in line with our expectations. As summarized on Slide 3 of the materials, for the second",1045,"Thank you, Don, and thank you again, everyone, for joining us on the call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2016, which were in line with our expectations. As summarized on Slide 3 of the materials, for the second quarter of 2016, we earned $1.08 per share compared to $1.10 per share in the second quarter of 2015.
Slide 4 outlines the variances in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share, the key drivers being higher gross margin, which is primarily offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses. Looking at gross margin, there were several factors that contributed to the $0.21 increase, including favorable weather. June's weather was the hottest on record and when paired with the mild conditions in the second quarter of last year, the net effect of weather variations increased earnings by $0.09 per share. Higher sales in the second quarter this year compared to the second quarter in 2015 added $0.04 to gross margin. In total, weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales were flat compared to last year, but the sales trend by customer class were mixed and ended up yielding a positive gross margin effect. More specifically, sales to higher-margin residential customers increased 1.8% in the second quarter, but this growth was partially offset by a 1.5% reduction in sales to lower-margin business customers. Collectively, the adjustment mechanisms continue to add incremental growth to our gross margin as designed, contributing $0.04 per share.
A final comment on gross margin. In April, APS completed the sale of a 50% ownership stake in an existing 230 kV transmission line, which resulted at a $0.03 [ph] contribution to gross margin. 
Now turning to operating expenses. As I mentioned earlier, higher O&M was a primary offset to ongoing earnings per share in the second quarter. Included in guidance and in line with our expectations, the major planned outages at Four Corners Units 4 and 5 that concluded in the second quarter were a headwork to quarterly activity compared to 2015. Another key factor that contributed to an increase in O&M in the second quarter of this year relative to last year was higher employee benefit cost, including stock compensation cost. Higher D&A also increased earnings by $0.02 in the second quarter. This variance includes higher expenses resulting from additional planned service, which were partially offset by lower depreciation related to the extension of the Palo Verde sale leaseback. The gross margin and D&A variances exclude operating revenues and expenses related to Palo Verde Unit 2 decommissioning recovered through a system benefits charge. The drivers I discussed exclude these items as there was no net impact on second quarter results. 
As the Arizona economy continues to be an integral part of our business story, I'll highlight next the trends we are seeing in our local economy and in particular, the Metro Phoenix area. Job growth in the second quarter in the 2000 Metro Phoenix area remained at about double the national average, continuing the trend we have seen for nearly 5 years. As seen in the upper panel of Slide 5, Metro Phoenix added jobs at a 3.4% year-over-year rate. This job growth is broad-based with construction, business services, financial services, and health care showing strong sectoral strength, adding jobs at a clip above 4% year-over-year. Strong job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets. Absorption of vacant commercial space remains steady in the second quarter with a combined 2 million square foot of office and retail space occupied by new tenants. Vacancy rates in both markets have fallen to levels last seen in 2008 and almost 3 million square feet of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will in turn support continued commercial development. 
The residential real estate market reflects those trends as well. As you can see on the lower panel of Slide 5, housing construction is on pace to have its best year since 2007, driven primarily by the single-family market and overall, the amount of vacant housing in Phoenix is solidly back to pre-recession levels. Record lower apartment vacancies and absorption of available single-family homes is providing meaningful support to home prices, which have returned to levels last seen in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth, low mortgage rates and the opening up of credit to the wave of households who suffered from foreclosures during the recession should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and economy more generally to expand in a healthy pace over the next couple of years. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 1.4% compared with the second quarter of last year. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
In closing, I will review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2016 will be in the range of $3.90 to $4.10 per share. You will find a complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance included on Slide 6, which remain unchanged. In terms of recent financing, on May 6, APS issued $350 million of 3.75% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds from the sale were used to redeem and cancel certain pollution control bonds and to repay commercial paper and replenish cash temporarily used to fund capital expenditures. Additionally, on August 1, APS repaid a maturity $250 million of 6.25% senior unsecured notes. We anticipate issuing up to $350 million of additional long-term debt this year. 
Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity continue to remain very strong. At the end of the quarter, Pinnacle West had no short-term borrowings and APS had $64 million of commercial paper outstanding. Finally, our rate base growth outlook remains  6% to 7% through 2018, and our forecast does not include the need for additional equity.
This concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

We do and are doing right now technical conferences to help folks understand the filing itself, and so we'll continue that through the testimony piece. On the other issue is, obviously, rate design's been a pretty major topic in most of the cases. And while it's certainly helpful in seeing what some of those issues are, one of the things I'd be cautious of is all the utilities in the state are coming from a slightly different position. And so you've probably seen the UNS order, the recommended order is out in the UNS case and it's proposing a move to TOU rates. We have also suggested in our testimony in that case that they move more towards the demand rates, which is similar to our proposal. But they're not in the same position as we are, and so one way that we're viewing that case now is that, that's a good step in overall rate modernization because they're moving customers out of TOU. We're in a better position with that with half our customers on TOU and about 11% of the customers on demand rates, residential demand rates today. And so that's helpful in seeing what's some of the issues and discussions are, but the cases are all going to be different as they ultimately move forward."

So one of the ways to think of the difference between demand rates and fixed charges is with the demand rate, the customer can still control that. So one of the challenges, if folks are just talking about moving to higher fixed charges that don't vary with demand, there's essentially nothing a customer can do to manage that. And so what we've seen with our residential customers who are on a demand rate and particularly with customers who've transitioned from a more traditional or kind of use rate to a demand rate, is that they actually can do things both behaviorally and with technology that can manage demand. And so there's a lot of value in moving to something that sends a better price signal that can actually incent some technology or some behavioral adaptation from customers that help us manage peak demand. And with all the solar we see in the Southwest, that's the major transition that we've got to start looking at. And so when you look at the other utilities, we have done more -- I think, we have more customers on residential demand rates than anyone in the U.S. So we're in a better position to understand the dynamics of those rates, how the rate design matters and make those changes. And I think, there's a recognition of that from the folks who are involved in the hearings here. But overall, in the Southwest, rate modernization is something that has to happen. And so what you're seeing in UNS is a transition out of time of use. We've done the time of use rate for over 30 years, and so we're at a slightly different place. Our metering technology is more advanced, and so you have to be careful in looking at other cases for direct precedent, but they're certainly instructive in what some of the issues are."

Before Jim discusses the details of our second quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments.
On June 1, APS filed its first rate review in 5 years. Our proposal moves Arizona forward with continued investments and an advanced energy grid, a cleaner energy mix and new technologies that will enable our customers to have more choices and control. Today, I'll highlight the key request of the filing and their benefits. For your reference, those items as well as key underlying assumptions are summarized in the appendix to today's presentation.
The rate review provisions contain a number of benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. The requested regulatory treatment will build upon the constructive the regulatory framework established in the 2009 and 2012 settlements. Through this rate review, APS is asking for a change in the way customer rates are designed and an overall 5.74% bill increase or $166 million annually. APS has asked for an effective date of the new rates of July 1, 2017. Many of the key provisions in our rate review proposal are focused on constructive regulatory treatment that mitigates regulatory lag. For example, we're seeking post-test year plant additions for the period between the end of the test year and the date new rates take effect. This process has been used to mitigate regulatory lag in our last 2 rate settlements and in other cases in Arizona. APS is also requesting a deferral order for our investment in the Ocotillo Modernization Project, which will come into service after the rate case; and a deferral on step increase for the selective catalytic reduction technology equipment now being installed at the Four Corners Power Plant. This type of step increase would be similar to the structure agreed to in our last rate settlement regarding the acquisition by APS of Southern California Edison's interest in the Four Corners Power Plant. In addition, the APS also propose changes to the rate options it offers to customers, ensuring that the price a customer pays more accurately reflects the way that customer uses the electric grid. A 3-part bill with a demand component in addition to making the basic service charge itself more cost based will reduce interclass subsidies, better reflect the actual cost of service and enable the sustainable deployment of new customer technologies. APS already has more than 120,000 residential customers on demand rates today, and our proposal expands this rate element to most residential customers.
Our proposal also benefits customers by reducing the subsidy currently paid to support the rooftop solar industry by the 96% of residential customers who do not have rooftop solar. This change would not affect the 45,000 customers who already have rooftop solar or new solar customers who submit a completed interconnection application before July 1, 2017. We want to continue Arizona's solar leadership the right way with more solar for more customers without driving up the energy bills paid by non-solar customers.
The administrative law judge has set a procedural schedule for the rate proceedings. The ACC staff and intervenors would begin filing their direct testimony on December 21, and the hearing would commence on March 22, 2017. The commission staff supports completing the case within 12 months.
In addition to the APS rate review filing, the Arizona Corporation Commission is managing a very full schedule. On June 13, hearings concluded in the value and cost of solar generic docket. Final legal briefs are due on August 5, and we expect a recommended opinion in order later this year. While the initial round of testimony has recently been filed in the Tucson Electric rate case, hearings are now complete in UniSource electric case and a recommended opinion and order was recently issued, recommending a 9.6% nonfuel rate increase.
Turning to operational developments. We concluded plant outages at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station and both units at the Four Corners generating plant. Jim will discuss the financial impact, but the extended duration of the Four Corners plant outages was a headwind in the second quarter results compared to the second quarter of 2015. Palo Verde, which is America's largest carbon-free energy source, had a solid first half of the year, including successfully completing the Unit 1 planned refueling outage in 35 days. On a related note, APS recently announced changes to its senior leadership team at Palo Verde. Bob Bement, who has been instrumental in Palo Verde's success, has been promoted to Executive Vice President, nuclear. Bob will continue reporting to Randy Edington, Executive Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer, until October 31, when Bob will then take over as Chief Nuclear Officer, while Randy transitions to Executive Vice President and adviser to me. Jack Cadogan, currently Vice President, Nuclear Engineering, has been named to replace Bob as Senior Vice President, Site Operations. And completing the leadership team at Palo Verde, Chuck Kharrl has been named Vice President, Site Operations and General Plant Manager; and Mike McLaughlin has been named Vice President, Operations Support. In addition, Bruce Rash is joining Palo Verde from Exelon Corporation in the position as Vice President of Nuclear Engineering. These changes ensure Palo Verde will continue to have the strongest nuclear leadership team in the industry.
Looking to our capital investment program, we continue making good progress on both the Ocotillo Modernization Project and the installation of selective catalytic reduction technology at Four Corners. Our 40-megawatt utility scale solar plant red rock is more than 50% complete and on schedule for completion later this year. APS recently issued an all-source request for proposals seeking 400 to 600 megawatts of capacity resources to help meet customer peak energy needs. We're now evaluating the proposals with an expected decision later this year. Last May, APS announced plans to participate in the energy imbalance market. We're currently performing parallel operations and expect to go live on October 1st. Participation in this 5-minute energy market is expected to offer economic savings to our customers and improve the integration of renewable resources.
Let me conclude by saying we're excited about the opportunities ahead for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. In April, APS celebrated 130 years of providing its customers with reliable electricity at an affordable cost. One month later, we filed a historic rate review, which builds on the foundation established in previous rate reviews. The investments and proposals discussed in this filing provide a clear and compelling vision for the future. In many respects, this case serves as a transition from the challenges of the present to the opportunities of the future. Meanwhile, we are delivering on our commitments and continue to be well positioned for the balance of the year.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2016, which were in line with our expectations. As summarized on Slide 3 of the materials, for the second",1044,"Thank you, Don, and thank you again, everyone, for joining us on the call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2016, which were in line with our expectations. As summarized on Slide 3 of the materials, for the second quarter of 2016, we earned $1.08 per share compared to $1.10 per share in the second quarter of 2015.
Slide 4 outlines the variances in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share, the key drivers being higher gross margin, which is primarily offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses. Looking at gross margin, there were several factors that contributed to the $0.21 increase, including favorable weather. June's weather was the hottest on record and when paired with the mild conditions in the second quarter of last year, the net effect of weather variations increased earnings by $0.09 per share. Higher sales in the second quarter this year compared to the second quarter in 2015 added $0.04 to gross margin. In total, weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales were flat compared to last year, but the sales trend by customer class were mixed and ended up yielding a positive gross margin effect. More specifically, sales to higher-margin residential customers increased 1.8% in the second quarter, but this growth was partially offset by a 1.5% reduction in sales to lower-margin business customers. Collectively, the adjustment mechanisms continue to add incremental growth to our gross margin as designed, contributing $0.04 per share.
A final comment on gross margin. In April, APS completed the sale of a 50% ownership stake in an existing 230 kV transmission line, which resulted at a $0.03 contribution to gross margin. 
Now turning to operating expenses. As I mentioned earlier, higher O&M was a primary offset to ongoing earnings per share in the second quarter. Included in guidance and in line with our expectations, the major planned outages at Four Corners Units 4 and 5 that concluded in the second quarter were a headwork to quarterly activity compared to 2015. Another key factor that contributed to an increase in O&M in the second quarter of this year relative to last year was higher employee benefit cost, including stock compensation cost. Higher D&A also increased earnings by $0.02 in the second quarter. This variance includes higher expenses resulting from additional planned service, which were partially offset by lower depreciation related to the extension of the Palo Verde sale leaseback. The gross margin and D&A variances exclude operating revenues and expenses related to Palo Verde Unit 2 decommissioning recovered through a system benefits charge. The drivers I discussed exclude these items as there was no net impact on second quarter results. 
As the Arizona economy continues to be an integral part of our business story, I'll highlight next the trends we are seeing in our local economy and in particular, the Metro Phoenix area. Job growth in the second quarter in the 2000 Metro Phoenix area remained at about double the national average, continuing the trend we have seen for nearly 5 years. As seen in the upper panel of Slide 5, Metro Phoenix added jobs at a 3.4% year-over-year rate. This job growth is broad-based with construction, business services, financial services, and health care showing strong sectoral strength, adding jobs at a clip above 4% year-over-year. Strong job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets. Absorption of vacant commercial space remains steady in the second quarter with a combined 2 million square foot of office and retail space occupied by new tenants. Vacancy rates in both markets have fallen to levels last seen in 2008 and almost 3 million square feet of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will in turn support continued commercial development. 
The residential real estate market reflects those trends as well. As you can see on the lower panel of Slide 5, housing construction is on pace to have its best year since 2007, driven primarily by the single-family market and overall, the amount of vacant housing in Phoenix is solidly back to pre-recession levels. Record lower apartment vacancies and absorption of available single-family homes is providing meaningful support to home prices, which have returned to levels last seen in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth, low mortgage rates and the opening up of credit to the wave of households who suffered from foreclosures during the recession should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and economy more generally to expand in a healthy pace over the next couple of years. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 1.4% compared with the second quarter of last year. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
In closing, I will review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2016 will be in the range of $3.90 to $4.10 per share. You will find a complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance included on Slide 6, which remain unchanged. In terms of recent financing, on May 6, APS issued $350 million of 3.75% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds from the sale were used to redeem and cancel certain pollution control bonds and to repay commercial paper and replenish cash temporarily used to fund capital expenditures. Additionally, on August 1, APS repaid a maturity $250 million of 6.25% senior unsecured notes. We anticipate issuing up to $350 million of additional long-term debt this year. 
Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity continue to remain very strong. At the end of the quarter, Pinnacle West had no short-term borrowings and APS had $64 million of commercial paper outstanding. Finally, our rate base growth outlook remains  6% to 7% through 2018, and our forecast does not include the need for additional equity.
This concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

We do and are doing right now technical conferences to help folks understand the filing itself, and so we'll continue that through the testimony piece. On the other issue is, obviously, rate design's been a pretty major topic in most of the cases. And while it's certainly helpful in seeing what some of those issues are, one of the things I'd be cautious of is all the utilities in the state are coming from a slightly different position. And so you've probably seen the UNS order, the recommended order is out in the UNS case and it's proposing a move to TOU rates. We have also suggested in our testimony in that case that they move more towards the demand rates, which is similar to our proposal. But they're not in the same position as we are, and so one way that we're viewing that case now is that, that's a good step in overall rate modernization because they're moving customers out of TOU. We're in a better position with that with half our customers on TOU and about 11% of the customers on demand rates, residential demand rates today. And so that's helpful in seeing what's some of the issues and discussions are, but the cases are all going to be different as they ultimately move forward."

So one of the ways to think of the difference between demand rates and fixed charges is with the demand rate, the customer can still control that. So one of the challenges, if folks are just talking about moving to higher fixed charges that don't vary with demand, there's essentially nothing a customer can do to manage that. And so what we've seen with our residential customers who are on a demand rate and particularly with customers who've transitioned from a more traditional or kind of use rate to a demand rate, is that they actually can do things both behaviorally and with technology that can manage demand. And so there's a lot of value in moving to something that sends a better price signal that can actually incent some technology or some behavioral adaptation from customers that help us manage peak demand. And with all the solar we see in the Southwest, that's the major transition that we've got to start looking at. And so when you look at the other utilities, we have done more -- I think, we have more customers on residential demand rates than anyone in the U.S. So we're in a better position to understand the dynamics of those rates, how the rate design matters and make those changes. And I think, there's a recognition of that from the folks who are involved in the hearings here. But overall, in the Southwest, rate modernization is something that has to happen. And so what you're seeing in UNS is a transition out of time of use. We've done the time of use rate for over 30 years, and so we're at a slightly different place. Our metering technology is more advanced, and so you have to be careful in looking at other cases for direct precedent, but they're certainly instructive in what some of the issues are."

And so it means there's a very heavy focus on the peak demand part of the day and less on kind of overall energy consumption.

Before Jim discusses the details of our second quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent regulatory and operational developments.
On June 1, APS filed its first rate review in 5 years. Our proposal moves Arizona forward with continued investments and an advanced energy grid, a cleaner energy mix and new technologies that will enable our customers to have more choices and control. Today, I'll highlight the key request of the filing and their benefits. For your reference, those items as well as key underlying assumptions are summarized in the appendix to today's presentation.
The rate review provisions contain a number of benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. The requested regulatory treatment will build upon the constructive the regulatory framework established in the 2009 and 2012 settlements. Through this rate review, APS is asking for a change in the way customer rates are designed and an overall 5.74% bill increase or $166 million annually. APS has asked for an effective date of the new rates of July 1, 2017. Many of the key provisions in our rate review proposal are focused on constructive regulatory treatment that mitigates regulatory lag. For example, we're seeking post-test year plant additions for the period between the end of the test year and the date new rates take effect. This process has been used to mitigate regulatory lag in our last 2 rate settlements and in other cases in Arizona. APS is also requesting a deferral order for our investment in the Ocotillo Modernization Project, which will come into service after the rate case; and a deferral on step increase for the selective catalytic reduction technology equipment now being installed at the Four Corners Power Plant. This type of step increase would be similar to the structure agreed to in our last rate settlement regarding the acquisition by APS of Southern California Edison's interest in the Four Corners Power Plant. In addition, the APS also propose changes to the rate options it offers to customers, ensuring that the price a customer pays more accurately reflects the way that customer uses the electric grid. A 3-part bill with a demand component in addition to making the basic service charge itself more cost based will reduce interclass subsidies, better reflect the actual cost of service and enable the sustainable deployment of new customer technologies. APS already has more than 120,000 residential customers on demand rates today, and our proposal expands this rate element to most residential customers.
Our proposal also benefits customers by reducing the subsidy currently paid to support the rooftop solar industry by the 96% of residential customers who do not have rooftop solar. This change would not affect the 45,000 customers who already have rooftop solar or new solar customers who submit a completed interconnection application before July 1, 2017. We want to continue Arizona's solar leadership the right way with more solar for more customers without driving up the energy bills paid by non-solar customers.
The administrative law judge has set a procedural schedule for the rate proceedings. The ACC staff and intervenors would begin filing their direct testimony on December 21, and the hearing would commence on March 22, 2017. The commission staff supports completing the case within 12 months.
In addition to the APS rate review filing, the Arizona Corporation Commission is managing a very full schedule. On June 13, hearings concluded in the value and cost of solar generic docket. Final legal briefs are due on August 5, and we expect a recommended opinion in order later this year. While the initial round of testimony has recently been filed in the Tucson Electric rate case, hearings are now complete in UniSource electric case and a recommended opinion and order was recently issued, recommending a 9.6% nonfuel rate increase.
Turning to operational developments. We concluded plant outages at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station and both units at the Four Corners generating plant. Jim will discuss the financial impact, but the extended duration of the Four Corners plant outages was a headwind in the second quarter results compared to the second quarter of 2015. Palo Verde, which is America's largest carbon-free energy source, had a solid first half of the year, including successfully completing the Unit 1 planned refueling outage in 35 days. On a related note, APS recently announced changes to its senior leadership team at Palo Verde. Bob Bement, who has been instrumental in Palo Verde's success, has been promoted to Executive Vice President, nuclear. Bob will continue reporting to Randy Edington, Executive Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer, until October 31, when Bob will then take over as Chief Nuclear Officer, while Randy transitions to Executive Vice President and adviser to me. Jack Cadogan, currently Vice President, Nuclear Engineering, has been named to replace Bob as Senior Vice President, Site Operations. And completing the leadership team at Palo Verde, Chuck Kharrl has been named Vice President, Site Operations and General Plant Manager; and Mike McLaughlin has been named Vice President, Operations Support. In addition, Bruce Rash is joining Palo Verde from Exelon Corporation in the position as Vice President of Nuclear Engineering. These changes ensure Palo Verde will continue to have the strongest nuclear leadership team in the industry.
Looking to our capital investment program, we continue making good progress on both the Ocotillo Modernization Project and the installation of selective catalytic reduction technology at Four Corners. Our 40-megawatt utility scale solar plant red rock is more than 50% complete and on schedule for completion later this year. APS recently issued an all-source request for proposals seeking 400 to 600 megawatts of capacity resources to help meet customer peak energy needs. We're now evaluating the proposals with an expected decision later this year. Last May, APS announced plans to participate in the energy imbalance market. We're currently performing parallel operations and expect to go live on October 1st. Participation in this 5-minute energy market is expected to offer economic savings to our customers and improve the integration of renewable resources.
Let me conclude by saying we're excited about the opportunities ahead for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. In April, APS celebrated 130 years of providing its customers with reliable electricity at an affordable cost. One month later, we filed a historic rate review, which builds on the foundation established in previous rate reviews. The investments and proposals discussed in this filing provide a clear and compelling vision for the future. In many respects, this case serves as a transition from the challenges of the present to the opportunities of the future. Meanwhile, we are delivering on our commitments and continue to be well positioned for the balance of the year.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim."

This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2016, which were in line with our expectations. As summarized on Slide 3 of the materials, for the second",1044,"Thank you, Don, and thank you again, everyone, for joining us on the call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the second quarter of 2016, which were in line with our expectations. As summarized on Slide 3 of the materials, for the second quarter of 2016, we earned $1.08 per share compared to $1.10 per share in the second quarter of 2015.
Slide 4 outlines the variances in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share, the key drivers being higher gross margin, which is primarily offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses. Looking at gross margin, there were several factors that contributed to the $0.21 increase, including favorable weather. June's weather was the hottest on record and when paired with the mild conditions in the second quarter of last year, the net effect of weather variations increased earnings by $0.09 per share. Higher sales in the second quarter this year compared to the second quarter in 2015 added $0.04 to gross margin. In total, weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales were flat compared to last year, but the sales trend by customer class were mixed and ended up yielding a positive gross margin effect. More specifically, sales to higher-margin residential customers increased 1.8% in the second quarter, but this growth was partially offset by a 1.5% reduction in sales to lower-margin business customers. Collectively, the adjustment mechanisms continue to add incremental growth to our gross margin as designed, contributing $0.04 per share.
A final comment on gross margin. In April, APS completed the sale of a 50% ownership stake in an existing 230 kV transmission line, which resulted at a $0.03 contribution to gross margin. 
Now turning to operating expenses. As I mentioned earlier, higher O&M was a primary offset to ongoing earnings per share in the second quarter. Included in guidance and in line with our expectations, the major planned outages at Four Corners Units 4 and 5 that concluded in the second quarter were a headwork to quarterly activity compared to 2015. Another key factor that contributed to an increase in O&M in the second quarter of this year relative to last year was higher employee benefit cost, including stock compensation cost. Higher D&A also increased earnings by $0.02 in the second quarter. This variance includes higher expenses resulting from additional planned service, which were partially offset by lower depreciation related to the extension of the Palo Verde sale leaseback. The gross margin and D&A variances exclude operating revenues and expenses related to Palo Verde Unit 2 decommissioning recovered through a system benefits charge. The drivers I discussed exclude these items as there was no net impact on second quarter results. 
As the Arizona economy continues to be an integral part of our business story, I'll highlight next the trends we are seeing in our local economy and in particular, the Metro Phoenix area. Job growth in the second quarter in the 2000 Metro Phoenix area remained at about double the national average, continuing the trend we have seen for nearly 5 years. As seen in the upper panel of Slide 5, Metro Phoenix added jobs at a 3.4% year-over-year rate. This job growth is broad-based with construction, business services, financial services, and health care showing strong sectoral strength, adding jobs at a clip above 4% year-over-year. Strong job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets. Absorption of vacant commercial space remains steady in the second quarter with a combined 2 million square foot of office and retail space occupied by new tenants. Vacancy rates in both markets have fallen to levels last seen in 2008 and almost 3 million square feet of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will in turn support continued commercial development. 
The residential real estate market reflects those trends as well. As you can see on the lower panel of Slide 5, housing construction is on pace to have its best year since 2007, driven primarily by the single-family market and overall, the amount of vacant housing in Phoenix is solidly back to pre-recession levels. Record lower apartment vacancies and absorption of available single-family homes is providing meaningful support to home prices, which have returned to levels last seen in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth, low mortgage rates and the opening up of credit to the wave of households who suffered from foreclosures during the recession should allow the Metro Phoenix housing market and economy more generally to expand in a healthy pace over the next couple of years. Reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions, APS' retail customer base grew 1.4% compared with the second quarter of last year. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
In closing, I will review our earnings guidance and financial outlook. We continue to expect Pinnacle West's consolidated ongoing earnings for 2016 will be in the range of $3.90 to $4.10 per share. You will find a complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance included on Slide 6, which remain unchanged. In terms of recent financing, on May 6, APS issued $350 million of 3.75% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds from the sale were used to redeem and cancel certain pollution control bonds and to repay commercial paper and replenish cash temporarily used to fund capital expenditures. Additionally, on August 1, APS repaid a maturity $250 million of 6.25% senior unsecured notes. We anticipate issuing up to $350 million of additional long-term debt this year. 
Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity continue to remain very strong. At the end of the quarter, Pinnacle West had no short-term borrowings and APS had $64 million of commercial paper outstanding. Finally, our rate base growth outlook remains  6% to 7% through 2018, and our forecast does not include the need for additional equity.
This concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

On the other issue is, obviously, rate design's been a pretty major topic in most of the cases. And while it's certainly helpful in seeing what some of those issues are, one of the things I'd be cautious of is all the utilities in the state are coming from a slightly different position. And so you've probably seen the UNS order, the recommended order is out in the UNS case and it's proposing a move to TOU rates. We have also suggested in our testimony in that case that they move more towards the demand rates, which is similar to our proposal. But they're not in the same position as we are, and so one way that we're viewing that case now is that, that's a good step in overall rate modernization because they're moving customers out of TOU. We're in a better position with that with half our customers on TOU and about 11% of the customers on demand rates, residential demand rates today. And so that's helpful in seeing what's some of the issues and discussions are, but the cases are all going to be different as they ultimately move forward."

So one of the ways to think of the difference between demand rates and fixed charges is with the demand rate, the customer can still control that. So one of the challenges, if folks are just talking about moving to higher fixed charges that don't vary with demand, there's essentially nothing a customer can do to manage that. And so what we've seen with our residential customers who are on a demand rate and particularly with customers who've transitioned from a more traditional or kind of use rate to a demand rate, is that they actually can do things both behaviorally and with technology that can manage demand. And so there's a lot of value in moving to something that sends a better price signal that can actually incent some technology or some behavioral adaptation from customers that help us manage peak demand. And with all the solar we see in the Southwest, that's the major transition that we've got to start looking at. And so when you look at the other utilities, we have done more -- I think, we have more customers on residential demand rates than anyone in the U.S. So we're in a better position to understand the dynamics of those rates, how the rate design matters and make those changes. And I think, there's a recognition of that from the folks who are involved in the hearings here. But overall, in the Southwest, rate modernization is something that has to happen. And so what you're seeing in UNS is a transition out of time of use. We've done the time of use rate for over 30 years, and so we're at a slightly different place. Our metering technology is more advanced, and so you have to be careful in looking at other cases for direct precedent, but they're certainly instructive in what some of the issues are."

And so it means there's a very heavy focus on the peak demand part of the day and less on kind of overall energy consumption. And so folks are trying to figure out in both rate design and the use of technology and how we designed a system, so things like the Ocotillo Modernization Project, how we deal with peak demand, this increasingly the challenge isn't running the system. That workshop is, I think, a positive sign that says we're looking at how all these things play in and what role technology has, what role rate design will have, and so it's a constructive conversation."

This year continues to be in line with our expectations and keeping us on pace with our guidance for the year. Although we experienced mild weather during August and September, our positive customer growth and disciplined cost management continue to support our ability to meet our financial commitments. 
Our board also approved a 5% dividend increase effective with the December payment, continuing the predictable return of capital to our shareholders. 
Before Jim discusses the details of our third quarter results, I'll provide several updates on recent operational and regulatory developments. Our operations teams did an excellent job maintaining the generating fleet and the electrical grid again this summer. The Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station performed well, and Unit 3 entered its planned refueling outage on October 8. Although this summer was mild compared to last, temperatures soared to 118 degrees on June 19. And demand for electricity peaked at 7,051 megawatts. 
On a weather-normalized basis, this was the highest peak demand for APS in 9 years. Our growing customer demand further demonstrates the need to continue expanding the grid while adding peaking resources. 
One data point worth noting is that when our customers were using the most energy, around 5:30 p.m. on June 19, rooftop solar on our system was producing only 28% of its capacity. Meanwhile, utility scale solar was producing 72% of its capacity because most utility scale panels are on trackers that move with the sun. A couple of hours later, when our system demand was still above 7,000 megawatts, essentially not changed, rooftop solar production plummeted to 0. This scenario is not unique to our peak day and highlights the importance of the electric grid at all hours of the day. On average, our customers now reach their summer peak energy demand 45 minutes later in the day than they did 4 years ago. With customers using more energy in the evening hours, APS's on-peak hours of noon to 7 p.m. are outdated. This is why we have recently proposed to change on-peak hours to 3 to 8 p.m. so on peak pricing is better aligned with customer demand. 
As I discussed on our last call, APS filed a rate review on June 1. Since the filing, we have continued to communicate with the Arizona Corporation Commission staff and intervenors regarding the details of the proposal and its intent. The ACC staff and intervenors will file their direct testimony on all matters except rate design, on December 21 and their remaining direct testimony on January 27. Parties will have the opportunity to enter into formal settlement discussions before the hearing commences on March 22. 
On a related matter, a recommended opinion and order was issued by the Administrative Law Judge on October 7 for the value and cost of distributed generation docket. The recommendation proposed progress on several key issues, including the elimination of net metering to be replaced by new methodologies consistent with staff's proposal. These methodologies align the value of export energy from rooftop solar with either a utilities avoided cost or a resource comparison proxy comprised of actual utility scale solar PPA cost. The ALJ recommendation also concludes that rooftop solar customers are partial requirement customers and suggested the termination for placing these customers on a separate class should be addressed in the rate review proceeding. This item is expected to be heard in the December 13 and 14 commission open meeting. 
On September 30, APS filed its preliminary 2017 Integrated Resource Plan or IRP with the Corporation Commission. The plan addresses several key factors, including our future resource needs as customer demand grows and power supply contracts expire. By 2022, our incremental resource requirement is forecasted to be in excess of 3,500 megawatts. This resource gap will be fulfilled through a variety of sources, including the Ocotillo Modernization Project, which is on track for completion in 2019. Earlier this year, we issued an all source request for proposals seeking 400 to 600 megawatts of capacity by 2020, which will also contribute toward our future resource needs. We have shortlisted proposals and we'll be finalizing a resource selection in the coming months. The remainder of our resource requirements will be evaluated as part of the IRP process, which may include additional RFPs in the future. 
On October 1, APS successfully began full participation in the Western energy imbalance market. This real-time wholesale power market enables APS to exchange energy with a variety of resources across 8 Western states, reducing cost for our customers and improving the integration of renewable resources. This was a smooth transition and well managed by our operations teams. 
Turning to our capital investment program. We continue making good progress on the installation of selective catalytic reduction technology at the Four Corners power plant. Our 40-megawatt utility scale solar plant, Red Rock, is on schedule for completion later this year, and our 4 megawatts of battery storage investments are also on track for completion this year as part of the Solar Partner Program. 
We completed 3 high-voltage transmission lines this year to support our customer growth west of Phoenix, which total $145 million of investment in the reliability of our transmission system. And finally, our innovative micro grid project for the department of the Navy will begin commercial operation next month at the Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma, Arizona. 
Let me conclude by saying that we remain focused on delivering our financial and operational commitments. We have a busy calendar over the next year. And while the Corporation Commission addresses rate design modernization, and we engage with stakeholders on our rate review, our capital investment program continues to be robust and is focused on flexible generation, new grid technology and advancing our core utility operations to prepare for the changing needs of our customers. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."
296957,403436515,1072151,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Don, and thank you, again, everyone for joining us on the call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter 2016, which, excluding historically mild weather, were in line with our expectations. As summarized on Slide",1161,"Thank you, Don, and thank you, again, everyone for joining us on the call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter 2016, which, excluding historically mild weather, were in line with our expectations. 
As summarized on Slide 3 of the materials, for the third quarter of 2016, we earned $2.35 per share compared to $2.30 in the third quarter of 2015. 
Slide 4 outlines the variances in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. Looking at gross margin, the largest single driver during the quarter was unfavorable weather which decreased earnings by $0.09. In aggregate, this year's third quarter was the mildest in the last 10 years where we experienced one of the hottest July's on record followed by some of the mildest August and September conditions we've seen the last 20 years. 
Sales in the third quarter of this year compared to the third in 2015 added $0.02 to gross margin. In total, weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales were essentially flat compared to last year, but similar to the pattern we saw in the second quarter of this year, the sales trend by customer class were mixed and ending up yielding a positive gross margin effect. And lastly, our transmission and LFCR adjustors continue to add incremental growth to our gross margin as designed, contributing $0.09 per share collectively. 
Now turning to operating expenses, which, combined, contributed $0.02 per share. Lower depreciation and amortization expense and lower other taxes each contributed $0.01 to earnings. Lower D&A included higher expenses resulting from additional plants served, which were offset by lower depreciation related to the extension of the Palo Verde's sale-leaseback. In line with our expectations, as we have previously indicated, operations and maintenance expense was flat in the third quarter of this year relative to last year. This also aligns with guidance with a projected increase in 2016 O&M over 2015 having been realized in the first half of the year. 
Interest expense net of AFUDC was another positive driver to earnings during the third quarter of this year compared to the third quarter of 2015. The net reduction included higher interest charges resulting from higher balances offset by a higher construction work in progress benefiting AFUDC. As a reminder, both the O&M and gross margin variances exclude amounts related to our renewable energy and demand side management programs. Also note that the gross margin and D&A variances exclude operating revenues and expenses related to the Palo Verde Unit 2 decommissioning recovered through a system benefit charge. The drivers I discussed exclude these items as there is no net impact on third quarter results. 
As Arizona's growing economy continues to be an integral part of our value proposition, I'll highlight next the trends we are seeing in our local economy and in particular, the Metro Phoenix area. In the latest quarter, the Metro Phoenix region continued its trend of generating solid job and population growth at rates above the national average. In fact, of the 50 largest metro areas across the country, Metro Phoenix ranks as the third fastest-growing area in population and the fourth fastest-growing in jobs. This above average job growth holds true in virtually every major industry sector as well although the most significant performance gains are seen in the construction, financial services and wholesale trade sectors. This strong job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate market. Absorption of vacant commercial space remains steady in the third quarter with over 1 million square feet of office and retail space occupied by new tenants. 
As seen on the upper panel of Slide 5, vacancy rates in both markets have -- fall to levels last seen in 2008 or earlier and almost 3 million square feet of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support commercial development. 
The residential real estate market reflects these trends as well. As you can see on the lower panel of Slide 5, housing construction is on pace to have its best year since 2007 driven primarily by the single-family market. And overall, the amount of vacant housing in Phoenix is solidly back to pre-recession levels. Record low apartment vacancies and absorption of available single-family homes is providing meaningful support to home prices, which have returned to levels last seen in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth, low mortgage rates and the opening up of credit to the wave of households who suffer from foreclosures during the recession should allow the Phoenix Metro housing market and economy more generally to expand at a healthy pace over the next couple of years. 
Reflecting this steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.4% compared to the third quarter of last year. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
In closing, I will review our recent financing activity, earnings guidance and financial outlook. On September 20, APS issued $250 million of 10-year 2.55% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds from the sale were used to repay commercial paper borrowings and replenish cash temporarily used in connection with the payment of APS's August senior unsecured note maturity. 
On August 31, Pinnacle West entered into a $75 million 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility. At end of the quarter, Pinnacle West had $34 million outstanding under the facility, and APS had $83 million of commercial paper outstanding. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity continue to remain very strong. 
As Don discussed, in October, the Board of Directors increased the indicated annual dividend by $0.12 per share or approximately 5% to $2.62 per share effective with our December payment. 
Looking to guidance. We expect Pinnacle West consolidated ongoing earnings for 2016 will be in the range of $3.90 to $4.10 per share. However, based on year-to-date results, we expect to be in the lower half of the range. You will find a complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance included on Slide 6, which are unchanged. 
Similar to prior years with rate case proceedings, we'll evaluate the appropriate time to issue 2017 information and APS guidance as the rate case progresses. In the meantime, to assist with your estimates, we have updated our rate base forecast through 2019, which is included in the appendix to today's slides. The primary drivers have not changed and the trajectory of 6% to 7% growth off of 2015 continues. We will provide updates to our CapEx forecast and other drivers on our fourth quarter call as part of our 10-K update. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

Although we experienced mild weather during August and September, our positive customer growth and disciplined cost management continue to support our ability to meet our financial commitments. 
Our board also approved a 5% dividend increase effective with the December payment, continuing the predictable return of capital to our shareholders. 
Before Jim discusses the details of our third quarter results, I'll provide several updates on recent operational and regulatory developments. Our operations teams did an excellent job maintaining the generating fleet and the electrical grid again this summer. The Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station performed well, and Unit 3 entered its planned refueling outage on October 8. Although this summer was mild compared to last, temperatures soared to 118 degrees on June 19. And demand for electricity peaked at 7,051 megawatts. 
On a weather-normalized basis, this was the highest peak demand for APS in 9 years. Our growing customer demand further demonstrates the need to continue expanding the grid while adding peaking resources. 
One data point worth noting is that when our customers were using the most energy, around 5:30 p.m. on June 19, rooftop solar on our system was producing only 28% of its capacity. Meanwhile, utility scale solar was producing 72% of its capacity because most utility scale panels are on trackers that move with the sun. A couple of hours later, when our system demand was still above 7,000 megawatts, essentially not changed, rooftop solar production plummeted to 0. This scenario is not unique to our peak day and highlights the importance of the electric grid at all hours of the day. On average, our customers now reach their summer peak energy demand 45 minutes later in the day than they did 4 years ago. With customers using more energy in the evening hours, APS's on-peak hours of noon to 7 p.m. are outdated. This is why we have recently proposed to change on-peak hours to 3 to 8 p.m. so on peak pricing is better aligned with customer demand. 
As I discussed on our last call, APS filed a rate review on June 1. Since the filing, we have continued to communicate with the Arizona Corporation Commission staff and intervenors regarding the details of the proposal and its intent. The ACC staff and intervenors will file their direct testimony on all matters except rate design, on December 21 and their remaining direct testimony on January 27. Parties will have the opportunity to enter into formal settlement discussions before the hearing commences on March 22. 
On a related matter, a recommended opinion and order was issued by the Administrative Law Judge on October 7 for the value and cost of distributed generation docket. The recommendation proposed progress on several key issues, including the elimination of net metering to be replaced by new methodologies consistent with staff's proposal. These methodologies align the value of export energy from rooftop solar with either a utilities avoided cost or a resource comparison proxy comprised of actual utility scale solar PPA cost. The ALJ recommendation also concludes that rooftop solar customers are partial requirement customers and suggested the termination for placing these customers on a separate class should be addressed in the rate review proceeding. This item is expected to be heard in the December 13 and 14 commission open meeting. 
On September 30, APS filed its preliminary 2017 Integrated Resource Plan or IRP with the Corporation Commission. The plan addresses several key factors, including our future resource needs as customer demand grows and power supply contracts expire. By 2022, our incremental resource requirement is forecasted to be in excess of 3,500 megawatts. This resource gap will be fulfilled through a variety of sources, including the Ocotillo Modernization Project, which is on track for completion in 2019. Earlier this year, we issued an all source request for proposals seeking 400 to 600 megawatts of capacity by 2020, which will also contribute toward our future resource needs. We have shortlisted proposals and we'll be finalizing a resource selection in the coming months. The remainder of our resource requirements will be evaluated as part of the IRP process, which may include additional RFPs in the future. 
On October 1, APS successfully began full participation in the Western energy imbalance market. This real-time wholesale power market enables APS to exchange energy with a variety of resources across 8 Western states, reducing cost for our customers and improving the integration of renewable resources. This was a smooth transition and well managed by our operations teams. 
Turning to our capital investment program. We continue making good progress on the installation of selective catalytic reduction technology at the Four Corners power plant. Our 40-megawatt utility scale solar plant, Red Rock, is on schedule for completion later this year, and our 4 megawatts of battery storage investments are also on track for completion this year as part of the Solar Partner Program. 
We completed 3 high-voltage transmission lines this year to support our customer growth west of Phoenix, which total $145 million of investment in the reliability of our transmission system. And finally, our innovative micro grid project for the department of the Navy will begin commercial operation next month at the Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma, Arizona. 
Let me conclude by saying that we remain focused on delivering our financial and operational commitments. We have a busy calendar over the next year. And while the Corporation Commission addresses rate design modernization, and we engage with stakeholders on our rate review, our capital investment program continues to be robust and is focused on flexible generation, new grid technology and advancing our core utility operations to prepare for the changing needs of our customers. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."
296957,403436515,1072224,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Don, and thank you, again, everyone for joining us on the call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter 2016, which, excluding historically mild weather, were in line with our expectations. As summarized on Slide",1161,"Thank you, Don, and thank you, again, everyone for joining us on the call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter 2016, which, excluding historically mild weather, were in line with our expectations. 
As summarized on Slide 3 of the materials, for the third quarter of 2016, we earned $2.35 per share compared to $2.30 in the third quarter of 2015. 
Slide 4 outlines the variances in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. Looking at gross margin, the largest single driver during the quarter was unfavorable weather which decreased earnings by $0.09. In aggregate, this year's third quarter was the mildest in the last 10 years where we experienced one of the hottest July's on record followed by some of the mildest August and September conditions we've seen the last 20 years. 
Sales in the third quarter of this year compared to the third in 2015 added $0.02 to gross margin. In total, weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales were essentially flat compared to last year, but similar to the pattern we saw in the second quarter of this year, the sales trend by customer class were mixed and ending up yielding a positive gross margin effect. And lastly, our transmission and LFCR adjustors continue to add incremental growth to our gross margin as designed, contributing $0.09 per share collectively. 
Now turning to operating expenses, which, combined, contributed $0.02 per share. Lower depreciation and amortization expense and lower other taxes each contributed $0.01 to earnings. Lower D&A included higher expenses resulting from additional plants served, which were offset by lower depreciation related to the extension of the Palo Verde's sale-leaseback. In line with our expectations, as we have previously indicated, operations and maintenance expense was flat in the third quarter of this year relative to last year. This also aligns with guidance with a projected increase in 2016 O&M over 2015 having been realized in the first half of the year. 
Interest expense net of AFUDC was another positive driver to earnings during the third quarter of this year compared to the third quarter of 2015. The net reduction included higher interest charges resulting from higher balances offset by a higher construction work in progress benefiting AFUDC. As a reminder, both the O&M and gross margin variances exclude amounts related to our renewable energy and demand side management programs. Also note that the gross margin and D&A variances exclude operating revenues and expenses related to the Palo Verde Unit 2 decommissioning recovered through a system benefit charge. The drivers I discussed exclude these items as there is no net impact on third quarter results. 
As Arizona's growing economy continues to be an integral part of our value proposition, I'll highlight next the trends we are seeing in our local economy and in particular, the Metro Phoenix area. In the latest quarter, the Metro Phoenix region continued its trend of generating solid job and population growth at rates above the national average. In fact, of the 50 largest metro areas across the country, Metro Phoenix ranks as the third fastest-growing area in population and the fourth fastest-growing in jobs. This above average job growth holds true in virtually every major industry sector as well although the most significant performance gains are seen in the construction, financial services and wholesale trade sectors. This strong job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate market. Absorption of vacant commercial space remains steady in the third quarter with over 1 million square feet of office and retail space occupied by new tenants. 
As seen on the upper panel of Slide 5, vacancy rates in both markets have -- fall to levels last seen in 2008 or earlier and almost 3 million square feet of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will, in turn, support commercial development. 
The residential real estate market reflects these trends as well. As you can see on the lower panel of Slide 5, housing construction is on pace to have its best year since 2007 driven primarily by the single-family market. And overall, the amount of vacant housing in Phoenix is solidly back to pre-recession levels. Record low apartment vacancies and absorption of available single-family homes is providing meaningful support to home prices, which have returned to levels last seen in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth, low mortgage rates and the opening up of credit to the wave of households who suffer from foreclosures during the recession should allow the Phoenix Metro housing market and economy more generally to expand at a healthy pace over the next couple of years. 
Reflecting this steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.4% compared to the third quarter of last year. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
In closing, I will review our recent financing activity, earnings guidance and financial outlook. On September 20, APS issued $250 million of 10-year 2.55% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds from the sale were used to repay commercial paper borrowings and replenish cash temporarily used in connection with the payment of APS's August senior unsecured note maturity. 
On August 31, Pinnacle West entered into a $75 million 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility. At end of the quarter, Pinnacle West had $34 million outstanding under the facility, and APS had $83 million of commercial paper outstanding. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity continue to remain very strong. 
As Don discussed, in October, the Board of Directors increased the indicated annual dividend by $0.12 per share or approximately 5% to $2.62 per share effective with our December payment. 
Looking to guidance. We expect Pinnacle West consolidated ongoing earnings for 2016 will be in the range of $3.90 to $4.10 per share. However, based on year-to-date results, we expect to be in the lower half of the range. You will find a complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance included on Slide 6, which are unchanged. 
Similar to prior years with rate case proceedings, we'll evaluate the appropriate time to issue 2017 information and APS guidance as the rate case progresses. In the meantime, to assist with your estimates, we have updated our rate base forecast through 2019, which is included in the appendix to today's slides. The primary drivers have not changed and the trajectory of 6% to 7% growth off of 2015 continues. We will provide updates to our CapEx forecast and other drivers on our fourth quarter call as part of our 10-K update. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

I will now turn the call over to Don."

This year continues to be in line with our expectations and keeping us on pace with our guidance for the year. Although we experienced mild weather during August and September, our positive customer growth and disciplined cost management continue to support our ability to meet our financial commitments. 
Our board also approved a 5% dividend increase effective with the December payment, continuing the predictable return of capital to our shareholders. 
Before Jim discusses the details of our third quarter results, I'll provide several updates on recent operational and regulatory developments. Our operations teams did an excellent job maintaining the generating fleet and the electrical grid again this summer. The Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station performed well, and Unit 3 entered its planned refueling outage on October 8. Although this summer was mild compared to last, temperatures soared to 118 degrees on June 19. And demand for electricity peaked at 7,051 megawatts. 
On a weather-normalized basis, this was the highest peak demand for APS in 9 years. Our growing customer demand further demonstrates the need to continue expanding the grid, while adding peaking resources. 
One data point worth noting is that when our customers were using the most energy at around 5:30 p.m. on June 19, rooftop solar on our system was producing only 28% of its capacity. Meanwhile, utility scale solar was producing 72% of its capacity because most utility scale panels are on trackers that move with the sun. A couple of hours later, when our system demand was still above 7,000 megawatts, essentially not changed, rooftop solar production plummeted to 0. This scenario is not unique to our peak day and highlights the importance of the electric grid at all hours of the day. On average, our customers now reach their summer peak energy demand 45 minutes later in the day than they did 4 years ago. With customers using more energy in the evening hours, APS's on-peak hours of noon to 7 p.m. are outdated. This is why we have recently proposed to change on-peak hours to 3 to 8 p.m. so on peak pricing is better aligned with customer demand. 
As I discussed on our last call, APS filed a rate review on June 1. Since the filing, we have continued to communicate with the Arizona Corporation Commission staff and intervenors regarding the details of the proposal and its intent. The ACC staff and intervenors will file their direct testimony on all matters except rate design on December 21 and their remaining direct testimony on January 27. Parties will have the opportunity to enter into formal settlement discussions before the hearing commences on March 22. 
On a related matter, a recommended opinion and order was issued by the administrative law judge on October 7 for the value and cost of distributed generation docket. The recommendation proposed progress on several key issues, including the elimination of net metering to be replaced by new methodologies consistent with staff's proposal. These methodologies align the value of export energy from rooftop solar with either a utilities avoided cost or a resource comparison proxy comprised of actual utility scale solar PPA cost. The ALJ recommendation also concludes that rooftop solar customers are partial requirement customers and suggested determination for placing these customers in a separate class should be addressed in the rate review proceeding. This item is expected to be heard in the December 13 and 14 commission open meeting. 
On September 30, APS filed its preliminary 2017 Integrated Resource Plan or IRP with the Corporation Commission. The plan addresses several key factors, including our future resource needs as customer demand grows and power supply contracts expire. By 2022, our incremental resource requirement is forecasted to be in excess of 3,500 megawatts. This resource gap will be fulfilled through a variety of sources, including the Ocotillo Modernization Project, which is on track for completion in 2019. Earlier this year, we issued an all-source request for proposals seeking 400 to 600 megawatts of capacity by 2020, which will also contribute toward our future resource needs. We have shortlisted proposals and will be finalizing a resource selection in the coming months. The remainder of our resource requirements will be evaluated as part of the IRP process, which may include additional RFPs in the future. 
On October 1, APS successfully began full participation in the Western energy imbalance market. This real-time wholesale power market enables APS to exchange energy with a variety of resources across 8 Western states, reducing cost for our customers and improving the integration of renewable resources. This was a smooth transition and well managed by our operations teams. 
Turning to our capital investment program. We continue making good progress on the installation of selective catalytic reduction technology at the Four Corners power plant. Our 40-megawatt utility scale solar plant, Red Rock, is on schedule for completion later this year, and our 4 megawatts of battery storage investments are also on track for completion this year as part of the Solar Partner Program. 
We completed 3 high-voltage transmission lines this year to support our customer growth west of Phoenix, which total $145 million of investment in the reliability of our transmission system. And finally, our innovative micro grid project for the Department of the Navy will begin commercial operation next month at the Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma, Arizona. 
Let me conclude by saying that we remain focused on delivering our financial and operational commitments. We have a busy calendar over the next year. And while the Corporation Commission addresses rate design modernization and we engage with stakeholders on our rate review, our capital investment program continues to be robust and is focused on flexible generation, new grid technology and advancing our core utility operations to prepare for the changing needs of our customers. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."
296957,403436515,1073170,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Don. And thank you, again, everyone for joining us on the call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter 2016, which, excluding historically mild weather, were in line with our expectations. As summarized on Slide",1161,"Thank you, Don. And thank you, again, everyone for joining us on the call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter 2016, which, excluding historically mild weather, were in line with our expectations. 
As summarized on Slide 3 of the materials, for the third quarter of 2016, we earned $2.35 per share compared to $2.30 in the third quarter of 2015. 
Slide 4 outlines the variances in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. Looking at gross margin, the largest single driver during the quarter was unfavorable weather, which decreased earnings by $0.09. In aggregate, this year's third quarter was the mildest in the last 10 years where we experienced one of the hottest July's on record followed by some of the mildest August and September conditions we've seen the last 20 years. 
Sales in the third quarter of this year compared to the third in 2015 added $0.02 to gross margin. In total, weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales were essentially flat compared to last year; but similar to the pattern we saw in the second quarter of this year, the sales trend by customer class were mixed and ending up yielding a positive gross margin effect. And lastly, our transmission and LFCR adjustors continue to add incremental growth to our gross margin as designed, contributing $0.09 per share collectively. 
Now turning to operating expenses, which combined contributed $0.02 per share. Lower depreciation and amortization expense and lower other taxes each contributed $0.01 to earnings. Lower D&A included higher expenses resulting from additional plants served, which were offset by lower depreciation related to the extension of the Palo Verde's sale-leaseback. In line with our expectations, as we have previously indicated, operations and maintenance expense was flat in the third quarter of this year relative to last year. This also aligns with guidance, with a projected increase in 2016 O&M over 2015 having been realized in the first half of the year. 
Interest expense net of AFUDC was another positive driver to earnings during the third quarter of this year compared to the third quarter of 2015. The net reduction included higher interest charges resulting from higher balances offset by a higher construction work in progress benefiting AFUDC. As a reminder, both the O&M and gross margin variances exclude amounts related to our renewable energy and demand-side management programs. Also note that the gross margin and D&A variances exclude operating revenues and expenses related to the Palo Verde Unit 2 decommissioning recovered through a system benefit charge. The drivers I discussed exclude these items, as there is no net impact on third quarter results. 
As Arizona's growing economy continues to be an integral part of our value proposition, I'll highlight next the trends we are seeing in our local economy and in particular the Metro Phoenix area. In the latest quarter, the Metro Phoenix region continued its trend of generating solid job and population growth at rates above the national average. In fact, of the 50 largest metro areas across the country, Metro Phoenix ranks as the third fastest-growing area in population and the fourth fastest growing in jobs. This above-average job growth holds true in virtually every major industry sector as well, although the most significant performance gains are seen in the construction, financial services and wholesale trade sectors. This strong job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate market. Absorption of vacant commercial space remains steady in the third quarter with over 1 million square feet of office and retail space occupied by new tenants. 
As seen on the upper panel of Slide 5, vacancy rates in both markets have fallen to levels last seen in 2008 or earlier, and almost 3 million square feet of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will in turn support commercial development. 
The residential real estate market reflects these trends as well. As you can see on the lower panel of Slide 5, housing construction is on pace to have its best year since 2007 driven primarily by the single-family market. And overall, the amount of vacant housing in Phoenix is solidly back to prerecession levels. Record low apartment vacancies and absorption of available single-family homes is providing meaningful support to home prices, which have returned to levels last seen in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth, low mortgage rates and the opening up of credit to the wave of households who suffered from foreclosures during the recession should allow the Phoenix Metro housing market and the economy more generally to expand at a healthy pace over the next couple of years. 
Reflecting this steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.4% compared to the third quarter of last year. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
In closing, I will review our recent financing activity, earnings guidance and financial outlook. On September 20, APS issued $250 million of 10-year 2.55% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds from the sale were used to repay commercial paper borrowings and replenish cash temporarily used in connection with the payment of APS's August senior unsecured note maturity. 
On August 31, Pinnacle West entered into a $75 million 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility. At the end of the quarter, Pinnacle West had $34 million outstanding under the facility, and APS had $83 million of commercial paper outstanding. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity continue to remain very strong. 
As Don discussed, in October the Board of Directors increased the indicated annual dividend by $0.12 per share or approximately 5% to $2.62 per share effective with our December payment. 
Looking to guidance. We expect Pinnacle West consolidated ongoing earnings for 2016 will be in the range of $3.90 to $4.10 per share. However, based on year-to-date results, we expect to be in the lower half of the range. You will find a complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance included on Slide 6, which are unchanged. 
Similar to prior years with rate case proceedings, we'll evaluate the appropriate time to issue 2017 information and APS guidance as the rate case progresses. In the meantime, to assist with your estimates, we have updated our rate base forecast through 2019, which is included in the appendix to today's slides. The primary drivers have not changed, and the trajectory of 6% to 7% growth off of 2015 continues. We will provide updates to our CapEx forecast and other drivers on our fourth quarter call as part of our 10-K update. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

I will now turn the call over to Don."

This year continues to be in line with our expectations and keeping us on pace with our guidance for the year. Although we experienced mild weather during August and September, our positive customer growth and disciplined cost management continue to support our ability to meet our financial commitments. 
Our board also approved a 5% dividend increase effective with the December payment, continuing the predictable return of capital to our shareholders. 
Before Jim discusses the details of our third quarter results, I'll provide several updates on recent operational and regulatory developments. Our operations teams did an excellent job maintaining the generating fleet and the electrical grid again this summer. The Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station performed well, and Unit 3 entered its planned refueling outage on October 8. Although this summer was mild compared to last, temperatures soared to 118 degrees on June 19. And demand for electricity peaked at 7,051 megawatts. 
On a weather-normalized basis, this was the highest peak demand for APS in 9 years. Our growing customer demand further demonstrates the need to continue expanding the grid, while adding peaking resources. 
One data point worth noting is that when our customers were using the most energy at around 5:30 p.m. on June 19, rooftop solar on our system was producing only 28% of its capacity. Meanwhile, utility scale solar was producing 72% of its capacity because most utility scale panels are on trackers that move with the sun. A couple of hours later, when our system demand was still above 7,000 megawatts, essentially not changed, rooftop solar production plummeted to 0. This scenario is not unique to our peak day and highlights the importance of the electric grid at all hours of the day. On average, our customers now reach their summer peak energy demand 45 minutes later in the day than they did 4 years ago. With customers using more energy in the evening hours, APS's on-peak hours of noon to 7 p.m. are outdated. This is why we have recently proposed to change on-peak hours to 3 to 8 p.m. so on peak pricing is better aligned with customer demand. 
As I discussed on our last call, APS filed a rate review on June 1. Since the filing, we have continued to communicate with the Arizona Corporation Commission staff and intervenors regarding the details of the proposal and its intent. The ACC staff and intervenors will file their direct testimony on all matters except rate design on December 21 and their remaining direct testimony on January 27. Parties will have the opportunity to enter into formal settlement discussions before the hearing commences on March 22. 
On a related matter, a recommended opinion and order was issued by the administrative law judge on October 7 for the value and cost of distributed generation docket. The recommendation proposed progress on several key issues, including the elimination of net metering to be replaced by new methodologies consistent with staff's proposal. These methodologies align the value of export energy from rooftop solar with either a utilities avoided cost or a resource comparison proxy comprised of actual utility scale solar PPA cost. The ALJ recommendation also concludes that rooftop solar customers are partial requirement customers and suggested determination for placing these customers in a separate class should be addressed in the rate review proceeding. This item is expected to be heard in the December 13 and 14 commission open meeting. 
On September 30, APS filed its preliminary 2017 Integrated Resource Plan or IRP with the Corporation Commission. The plan addresses several key factors, including our future resource needs as customer demand grows and power supply contracts expire. By 2022, our incremental resource requirement is forecasted to be in excess of 3,500 megawatts. This resource gap will be fulfilled through a variety of sources, including the Ocotillo Modernization Project, which is on track for completion in 2019. Earlier this year, we issued an all-source request for proposals seeking 400 to 600 megawatts of capacity by 2020, which will also contribute toward our future resource needs. We have shortlisted proposals and will be finalizing a resource selection in the coming months. The remainder of our resource requirements will be evaluated as part of the IRP process, which may include additional RFPs in the future. 
On October 1, APS successfully began full participation in the Western energy imbalance market. This real-time wholesale power market enables APS to exchange energy with a variety of resources across 8 Western states, reducing cost for our customers and improving the integration of renewable resources. This was a smooth transition and well managed by our operations teams. 
Turning to our capital investment program. We continue making good progress on the installation of selective catalytic reduction technology at the Four Corners power plant. Our 40-megawatt utility scale solar plant, Red Rock, is on schedule for completion later this year, and our 4 megawatts of battery storage investments are also on track for completion this year as part of the Solar Partner Program. 
We completed 3 high-voltage transmission lines this year to support our customer growth west of Phoenix, which total $145 million of investment in the reliability of our transmission system. And finally, our innovative micro grid project for the Department of the Navy will begin commercial operation next month at the Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma, Arizona. 
Let me conclude by saying that we remain focused on delivering our financial and operational commitments. We have a busy calendar over the next year. And while the Corporation Commission addresses rate design modernization and we engage with stakeholders on our rate review, our capital investment program continues to be robust and is focused on flexible generation, new grid technology and advancing our core utility operations to prepare for the changing needs of our customers. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim."
296957,403436515,1075258,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Don. And thank you, again, everyone for joining us on the call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter 2016, which, excluding historically mild weather, were in line with our expectations. As summarized on Slide",1161,"Thank you, Don. And thank you, again, everyone for joining us on the call. This morning, we reported our financial results for the third quarter 2016, which, excluding historically mild weather, were in line with our expectations. 
As summarized on Slide 3 of the materials, for the third quarter of 2016, we earned $2.35 per share compared to $2.30 in the third quarter of 2015. 
Slide 4 outlines the variances in our quarterly ongoing earnings per share. Looking at gross margin, the largest single driver during the quarter was unfavorable weather, which decreased earnings by $0.09. In aggregate, this year's third quarter was the mildest in the last 10 years where we experienced one of the hottest July's on record followed by some of the mildest August and September conditions we've seen the last 20 years. 
Sales in the third quarter of this year compared to the third in 2015 added $0.02 to gross margin. In total, weather-normalized retail kilowatt hour sales were essentially flat compared to last year; but similar to the pattern we saw in the second quarter of this year, the sales trend by customer class were mixed and ending up yielding a positive gross margin effect. And lastly, our transmission and LFCR adjustors continue to add incremental growth to our gross margin as designed, contributing $0.09 per share collectively. 
Now turning to operating expenses, which combined contributed $0.02 per share. Lower depreciation and amortization expense and lower other taxes each contributed $0.01 to earnings. Lower D&A included higher expenses resulting from additional plants served, which were offset by lower depreciation related to the extension of the Palo Verde's sale-leaseback. In line with our expectations, as we have previously indicated, operations and maintenance expense was flat in the third quarter of this year relative to last year. This also aligns with guidance, with a projected increase in 2016 O&M over 2015 having been realized in the first half of the year. 
Interest expense net of AFUDC was another positive driver to earnings during the third quarter of this year compared to the third quarter of 2015. The net reduction included higher interest charges resulting from higher balances offset by a higher construction work in progress benefiting AFUDC. As a reminder, both the O&M and gross margin variances exclude amounts related to our renewable energy and demand-side management programs. Also note that the gross margin and D&A variances exclude operating revenues and expenses related to the Palo Verde Unit 2 decommissioning recovered through a system benefit charge. The drivers I discussed exclude these items, as there is no net impact on third quarter results. 
As Arizona's growing economy continues to be an integral part of our value proposition, I'll highlight next the trends we are seeing in our local economy and in particular the Metro Phoenix area. In the latest quarter, the Metro Phoenix region continued its trend of generating solid job and population growth at rates above the national average. In fact, of the 50 largest metro areas across the country, Metro Phoenix ranks as the third fastest-growing area in population and the fourth fastest growing in jobs. This above-average job growth holds true in virtually every major industry sector as well, although the most significant performance gains are seen in the construction, financial services and wholesale trade sectors. This strong job growth continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate market. Absorption of vacant commercial space remains steady in the third quarter with over 1 million square feet of office and retail space occupied by new tenants. 
As seen on the upper panel of Slide 5, vacancy rates in both markets have fallen to levels last seen in 2008 or earlier, and almost 3 million square feet of new office and retail space was under construction at the end of the quarter. We expect a continuation of business expansion and related job growth in the Phoenix market, which will in turn support commercial development. 
The residential real estate market reflects these trends as well. As you can see on the lower panel of Slide 5, housing construction is on pace to have its best year since 2007 driven primarily by the single-family market. And overall, the amount of vacant housing in Phoenix is solidly back to prerecession levels. Record low apartment vacancies and absorption of available single-family homes is providing meaningful support to home prices, which have returned to levels last seen in early 2008. We believe that solid job growth, low mortgage rates and the opening up of credit to the wave of households who suffered from foreclosures during the recession should allow the Phoenix Metro housing market and the economy more generally to expand at a healthy pace over the next couple of years. 
Reflecting this steady improvement in economic conditions, APS's retail customer base grew 1.4% compared to the third quarter of last year. We expect that this growth rate will continue to gradually accelerate in response to the economic growth trends I just discussed. Importantly, the long-term fundamentals supporting future population, job growth and economic development in Arizona appear to be in place. 
In closing, I will review our recent financing activity, earnings guidance and financial outlook. On September 20, APS issued $250 million of 10-year 2.55% senior unsecured notes. The proceeds from the sale were used to repay commercial paper borrowings and replenish cash temporarily used in connection with the payment of APS's August senior unsecured note maturity. 
On August 31, Pinnacle West entered into a $75 million 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility. At the end of the quarter, Pinnacle West had $34 million outstanding under the facility, and APS had $83 million of commercial paper outstanding. Overall, our balance sheet and liquidity continue to remain very strong. 
As Don discussed, in October the Board of Directors increased the indicated annual dividend by $0.12 per share or approximately 5% to $2.62 per share effective with our December payment. 
Looking to guidance. We expect Pinnacle West consolidated ongoing earnings for 2016 will be in the range of $3.90 to $4.10 per share. However, based on year-to-date results, we expect to be in the lower half of the range. You will find a complete list of factors and assumptions underlying our guidance included on Slide 6, which are unchanged. 
Similar to prior years with rate case proceedings, we'll evaluate the appropriate time to issue 2017 information and APS guidance as the rate case progresses. In the meantime, to assist with your estimates, we have updated our rate base forecast through 2019, which is included in the appendix to today's slides. The primary drivers have not changed, and the trajectory of 6% to 7% growth off of 2015 continues. We will provide updates to our CapEx forecast and other drivers on our fourth quarter call as part of our 10-K update. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions."
