It's great to be with you to review our results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015. It has been a very exciting and successful 2015 for Allergan as we continue to transform our business into a growth",1260,"Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be with you to review our results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015. It has been a very exciting and successful 2015 for Allergan as we continue to transform our business into a growth pharma leader. 
Allergan's fourth quarter and full year performance reflects a continued laser focus on executing on the 4 pillars of our growth strategy: first, operational excellence. We powered another quarter of exceptional financial performance while successfully integrating Forest and Allergan. With the planned divestiture of our Generics business to Teva, we are accelerating our transformation into a growth pharma leader. Second, our focus on therapeutic area leadership has led to strong, growing branded franchises with new product launches serving as a growth accelerator. Third, our productive and innovative R&D engine continues to produce at a record pace. In 2015, we delivered 4 branded NME FDA approvals. That is nearly 10% of all such approvals by the agency in 2015. With more than 70 mid- to late-stage programs in development, our branded pipeline is poised to continue to delivering innovative products for patients across every key therapeutic areas. 
Our best-in-class generics R&D engine also finished the year strong with 46 new ANDAs filed, including 22 first-to-file applications. And we're continuing to execute on strategic business development opportunities. Our Open Science model has helped us build or expand #1 or 2 positions in many of our key therapeutic areas and has delivered significant R&D assets to build a sustainable pipeline. With our proposed combination with Pfizer, we are positioned to create the leading global biopharmaceutical company in the world. 
Turning to Slide 6. This year was highly transformative for Allergan with the announced divestiture of our Global Generics business to Teva. We continue to make great progress in our planning efforts, and Teva continues to make progress with regulatory authorities. We're working towards satisfying all conditions in order to close by the end of the first quarter of 2016. However, it is possible that closing could slip beyond the end of the first quarter. I'm very proud of the tremendous focus and execution of our Global Generics team, and we look forward to the combination of our 2 great generics businesses. 
Slide 7. Now let me turn to the continuing operations business performance in the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter net revenue grew 74% on a year-over-year basis to $4.2 billion as a result of the Allergan acquisition and strong global growth within all of our key therapeutic categories. Strong sales in key products across our businesses drove a 33% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share to $3.41. Meanwhile, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA rose to $2 billion, an increase of 115% versus prior year, and cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion, excluding R&D asset acquisitions, restructuring and integration payments. These results illustrate the strong long-term growth profile of Allergan and our growth pharma model. 
Our team continues to drive strong performance. 5 of our 7 franchises have now reached the $1 billion mark. We maintained or expanded our leadership position in all of our key therapeutic categories. And when you exclude the impact of foreign exchange and Namenda IR, all of our therapeutic area businesses delivered double-digit growth. 
Slide 9. Our branded revenues grew double digits for the year, and growth was broad based across our key therapeutic areas. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, 3/4 of our top global products grew at double-digit rate. Nine of our top global products grew more than 15%. Leading growth drivers included Restasis, plus 19%; fillers, plus 20%; Botox, plus 14%; Linzess, plus 55%; Viibryd, plus 26%; and LoLoestrin, plus 26%. 
We continued to solidify our leadership in key categories with strong execution on launches. Our recent launch of Viberzi for the treatment of IBS-D is off to a strong and early start and is in line with our previous launch of Linzess and IBS-C. in Anti-infectives, our launches of AvyCaz and DALVANCE had delivered strong results throughout the year and are outpacing competition with an impressive launch trajectory. 
The launch of Liletta, our IUD, earlier this year has been very successful, showing continued growth momentum in unit sales. a key driver within our fillers line in the U.S., continues to drive strong growth for our Allergan medical business. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to drive growth through new approvals and upcoming launches, including in the first quarter of 2016. 
Touching on our international business, our teams delivered continued double-digit revenue growth from key products, including Botox therapeutic, Ozurdex and our glaucoma business. Our international eye care team led an exceptional rollout of Ozurdex in new countries with new indications, driving a 35% growth rate for that product year-over-year. 
In addition, our international team launched several key products in 2015, including Juvederm in China, and we gained rights to Constella in more than 40 markets, which adds another growth driver for this business in 2016. 
Turning to Slide 11. As noted earlier, we have made tremendous R&D progress this year. Our Open Science model seeks to deliver innovation regardless of its source. We've utilized this model to acquire or in license innovative products that expand our therapeutic area leadership, and 2015 was a year of impressive productivity on this front. 
In eye care, we continue to add shots on goal in development opportunities for dry eye disease and glaucoma with the acquisitions of Oculeve, Mimetogen and AqueSys. 
In Aesthetics, we completed the acquisition of Kythera, adding Kybella, a nonsurgical treatment for submental fullness for double chin. We also acquired Northwood Medical Innovation, and its less invasive surgery product earfold as well as Anterios and its proprietary NDS platform delivery technology that could enable local, targeted delivery of neurotoxins to the skin without the need for injections. 
In CNS, we completed the acquisition of Naurex, which added rapastinel, a breakthrough designated treatment in the development for depression and other potentially breakthrough treatments in depression. We also in licensed a right to Merck's development stage oral CGRP programs for the potential treatment of migraines, which we expect to enter Phase III later this year. And late in the fourth quarter, we announced our collaboration with Rugen Therapeutics to support the discovery and development of novel therapies for autism spectrum disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorders. 
And in GI, we acquired commercial rights to Constella in key international markets. This adds an important flagship product for our international GI commercial team and positions us strongly for the potential introduction of eluxadoline in international markets later this year. 
Turning to Slide 12. A key driver of future growth is new launches in 2016 and beyond. Both in the U.S. and internationally, we are poised to deliver sustainable growth through a number of new launches across 5 different therapeutic categories in 2006 (sic) [ 2016 ] and early 2017. We will add important new products in the U.S., including Vraylar, multidose, preservative-free Restasis, a new Botox indication, ACZONE 7.5%, then XEN for glaucoma, Oculeve for dry eye and new fillers, including VOLBELLA and Volite. 
Internationally, we will drive growth through new products, including for glaucoma, Optive gel drops in the EU, Kybella also known as in Canada and Australia and Volite in the EU later in 2017. 
With more than 70 projects in mid- to late-stage development, we have multiple programs in each of our leading therapeutic areas to help us to sustain strong future growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David Nicholson, who'll provide a more detailed pipeline update. David?"

Thanks, Brent. Good morning, everyone. On Slide 14, as you see and as mentioned by Brent, Allergan's R&D team has had a highly productive year with more than 100 pharma regulatory approvals worldwide. These strong results included submissions of our multidose, preservative-free formulation of Restasis and then valsartan fixed dose combination in the United States. 
We have 25 major drug approvals globally, including Liletta, Viberzi, Kybella and Vraylar in United States and Dalvance in the EU. We had 12 major device approvals, including Volite in the EU and Juvederm in China. 45 NMEs were approved in the U.S.A. last year. 
Allergan compounds, Vraylar, Kybella and AvyCaz accounted for nearly 10% of these approvals. This was a truly remarkable year to Allergan's R&D team, and I applaud them for their hard work and tremendous success. 
I do want to take a moment to recognize my colleague, Harford Friedreich, who heads the generic R&D. The team's achievements continues to set the industry standard with 46 new ANDAs filed, which included 22 first-to-file applications. 
Outside the U.S., they filed more than 1,000 marketing to key products in key markets around the world. 
On Slide 15, I look forward into 2016. Allergan's R&D team is poised for another productive year. We expect more than a dozen approvals and regulatory submissions. I'm not going to talk about everything on this slide, but I do want to go through a few key highlights. 
In Medical Aesthetics, we expect U.S. approval of ACZONE 7.5% in the first half of the year and VOLBELLA for lips in the second half. We anticipate international approvals for Botox in crow's feet lines and VOLUMA XC in Japan. We're looking forward to the approval of Kybella or Belkyra as it is known outside the U.S. in the EU in the second half of 2016. 
New drug applications for Oxymetazoline in rosacea and Botox for forehead lines are expected to be filed with the U.S. FDA in the first and second half of this year, respectively. 
Moving on to eye care. We are expecting U.S. approvals of a multidose, preservative-free formulation of Restasis in the second half of 2016. We also expect to file 510(k) submissions for XEN45, our ocular stent to treat glaucoma, and the Oculeve Tearbud, which is an intranasal neurostimulatory device for dry eye in the second half of 2016. We are anticipating the Phase III enrollments for Bimatoprost SR will be completed by the early 2017 time frame. 
For gastroenterology, we expect the second half 2016 EU approval for eluxadoline for the treatment of IBS-D. We're also preparing an sNDA submission for low-dose Linzess 72 micrograms for the treatment of Chronic Idiopathic Constipation for the first half of 2016, and we're looking forward to seeing the Phase IIb data for Relamorelin, our investigational treatment for diabetic gastroparesis in the second half of 2016, which we're working on with Rhythm Health. 
In Women's Health, we expect to have top line results from the first Phase III study of Esmya in the first half of 2016. 
In CNS, we expect to submit an NDA for Semprana in the U.S. This is an investigational treatment for acute migraine in the second half of the year. We expect to begin new trials for some of our mid-stage compounds. This includes initiation of a Phase III study for Cariprazine in bipolar depression. Importantly, Phase III studies for Rapastinel an investigational aid treatment for major depressive disorder and Ubrogepant, a potential treatment for acute migraine are expected to begin in the second half of 2016. Know that Rapastinel obtained breakthrough designation from the FDA. 
And finally, in anti-infectives urology and cardiovascular, we anticipate receiving FDA approval for Nebivolol/Valtarsan fixed dose combination treatment for hypertension in the first half of 2016. We have submitted, and the FDA has accepted our sNDA submission for chronic intra-abdominal infections for AvyCaz, and we are planning a further sNDA submission utilizing Phase III data for complicated urinary tract infections in the second half of 2016. 
As I have outlined, we did have an extraordinary 2015, and we are expecting an equally exciting 2016 for our brand's R&D pipeline. I really thank our more than 2,000 Allergan employees, R&D colleagues around the world for their tremendous work and dedication in achieving these results. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Tessa to review our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Tessa?"
36478,322605176,937422,"Allergan plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2016",2016-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Slide 17 provides overall results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. Please note this discussion of results reflect continuing operations only, which we began reporting since the third quarter of 2015",1240,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Slide 17 provides overall results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. Please note this discussion of results reflect continuing operations only, which we began reporting since the third quarter of 2015 following the announcement of the divestiture of our Global Generics business to Teva. 
In the fourth quarter, we continued to deliver exceptional year-over-year performance. On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated net revenue for the fourth quarter was $4.2 billion, an increase of 74% versus fourth quarter 2014. This increase was primarily driven by strong performance in our Botox, Eye Care, Medical Aesthetics and the GI businesses, offset by the loss of exclusivity for Namenda IR. 
On a non-GAAP gross margin basis for the fourth quarter, it was 78.1%, an increase of 12.1 percentage points versus fourth quarter 2014, which reflects the addition of the Allergan business. Non-GAAP R&D investment for the fourth -- for the quarter was $338 million compared to $203 million in the prior period. Non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 24.9%, an increase of 1.4 percentage points versus the prior year quarter as a result of the launch of Kybella, sales force expansion within our facial aesthetics franchise in the U.S. and transactional FX impact of approximately $30 million. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.98 billion, an increase of 115% versus the prior year, driven by strong revenues and higher gross margins across our business segments. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 33% to $3.41 per share compared to $2.57 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 8.2% in the quarter. This rate was driven primarily by the interest -- entire interest expense being included in our continuing operations earnings. 
Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $1.6 billion, impacted by recent R&D acquisitions. Excluding the impact of restructuring and onetime items, cash flows were strong at $1.8 billion. 
Turning now to our U.S. Brand results on Slide 18. The business delivered strong performance year-over-year. U.S. Brands revenue was $2.5 billion for the quarter, up 38% versus the prior period, driven by the addition of the Allergan businesses and strong growth across key products in the GI and Women's Health franchises, offset by a decline in Namenda IR with a loss of exclusivity for that product. 
Adjusted gross margin within U.S. Brands continue to be strong with margins of approximately 87.8%, up 7.1 percentage points versus the prior year quarter. SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 18.2% versus 21.2% in the year-ago quarter, driven by our continued ability to maximize our commercial infrastructure and continued synergy capture from recent acquisitions. 
Turning to Slide 19 and our U.S. Medical business. Fourth quarter revenues were $490 million, an increase of 7% versus the prior quarter. There are no prior year comparisons for U.S. Medical as it was acquired as part of the Allergan acquisition in March of 2015. 
On a pro forma basis, the U.S. Medical business grew 9.3%, reflecting strong growth in Botox, fillers and breast implant. Our breast implant business had its best quarter to date, driven by the launch of Inspira and market share expansion as we were able to capitalize on the competitor being out of the marketplace. 
Fourth quarter gross margins continued to be strong at 93.4%, and SG&A as a percentage of revenue increased to 23.3% due to the additional Kybella promotional spend and sales force expansion related to the launch of that product. 
Turning to Slide 20 and our international brand results. Fourth quarter revenues were $691 million versus $79 million in the prior year period, largely due to the Allergan acquisition. Excluding foreign exchange on a pro forma basis, international revenues in the fourth quarter grew 12%, driven by continued strong growth of Ozurdex, Botox cosmetic and fillers. Gross margins were 83.7% in the fourth quarter. Segment SG&A increased 1.6 percentage points to 31.4% versus third quarter 2015 due largely to new product expansion for Botox and fillers. 
Turning to our Anda business on Slide 21. Revenues decreased 5% to $547 million versus $576 million in the prior quarter, driven by lower retail business, primarily from the Target merger with CVS, which had some impact in the fourth quarter. The impact in 2016 revenue will be more significant in the range of $500 million. However, we expect margins to be -- remain stable. Results in all periods include third-party revenues and related expenses of generic products manufactured by the company and distributed through Anda. 
Slide 22 details our debt capitalization. We ended the fourth quarter 2015 with total debt of approximately $42.7 billion and equity of $76.6 billion related to the Allergan acquisition and previous financing. At year-end, our leverage ratio was 4.09x debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA versus 3.98x in the prior quarter. Since year-end, we have repaid approximately $500 million of term loan debt and $200 million toward our revolving credit facility. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings. Following the close of the divestiture of our Generics business to Teva, we anticipate making a debt repayment toward the remaining term loan balance of approximately $8 billion. The remaining proceeds will be reflected on the balance sheet until the Pfizer close. 
Let me close with a few comments on our preliminary view of 2016 financials. Please note that this guidance will remain in effect until prior to the filing of the EU prospectus to be filed by Allergan in connection with the Pfizer transaction subsequent to the U.S. filing. We expect full year net revenue to be approximately $17 billion, including branded business revenues of approximately $15 billion. Our revenue forecast reflects foreign currency headwinds of approximately $200 million and lower year-over-year revenue expectations for Anda of approximately $500 million due to the merger between Target and CVS. 
In our branded business, excluding Namenda IR and divestitures, we continue to expect double-digit revenue growth, driven by strong sales of key products and new launches in 2016. Note that revenues will be back half weighted as a result of contribution from launches being greater in the second half and typical pharma seasonality. As a result, the first quarter of 2016 will be lower than the fourth quarter of 2015 and will be the lowest quarter of the year with each quarter subsequently increasing. 
Our gross margin should remain strong with no material change from current levels. Because of the initiation of the preintegration planning process with Pfizer, we will no longer proceed with our plan for a restructuring following the divestiture of the Generics business. 
As a result, SG&A as a percentage of non-GAAP revenue is now anticipated to trend above our previous expectations of 21% to 24% to approximately 25% of total net revenue. SG&A as a percentage of revenue will be higher in the first quarter and then trend downwards throughout the year as we support a number of important launches this year, including Kybella, Viberzi and Vraylar. 
R&D spend is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion, reflecting increased investment from 2015. The increase is almost entirely project related as a result of the many important late-stage programs advancing our pipeline. Our tax rate should begin to trend toward normalized levels in the range of 14% following the close of Teva. 
And now I will turn the call back over to Brent for an update on the Pfizer transaction. Brent?"

Together, we will leverage the best of both organizations, matching Pfizer's strong infrastructure, broad portfolio and global reach with Allergan's operating agility, growth profile and new therapeutic areas. We will have breadth and depth in key therapeutic areas, strengthened by an expanded global footprint, allowing Allergan brands to reach more patients in more markets more quickly, including 2 of the world's largest pharmaceutical markets in Japan and China. 
We will have an innovative R&D pipeline consisting of projects sourced from strong internal science and Open Science to fuel our future growth.

So I think turning to the global aesthetics business, I think we feel good about the business. I think when you look at history and even go to the Great Recession, the durability of that business I think was tested, and it was proven that even in slowing economic times, people still look to elective procedures, particularly noninvasive procedures over surgeries. So we tended to do well and remain strong even in the Great Recession. So we're very optimistic despite any slowing economic factors around the world for the aesthetic business. With respect to Botox, perhaps Tessa can jump in, but we believe both the aesthetic application and the therapeutic indications are going to drive strong growth and not only from expanding markets in the U.S. and abroad but also expanding indications across both of the uses. We continue to -- as David outlined, we continue to look for new medications, for example, crow's feet outside the U.S, and we continue to study Botox in areas like depression, and so we think Botox still has a decade or more of strong growth ahead.

I think with respect to the Teva transaction, I think the teams have been working incredibly hard. It's a very complex regulatory filing around the world and requires every individual product and overlapping product to be analyzed by the regulator. So I think given the sheer volume of products there, we should be a little understanding of the time that it takes. We still as I said earlier, believe that it should close, close at the end of this quarter or slip a little bit into the second quarter, but nothing really surprising or concerning in our end. I think it's just a matter of managing complexity in the time line, and I have to give our legal team but also the team at Teva a lot of kudos. They're managing through complexity with amazing grace. So I give them a lot of kudos for that, and I wouldn't stress too much about that. It's just run its normal but complicated course. On the Pfizer situation, everything is moving ahead. All the filings are being contemplated or are in process, and we do expect that to close in the second half, and we haven't stumbled across any surprising or information that we thought was different than when we originally contemplated the deal. So I would say absolutely where we thought it was going to be and moving ahead full steam. I think with respect to the spread or the discount, it's a little baffling from my perspective, and I know from Ian Read's perspective I think if you look at buying us and get Pfizer, you're buying Pfizer at like in the low 20s. I haven't done the math recently, but it's a fairly significant discount, I think 20-plus percent. And my guess is there's just some skepticism around could the government do something to intervene. All of our knowledge and sources at both our side and Pfizer's is that this deal will close. It was highly -- it was constructed in a highly legal way with advice of many experts, and I think we're in a very strong position to close this deal in the second half of the year. I don't see any obstacles, yes."

So I'll make an opening remark and then turn it over to Bill. I think with respect to price-volume, our -- nothing in our behavior has changed. Obviously, we watch the outside environment and a lot of the rhetoric around pricing, but I think we have had a long history. And if you go back and look at things that I have said on this topic dating back to Forest Labs even, we always treated our payer colleagues as consumers, and we always were mindful of the respect that you need in that relationship. And so we were always -- with some exception for mispriced products but for the large majority of our products, we were always very respectful of the price-volume relationship, and so we'd see as business as usual. It is always a negotiated relationship. For those people who think we can just take price increases as we deem fit, that is not true. There is always a repercussion to doing that, and there are always highly negotiated. We don't see -- the pressure was there last year and was there the year before, and it's there again this year, and it's something that innovation and good data and good customer service tend to help balance on our end.

Generally, our aim here especially for our top products is real estate and market share and volume. We have exclusivities on most -- exclusivity periods on most products that extend well into the 2020, and our pricing approach reflects that. The price-volume relationship on our top 10 products leaned heavily towards volume in 2015. We expect the same in 2016, and our price increases generally trade for our growth products below 10%. And as Brent said, we have excellent formulary coverage, and that's given the relationships that we now with health plans. As it relates to Viberzi, the price-volume relationship is or equation is a little different relative to Linzess. I think a good way to think about it is the trajectory will look like the IDFC component of Linzess, which is about 50% of the volume. In terms of pricing, of course, the price point is public. Viberzi is in the let's call it $15 to $20 a day a range relative to Linzess, which is probably like $7 or $8 a day, but there's a big primary care and GID telling effort. Direct-to-consumer advertising will start in March, and based on the first 6 to 7 weeks of data, this feels very much like Linzess. The pharmacology of the product is very intuitive for physicians. It's got a good benefit risk ratio. I think it can be it could double the size of our GI business over time."

I mean, there's no question about it with the purchasing consolidation and the buying now and fewer hands. There's no doubt that there's challenges to that remaining status quo going forward, but I think what you're seeing now in the way the companies are reporting, some are reporting higher price erosion versus others, and I think that's largely due to these strategies that they are employing. Some companies are really trying to fill their capacity, and are chasing share and usually, when you're chasing share, you're basically discounting your products in order to be able to get that, that volume benefit. And so that wasn't our strategy nor was that the same strategy from others. And what we've been focusing on over the years is making sure that we've got the right capacity and differentiating ourselves with portfolio, and those companies that have differentiated portfolios that are harder to manufacture, less competition and products generally see price erosion on the lower end of the percent -- lower end of range. So what I see in our business and Brent alluded to the fact that our business has performed very well despite obviously going through this integration, what we're seeing is that price erosion kind of consistent with '15, which we saw that in more of the mid-single digits, and I see that continuing in '16 as well."

So with respect to the SG&A, some stability plus cost of launches, which make it a slight increase I guess, it really is related to not being able to execute the restructuring that we had essentially worked very hard to plan, and we're ready to pull the trigger on when the Pfizer deal came around, and so we put that on the shelf. I do think it's fair to treat people through to put people through the stress over reorganization while they're also doing a preintegration of the size and scale of the Pfizer one. And so we have, in essence, put that on the shelf or canceled it due to the pending Pfizer deal close and obviously, all the work that's everybody's plate given the preintegration work. I think with respect to the synergy numbers, Pfizer was aware that we were going to do that, and when we built our model, that was contemplated. The M&A environment, I think, remains of high interest to us. I think when you look at the volatility or the weakness in the marketplace, I think it does a couple of things. One, as it sustains itself, right, it has to stay in this environment. I think we're seeing some high flyers now become more clearly valued, and I think we're also seeing opportunities. Now as you know, Chris, you can't strike on these opportunities because everybody's going to look at various length of average price to figure out premiums. So whether it be a 30-, 60-, 90-day you have to let these things settle out before there's really any actionable around them, but I think we're going to continue both as a stand-alone Allergan and as a combined Pfizer, look for things that expand our intellectual property in our therapeutic areas to complement our discovery and own pipeline capabilities inside of Pfizer. I think we're going to look for opportunities to expand our therapeutic area leadership in our key therapeutic areas much like stand-alone Allergan has been doing today. So I think that you won't probably see both for stand-alone Allergan and likely for stand-alone -- for combined Pfizer is large transformational M&A in the short term.

If there's anything you can see that or any work you've done on that scenario that you could share with us, that would be great. And then final question for Brent, I guess, from investors we do hear sometimes that not everyone's bought into the deal still, and I just wanted to get your perspective. Is the spread just based on the risk that the government can block the deal? Or do you think there's some investors that are still holding out at the moment, and waiting for more information or to be convinced?"

I'm not suggesting that it's unanimous in any way, shape or form. We have a very large shareholder base with very diverse opinions, but from what I can see them from where I said, I think there is broad based enthusiastic support for the deal and I continue with the benefit of a little bit more hindsight and a few months of preintegration, believe this is the absolute best course for Allergan's shareholders. I think owning 44% of the pro forma company of the combined Pfizer Allergan puts our shareholders in an absolute better position for continued growth, for continued value creation and is absolutely the right move at the right time.
So I think that was our last question. I thank everyone for joining us. I would just add that 2015 was a highly successful year for Allergan on a broad number of areas, whether that be double-digit branded growth in our commercial performance, strong performance from our generics business during the phase of a divestiture or and of course, argue productivity both in brands and generics was, I think, a record pace.

It's great to be with you to review our results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015. It has been a very exciting and successful 2015 for Allergan as we continue to transform our business into a growth pharma leader. 
Allergan's fourth quarter and full year performance reflects a continued laser focus on executing on the 4 pillars of our growth strategy. First, operational excellence. We powered another quarter of exceptional financial performance while successfully integrating Forest and Allergan. With the planned divestiture of our Generics business to Teva, we are accelerating our transformation into a growth pharma leader. 
Second, our focus on therapeutic area leadership has led to strong, growing branded franchises with new product launches serving as a growth accelerator. Third, our productive and innovative R&D engine continues to produce at a record pace. In 2015, we delivered 4 branded NME FDA approvals. That is nearly 10% of all such approvals by the agency in 2015. With more than 70 mid- to late-stage programs in development, our branded pipeline is poised to continue to delivering innovative products for patients across our key therapeutic areas. 
Our best-in-class generics R&D engine also finished the year strong with 46 new ANDAs filed, including 22 first-to-file applications. And we're continuing to execute on strategic business development opportunities. Our Open Science model has helped us build or expand #1 or 2 positions in many of our key therapeutic areas, and has delivered significant R&D assets to build a sustainable pipeline. With our proposed combination with Pfizer, we are positioned to create the leading global biopharmaceutical company in the world. 
Turning to Slide 6. This year was highly transformative for Allergan with the announced divestiture of our Global Generics business to Teva. We continue to make great progress in our planning efforts, and Teva continues to make progress with regulatory authorities. We're working towards satisfying all conditions in order to close by the end of the first quarter of 2016. However, it is possible that closing could slip beyond the end of the first quarter. I'm very proud of the tremendous focus and execution of our Global Generics team, and we look forward to the combination of our 2 great generics businesses. 
Slide 7. Now let me turn to the continuing operations business performance in the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter net revenue grew 74% on a year-over-year basis to $4.2 billion as a result of the Allergan acquisition and strong global growth within all of our key therapeutic categories. Strong sales in key products across our businesses drove a 33% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share to $3.41. Meanwhile, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA rose to $2 billion, an increase of 115% versus prior year, and cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion, excluding R&D asset acquisitions, restructuring and integration payments. These results illustrate the strong long-term growth profile of Allergan and our growth pharma model. 
Our team continues to drive strong performance. 5 of our 7 franchises have now reached the $1 billion mark. We maintained or expanded our leadership position in all of our key therapeutic categories. And when you exclude the impact of foreign exchange and Namenda IR, all of our therapeutic area businesses delivered double-digit growth. 
Slide 9. Our branded revenues grew double digits for the year, and growth was broad based across our key therapeutic areas. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, 3/4 of our top global products grew at double-digit rate. Nine of our top global products grew more than 15%. Leading growth drivers included Restasis, plus 19%; fillers, plus 20%; Botox, plus 14%; Linzess, plus 55%; Viibryd, plus 26%; and LoLoestrin, plus 26%. 
We continue to solidify our leadership in key categories with strong execution on launches. Our recent launch of Viberzi for the treatment of IBS-D is off to a strong and early start and is in line with our previous launch of Linzess and IBS-C. In anti-infectives, our launches of AvyCaz and DALVANCE had delivered strong results throughout the year and are outpacing competition with an impressive launch trajectory. 
The launch of Liletta, our IUD, earlier this year has been very successful, showing continued growth momentum in unit sales. Voluma, a key driver within our fillers line in the U.S., continues to drive strong growth for our Allergan medical business. Looking ahead, we will continue to drive growth through new approvals and upcoming launches, including Vraylar in the first quarter of 2016. 
Touching on our international business, our teams delivered continued double-digit revenue growth from key products, including Botox therapeutic, Ozurdex and our glaucoma business. Our international eye care team led an exceptional rollout of Ozurdex in new countries with new indications, driving a 35% growth rate for that product year-over-year. In addition, our international team launched several key products in 2015, including Juvederm in China, and we gained rights to Constella in more than 40 markets, which adds another growth driver for this business in 2016. 
Turning to Slide 11. As noted earlier, we have made tremendous R&D progress this year. Our Open Science model seeks to deliver innovation regardless of its source. We have utilized this model to acquire or in-license innovative products that expand our therapeutic area leadership, and 2015 was a year of impressive productivity on this front. 
In eye care, we continue to add shots on goal in development opportunities for dry eye disease and glaucoma with the acquisitions of Oculeve, Mimetogen and AqueSys. 
In Aesthetics, we completed the acquisition of Kythera, adding Kybella, a nonsurgical treatment for submental fullness or double chin. We also acquired Northwood Medical Innovation, and its less-invasive surgery-sparing product earFold. As well as Anterios, and its proprietary NDS platform delivery technology that could enable local, targeted delivery of neurotoxins to the skin without the need for injections. 
In CNS, we completed the acquisition of Naurex, which added rapastinel, a breakthrough designated treatment in the development for depression and other potentially breakthrough treatments in depression. We also in-licensed the right to Merck's development-stage oral CGRP programs for the potential treatment of migraines, which we expect to enter Phase III later this year. And late in the fourth quarter, we announced our collaboration with Rugen Therapeutics to support the discovery and development of novel therapies for autism spectrum disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorders. 
And in GI, we acquired commercial rights to Constella in key international markets. This adds an important flagship product for our international GI commercial team and positions us strongly for the potential introduction of eluxadoline in international markets later this year. 
Turning to Slide 12. A key driver of future growth is new launches in 2016 and beyond. Both in the U.S. and internationally, we are poised to deliver sustainable growth through a number of new launches across 5 different therapeutic categories in 2006 (sic) [ 2016 ] and early 2017. We will add important new products in the U.S., including Vraylar; multidose preservative-free Restasis; a new Botox indication; Aczone 7.5%; XEN shunt for glaucoma, Oculeve for dry eye; and new fillers, including Volbella and Volite. Internationally, we will drive growth through new products, including XEN shunt for glaucoma, OPTIVE gel drops in the EU, Kybella also known as BELKYRA in Canada and Australia and Volite in the EU later in 2017. 
With more than 70 projects in mid- to late-stage development, we have multiple programs in each of our leading therapeutic areas to help us to sustain strong future growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David Nicholson, who'll provide a more detailed pipeline update. David?"

Good morning, everyone. On Slide 14, as you see and as mentioned by Brent, Allergan's R&D team has had a highly productive year with more than 100 pharma regulatory approvals worldwide.
These strong results included submissions of our multidose, preservative-free formulation of Restasis and then nebivolol/valsartan fixed-dose combination in the United States. We have 25 major drug approvals globally, including Liletta, Viberzi, Kybella and Vraylar in the United States and Dalvance in the EU.
We had 12 major device approvals, including Volite in the EU and Juvederm in China. 45 NMEs were approved in the U.S.A. last year. Allergan compounds, Vraylar, Viberzi, Kybella and AvyCaz accounted for nearly 10% of these approvals. This was a truly remarkable year to Allergan's R&D team, and I applaud them for their hard work and tremendous success.
I do want to take a moment to recognize my colleague, Hafrun Fridriksdottir, who heads up the Generics R&D. The team's achievements continues to set the industry standard, with 46 new ANDAs filed, which included 22 first-to-file applications. Outside the U.S., they filed more than 1,000 marketing applications to key products in key markets around the world. 
On Slide 15, I look forward into 2016. Allergan's R&D team is poised for another productive year. We expect more than a dozen approvals and regulatory submissions. I'm not going to talk about everything on this slide, but I do want to go through a few key highlights. 
In Medical Aesthetics, we expect U.S. approval of Aczone 7.5% in the first half of the year and Volbella lips in the second half. We anticipate international approvals for Botox in crow's feet lines and Voluma XC in Japan. We're looking forward to the approval of Kybella, or Belkyra as it is known outside the U.S., in the EU in the second half of 2016. New drug applications for Oxymetazoline in rosacea and Botox for forehead lines are expected to be filed with the U.S. FDA in the first and second half of this year, respectively. 
Moving on to eye care. We are expecting U.S. approvals of a multidose, preservative-free formulation of Restasis in the second half of 2016. We also expect to file 510(k) submissions for XEN45, our ocular stent to treat glaucoma; and the Oculeve Tearbud, which is an intranasal neurostimulatory device for dry eye, in the second half of 2016. We are anticipating the Phase III enrollments of Bimatoprost SR will be completed by the early 2017 time frame. 
In gastroenterology, we expect the second half 2016 EU approval for eluxadoline for the treatment of IBS-D. We're also preparing an sNDA submission for low-dose Linzess 72 micrograms for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation for the first half of 2016, and we're looking forward to seeing the Phase IIb data for relamorelin, our investigational treatment for diabetic gastroparesis in the second half of 2016, which we're working on with Rhythm Health. 
In Women's Health, we expect to have top line results from the first Phase III study of Esmya in the first half of 2016. 
In CNS, we expect to submit an NDA for Semprana in the U.S. This is an investigational treatment for acute migraine in the second half of the year. We expect to begin new trials for some of our mid-stage compounds. This includes initiation of a Phase III study for cariprazine in bipolar depression. Importantly, Phase III studies for rapastinel, an investigational aid treatment for major depressive disorder; and ubrogepant, a potential treatment for acute migraine, are expected to begin in the second half of 2016. Know that rapastinel obtained breakthrough designation from the FDA. 
And finally, in anti-infectives urology and cardiovascular, we anticipate receiving FDA approval for nebivolol/valsartan fixed-dose combination treatment for hypertension in the first half of 2016. We have submitted and the FDA has accepted our sNDA submission for chronic intra-abdominal infections for AvyCaz, and we are planning a further sNDA submission utilizing Phase III data for complicated urinary tract infections in the second half of 2016. 
As I have outlined, we did have an extraordinary 2015, and we are expecting an equally exciting 2016 for our branded R&D pipeline. I really thank our more than 2,000 Allergan employees, R&D colleagues around the world for their tremendous work and dedication in achieving these results. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Tessa to review our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Tessa?"
36478,322605176,937504,"Allergan plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2016",2016-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Slide 17 provides overall results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. Please note this discussion of results reflect continuing operations only, which we began reporting since the third quarter of 2015",1239,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Slide 17 provides overall results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. Please note this discussion of results reflect continuing operations only, which we began reporting since the third quarter of 2015 following the announcement of the divestiture of our Global Generics business to Teva. 
In the fourth quarter, we continued to deliver exceptional year-over-year performance. On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated net revenue for the fourth quarter was $4.2 billion, an increase of 74% versus fourth quarter 2014. This increase was primarily driven by strong performance in our Botox, eye care, Medical Aesthetics and the GI businesses, offset by the loss of exclusivity for Namenda IR. 
On a non-GAAP gross margin basis for the fourth quarter, it was 78.1%, an increase of 12.1 percentage points versus fourth quarter 2014, which reflects the addition of the Allergan business. Non-GAAP R&D investment for the fourth -- for the quarter was $338 million compared to $203 million in the prior period. Non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 24.9%, an increase of 1.4 percentage points versus the prior year quarter as a result of the launch of Kybella, sales force expansion within our facial aesthetics franchise in the U.S. and transactional FX impact of approximately $30 million. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.98 billion, an increase of 115% versus the prior year, driven by strong revenues and higher gross margins across our business segments. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 33% to $3.41 per share compared to $2.57 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 8.2% in the quarter. This rate was driven primarily by the interest -- entire interest expense being included in our continuing operations earnings. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $1.6 billion, impacted by recent R&D acquisitions. Excluding the impact of restructuring and onetime items, cash flows were strong at $1.8 billion. 
Turning now to our U.S. Brand results on Slide 18. The business delivered strong performance year-over-year. U.S. Brands revenue was $2.5 billion for the quarter, up 38% versus the prior period, driven by the addition of the Allergan businesses and strong growth across key products in the GI and Women's Health franchises, offset by a decline in Namenda IR, with the loss of exclusivity for that product. 
Adjusted gross margin within U.S. Brands continue to be strong, with margins of approximately 87.8%, up 7.1 percentage points versus the prior year quarter. SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 18.2% versus 21.2% in the year-ago quarter, driven by our continued ability to maximize our commercial infrastructure and continued synergy capture from recent acquisitions. 
Turning to Slide 19 and our U.S. Medical business. Fourth quarter revenues were $490 million, an increase of 7% versus the prior quarter. There are no prior year comparisons for U.S. Medical as it was acquired as part of the Allergan acquisition in March of 2015. 
On a pro forma basis, the U.S. Medical business grew 9.3%, reflecting strong growth in Botox, fillers and breast implants. Our breast implant business had its best quarter to date, driven by the launch of Inspira and market share expansion, as we were able to capitalize on a competitor being out of the marketplace. Fourth quarter gross margins continued to be strong at 93.4%, and SG&A as a percentage of revenue increased to 23.3% due to the additional Kybella promotional spend and sales force expansion related to the launch of that product. 
Turning to Slide 20 and our international brand results. Fourth quarter revenues were $691 million versus $79 million in the prior year period, largely due to the Allergan acquisition. Excluding foreign exchange on a pro forma basis, international revenues in the fourth quarter grew 12%, driven by continued strong growth of Ozurdex, Botox cosmetic and fillers. Gross margins were 83.7% in the fourth quarter. Segment SG&A increased 1.6 percentage points to 31.4% versus third quarter 2015 due largely to new product expansion for Botox and fillers. 
Turning to our Anda business on Slide 21. Revenues decreased 5% to $547 million versus $576 million in the prior quarter, driven by lower retail business, primarily from the Target merger with CVS, which had some impact in the fourth quarter. The impact in 2016 revenue will be more significant in the range of $500 million. However, we expect margins to be -- remain stable. Results in all periods include third-party revenues and related expenses of generic products manufactured by the company and distributed through Anda. 
Slide 22 details our debt capitalization. We ended the fourth quarter 2015 with total debt of approximately $42.7 billion and equity of $76.6 billion related to the Allergan acquisition and previous financing. At year-end, our leverage ratio was 4.09x debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA versus 3.98x in the prior quarter. Since year-end, we have repaid approximately $500 million of term loan debt and $200 million toward our revolving credit facility. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings. Following the close of the divestiture of our Generics business to Teva, we anticipate making a debt repayment toward the remaining term loan balance of approximately $8 billion. The remaining proceeds will be reflected on the balance sheet until the Pfizer close. 
Let me close with a few comments on our preliminary view of 2016 financials. Please note that this guidance will remain in effect until prior to the filing of the EU prospectus to be filed by Allergan in connection with the Pfizer transaction subsequent to the U.S. filing. We expect full year net revenues to be approximately $17 billion, including branded business revenues of approximately $15 billion. Our revenue forecast reflects foreign currency headwinds of approximately $200 million and lower year-over-year revenue expectations for Anda of approximately $500 million due to the merger between Target and CVS. 
In our branded business, excluding Namenda IR and divestitures, we continue to expect double-digit revenue growth, driven by strong sales of key products and new launches in 2016. Note that revenues will be back-half weighted as a result of contribution from launches being greater in the second half and typical pharma seasonality. As a result, the first quarter of 2016 will be lower than the fourth quarter of 2015 and will be the lowest quarter of the year, with each quarter subsequently increasing. 
Our gross margin should remain strong with no material change from current levels. Because of the initiation of the preintegration planning process with Pfizer, we will no longer proceed with our plan for a restructuring following the divestiture of the Generics business. 
As a result, SG&A as a percentage of non-GAAP revenue is now anticipated to trend above our previous expectations of 21% to 24% to approximately 25% of total net revenue. SG&A as a percentage of revenue will be higher in the first quarter and then trend downwards throughout the year, as we support a number of important launches this year, including Kybella, Viberzi and Vraylar. 
R&D spend is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion, reflecting increased investment from 2015. The increase is almost entirely project related as a result of the many important late-stage programs advancing our pipeline. Our tax rate should begin to trend toward normalized levels in the range of 14% following the close of Teva. 
And now, I will turn the call back over to Brent for an update on the Pfizer transaction. Brent?"

Together, we will leverage the best of both organizations, matching Pfizer's strong infrastructure, broad portfolio and global reach with Allergan's operating agility, growth profile and new therapeutic areas. We will have breadth and depth in key therapeutic areas, strengthened by an expanded global footprint, allowing Allergan brands to reach more patients in more markets more quickly, including 2 of the world's largest pharmaceutical markets in Japan and China.

So I think turning to the global aesthetics business, I think we feel good about the business. I think when you look at history and even go to the Great Recession, the durability of that business I think was tested, and it was proven that even in slowing economic times, people still look to elective procedures, particularly noninvasive procedures, over surgery. So we tended to do well and remain strong even in the Great Recession. So we're very optimistic despite any slowing economic factors around the world for the aesthetic business. With respect to Botox, perhaps Tessa can -- to jump in, but we believe both the aesthetic application and the therapeutic indications are going to drive strong growth, and not only from expanding markets in the U.S. and abroad but also expanding indications across both of the uses. We continue to -- as David outlined, we continue to look for new medications, for example, crow's feet, outside the U.S. and we continue to study Botox in areas like depression.

I think with respect to the Teva transaction, I think the teams have been working incredibly hard. It's a very complex regulatory filing around the world and requires every individual product and overlapping product to be analyzed by the regulator. So I think given the sheer volume of products there, we should be a little understanding of the time that it takes. We still, as I said earlier, believe that it should close, close to the end of this quarter or slip a little bit into the second quarter, but nothing really surprising or concerning on our end. I think it's just a matter of managing complexity and the time line. And I have to give our legal team, but also the team at Teva, a lot of kudos. They're managing through complexity with amazing grace. So I give them a lot of kudos for that. And I wouldn't stress too much about that, it's just running its normal but complicated course. On the Pfizer situation, everything is moving ahead. All the filings are being contemplated or are in process, and we do expect that to close in the second half. And we haven't stumbled across any surprising or -- information that we thought was different than when we originally contemplated the deal. So I would say absolutely where we thought it was going to be and moving ahead full steam. I think with respect to the spread or the discount, it's a little baffling from my perspective and I know from Ian Read's perspective. I think if you look at buying us to get Pfizer, you're buying Pfizer at like in the low 20s. I haven't done the math recently, but it's a fairly significant discount, I think 20-plus percent. And my guess is there's just some skepticism around could the government do something to intervene. All of our knowledge and sources at both our side and Pfizer's is that this deal will close. It was highly -- it was constructed in a highly legal way with advice of many experts, and I think we're in a very strong position to close this deal in the second half of the year. I don't see any obstacles, yes."

So I'll make an opening remark and then turn it over to Bill. I think with respect to price-volume, our -- nothing in our behavior has changed. Obviously, we watch the outside environment and a lot of the rhetoric around pricing. But I think we have had a long history. And if you go back and look at things that I have said on this topic dating back to Forest Labs even, we always treated our payer colleagues as consumers, and we always were mindful of the respect that you need in that relationship. And so we were always -- with some exception for mispriced products, but for the large majority of our products, we were always very respectful of the price-volume relationship. And so we see it as business as usual. It is always a negotiated relationship. For those people who think we can just take price increases as we deem fit, that is not true. There is always a repercussion to doing that, and they're always highly negotiated. We don't see -- the pressure was there last year, it was there the year before and it's there again this year. And it's something that innovation and good data and good customer service tend to help balance on our end.

Generally, our aim here, especially for our top products, is real estate and market share and volume. We have exclusivities on most -- exclusivity periods on most products that extend well into the 2020, and our pricing approach reflects that. The price-volume relationship on our top 10 products leaned heavily towards volume in 2015. We expect the same in 2016, and our price increases generally trade for our growth products below 10%. And as Brent said, we have excellent formulary coverage, and that's given the relationships that we have with health plans. As it relates to Viberzi, the price-volume relationship is -- or equation is a little different relative to Linzess. I think a good way to think about it is the trajectory will look like the IBS-C component of Linzess, which is about 50% of the volume. In terms of pricing, of course, the price point is public. Viberzi is in the, let's call it, $15 to $20 a day  range relative to Linzess, which is probably like $7 or $8 a day. There's a big primary care and GID telling effort. Direct-to-consumer advertising will start in March, and based on the first 6 to 7 weeks of data, this feels very much like Linzess. The pharmacology of the product is very intuitive for physicians. It's got a good benefit risk ratio. And so I think it can be -- it could double the size of our GI business over time."

I mean, there's no question about it with the purchasing consolidation and the buying now and fewer hands. There's no doubt that there's challenges to that remaining status quo going forward, but I think what you're seeing now in the way the companies are reporting, some are reporting higher price erosion versus others, and I think that's largely due to these strategies that they're employing. Some companies are really trying to fill their capacity and are chasing share. And usually, when you're chasing share, you're basically discounting your products in order to be able to get that volume benefit. And so that wasn't our strategy nor was that the same strategy from others. And what we've been focusing on over the years is making sure that we've got the right capacity and differentiating ourselves with portfolio. And those companies that have differentiated portfolios that are harder to manufacture, less competition and products generally see price erosion on the lower end of the range. So what I see in our business, and Brent alluded to the fact that our business has performed very well despite obviously going through this integration, what we're seeing is that price erosion kind of consistent with '15, which we saw that in more of the mid-single digits, and I see that continuing in '16 as well."

So with respect to the SG&A, that's some stability plus cost of launches which make a slight increase, I guess. It really is related to not being able to execute the restructuring that we had essentially worked very hard to plan and we're ready to pull the trigger on when the Pfizer deal came around, and so we put that on the shelf. I do think it's fair to treat people through a -- to put people through the stress over reorganization while they're also doing a preintegration of the size and scale of the Pfizer one. And so we have, in essence, put that on the shelf or canceled it due to the pending Pfizer deal close, and obviously all the work that's on everybody's plate given the preintegration work. I think with respect to the synergy numbers, Pfizer was aware that we were going to do that, and when we built our model, that was contemplated. The M&A environment, I think, remains of high interest to us. I think when you look at the volatility or the weakness in the marketplace, I think it does a couple of things. One, as it sustains itself, right, it has to stay in this environment, I think we're seeing some high flyers now become more fairly valued, and I think we're also seeing opportunities. Now as you know, Chris, you can't strike on these opportunities because everybody's going to look at various lengths of average price to figure out premiums. So whether it'd be a 30-, 60-, 90-day VWAP, you have to let these things settle out before there's really any action ability around them. But I think we're going to continue, both as a stand-alone Allergan and as a combined Pfizer, look for things that expand our intellectual property in our therapeutic areas to complement our discovery and own pipeline capabilities inside of Pfizer. I think we're going to look for opportunities to expand our therapeutic area leadership in our key therapeutic areas much like stand-alone Allergan has been doing today. So I think the thing that you won't probably see, both for stand-alone Allergan and likely for stand-alone -- for combined Pfizer, is large transformational M&A in the short term. I think we'll be looking more for intellectual property, tuck-in geographic expansion and therapeutic area leadership support-type deals."

So I think with respect to treasury, what's interesting to me is how much rhetoric there is around what treasury will or won't do and how many, I guess, supposed experts or pundits tend to want to opine on this and how the market takes it as almost as if being real. I think that the reality is treasury has issued 2 notices of proposed rule-making with respect to this provision related to inversions. We have carefully considered and evaluated both of those and have constructed our deal in a manner that takes those into account. What we understand is treasury is working hard at promulgating the actual regulations to support those notices, and that seems to be their focus as you would expect, and we don't hear anything about a third notice coming. If in fact a third notice did become public, then certainly we will evaluate that. But we don't expect anything treasury could do could impact our deal since we structured it according to the law, and so we feel very optimistic. I think most of the noise around the third -- or most of the rhetoric about the potential third notice is just noise. The treasury, from all we can tell, is working on promulgating the regulations to support the first 2 notices, which haven't been issued yet. Okay? Tessa, you want to..."

It's got a great following in both ophthalmology and optometry. As I mentioned earlier after Liav's question, the formulary coverage looks really, really good. You're just scratching the surface of the dry eye market. The percentage of people treated as a -- of all the dry eye sufferers is very, very small. We'll have perhaps a step-down in the growth rate, of course, when Shire launches lifitegrast, that's not surprising. I think it will recover. We came off of a very high double-digit year. When I look at Restasis relative to lifitegrast in terms of efficacy measures, staining, tear production and goblet cell density, I think Restasis is a great option. When you look at tolerability, it's an even better option in my opinion. We'll be launching Restasis multidose, preservative-free in the second half of the year. I think dry eye sufferers are going to love it instead of getting 60 single unit vials, they're going to get one 60-dose vial. And importantly, it's just much easier to administer a drop into your eye with a 60 unit vial as opposed to these single unit vials. And I think we're going to find out in the second half of the year that they're really going to prefer the option. And even when you go beyond multidose preservative-free, we have Oculeve and Mimetogen, and so you essentially building a supermarket of dry eye products. I like the overall outlook for the business. As it relates to pricing, this is a highly economical product relative to all the products that health plans that -- are managing. I don't expect any real issues. We have excellent formulary coverage preferred status in most plans. I mentioned the 85% figure. And even with the introduction of Shire's lifitegrast, I just don't see any major disruption."

And final question for Brent, I guess, from investors we do hear sometimes that not everyone's bought into the deal still. And I just wanted to get your perspective.

And I'm not suggesting that it's unanimous in any way, shape or form. We have a very large shareholder base with very diverse opinions. But from what I can see and from where I sit, I think there is broad-based enthusiastic support for the deal. And I continue, with the benefit of a little bit more hindsight and a few months of preintegration, believe this is the absolute best course for Allergan's shareholders. I think owning 44% of the pro forma company of the combined Pfizer-Allergan puts our shareholders in an absolute better position for continued growth, for continued value creation and is absolutely the right move at the right time.
So I think that was our last question. I thank everyone for joining us. I would just add that 2015 was a highly successful year for Allergan on a broad number of areas, whether that be the double-digit branded growth and our commercial performance, strong performance from our generics business during the phase of a divestiture, and of course R&D productivity both in brands and generics was, I think, a record pace. We look forward to challenging ourselves to outperform our 2015 performance in 2016, and looking forward to keeping you all up as we move forward. Thank you for your time."

It has been a very exciting and successful 2015 for Allergan as we continue to transform our business into a growth",1262,"Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be with you to review our results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015. It has been a very exciting and successful 2015 for Allergan as we continue to transform our business into a growth pharma leader. 
Allergan's fourth quarter and full year performance reflects a continued laser focus on executing on the 4 pillars of our growth strategy. First, operational excellence. We powered another quarter of exceptional financial performance while successfully integrating Forest and Allergan. With the planned divestiture of our Generics business to Teva, we are accelerating our transformation into a growth pharma leader. 
Second, our focus on therapeutic area leadership has led to strong, growing branded franchises with new product launches serving as a growth accelerator. Third, our productive and innovative R&D engine continues to produce at a record pace. In 2015, we delivered 4 branded NME FDA approvals. That is nearly 10% of all such approvals by the agency in 2015. With more than 70 mid- to late-stage programs in development, our branded pipeline is poised to continue to delivering innovative products for patients across our key therapeutic areas. 
Our best-in-class generics R&D engine also finished the year strong with 46 new ANDAs filed, including 22 first-to-file applications. And we're continuing to execute on strategic business development opportunities. Our Open Science model has helped us build or expand #1 or 2 positions in many of our key therapeutic areas, and has delivered significant R&D assets to build a sustainable pipeline. With our proposed combination with Pfizer, we are positioned to create the leading global biopharmaceutical company in the world. 
Turning to Slide 6. This year was highly transformative for Allergan with the announced divestiture of our Global Generics business to Teva. We continue to make great progress in our planning efforts, and Teva continues to make progress with regulatory authorities. We're working towards satisfying all conditions in order to close by the end of the first quarter of 2016. However, it is possible that closing could slip beyond the end of the first quarter. I'm very proud of the tremendous focus and execution of our Global Generics team, and we look forward to the combination of our 2 great generics businesses. 
Slide 7. Now let me turn to the continuing operations business performance in the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter net revenue grew 74% on a year-over-year basis to $4.2 billion as a result of the Allergan acquisition and strong global growth within all of our key therapeutic categories. Strong sales in key products across our businesses drove a 33% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share to $3.41. Meanwhile, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA rose to $2 billion, an increase of 115% versus prior year, and cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion, excluding R&D asset acquisitions, restructuring and integration payments. These results illustrate the strong long-term growth profile of Allergan and our growth pharma model. 
Our team continues to drive strong performance. 5 of our 7 franchises have now reached the $1 billion mark. We maintained or expanded our leadership position in all of our key therapeutic categories. And when you exclude the impact of foreign exchange and Namenda IR, all of our therapeutic area businesses delivered double-digit growth. 
Slide 9. Our branded revenues grew double digits for the year, and growth was broad based across our key therapeutic areas. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, 3/4 of our top global products grew at double-digit rate. Nine of our top global products grew more than 15%. Leading growth drivers included Restasis, plus 19%; fillers, plus 20%; Botox, plus 14%; Linzess, plus 55%; Viibryd, plus 26%; and LoLoestrin, plus 26%. 
We continue to solidify our leadership in key categories with strong execution on launches. Our recent launch of Viberzi for the treatment of IBS-D is off to a strong and early start and is in line with our previous launch of Linzess in IBS-C. In anti-infectives, our launches of AvyCaz and DALVANCE had delivered strong results throughout the year and are outpacing competition with an impressive launch trajectory. 
The launch of Liletta, our IUD, earlier this year has been very successful, showing continued growth momentum in unit sales. Voluma, a key driver within our fillers line in the U.S., continues to drive strong growth for our Allergan medical business. Looking ahead, we will continue to drive growth through new approvals and upcoming launches, including Vraylar in the first quarter of 2016. 
Touching on our international business, our teams delivered continued double-digit revenue growth from key products, including Botox therapeutic, Ozurdex and our glaucoma business. Our international eye care team led an exceptional rollout of Ozurdex in new countries with new indications, driving a 35% growth rate for that product year-over-year. In addition, our international team launched several key products in 2015, including Juvederm in China, and we gained rights to Constella in more than 40 markets, which adds another growth driver for this business in 2016. 
Turning to Slide 11. As noted earlier, we have made tremendous R&D progress this year. Our Open Science model seeks to deliver innovation regardless of its source. We have utilized this model to acquire or in-license innovative products that expand our therapeutic area leadership, and 2015 was a year of impressive productivity on this front. 
In eye care, we continue to add shots on goal in development opportunities for dry eye disease and glaucoma with the acquisitions of Oculeve, Mimetogen and AqueSys. 
In Aesthetics, we completed the acquisition of Kythera, adding KYBELLA, a nonsurgical treatment for submental fullness or double chin. We also acquired Northwood Medical Innovation, and its less-invasive surgery-sparing product earFold. As well as Anterios, and its proprietary NDS platform delivery technology that could enable local, targeted delivery of neurotoxins to the skin without the need for injections. 
In CNS, we completed the acquisition of Naurex, which added rapastinel, a breakthrough designated treatment in the development for depression and other potentially breakthrough treatments in depression. We also in-licensed the right to Merck's development-stage oral CGRP programs for the potential treatment of migraines, which we expect to enter Phase III later this year. And late in the fourth quarter, we announced our collaboration with Rugen Therapeutics to support the discovery and development of novel therapies for autism spectrum disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorders. 
And in GI, we acquired commercial rights to Constella in key international markets. This adds an important flagship product for our international GI commercial team and positions us strongly for the potential introduction of eluxadoline in international markets later this year. 
Turning to Slide 12. A key driver of future growth is new launches in 2016 and beyond. Both in the U.S. and internationally, we are poised to deliver sustainable growth through a number of new launches across 5 different therapeutic categories in 2006 (sic) [ 2016 ] and early 2017. We will add important new products in the U.S., including Vraylar; multidose preservative-free Restasis; a new Botox indication; Aczone 7.5%; XEN shunt for glaucoma, Oculeve for dry eye; and new fillers, including Volbella and Volite. Internationally, we will drive growth through new products, including XEN shunt for glaucoma, OPTIVE gel drops in the EU, Kybella also known as BELKYRA in Canada and Australia and Volite in the EU later in 2017. 
With more than 70 projects in mid- to late-stage development, we have multiple programs in each of our leading therapeutic areas that help us to sustain strong future growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David Nicholson, who'll provide a more detailed pipeline update. David?"

Good morning, everyone. On Slide 14, as you see and as mentioned by Brent, Allergan's R&D team has had a highly productive year with more than 100 pharma regulatory approvals worldwide.
These strong results included submissions of our multidose, preservative-free formulation of Restasis and then nebivolol/valsartan fixed-dose combination in the United States. We have 25 major drug approvals globally, including Liletta, Viberzi, Kybella and Vraylar in the United States and Dalvance in the EU.
We had 12 major device approvals, including Volite in the EU and Juvederm in China. 45 NMEs were approved in the U.S.A. last year. Allergan compounds, Vraylar, Viberzi, Kybella and AvyCaz accounted for nearly 10% of these approvals. This was a truly remarkable year to Allergan's R&D team, and I applaud them for their hard work and tremendous success.
I do want to take a moment to recognize my colleague, Hafrun Fridriksdottir, who heads up the Generics R&D. The team's achievements continues to set the industry standard, with 46 new ANDAs filed, which included 22 first-to-file applications. Outside the U.S., they filed more than 1,000 marketing applications to key products in key markets around the world. 
On Slide 15, I look forward into 2016. Allergan's R&D team is poised for another productive year. We expect more than a dozen approvals and regulatory submissions. I'm not going to talk about everything on this slide, but I do want to go through a few key highlights. 
In Medical Aesthetics, we expect U.S. approval of Aczone 7.5% in the first half of the year and Volbella lips in the second half. We anticipate international approvals for Botox in crow's feet lines and Voluma XC in Japan. We're looking forward to the approval of Kybella, or Belkyra as it is known outside the U.S., in the EU in the second half of 2016. New drug applications for Oxymetazoline in rosacea and Botox for forehead lines are expected to be filed with the U.S. FDA in the first and second half of this year, respectively. 
Moving on to eye care. We are expecting U.S. approvals of a multidose, preservative-free formulation of Restasis in the second half of 2016. We also expect to file 510(k) submissions for XEN45, our ocular stent to treat glaucoma; and the Oculeve Tearbud, which is an intranasal neurostimulatory device for dry eye, in the second half of 2016. We are anticipating the Phase III enrollments of Bimatoprost SR will be completed by the early 2017 time frame. 
In gastroenterology, we expect the second half 2016 EU approval for eluxadoline for the treatment of IBS-D. We're also preparing an sNDA submission for low-dose Linzess 72 micrograms for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation for the first half of 2016, and we're looking forward to seeing the Phase IIb data for relamorelin, our investigational treatment for diabetic gastroparesis in the second half of 2016, which we're working on with Rhythm Health. 
In Women's Health, we expect to have top line results from the first Phase III study of Esmya in the first half of 2016. 
In CNS, we expect to submit an NDA for Semprana in the U.S. This is an investigational treatment for acute migraine in the second half of the year. We expect to begin new trials for some of our mid-stage compounds. This includes initiation of a Phase III study for cariprazine in bipolar depression. Importantly, Phase III studies for rapastinel, an investigational aid treatment for major depressive disorder; and ubrogepant, a potential treatment for acute migraine, are expected to begin in the second half of 2016. Know that rapastinel obtained breakthrough designation from the FDA. 
And finally, in anti-infectives urology and cardiovascular, we anticipate receiving FDA approval for nebivolol/valsartan fixed-dose combination treatment for hypertension in the first half of 2016. We have submitted and the FDA has accepted our sNDA submission for chronic intra-abdominal infections for AvyCaz, and we are planning a further sNDA submission utilizing Phase III data for complicated urinary tract infections in the second half of 2016. 
As I have outlined, we did have an extraordinary 2015, and we are expecting an equally exciting 2016 for our branded R&D pipeline. I really thank our more than 2,000 Allergan employees, R&D colleagues around the world for their tremendous work and dedication in achieving these results. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Tessa to review our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Tessa?"
36478,322605176,937561,"Allergan plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2016",2016-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Slide 17 provides overall results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. Please note this discussion of results reflect continuing operations only, which we began reporting since the third quarter of 2015",1239,"Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Slide 17 provides overall results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. Please note this discussion of results reflect continuing operations only, which we began reporting since the third quarter of 2015 following the announcement of the divestiture of our Global Generics business to Teva. 
In the fourth quarter, we continued to deliver exceptional year-over-year performance. On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated net revenue for the fourth quarter was $4.2 billion, an increase of 74% versus fourth quarter 2014. This increase was primarily driven by strong performance in our Botox, eye care, Medical Aesthetics and the GI businesses, offset by the loss of exclusivity for Namenda IR. 
On a non-GAAP gross margin basis for the fourth quarter, it was 78.1%, an increase of 12.1 percentage points versus fourth quarter 2014, which reflects the addition of the Allergan business. Non-GAAP R&D investment for the fourth -- for the quarter was $338 million compared to $203 million in the prior period. Non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 24.9%, an increase of 1.4 percentage points versus the prior year quarter as a result of the launch of Kybella; sales force expansion within our facial aesthetics franchise in the U.S. and transactional FX impact of approximately $30 million. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.98 billion, an increase of 115% versus the prior year, driven by strong revenues and higher gross margins across our business segments. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 33% to $3.41 per share compared to $2.57 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 8.2% in the quarter. This rate was driven primarily by the interest -- entire interest expense being included in our continuing operations earnings. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $1.6 billion, impacted by recent R&D acquisitions. Excluding the impact of restructuring and onetime items, cash flows were strong at $1.8 billion. 
Turning now to our U.S. Brand results on Slide 18. The business delivered strong performance year-over-year. U.S. Brands revenue was $2.5 billion for the quarter, up 38% versus the prior period, driven by the addition of the Allergan businesses and strong growth across key products in the GI and Women's Health franchises, offset by a decline in Namenda IR, with the loss of exclusivity for that product. 
Adjusted gross margin within U.S. Brands continue to be strong, with margins of approximately 87.8%, up 7.1 percentage points versus the prior year quarter. SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 18.2% versus 21.2% in the year-ago quarter, driven by our continued ability to maximize our commercial infrastructure and continued synergy capture from recent acquisitions. 
Turning to Slide 19 and our U.S. Medical business. Fourth quarter revenues were $490 million, an increase of 7% versus the prior quarter. There are no prior year comparisons for U.S. Medical as it was acquired as part of the Allergan acquisition in March of 2015. 
On a pro forma basis, the U.S. Medical business grew 9.3%, reflecting strong growth in Botox, fillers and breast implants. Our breast implant business had its best quarter to date, driven by the launch of Inspira and market share expansion, as we were able to capitalize on a competitor being out of the marketplace. Fourth quarter gross margins continued to be strong at 93.4%, and SG&A as a percentage of revenue increased to 23.3% due to the additional Kybella promotional spend and sales force expansion related to the launch of that product. 
Turning to Slide 20 and our international brand results. Fourth quarter revenues were $691 million versus $79 million in the prior year period, largely due to the Allergan acquisition. Excluding foreign exchange on a pro forma basis, international revenues in the fourth quarter grew 12%, driven by continued strong growth of Ozurdex, Botox cosmetic and fillers. Gross margins were 83.7% in the fourth quarter. Segment SG&A increased 1.6 percentage points to 31.4% versus third quarter 2015 due largely to new product expansion for Botox and fillers. 
Turning to our Anda business on Slide 21. Revenues decreased 5% to $547 million versus $576 million in the prior quarter, driven by lower retail business, primarily from the Target merger with CVS, which had some impact in the fourth quarter. The impact in 2016 revenue will be more significant in the range of $500 million. However, we expect margins to be -- remain stable. Results in all periods include third-party revenues and related expenses of generic products manufactured by the company and distributed through Anda. 
Slide 22 details our debt capitalization. We ended the fourth quarter 2015 with total debt of approximately $42.7 billion and equity of $76.6 billion related to the Allergan acquisition and previous financing. At year-end, our leverage ratio was 4.09x debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA versus 3.98x in the prior quarter. Since year-end, we have repaid approximately $500 million of term loan debt and $200 million toward our revolving credit facility. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings. Following the close of the divestiture of our Generics business to Teva, we anticipate making a debt repayment toward the remaining term loan balance of approximately $8 billion. The remaining proceeds will be reflected on the balance sheet until the Pfizer close. 
Let me close with a few comments on our preliminary view of 2016 financials. Please note that this guidance will remain in effect until prior to the filing of the EU prospectus to be filed by Allergan in connection with the Pfizer transaction subsequent to the U.S. filing. We expect full year net revenues to be approximately $17 billion, including branded business revenues of approximately $15 billion. Our revenue forecast reflects foreign currency headwinds of approximately $200 million and lower year-over-year revenue expectations for Anda of approximately $500 million due to the merger between Target and CVS. 
In our branded business, excluding Namenda IR and divestitures, we continue to expect double-digit revenue growth, driven by strong sales of key products and new launches in 2016. Note that revenues will be back-half weighted as a result of contribution from launches being greater in the second half and typical pharma seasonality. As a result, the first quarter of 2016 will be lower than the fourth quarter of 2015 and will be the lowest quarter of the year, with each quarter subsequently increasing. 
Our gross margin should remain strong with no material change from current levels. Because of the initiation of the preintegration planning process with Pfizer, we will no longer proceed with our plan for a restructuring following the divestiture of the Generics business. 
As a result, SG&A as a percentage of non-GAAP revenue is now anticipated to trend above our previous expectations of 21% to 24% to approximately 25% of total net revenue. SG&A as a percentage of revenue will be higher in the first quarter and then trend downwards throughout the year, as we support a number of important launches this year, including Kybella, Viberzi and Vraylar. 
R&D spend is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion, reflecting increased investment from 2015. The increase is almost entirely project related as a result of the many important late-stage programs advancing our pipeline. Our tax rate should begin to trend toward normalized levels in the range of 14% following the close of Teva. 
And now, I will turn the call back over to Brent for an update on the Pfizer transaction. Brent?"

Before we start the Q&A, I wanted to provide a brief update on our proposed combination with Pfizer. In late November, we announced with Pfizer the proposed combination of our businesses, bringing together 2 successful pharmaceutical companies to create a premier global biopharmaceutical leader with the resources and capabilities to bring more medicines to more people around the world. 
Together, we will leverage the best of both organizations, matching Pfizer's strong infrastructure, broad portfolio and global reach with Allergan's operating agility, growth profile and new therapeutic areas. We will have breadth and depth in key therapeutic areas, strengthened by an expanded global footprint, allowing Allergan brands to reach more patients in more markets more quickly, including 2 of the world's largest pharmaceutical markets in Japan and China. 
We will have an innovative R&D pipeline consisting of projects sourced from strong internal science and Open Science to fuel our future growth. We are 2 months into the planning for this combination, and I'm already pleased to see early progress on our integration planning efforts such as the announcement of our proposed executive team. Both teams are hard at work planning for the integration for what will be the premier biopharmaceutical company in the world. We continue to expect the combination with Pfizer to close in the second half of 2016.

So we tended to do well and remained strong even in the Great Recession. So we're very optimistic despite any slowing economic factors around the world for the aesthetic business. With respect to Botox, perhaps Tessa can -- to jump in, but we believe both the aesthetic application and the therapeutic indications are going to drive strong growth, and not only from expanding markets in the U.S. and abroad but also expanding indications across both of the uses.

I think with respect to the Teva transaction, I think the teams have been working incredibly hard. It's a very complex regulatory filing around the world and requires every individual product and overlapping product to be analyzed by the regulator. So I think given the sheer volume of products there, we should be a little understanding of the time that it takes. We still, as I said earlier, believe that it should close, close to the end of this quarter or slip a little bit into the second quarter, but nothing really surprising or concerning on our end. I think it's just a matter of managing complexity and the time line. And I have to give our legal team, but also the team at Teva, a lot of kudos. They're managing through complexity with amazing grace. So I give them a lot of kudos for that. And I wouldn't stress too much about that, it's just running its normal but complicated course. On the Pfizer situation, everything is moving ahead. All the filings are being contemplated or are in process, and we do expect that to close in the second half. And we haven't stumbled across any surprising or -- information that we thought was different than when we originally contemplated the deal. So I would say absolutely where we thought it was going to be and moving ahead full steam. I think with respect to the spread or the discount, it's a little baffling from my perspective and I know from Ian Read's perspective. I think if you look at buying us to get Pfizer, you're buying Pfizer at like in the low 20s. I haven't done the math recently, but it's a fairly significant discount, I think 20-plus percent. And my guess is there's just some skepticism around could the government do something to intervene. All of our knowledge and sources at both our side and Pfizer's is that this deal will close. It was highly -- it was constructed in a highly legal way with advice of many experts, and I think we're in a very strong position to close this deal in the second half of the year. I don't see any obstacles, yes."

Obviously, we watch the outside environment and a lot of the rhetoric around pricing. But I think we have had a long history. And if you go back and look at things that I have said on this topic dating back to Forest Labs even, we always treated our payer colleagues as customers, and we always were mindful of the respect that you need in that relationship. And so we were always -- with some exception for mispriced products, but for the large majority of our products, we were always very respectful of the price-volume relationship. And so we see it as business as usual. It is always a negotiated relationship. For those people who think we can just take price increases as we deem fit, that is not true. There is always a repercussion to doing that, and they're always highly negotiated. We don't see -- the pressure was there last year, it was there the year before and it's there again this year. And it's something that innovation and good data and good customer service tend to help balance on our end.

Generally, our aim here, especially for our top products, is real estate and market share and volume. We have exclusivities on most -- exclusivity periods on most products that extend well into the 2020s, and our pricing approach reflects that. The price-volume relationship on our top 10 products leaned heavily towards volume in 2015. We expect the same in 2016, and our price increases generally trade for our growth products below 10%. And as Brent said, we have excellent formulary coverage, and that's given the relationships that we have with health plans. As it relates to Viberzi, the price-volume relationship is -- or equation is a little different relative to Linzess. I think a good way to think about it is the trajectory will look like the IBS-C component of Linzess, which is about 50% of the volume. In terms of pricing, of course, the price point is public. Viberzi is in the, let's call it, $15 to $20 a day range relative to Linzess, which is probably like $7 or $8 a day. There's a big primary care and GI detailing effort. Direct-to-consumer advertising will start in March, and based on the first 6 to 7 weeks of data, this feels very much like Linzess. The pharmacology of the product is very intuitive for physicians. It's got a good benefit risk ratio. And so I think it can be -- it could double the size of our GI business over time."

I mean, there's no question about it with the purchasing consolidation and the buying now and fewer hands. There's no doubt that there's challenges to that remaining status quo going forward, but I think what you're seeing now in the way the companies are reporting, some are reporting higher price erosion versus others, and I think that's largely due to these strategies that they're employing. Some companies are really trying to fill their capacity and are chasing share. And usually, when you're chasing share, you're basically discounting your products in order to be able to get that volume benefit. And so that wasn't our strategy nor was that the same strategy from others. And what we've been focusing on over the years is making sure that we've got the right capacity and differentiating ourselves with portfolio. And those companies that have differentiated portfolios that are harder to manufacture, less competition in products generally see price erosion on the lower end of the range. So what I see in our business, and Brent alluded to the fact that our business has performed very well despite obviously going through this integration, what we're seeing is that price erosion kind of consistent with '15, which we saw that in more of the mid-single digits, and I see that continuing in '16 as well."

I do think it's fair to treat people through a -- to put people through the stress over reorganization while they're also doing a preintegration of the size and scale of the Pfizer one. And so we have, in essence, put that on the shelf or canceled it due to the pending Pfizer deal close, and obviously all the work that's on everybody's plate given the preintegration work. I think with respect to the synergy numbers, Pfizer was aware that we were going to do that, and when we built our model, that was contemplated.

Now as you know, Chris, you can't strike on these opportunities because everybody's going to look at various lengths of average price to figure out premiums. So whether it'd be a 30-, 60-, 90-day VWAP, you have to let these things settle out before there's really any actionability around them. But I think we're going to continue, both as a stand-alone Allergan and as a combined Pfizer, look for things that expand our intellectual property in our therapeutic areas to complement our discovery and own pipeline capabilities inside of Pfizer. I think we're going to look for opportunities to expand our therapeutic area leadership in our key therapeutic areas much like stand-alone Allergan has been doing today. So I think the thing that you won't probably see, both for stand-alone Allergan and likely for stand-alone -- for combined Pfizer, is large transformational M&A in the short term. I think we'll be looking more for intellectual property, tuck-in geographic expansion and therapeutic area leadership support-type deals."

That's opportunities to expand our capabilities, it's opportunities to strengthen our franchises, and it certainly is opportunity to expand our geographic footprint. And so when you look at those things in combination, it's kind of intuitive. I think the thing I've picked up in the last 2 months, though, is it's also an opportunity for talent and capabilities. And when you have an organization the size of the combined Pfizer-Allergan, you really need strength in your executive and management ranks. And in the first 2 months, the combination of our executives and managers with Pfizer's looks like a huge opportunity to drive these businesses and really have better performance in the market."

The coverage for Restasis today is over 85%. We expect that to be maintained through 2016, and we're already in the process of submitting bids at least on the Part D side of the business for 2017. It's a very, very popular product with a big user base, and I don't expect any real surprise or major changes in formulary coverage for Restasis. And I think over the next 2 years, we can continue to manage our discount rate. And as it relates to XR, we look good for '16 for both XR and Namzaric, Optum just added both products to formulary. And here, again, as we look into 2017, which we already have a line of sight to, I think the numbers are going to look very, very good. Again, Namenda XR and Namzaric are popular products especially with neurologists and select primary care physicians. I like the way the next 2 years looks for both businesses."

I think that the reality is treasury has issued 2 notices of proposed rule-making with respect to this provision related to inversions. We have carefully considered and evaluated both of those and have constructed our deal in a manner that takes those into account. What we understand is treasury is working hard at promulgating the actual regulations to support those notices, and that seems to be their focus as you would expect, and we don't hear anything about a third notice coming. If in fact a third notice did become public, then certainly we would evaluate that. But we don't expect anything treasury could do could impact our deal since we structured it according to the law, and so we feel very optimistic. I think most of the noise around the third -- or most of the rhetoric about the potential third notice is just noise.

You're just scratching the surface of the dry eye market. The percentage of people treated as a -- of all the dry eye sufferers is very, very small. We'll have perhaps a step-down in the growth rate, of course, when Shire launches lifitegrast, that's not surprising. I think it will recover. We came off of a very high double-digit year. When I look at Restasis relative to lifitegrast in terms of efficacy measures, staining, tear production and goblet cell density, I think Restasis is a great option. When you look at tolerability, it's an even better option in my opinion. We'll be launching Restasis multidose, preservative-free in the second half of the year. I think dry eye sufferers are going to love it instead of getting 60 single unit vials, they're going to get one 60-dose vial. And importantly, it's just much easier to administer a drop into your eye with a 60 unit vial as opposed to these single unit vials. And I think we're going to find out in the second half of the year that they're really going to prefer the option. And even when you go beyond multidose preservative-free, we have Oculeve and Mimetogen, and so you essentially building a supermarket of dry eye products. I like the overall outlook for the business. As it relates to pricing, this is a highly economical product relative to all the products that health plans that -- are managing. I don't expect any real issues. We have excellent formulary coverage preferred status in most plans. I mentioned the 85% figure. And even with the introduction of Shire's lifitegrast, I just don't see any major disruption."

But from what I can see and from where I sit, I think there is broad-based enthusiastic support for the deal.

I think owning 44% of the pro forma company of the combined Pfizer-Allergan puts our shareholders in an absolute better position for continued growth, for continued value creation and is absolutely the right move at the right time.
So I think that was our last question. I thank everyone for joining us. I would just add that 2015 was a highly successful year for Allergan on a broad number of areas, whether that be the double-digit branded growth and our commercial performance, strong performance from our generics business during the phase of a divestiture, and of course R&D productivity both in brands and generics was, I think, a record pace.

Beginning on Slide 5, Allergan remains the most dynamic and exciting company in our industry and in my mind, that makes us the best pharmaceutical company in the world. You can see it in our results this quarter. You can see it in the way our team has pivoted to focus on our future as a standalone leader in growth pharma. 
You can see it in the operational excellence on display in teams across our company. You can see it in the way we focus on building therapeutic area leadership in the categories where we choose to compete. You can see it in the way we're using open science to build an industry-leading R&D pipeline to sustain our leadership in those therapeutic areas. And you can ask our customers about how our highly responsive service-oriented approach to customer intimacy. 
Those are just a few reasons why we are especially excited about our feature. As we considered our options for deploying cash following Teva's planned $40.5 billion acquisition of our Global Generics business in the second quarter, we realize that there was no better investment than owning our fast-growing company. So our board has authorized the company's first share repurchase program at a value of up to $10 billion. We'll start with $4 billion to $5 billion during the rest of 2016 buying as much as prudently possible in the open market. If favorable market conditions persist, we will have additional capacity to consider buying more after satisfying the first part of the program. In addition to the stock repurchase program, we will have the ability to pay down debt to maintain our investment-grade credit ratings and preserve significant capacity to invest for growth. 
Given the strength of our current business and the opportunities we see ahead, we remain focused on running one of the finest companies in our industry. 
Tessa will talk more about the share repurchase program in just a few minutes. 
Turning to Slide 6. Allergan's first quarter performance reflects our continuing execution on each element of our growth pharma strategy. First, top line growth. In the first quarter, we powered another fine quarter with total revenue up 48% and branded growth up 71% versus prior year. On a pro forma basis, branded revenue was up double digits again this quarter. Second, we maintained leadership positions in our 7 core therapeutic areas and with the recent launches of new new drugs like Viberzi, Vraylar and Kybella, we have added significant muscle and growth potential to our GI, CNS and aesthetic therapeutic areas. Third, our R&D engine continues to produce at record pace. We delivered 2 new branded FDA approvals and 4 FDA submissions just in the first quarter. 
In Europe, we also receive a positive opinion for Zenpep ex-U.S. named [ph] to enhance our cystic fibrosis and pancreatic efficiency offering. 
Our Open Science model is helping us build a sustainable R&D pipeline by bringing us novel assets like XAF5 for under eye bags and from [ph], a portfolio selective agents for major neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease, where we are the market leader. 
Our best-in-class generics R&D engine continues to perform well and Rob Steward will highlight this later. Fourth, our focus on operational excellence help to simplify the operating structure, streamline our IT systems and drive more than 500 basis point improvement in our operating margins versus prior year. Our operational excellence also has been on display with the launch of our generic in the U.S. Our generics team together with ANDA executed flawlessly to get product on the pharmacy shelves fast in order to take advantage of this first-to-market opportunity. 
Now let me turn to continuing operations business performance in the first quarter on Slide 7. Our first quarter net revenue grew 48% on a year-over-year basis to $3.8 billion as a result of the Allergan acquisition and strong global growth within all of our key therapeutic categories. Branded revenue was the key driver, up 71%. Strong sales in key products and our operating margin expansion across our business drove a 15% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share to $3.04. 
Meanwhile, non-GAAP operating income rose to $1.8 billion, an increase of 68% versus prior. And cash flow from operations was $1.45 billion, excluding R&D asset acquisitions, restructuring and integration payments. These results illustrate the strong, long-term growth profile of Allergan. 
Turning to Slide 8. Our strategy is based on utilizing all of our growth pharma assets together including our best-in-class commercial engine to bring life-changing medicines to patients around the world. 
As we look at our product portfolio, our branded business continues to thrive in the first quarter with 10% pro forma revenue growth, excluding the impact of currency and Namenda IR and divestitures. Our top global products, which represent more than 75% of total branded revenue, grew 13%, excluding the impact of currency and Namenda IR with over half of those products growing at double-digit rates. This quarter performance is a true testament to the hard work of our team and the success of our growth pharma strategy and mindset. 
Moving to Slide 9. As we near the conclusion of the generics divestiture, I have been carefully considering how to streamline our management structure to better align our resources as a focus, branded growth pharma business with many leading global brands. 
We've announced the streamlined executive team to lead Allergan going forward. In this new leadership structure, all of our commercial businesses will be combined under Bill Meury, who has been chief commercial officer. There will be 3 major business segments under Bill. The first segment is U.S. specialized therapeutics, which includes eye care, medical aesthetics, medical Dermatology and Botox therapeutics. The second segment is U.S. general medicine, which includes CNS, CV, GI, Women's Health, AI and urology. The third segment is international, which includes all of our businesses outside the U.S. organized in multiple regions. 
Anda, our fourth [ph] segment will continue to report Rob Stewart. We remain focused on driving growth by building therapeutic area leadership in our 7 core therapeutic areas, Eye Care, Aesthetics and Medical Dermatology, CNS, GI, Women's Health, Botox therapeutics and anti-infectives. 
We will continue to be a drug development powerhouse and utilize our Open Science model to invest in innovation and propel future growth in these therapeutic areas. I believe this new commercial structure will further enhance our global focus, speed decision-making and align resources and priorities with our R&D priorities. 
We are also appointing Rob Stewart to the position of Chief Operating Officer. In this role, Rob will mature our manufacturing operations run smoothly to meet our sales go, oversee harmonization of our IT systems and processes and finish previous integrations. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Meury, our new Chief Commercial Officer."

Good morning, everyone. 2 hallmarks of growth pharma are category leadership and customer intimacy, the truth differentiators for Allergan, especially within our commercial team, which consists of a worldwide sales force of more than 7,500 strong.

We're squarely focused the leadership in each of our therapeutic areas and have -- and on having a unique connection with our customers, both of which are competitive advantages. 
Returning to Slide 11, the fundamentals of our business are strong. Overall basic demand, market share growth and sales performance were robust in the first quarter and we're well positioned to sustain the growth for these franchises for the remainder of 2016 and beyond. 
In 7 of our therapeutic areas, our teams delivered high single or double-digit sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange versus the prior year. In Eye Care, sales increased by 11% powered by continued strength from Restasis, Combigan and Ozurdex. 
U.S. sales for Restasis, our flagship product, increased by 22%. We're preparing for the launch of Restasis MVPF, multidose preservative-free, in the second half of the year and looking forward to the approval of Oculeve, our nasal neuro stimulator in early 2017, which will significantly strengthen our product offering for ocular surface disease. 
Behind these 2 products we have analog and [ph]. We are, as you know, an eye care company and we look forward to building their deepest and broadest portfolio for ocular surface disease. 
In CNS, we delivered 21% growth with both [ph], Namenda XR and Vraylar. These were the key growth products in the quarter and are expected to continue driving growth in 2016 and beyond. In Aesthetics, sales increased by 7% with Botox, fillers and Kybella. All 3 businesses are in excellent position and we expect to sustain high-growth rates in 2016 and beyond too. 
Sales in aesthetics increased at an impressive rate of 16%, excluding Medical Dermatology. Medical Derm revenue, however, was impacted by a onetime harmonization for allowances in the quarter. However, prescription trends relatively stable, and we expect growth in the back half of the year. 
In GI, we invest our flagship continues to exceed expectations and post exceptional growth, and the launch of Viberzi is off to a very strong start. We expect sales for this brand just to increase at double-digit rate for 2016 and beyond despite the decline in the Delzicol product line. 
We also see strong growth and continue to be excited about our future in Women's Health, Urology and anti-infectives. 
On Slide 12, we have 8 products in launch phase across each of our leading therapeutic areas. this is important as it provides new products for our sales forces, new products to deliver to our customers and new innovation to solve unmet medical need for patients. 
Let me talk a little bit about 3 of our newest launches, Vraylar, Viberzi and Kybella, all of which have blockbuster potential. 
Turning to Slide 13. We've launched Viberzi, our treatment for IBS, right at the end of 2015 and we're off to a strong start. Based on sales, Viberzi is trending at approximately 80% of Linzess and IBS-C during the same time period post launch, which is in line with our expectations. More than 8,000 physicians have prescribed Viberzi to date and about 65% of the physician base are repeat prescribers. And we're seeing a nice boost to script the start of our DDC campaign in April. 
Linzess, our treatment for IBS-C, continues to experienced strong growth 4 years post launch. We've seen incremental growth following the launch of long-term care focused detailing program and DTC advertising campaigns. 
We now have 2 products that can cover a range of IBS needs to treat these patients. 
Turning to Slide 14 in Vraylar. Vraylar was launched in mid-margin in the United States and is tracking strongly with competitive products, including [ph] and [ph] at the time of their launches exceeding our internal expectations. Vraylar has higher script trends versus [ph] at launch, and Vraylar volume is similar to Rexulti without occurring indication in MDD. The future of this product is very promising. Vraylar could potentially be the approved treatment with 5 different indications or claims. That would be a significant advantage for the product and would make it a potential blockbuster in the marketplace. 
Now turning to Slide 15. Kybella, our product for fat reduction or double chin is off to a stron start. Since we acquire the product from Playfair in October 2015, we've decelerated the training of targeted accounts. So far, we've trained over 4,000 injectors or almost 50% of the potential user base and importantly, 3,000 of those trained have already begun ordering. 
At the back half of the year, we plan to launch a DTC campaign for Kybella. The campaign will greatly enhance the current promotional efforts, which really lay the groundwork in the creation of development of this new market for injectable. We continue to believe this product is of your stock future potential and our R&D team is exploring a number of new indications. 
We're also continuing to develop and prepare for the launch of the product ex U.S. in various markets, including the recent launch in Canada and other international markets later this year and in 2017. 
In summary, our commercial business continues to perform well, and we plan to continue to focus on our core therapy area leadership and leading the industry with launches and notably in double-digit top line growth. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David."

In Q1, we continue to make very significant progress. 2016 being another extremely busy year for our R&D team. We expect more than a dozen approvals and regulatory submissions, and we are on track to achieving these milestones. 
I'm not going to talk about everything on this slide but I would like to talk out a few of the key highlights. 
First, approvals. We received U.S. approval of Aczone gel, 7.5% for the treatment of acne. Providing a new concentration of Aczone for once a day application. When we received FDA approval of Dalvance, single-dose of on an antibiotic for skin dancing structure infections. The single dose allows the delivery of this IV antibiotic in 30 minutes in the emergency department and infusion centers and will provide separate patients the benefit of receiving a complete course of parenteral treatment, which may avoid hospital admissions. 
Regarding submissions to regulatory authorities, we submitted an NDA for Oxymetazoline as a treatment for rosacea. Also, we submitted on sNDA for Linzess low-dose 72 micrograms for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation or CIC, which provides another important dosing option for physicians and patients and could accelerate the conversion to the OTC market. We also filed on sNDA for a single-handed Liletta with optimized packaging for Liletta, our intrauterine device. Our partner, serenity pharmaceuticals, submitted and the FDA has accepted an NDA for SER 120, a potential new treatment for [ph]. 
Turning to development programs, early this week, we announced paucity of top line results from Venus I, 1 of 2 Phase III clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of [ph] acetate for the treatment of uterine fibroid. 
In the trial, both 10-milligrams and 5-milligram treatment arms met all primary and secondary endpoints of the placebo, and there were no treatment-related serious adverse events. This is important progress for our program and for patients. It's estimated that uterine fibroids contribute to more than 200,000 hysterectomies annually in the U.S. So about 1/3 of all hysterectomies performed in the United States. 
Esmya has the potential to offer the first and only nonsurgical oral treatment option for women suffering from uterine fibroids in the United States. The results are very exciting, and we continue to anticipate the 2017 submission for this product. 
In addition, in Q1, together with Gideon Richter, we initiated Phase III trials for cariprazine in bipolar depression. Two parallel studies will be conducted at approximately 85 [ph] in the U.S. and Europe. Bipolar depression is one of the most difficult mental illnesses to treat and response rates vary greatly from 1 patient to another. So it's important to continue to explore new therapies and increase the number of options that are available to help patients manage their symptoms. 
Turning to Slide 18. As Brent mentioned, Allergan's R&D pipeline continues to be innovative and productive and continuing to grow our Open Science model. In 2015, we acquired in-licensed or enter into collaborations provide a more than 10 new pipeline opportunities across our key therapeutic areas. We achieved registration for 4 NMEs in the United States. 
In 2016, we have already added 2 additional development programs through Open Science. First, our development in commercialization partnership with Kythera as a broad clinical and preclinical portfolio of muscarinic M1, M4 and [ph] M1 M4 agonists, including HDL 9936 and HTL 18318 for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. These muscarinic antagonists have the potential to improvements in terms of these disorders, such as cognition and psychosis. 
Most agonists have previously demonstrated to improve cognition in Alzheimer's but development has been hindered due to off-target side effects. We believe that the Heptares compound has selectivity advantages, which should result in maintenance of the beneficial effects without the [ph] of side effects. 
Our acquisition of Topokine adds XAF5, a potential first-in-class treatment for stay at the buzzer on or more easily known as undereye bags. We had a great start to 2016 in R&D. We have many more milestones ahead for the remainder of the year. Our pipeline continues to validate our approach to R&D innovation through our Open Science model. 
I [indiscernible] more than 2,000 Allergan R&D colleagues around the world for their tremendous work and dedication in driving innovation in achieving these results and for their commitment to the work ahead. 
I will now turn the call over to Rob Stewart to briefly discuss a few highlights of the Global Generics business. Rob?"

Turning to Slide 20, our generics business remains a best-in-class asset and I could not be more proud of the accomplishments of our entire organization. The R&D team continues to achieve an incredible number of filings, both in the United States as well as in key international markets. More impressive than the numbers are the quality of the assets filed, including first to file applications for generic Abraxane as well as generic [ph]. Out of all the first to files published by FDA in 2016, our generics team holds 50% of those accepted. They've done this year after year and now have amassed over 98 first-to-file applications pending at the agency. 
Outside of the United States, we have filed over 1,000 marketing authorizations so the performance remains strong not only in the U.S. but across the globe. 
Price erosion is always a headwind in the generic industry and 2016 is no different. Companies that invested in developing high-quality assets and invested in their supply chain capabilities are able to counter price erosion more effectively with new product launches, strong quality and reliable customer service. 
This year, we've launched 13 new products in the United States including generic last week Internationally, we launched 62 products, including Pemetrexed. We continue to see erosion within expectations around mid-single digits different from the more commoditized generic models out there. 
Moving to Slide 21. Our entire organization remains focused on closing the transaction with Teva in June. We are operationally ready to close once we receive the antitrust clearance. We have regulatory approvals in all countries with exception of the U.S., but both teams are working diligently to complete that process. 
In closing, our performance remains strong. Our team continues to execute and most of our leadership team at Allergan generics is continuing on with Teva, so we expect to see continued strong performance post close. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tessa to review our first quarter financial results. Tessa?"
36478,331526583,979476,"Allergan plc, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 10, 2016",2016-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Please note this discussion of results reflect continuing operations, which we have been reporting since Q3 2015 following the announcement of the divestiture of our Global Generics business to Teva.

Please note this discussion of results reflect continuing operations, which we have been reporting since Q3 2015 following the announcement of the divestiture of our Global Generics business to Teva. 
Turning to our of our results for the first quarter of 2016 on Slide 23. In the first quarter, we delivered strong year-over-year performance. On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated net revenue for the first quarter 2016 was $3.8 billion, an increase of 48% versus the first quarter of 2015 with branded net revenues increasing 71% to $3.4 billion, primarily driven by the Allergan acquisition. 
Sequentially, the results were impacted by lower Anda revenues and the impact of anticipated seasonality on top promoted branded products. Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter was 80.1%, an increase of 8.1 percentage points versus first quarter 2015, which reflects our revenue mix following the acquisition of Allergan and the impact from Anda. 
While Anda's revenue has declined versus prior year, the loss revenue was at the very low margin. Non-GAAP R&D investment for the quarter was $277 million compared to $172 million in the prior-year period. Non-GAAP SG&A was relatively flat compared to last quarter at $1.01 billion as a result of continued spending behind our new product launches including Kybella, [ph] and Vraylar. SG&A increased from the previous-year period as a result of the acquisition of Allergan. Non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was $1.75 billion, an increase of 68% versus the prior year, driven by higher revenues and higher gross margins across our business segments mainly as a result of the Allergan acquisition. 
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 15% to $3.04 compared to $2.65 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2015. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 9.7% in the quarter. This rate was driven in part by the entire interest expense being included in our continuing operations earnings. 
Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $1.2 billion, impacted by recent R&D asset acquisitions and integration expenses. Excluding these items, cash flow from operations was $1.45 billion. 
Turning now to our U.S. Brands brand results on Slide 24. The business continue to deliver strong performance year-over-year. U.S. Brands revenue was $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 27% versus the prior year period, driven by the addition of the Allergan business and strong growth across other key branded products offset by a decline in Namenda IR with the loss of exclusivity for that product and lower revenue of the Asacol/Delzicol franchise. 
Adjusted gross margin within U.S. Brands continued to show improvement, with margins of approximately 89%, up 0.8 percentage versus the prior year quarter. SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 21.7% versus 23.8% in the year ago quarter, driven by our continued ability to maximize our commercial infrastructure post the Allergan acquisition. 
And now turning to Slide 25, our U.S. Medical business. First quarter revenues were $450 million. There's no significant prior year comparison for U.S. Medical as it was acquired as part of the Allergan acquisition in March of 2015. On a pro forma basis, U.S. Medical business revenue grew 2 percentage versus prior year and 14%, excluding Medical Dermatology. Growth was driven by key products, including Botox at 12%, fillers at 14% and Kybella. 
Sequentially, revenue was impacted by typical seasonality. Our [indiscernible] business that revenue decline versus the prior year on a pro forma basis attributed to a onetime harmonization of allowance is versus Q1 2015. Prescription transfer the products were stable and we expect strong full year performance for this business, driven by Aczone. 
First quarter gross margins continue to be stable at 93.1%. Sequentially, SG&A increased slightly as a result of continued Kybella promotional spend and sales force expansion related to the launch of this product. 
Turning to Slide 26 in our International Brand results. First quarter revenues were $673 million versus $119 million in the prior year period largely due to the Allergan acquisition. Excluding FX on a pro forma basis, international revenues in the first quarter grew 16%, driven by continued strong growth of Botox, cosmetic, fillers and Ozurdex. 
Gross margins were 85.3% in the quarter and segment SG&A increased 2 percentage points to 31.9% versus fourth quarter 2015 due largely to new product launches, including Constella in various markets. 
Turning to our Anda business on Slide 27. Revenues gravels decreased to 34% to $365 million, this is $554 million in the prior year period, driven by anticipated lower retail business primarily from that CVS acquisition of Target in store pharmacies. Gross margins increased 2.3 percentage points to 68.9% [ph] due to product mix. 
Results in all periods include third-party revenues and related expenses of generic products manufactured by the company and distributed through Anda. 
Slide 28 details our debt capitalization. We ended the first quarter 2016 with total debt of approximately $42.6 billion and equity of $77.5 billion. At quarter end, our leverage ratio was 4.43x debt-to-adjusted EBITDA versus 4.07x in the prior year quarter. 
In April, we made approximately $1.2 billion in debt payments, bringing our adjusted leverage ratio to 4.3x debt-to-adjusted EBITDA. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings. Following the close of the divestiture of our generics business to Teva, we anticipate paying the remaining term loan balance of approximately $8 billion, which has no prepayment penalties. 
Turning to Slide 29. Let me make a few comments on our 2016 guidance, which we are retreating today. We continue to expect full year net revenues to be approximately $17 billion ,including branded business revenues of approximately $15 billion, reflecting double-digit growth, driven by strong sales of key products and new launches in 2016. 
Note that revenues will be back half weighted as a result of contribution from launch of being greater in the second half and typical pharm seasonality. Our revenue forecast reflects lower year-over-year revenue expectations for Anda of approximately $500 million due to the CVS acquisition of target in-store pharmacy. We continue to expect growth market gross margins to remain strong with no material change from current levels in each segment. We continue to anticipate SG&A as a percentage of non-GAAP revenue to be approximately 25% of total net revenue. And we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to trend downwards throughout the year naturally as revenue increase and as we continue to see the impact of our anticipated business simplification activities following the divestiture of our Global Generics business to Teva. 
As part of the business simplification plan, we announced a new streamlined senior leadership structure. This new structure will allow us to leverage resources across therapeutic areas and product categories in focus on the key attributes of growth pharma, including strong top line revenue growth and operational excellence, which will result in industry-leading operating margins. 
R&D spend is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion as a result of the many important late-stage programs advancing in our pipeline, including the commencement of Phase III programs of [indiscernible] in the back half of this year. Our tax rate should begin to trend gradually toward normalized levels in the range of 14%, following the close of Teva. We 
will provide an updated forecast for 2016, including our expectations for earnings per share following the close of the Teva transaction, most likely on our second quarter earnings call in August. 
And now starting starting on Slide 30. I would like to spend a few minutes on our capital deployment expectations following the close of the Teva transaction. To echo Brent's comments during his introduction, we have great conviction in our growth pharma strategy and the strong future prospects of our company. Our strategy for capital deployment will involve a three-pronged approach with options that are not mutually exclusive with the goal of providing the best value and return to our shareholders. 
On Slide 31, the divestiture of our Global Generics business provides us with significant liquidity. As mentioned by Rob previously, Teva has done a great job working through a very intricate process, working together with our colleagues at Allergan, Teva is ready for a successful day 1 following the close, which is on track for June. 
Moving to Slide 32. As you saw this morning, we announced our board's authorization to repurchase up to $10 billion of our own stock following the close of the Teva transaction. We realized that there was no better investment that in our own fast-growing company. 
We expect to execute $4 billion to $5 billion over 4- to 6-month period buying as much as prudently possible in open market purchases subject to favorable market conditions. If favorable market conditions persist, we will have more liquidity to consider buying more after satisfying the first part of the program. 
In addition to the stock repurchase program, we're also committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings and will paydown approximately $8 billion of debt, following the close of the Teva transaction. This leads us with significant capacity to invest strategically in the growth of our company. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent for closing remarks."

Now to finish, let me provide some comments and the overall environment. Over the past 6 months, we have seen a particularly tough player for companies relying on a strategy of highly -- of high leverage and buying low-quality noncore assets, significantly raising prices and drastically cutting lifeblood investments at R&D and commercial infrastructure. When the strategy is flawed, the outcome will be bad even if it takes time. What is left will be high-quality companies that continued to invest in R&D and those that come up with new ways to speed introduction of medical innovations. The best of those high-quality companies will not rely only on what their teams discover in-house, but will also have an open mind and use Open Science to attract innovations from across the entire ecosystem. They will have excellent R&D capabilities to bring those innovations through the rigorous of clinical trials and regulatory review around the world. And the most dynamic of those companies will have commercial that re resilient's, persistent and effective at driving growth.

Overall though, whether it's or Namzaric this is a very stable business, and we have a heavy promotional effort. We're are the only 1 in the category that is active.

I expect that over the next 9 to 12 months, the formulary coverage for Viberzi is going to of the prospective formulary coverage for Linzess. Speaking about Linzess, it was added to CVS Caremark formulary and in the Part D space, well care and [ph]. And those are very significant formulary wins for the product and really sure up 2016, I think, into '17.

The product said are most important to our growth, our first economical. They are -- most of their growth is coming from volume and single-digit price appreciation.

And then as it relates to Vraylar, products are off a terrific start. And we know psychiatry very, very well. The feedback that we're getting is exceeding our expectations in terms of the actual experience with the drug, formulary coverage is developing, as expected. This is a category where while there are a lot of products, there's a great deal of trial and error and so helps Namzaric inclined to place the products on formulary even if it's behind the use of answer risperidone or [ph]. And I think that essentially what's going to happen in this category is is there's changing of the growing between the older [ph] the ones that I just mentioned between newer it goes like Vraylar and [ph].

Both on the branded and in generic business, there's been a lot of debate and concern, I think, almost the community around pricing. I think the reality is when you have innovative products that meet unmet need that can distinguish themselves from older products, pricing really isn't the central issue. It's the ability to commercialize and support your drug with data. On the generic side, it's a very similar story. When you invest in R&D, as Bob Stewart pointed out, when you have a team that has 90 first to files waiting at the FDA, when they go after complex generics and higher-barrier products, you get a better pricing environment. And so I think that the net-net is that there are others that have reported weakness in price, but that's because their portfolio lacks innovation, lacks differentiation. Even in highly integrated areas in the branded said, were there is multiple entries into the same market with very similar mechanisms of reaction, it drives price down. When you standalone when your -- like we do with Viberzi as an example, you tend to have better pricing dynamics in the environment. It's really that straightforward.

Allergan remains the most dynamic and exciting company in our industry, and in my mind, that makes us the best pharmaceutical company in the world. You can see it in our results this quart",1145,"Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 5. Allergan remains the most dynamic and exciting company in our industry, and in my mind, that makes us the best pharmaceutical company in the world. You can see it in our results this quarter. You can see it in the way our team has pivoted to focus on our future as a stand-alone leader in Growth Pharma. You can see it in the operational excellence on display in teams across our company. You can see it in the way we focus on building therapeutic area leadership in the categories where we choose to compete. You can see it in the way we are using Open Science to build an industry-leading R&D pipeline to sustain our leadership in those therapeutic areas. And you can ask our customers about how our highly responsive service-oriented approach to customer intimacy.
Those are just a few reasons why we are especially excited about our future. As we considered our options for deploying cash following Teva's planned $40.5 billion acquisition of our Global Generics business in the second quarter, we realize that there was no better investment than owning our fast-growing company. So our board has authorized the company's first share repurchase program at a value of up to $10 billion. We'll start with $4 billion to $5 billion during the rest of 2016, buying as much as prudently possible in the open market. If favorable market conditions persist, we will have additional capacity to consider buying more after satisfying the first part of the program. In addition to the stock repurchase program, we will have the ability to pay down debt to maintain our investment-grade credit ratings and preserve significant capacity to invest for growth.
Given the strength of our current business and the opportunities we see ahead, we remain focused on running one of the finest companies in our industry. Tessa will talk more about the share repurchase program in just a few minutes.
Turning to Slide 6. Allergan's first quarter performance reflects our continuing execution on each element of our Growth Pharma strategy. First, top line growth. In the first quarter, we powered another fine quarter with total revenue up 48% and branded growth up 71% versus prior year. On a pro forma basis, branded revenue was up double digits again this quarter.
Second, we maintained leadership positions in our 7 core therapeutic areas. And with the recent launches of new drugs like Viberzi, Vraylar and KYBELLA, we have added significant muscle and growth potential to our GI, CNS and aesthetic therapeutic areas.
Third, our R&D engine continues to produce at record pace. We delivered 2 new branded FDA approvals and 4 FDA submissions just in the first quarter. In Europe, we also received a positive opinion for ZENPEP ex-U.S. named Enzepi to enhance our cystic fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency offering.
Our Open Science model is helping us build a sustainable R&D pipeline by bringing us novel assets like XAF5 for undereye bags and from Heptares, a portfolio selective agents for major neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease where we are the market leader. Our best-in-class generics R&D engine continues to perform well, and Rob Steward will highlight this later. 
Fourth, our focus on operational excellence helped us simplify the operating structure, streamline our IT systems and drive more than a 500 basis point improvement in our operating margins versus prior year. Our operational excellence also has been on display with the launch of our generic Crestor in the U.S. Our generics team, together with Anda, executed flawlessly to get product on the pharmacy shelves fast in order to take advantage of this first-to-market opportunity.
Now let me turn to continuing operations business performance in the first quarter on Slide 7. Our first quarter net revenue grew 48% on a year-over-year basis to $3.8 billion as a result of the Allergan acquisition and strong global growth within all of our key therapeutic categories. Branded revenue was the key driver, up 71%. Strong sales in key products and operating margin expansion across our business drove a 15% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share to $3.04.
Meanwhile, non-GAAP operating income rose to $1.8 billion, an increase of 68% versus prior year. And cash flow from operations was $1.45 billion, excluding R&D asset acquisitions, restructuring and integration payments. These results illustrate the strong, long-term growth profile of Allergan.
Turning to Slide 8. Our strategy is based on utilizing all of our Growth Pharma assets together, including our best-in-class commercial engine to bring life-changing medicines to patients around the world.
As we look at our product portfolio, our branded business continues to thrive in the first quarter with 10% pro forma revenue growth, excluding the impact of currency and the Namenda IR and divestitures. Our top global products, which represent more than 75% of total branded revenue, grew 13%, excluding the impact of currency and Namenda IR, with over half of those products growing at double-digit rates. This quarter performance is a true testament to the hard work of our team and the success of our Growth Pharma strategy and mindset.
Moving to Slide 9. As we near the conclusion of the generics divestiture, I have been carefully considering how to streamline our management structure to better align our resources as a focused branded Growth Pharma business with many leading global brands.
We've announced to streamline the executive team to lead Allergan going forward. In this new leadership structure, all of our commercial businesses will be combined under Bill Meury, who has been appointed our Chief Commercial Officer. There will be 3 major business segments under Bill. The first segment is U.S. specialized therapeutics, which includes eye care, Medical Aesthetics, medical dermatology and Botox therapeutics. The second segment is U.S. general medicine, which includes CNS, CV, GI, Women's Health, infect -- AI and urology. The third segment is international, which includes all of our businesses outside the U.S. organized in multiple regions.
Anda, our fourth segment, will continue to report to Rob Stewart.
We remain focused on driving growth by building therapeutic area leadership in our 7 core therapeutic areas, eye care, aesthetics and medical dermatology, CNS, GI, Women's Health, Botox therapeutics and anti-infectives. We will continue to be a drug development powerhouse and utilize our Open Science model to invest in innovation and propel future growth in these therapeutic areas. I believe this new commercial structure will further enhance our global focus, speed decision-making and align resources and priorities with our R&D priorities.
We are also appointing Rob Stewart to the position of Chief Operating Officer. In this role, Rob will make sure our manufacturing operations run smoothly to meet our sales goal, oversee harmonization of our IT systems and processes and finish previous integrations.
With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Meury, our new Chief Commercial Officer."

Two hallmarks of Growth Pharma are category leadership and customer intimacy. They are true differentiators for Allergan, especially within our commercial team, which consists of a worldwide sales force of more than 7,500 strong. I'm looking forward to leading the Allergan commercial organization, which has a great portfolio of products, as you know, an industry-leading team with deep knowledge and expertise of key therapy areas. All the talent we needed for the future organization was here within our 4 walls. And with this new integrated structure, we can begin to leverage resources globally and across product lines in lockstep with our R&D organization. We're squarely focused on leadership in each of our therapeutic areas and have -- and on having a unique connection with our customers, both of which are competitive advantages.
Turning to Slide 11. The fundamentals of our business are strong. Overall basic demand, market share growth and sales performance were robust in the first quarter, and we're well positioned to sustain the growth for these franchises for the remainder of 2016 and beyond.
In all 7 of our therapeutic areas, our teams delivered high single or double-digit sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange versus the prior year. In eye care, sales increased by 11% powered by continued strength from Restasis, Combigan and Ozurdex.
U.S. sales for Restasis, our flagship product, increased by 22%. We're preparing for the launch of Restasis MDPF, Multi-Dose Preservative-free, in the second half of the year and looking forward to the approval of Oculeve, our nasal neuro stimulator in, early 2017, which will significantly strengthen our product offering for ocular surface disease. Behind these 2 products, we have, of course, our analog [ph] and [indiscernible]. We are, as you know, an eye care company, and we look forward to building their deepest and broadest portfolio for ocular surface disease. 
In CNS, we delivered 21% growth with Botox migraine, Namenda XR and Vraylar. These were the key growth products in the quarter and are expected to continue driving growth in 2016 and beyond. In aesthetics, sales increased by 7% with Botox, Fillers and KYBELLA. All 3 businesses are in excellent position, and we expect to sustain high-growth rates in 2016 and beyond, too.
Sales in aesthetics increased at an impressive rate of 16%, excluding medical dermatology. Medical derm revenue, however, was impacted by a onetime harmonization for allowances in the quarter. However, prescription trends were relatively stable, and we expect growth in the back half of the year.
In GI, Linzess, our flagship, continues to exceed expectations and post exceptional growth. And the launch of Viberzi is off to a very strong start. We expect sales for this franchise to increase at a double-digit rate in 2016 and beyond despite the decline in the Asacol/Delzicol product line.
We also see strong growth and continue to be excited about our future in Women's Health, urology and anti-infectives.
On Slide 12, we have 8 products in launch phase across each of our leading therapeutic areas. This is important as it provides new products for our sales forces, new products to deliver to our customers and new innovation to solve unmet medical need for patients. Let me talk a little bit about 3 of our newest launches, Vraylar, Viberzi and KYBELLA, all of which have blockbuster potential.
Turning to Slide 13. We launched Viberzi, our treatment for IBS-D, right at the end of 2015, and we're off to a strong start. Based on sales, Viberzi is trending at approximately 80% of Linzess IBS-C during the same time period post launch, which is in line with our expectations. More than 8,000 physicians have prescribed Viberzi to date, and about 65% of the physician base are repeat prescribers. And we're seeing a nice boost to scripts following the start of our DTC campaign in April.
Linzess, our treatment for IBS-C, continues to experience strong growth 4 years post launch. We've seen incremental growth following the launch of our long-term care-focused detailing program and DTC advertising campaigns. We now have 2 products that can cover a range of IBS needs to treat these patients.
Turning to Slide 14 and Vraylar. Vraylar was launched in mid-March in the United States and is tracking strongly with competitive products, including Rexulti and Latuda at the time of their launches, exceeding our internal expectations. Vraylar has higher script trends versus Latuda at launch, and Vraylar's volume is similar to Rexulti without occurring indication in MDD. The future of this product is very promising. Vraylar could potentially be the only approved treatment with 5 different indications or claims. That would be a significant advantage for the product and would make it a potential blockbuster in the marketplace.
Now turning to Slide 15. KYBELLA, our product for submental fat reduction or double chin, is off to a strong start. Since we acquired the product from Kythera in October 2015, we've accelerated the training of targeted accounts. So far, we've trained over 4,000 injectors or almost 50% of the potential user base, and importantly, 3,000 of those trained have already begun ordering.
For the back half of the year, we plan to launch a DTC campaign for KYBELLA. The campaign will greatly enhance the current promotional efforts, which are really laying the groundwork in the creation and development of this new market for injectables. We continue to believe this product has a very strong future potential, and our R&D team is exploring a number of new indications.
We're also continuing to develop and prepare for the launch of the product ex-U.S. in various markets, including the recent launch in Canada, and other international markets later this year and in 2017.
In summary, our commercial business continues to perform well, and we plan to continue to focus on our core therapy area leadership and in leading the industry with launches and ultimately in double-digit top line growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to David."

Let's move to Slide 17. This presents our late-stage development pipeline. In Q1, we continue to make very significant progress. 2016, being another extremely busy year for our R&D team, we expect more than a dozen approvals and regulatory submissions, and we are on track to achieving these milestones.
I'm not going to talk about everything on this slide, but I would like to talk out a few of the key highlights.
First, approvals. We received U.S. approval of Aczone Gel 7.5% for the treatment of acne, providing a new concentration of Aczone for once a day application. And we received FDA approval of Dalvance single dose, an antibiotic for skin and skin structure infections. The single dose allows for delivery of this IV antibiotic in 30 minutes in the emergency department and infusion centers and will provide separate patients the benefit of receiving a complete course of parenteral treatment, which may avoid hospital admissions.
Regarding submissions to regulatory authorities, we submitted an NDA for Oxymetazoline as a treatment for rosacea. Also, we submitted an sNDA for Linzess, low dose, 72 micrograms, for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation or, CIC, which provides another important dosing option for physicians and patients and could accelerate the conversion to the OTC market. We also filed an sNDA for a single-handed inserter with optimized packaging for Liletta, our intrauterine device. Our partner, Serenity Pharmaceuticals, submitted and the FDA has accepted an NDA for SER 120, a potential new treatment for Nocturia.
Turning to development programs, earlier this week, we announced positive top line results from Venus I, 1 of 2 Phase III clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of ulipristal acetate for the treatment of uterine fibroid. In the trial, both 10 milligrams and 5 milligram treatment arms met all co-primary and secondary endpoints of the placebo, and there were no treatment-related serious adverse events. This is important progress for our Esmya program and for patients. It's estimated that uterine fibroids contribute to more than 200,000 hysterectomies annually in the U.S., so about 1/3 of all hysterectomies performed in the United States. Esmya has the potential to offer the first and only nonsurgical oral treatment option for women suffering from uterine fibroids in the United States. The results are very exciting, and we continue to anticipate the 2017 submission for this product.
In addition, in Q1, together with Gedeon Richter, we initiated Phase III trials for cariprazine in bipolar depression. Two parallel studies will be conducted at approximately 85 sites in the U.S. and Europe. Bipolar depression is one of the most difficult mental illnesses to treat, and response rates vary greatly from 1 patient to another. So it's important to continue to explore new therapies and increase the number of options that are available to help patients manage their symptoms.
Turning to Slide 18. As Brent mentioned, Allergan's R&D pipeline continues to be innovative and productive, and it is continuing to grow through our Open Science model. In 2015, we acquired, in-licensed or entered into collaborations, providing more than 10 new pipeline opportunities across our key therapeutic areas. We achieved registration for 4 NMEs in the United States.
In 2016, we have already added 2 additional development programs through Open Science. First, our development and commercialization partnership with Heptares as a broad clinical and preclinical portfolio of muscarinic M1, M4 and dual M1/M4 agonists, including HTL9936 and HTL18318 for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. These muscarinic agonists have the potential to improve symptoms of this disorder, such as cognition and psychosis. Muscarinic agonists have previously been demonstrated to improve cognition in Alzheimer's, but development has been hindered due to off-target side effects. We believe that the Heptares compounds have selectivity advantages, which should result in maintenance of the beneficial effect without the deleterious side effects.
Our acquisition of Topokine adds XAF5, a potential first-in-class treatment for steatoblepharon or more easily known as undereye bags.
We've had a great start to 2016 in R&D. We have many more milestones ahead for the remainder of the year. Our pipeline continues to validate our approach to R&D innovation through our Open Science model.
I thank our more than 2,000 Allergan R&D colleagues around the world for their tremendous work and dedication in driving innovation in achieving these results and for their commitment to the work ahead.
I will now turn the call over to Rob Stewart to briefly discuss a few highlights of the Global Generics business. Rob?"

Turning to Slide 20, our generics business remains a best-in-class asset, and I could not be more proud of the accomplishments of our entire organization.

Turning to Slide 20, our generics business remains a best-in-class asset, and I could not be more proud of the accomplishments of our entire organization. The R&D team continues to achieve an incredible number of filings, both in the United States as well as in key international markets. More impressive than the numbers are the quality of the assets filed, including First-to-File applications for generic Abraxane as well as generic Xifaxan. Out of all the First-to-Files published by FDA in 2016, our generic team holds 50% of those accepted. They've done this year-after-year and now have amassed over 98 First-to-File applications pending at the agency. Outside of the United States, we have filed over 1,000 marketing authorizations, so the performance remains strong not only in the U.S. but across the globe.
Price erosion is always a headwind in the generic industry, and 2016 is no different. Companies that invested in developing high-quality assets and invested in their supply chain capability are able to counter price erosion more effectively with new product launches, strong quality and reliable customer service.
This year, we've launched 13 new products in the United States, including generic Crestor last week Internationally, we launched 62 products, including Pemetrexed. We continue to see erosion within -- in expectations around mid-single digits different from the more commoditized generic models out there.
Moving to Slide 21. Our entire organization remains focused on closing the transaction with Teva in June. We are operationally ready to close once we receive the antitrust clearance. We have regulatory approvals in all countries with exception of the U.S., but both teams are working diligently to complete that process. 
In closing, our performance remains strong. Our team continues to execute, and most of our leadership team at Allergan generics is continuing on with Teva, so we expect to see continued strong performance post close.
I'll now turn the call over to Tessa to review our first quarter financial results. Tessa?"
36478,331526583,979817,"Allergan plc, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 10, 2016",2016-05-10,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Please note, this discussion of results reflect continuing operations, which we have been reporting since Q3 2015 following the announcement of the divestiture of our Global Generics business to Teva.Turning to ou",1519,"Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Please note, this discussion of results reflect continuing operations, which we have been reporting since Q3 2015 following the announcement of the divestiture of our Global Generics business to Teva.
Turning to our of our overall results for the first quarter of 2016 on Slide 23. In the first quarter, we delivered strong year-over-year performance. On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated net revenue for the first quarter 2016 was $3.8 billion, an increase of 48% versus the first quarter of 2015 with branded net revenues increasing 71% to $3.4 billion, primarily driven by the Allergan acquisition.
Sequentially, results were impacted by lower Anda revenues and the impact of anticipated seasonality on top promoted branded products. Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter was 80.1%, an increase of 8.1 percentage points versus first quarter 2015, which reflects our revenue mix following the acquisition of Allergan and the impact from Anda.
While Anda's revenue has declined versus prior year, the loss revenue was at the very low margin. Non-GAAP R&D investment for the quarter was $277 million compared to $172 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP SG&A was relatively flat compared to last quarter at $1.01 billion as a result of continued spending behind our new product launches, including KYBELLA, Viberzi and Vraylar. SG&A increased from the previous year period as a result of the acquisition of Allergan.
Non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was $1.75 billion, an increase of 68% versus the prior year, driven by higher revenues and higher gross margins across our business segments mainly as a result of the Allergan acquisition.
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 15% to $3.04 compared to $2.65 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2015. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 9.7% in the quarter. This rate was driven in part by the entire interest expense being included in our continuing operations earnings.
Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $1.2 billion impacted by recent R&D asset acquisitions and integration expenses. Excluding these items, cash flow from operations was $1.45 billion.
Turning now to our U.S. Brands results on Slide 24. The business continued to deliver strong performance year-over-year. U.S. Brands revenue was $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 27% versus the prior year period, driven by the addition of the Allergan business and strong growth across other key branded products offset by a decline in Namenda IR with the loss of exclusivity for that product and lower revenue of the Asacol/Delzicol franchise.
Adjusted gross margin within U.S. Brands continued to show improvement with margins of approximately 89%, up 0.8 percentage points versus the prior year quarter. SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 21.7% versus 23.8% in the year ago quarter, driven by our continued ability to maximize our commercial infrastructure post the Allergan acquisition.
And now turning to Slide 25, our U.S. Medical business. First quarter revenues were $450 million. There's no significant prior year comparison for U.S. Medical as it was acquired as part of the Allergan acquisition in March of 2015. On a pro forma basis, U.S. Medical business revenue grew 2 percentage versus prior year and 14%, excluding medical dermatology. Growth was driven by key products, including Botox at 12%, Fillers at 14% and KYBELLA.
Sequentially, revenue was impacted by typical seasonality. Our med derm business net revenue declined versus the prior year on a pro forma basis attributed to a onetime harmonization of allowances versus Q1 2015.
Prescription trends for the products were stable, and we expect strong full year performance from this business driven by Aczone.
First quarter gross margins continued to be stable at 93.1%. Sequentially, SG&A increased slightly as a result of continued KYBELLA promotional spend and sales force expansion related to the launch of this product.
Turning to Slide 26 and our International Brands results. First quarter revenues were $673 million versus $119 million in the prior year period largely due to the Allergan acquisition. Excluding FX on a pro forma basis, international revenues in the first quarter grew 16% driven by continued strong growth of Botox Cosmetics, Fillers and Ozurdex.
Gross margins were 85.3% in the quarter, and segment SG&A increased 2 percentage points to 31.9% versus fourth quarter 2015 due largely to new product launches, including earFold and Constella in various markets.
Turning to our Anda business on Slide 27. Revenues decreased 34% to $365 million versus $554 million in the prior year period, driven by anticipated lower retail business primarily from that CVS acquisition of Target in-store pharmacies. Gross margins increased 2.3 percentage points to 16.9% due to product mix.
Results in all periods include third-party revenues and related expenses of generic products manufactured by the company and distributed through Anda.
Slide 28 details our debt capitalization. We ended the first quarter 2016 with total debt of approximately $42.6 billion and equity of $77.5 billion. At quarter end, our leverage ratio was 4.43x debt to adjusted EBITDA versus 4.07x in the prior year quarter. In April, we made approximately $1.2 billion in debt payments, bringing our adjusted leverage ratio to 4.3x debt to adjusted EBITDA.
We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings.
Following the close of the divestiture of our generics business to Teva, we anticipate paying the remaining term loan balance of approximately $8 billion, which has no prepayment penalties.
Turning to Slide 29. Let me make a few comments on our 2016 guidance, which we are reiterating today. We continue to expect full year net revenues to be approximately $17 billion, including branded business revenues of approximately $15 billion, reflecting double-digit growth, driven by strong sales of key products and new launches in 2016.
Note that revenues will be back-half-weighted as a result of contribution from launches being greater in the second half and typical pharma seasonality. Our revenue forecast reflects lower year-over-year revenue expectations for Anda of approximately $500 million due to the CVS acquisition of Target in-store pharmacy.
We continue to expect our growth market gross margins to remain strong with no material change from current levels in each segment. We continue to anticipate SG&A as a percentage of non-GAAP revenue to be approximately 25% of total net revenue. And we expect the SG&A as a percentage of revenue to trend downwards throughout the year naturally as revenue increase and as we continue to see the impact of our anticipated business simplification activities following the divestiture of our Global Generics business to Teva.
As part of the business simplification plan, we announced a new streamlined senior leadership structure. This new structure will allow us to leverage resources across therapeutic areas and product categories and focus on the key attributes of Growth Pharma, including strong top line revenue growth and operational excellence, which will result in industry-leading operating margins.
R&D spend is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion as a result of the many important late-stage programs advancing in our pipeline, including the commencement of Phase III programs of Rapastinel and Ubrogepant in the back half of this year.
Our tax rate should begin to trend gradually toward normalized levels in the range of 14%, following the close of Teva.
We will provide an updated forecast for 2016, including our expectations for earnings per share following the close of the Teva transaction, most likely on our second quarter earnings call in August.
And now starting on Slide 30, I would like to spend a few minutes on our capital deployment expectations following the close of the Teva transaction. To echo Brent's comments during his introduction, we have great conviction in our Growth Pharma strategy and in the strong future prospects of our company. Our strategy for capital deployment will involve a three-pronged approach with options that are not mutually exclusive with the goal of providing the best value and return to our shareholders.
On Slide 31. The divestiture of our Global Generics business provides us with significant liquidity. As mentioned by Rob previously, Teva has done a great job working through a very intricate process. Working together with our colleagues at Allergan, Teva is ready for a successful day 1 following the close, which is on track for June.
Moving to Slide 32. As you saw this morning, we announced our board's authorization to repurchase up to $10 billion of our own stock following the close of the Teva transaction. We realized that there was no better investment that in our own fast-growing company. We expect to execute $4 billion to $5 billion over 4- to 6-month period buying as much as prudently possible in open market purchases subject to favorable market conditions. If favorable market conditions persist, we will have more liquidity to consider buying more after satisfying the first part of the program.
In addition to the stock repurchase program, we're also committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings and will pay down approximately $8 billion of debt, following the close of the Teva transaction. This leaves us with significant capacity to invest strategically in the growth of our company.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent for closing remarks."

Now to finish, let me provide some comments on the overall environment. Over the past 6 months, we have seen a particularly environment for companies relying on a strategy of highly -- of high leverage and buying low-quality noncore assets, significantly raising prices and drastically cutting lifeblood investments at R&D and commercial infrastructure. When the strategy is flawed, the outcome will be bad even if it takes time. What is left will be high-quality companies that continue to invest in R&D and those that come up with new ways to speed introduction of medical innovations.
The best of those high-quality companies will not rely only on what their teams discover in-house but will also have an open mind and use Open Science to attract innovations from across the entire ecosystem. They will have excellent R&D capabilities to bring those innovations through the rigorous of clinical trials and regulatory review around the world. And the most dynamic of those companies will have commercial engines that are resilient, persistent and effective at driving growth.
Allergan is one of those high-quality, dynamic, growing pharmaceutical companies. That is how we are running this company. I am proud of our team doing this a great work at every level and honored to be their CEO.

And I think, we have -- as David pointed out, we did about 10 of those last year. We've done 2 in the first quarter, and they've been, I think, highly productive and potentially very successful for us. So we're going to stick to the knitting of what's created Growth Pharma. If there was a transformational deal like Allergan where there's a -- which was a bit of a one in a million type of opportunity right to be a white knight to buy a once in a lifetime kind of asset like Allergan, certainly, we're going to stay open-minded to that.

We like every one of the 7 therapeutic areas that we're in. We think there's huge unmet medical need, huge opportunities to help patients with cures and treatments, and tremendous scientific advance. So we're going to continue to deploy Open Science and opportunities to bring in selected marketed products to bolster our position and become #1 globally in every one of those therapeutic areas. With respect to a new therapeutic area, I think the bar would be high for us to consider de novo, a new therapeutic area. It would have to be an area with strong growth potential, lots of white space and limited competition for assets in that category. There are a few that we evaluate that meet those goals, but we're not focused on doing that at this time.

And so that side of the business is very strong. When you turn to the aesthetic side, as you know, it's the leading brand in the world. It has a world-class e-commerce and a customer loyalty program which continues to sustain sales levels. If you think about it geographically, the international business sales for Botox are up almost 20%. And so this is just a rock-solid product. It's got 11 different indications. It's got a unique injection pattern that users understand. It's highly economical.

And I think for physicians, that's an important indication which we expect to get in the second half of '16. It's clear among urologists and primary care physicians that Namzaric is superior to anything on the market, whether it's Namenda XR or Aricept. Once we get that indication, we will essentially launch it, and I think you'll see a very different trajectory. Overall, though, whether it's XR or Namzaric, this is a very stable business. And we have a heavy promotional effort. We're are the only one in the category that is active. Neurologists and primary care physicians know that. Our formulary coverage in '16 and in '17 is very, very strong. And I believe that we're going to at least maintain the business that we have today.

Naturally, the formulary coverage for Viberzi is developing, but the majority of the claims for Viberzi during the first several weeks of launch have been approved. And so I'm very encouraged by it. ESI and CVS/Caremark placed Viberzi on formulary in an unrestricted position, which I thought was a terrific development this early in the launch. I expect that over the next 9 to 12 months, the formulary coverage for Viberzi is going to look just like the formulary coverage for Linzess. Speaking about Linzess, it was added to CVS/Caremark formulary; and then in the Part D space, WellCare and Aetna. And those are very significant formulary wins for the product and really shore up 2016 and I think into '17. There's nothing really, in my view, at least as it relates to our product line, that is going to surprise us. We already have a line of sight to 2017. The product set are most important to our growth, are first economical. They are -- most of their growth is coming from volume and single-digit price appreciation. And so I think as long as we continue to communicate with payers and we're predictable and transparent about our future pricing decisions, I think we're going to be able to maintain access across this entire product line. And then as it relates to Vraylar, the product's off to a terrific start. And we know psychiatry very, very well. The feedback that we're getting is exceeding our expectations in terms of the actual experience with the drug. Formulary coverage is developing, as expected. This is the category where, while there are a lot of products, there's a great deal of trial and error, and so health plans are inclined to place the product on formulary, even if it's behind the use of [indiscernible] or Risperdal or Zyprexa. And I think that essentially what's going to happen in this category is there'll be a changing of the guard between the older atypicals, the ones I just mentioned, to newer atypicals like Vraylar or even the 2 others, Latuda and Rexulti. Because when you look at the benefit risk ratio of the newer ones, including Vraylar, it's clearly better than what you see with the older antipsychotics. And we're very encouraged by what's going on with Vraylar in the first 8 weeks."

So let me quickly touch on pricing, then ask Bill to comment more specifically, because I think this holds true since you asked, Chris, across the entire portfolio. I think both in the branded and in the generics business, there's been a lot of debate and concern, I think, amongst the community around pricing. I think the reality is when you have innovative products that meet unmet need that can distinguish themselves from older products, pricing really isn't the central issue. It's the ability to commercialize and support your drug with data. On the generics side, it's a very similar story. When you invest in R&D, as Bob Stewart pointed out, when you have a team that has 90 first to files waiting at the FDA, when they go after complex generics and higher-barrier products, you get a better pricing environment. And so I think that the net-net is there are others that have reported weakness in price, but that's because their portfolio lacks innovation. It lacks differentiation. And even in highly innovative areas on the branded side, where there's multiple entries into the same market with very similar mechanisms of action, it drives price down. When you stand alone with your drug, like we do with Viberzi, as an example, you tend to have better pricing dynamics in the environment. It's really that straightforward. Bill, you want to comment specifically on our portfolio?"

I would just first comment that our pricing strategy stems from the intellectual property surrounding these products. And we have exclusivity periods that extends into the -- well into the 2020s, and so we price for the long term. If you want to look at the business overall in the United States, the split was roughly 50-50, with price appreciation, of course, being in the mid-single digits. If you want to look at those products that are responsible for the majority of our growth in sales, our top almost dozen products, the growth is coming 70% from volume and 30% from price. So it's just a solid business. And again, it goes back to the fact that we're playing for the long term here. These are categories in which we have deep product offerings and strong customer relationships. And it's not -- we don't have a short-term outlook as it relates to price. And we haven't built in anything to the 2016 estimates or even beyond. That's unrealistic given the current market dynamics."

I like the analogy that came up earlier of stepping stones because we're really walking at supporting the path to growth.

This will be a flagship of our Women's Health business in a few years. Outside the United States, where it's been launched in Canada and in the EU, once you adjust for price and population, year 3 sales is near $400 million. And so this first trial was significant not only in terms of important for the community of OB/GYNs and Women's Health in general, but also important to us in terms of a big pipeline development."

We look at our ability to execute on that over the next few years. And we think, given our current assets and current pipeline, on a risk-adjusted basis, we think we can get there. Obviously, there are always puts and takes that come to that. But we have a high degree of confidence that we could do no other deals and deliver that growth over the next few years. I think as we think about tuck-in or stepping-stone deals, as I've been calling them, the intellectual property type of deals or R&D those are designed to get us into the 2020s, well into the 2020s with double-digit growth because that's the name of our business. It's about new product launches. It's about innovation and looking for medicines that support treatment or cures for unmet need. And so we're going to continue to do that, but we're really thinking about well into the 2020s where we have to support the deal -- our business to get -- to maintain the double-digit growth. I think with respect to our stepping-stone approach to the marketed product, we're really looking for innovative products that we think really do provide a meaningful differentiation in terms of unmet need and that fit neatly into our current therapeutic areas so that we can get more leverage out of our infrastructure, whether that be G&A or selling and marketing. And so that's really how we see -- we have this great commercial engine, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. that we want to continue to leverage and make more of. And frankly, it makes our representatives, it makes our medical affairs teams, it makes our managed care teams more relevant when we talk about those therapeutic areas. So there are multiple reasons why we like our therapeutic area leadership approach with multiple products across an entire -- a broad spectrum. So I think we're in pretty good position to continue to deliver double digit or about 10% top line growth. I don't know, Bill, anything you'd add?"

We have a strong capital deployment opportunity, both with share buybacks, debt repayment and stepping-stone deals. And we have an investment-grade rated balance sheet. And so we are in, I think, the pole position, and our focus is going to be on operating and running our company and continuing to put up quarter-after-quarter performance. If we can support that or turbo-boost that with opportunistic deals that may come along, like Allergan came along in a very unique situation, then I think this is a bold management team that's going to look at what's in the best interest of our shareholders to drive shareholder value creation, and we'll do it.

We do look forward to probably our next call with respect to second quarter earnings in August to update you, both on earnings for the remainder of the year and our life post close of the Teva transaction. So thank you again for your time, and look forward to catching up again."

Allergan remains the most dynamic and exciting company in our industry, and in my mind, that makes us the best pharmaceutical company in the world. You can see it in our results this quart",1141,"Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. Beginning on Slide 5. Allergan remains the most dynamic and exciting company in our industry, and in my mind, that makes us the best pharmaceutical company in the world. You can see it in our results this quarter. You can see it in the way our team has pivoted to focus on our future as a stand-alone leader in Growth Pharma. You can see it in the operational excellence on display in teams across our company. You can see it in the way we focus on building therapeutic area leadership in the categories where we choose to compete. You can see it in the way we are using Open Science to build an industry-leading R&D pipeline to sustain our leadership in those therapeutic areas. And you can ask our customers about how our highly responsive service-oriented approach to customer intimacy.
Those are just a few reasons why we are especially excited about our future. As we considered our options for deploying cash following Teva's planned $40.5 billion acquisition of our Global Generics business in the second quarter, we realize that there was no better investment than owning our fast-growing company. So our board has authorized the company's first share repurchase program at a value of up to $10 billion. We'll start with $4 billion to $5 billion during the rest of 2016, buying as much as prudently possible in the open market. If favorable market conditions persist, we will have additional capacity to consider buying more after satisfying the first part of the program. In addition to the stock repurchase program, we will have the ability to pay down debt to maintain our investment-grade credit ratings and preserve significant capacity to invest for growth.
Given the strength of our current business and the opportunities we see ahead, we remain focused on running one of the finest companies in our industry. Tessa will talk more about the share repurchase program in just a few minutes.
Turning to Slide 6. Allergan's first quarter performance reflects our continuing execution on each element of our Growth Pharma strategy. First, top line growth. In the first quarter, we powered another fine quarter with total revenue up 48% and branded growth up 71% versus prior year. On a pro forma basis, branded revenue was up double digits again this quarter.
Second, we maintained leadership positions in our 7 core therapeutic areas. And with the recent launches of new drugs like Viberzi, Vraylar and KYBELLA, we have added significant muscle and growth potential to our GI, CNS and aesthetic therapeutic areas.
Third, our R&D engine continues to produce at record pace. We delivered 2 new branded FDA approvals and 4 FDA submissions just in the first quarter. In Europe, we also received a positive opinion for ZENPEP ex-U.S. named Enzepi to enhance our cystic fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency offering.
Our Open Science model is helping us build a sustainable R&D pipeline by bringing us novel assets like XAF5 for undereye bags and from Heptares, a portfolio selective agents for major neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease where we are the market leader. Our best-in-class generics R&D engine continues to perform well, and Rob Stewart will highlight this later. 
Fourth, our focus on operational excellence helped us simplify the operating structure, streamline our IT systems and drive more than a 500-basis-point improvement in our operating margins versus prior year. Our operational excellence also has been on display with the launch of our generic Crestor in the U.S. Our generics team, together with Anda, executed flawlessly to get product onto pharmacy shelves fast in order to take advantage of this first-to-market opportunity.
Now let me turn to continuing operations business performance in the first quarter on Slide 7. Our first quarter net revenue grew 48% on a year-over-year basis to $3.8 billion as a result of the Allergan acquisition and strong global growth within all of our key therapeutic categories. Branded revenue was the key driver, up 71%. Strong sales in key products and operating margin expansion across our business drove a 15% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share to $3.04.
Meanwhile, non-GAAP operating income rose to $1.8 billion, an increase of 68% versus prior year. And cash flow from operations was $1.45 billion, excluding R&D asset acquisitions, restructuring and integration payments. These results illustrate the strong, long-term growth profile of Allergan.
Turning to Slide 8. Our strategy is based on utilizing all of our Growth Pharma assets together, including our best-in-class commercial engine to bring life-changing medicines to patients around the world.
As we look at our product portfolio, our branded business continues to thrive in the first quarter with 10% pro forma revenue growth, excluding the impact of currency and the Namenda IR and divestitures. Our top global products, which represent more than 75% of total branded revenue, grew 13%, excluding the impact of currency and Namenda IR, with over half of those products growing at double-digit rates. This quarter performance is a true testament to the hard work of our team and the success of our Growth Pharma strategy and mindset.
Moving to Slide 9. As we near the conclusion of the generics divestiture, I have been carefully considering how to streamline our management structure to better align our resources as a focused branded Growth Pharma business with many leading global brands.
We've announced a streamlined executive team to lead Allergan going forward. In this new leadership structure, all of our commercial businesses will be combined under Bill Meury, who has been appointed our Chief Commercial Officer. There will be 3 major business segments under Bill. The first segment is U.S. specialized therapeutics, which includes eye care, Medical Aesthetics, medical dermatology and Botox therapeutics. The second segment is U.S. general medicine, which includes CNS, CV, GI, Women's Health, infect -- AI and urology. The third segment is international, which includes all of our businesses outside the U.S. organized in multiple regions.
Anda, our fourth segment, will continue to report to Rob Stewart.
We remain focused on driving growth by building therapeutic area leadership in our 7 core therapeutic areas: eye care, aesthetics and medical dermatology, CNS, GI, Women's Health, Botox therapeutic and anti-infectives. We will continue to be a drug development powerhouse and utilize our Open Science model to invest in innovation and propel future growth in these therapeutic areas. I believe this new commercial structure will further enhance our global focus, speed decision-making and align resources and priorities with our R&D priorities.
We are also appointing Rob Stewart to the position of Chief Operating Officer. In this role, Rob will make sure our manufacturing operations run smoothly to meet our sales goal, oversee harmonization of our IT systems and processes and finish previous integrations.
With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Meury, our new Chief Commercial Officer."

Two hallmarks of Growth Pharma are category leadership and customer intimacy. They are true differentiators for Allergan, especially within our commercial team, which consists of a worldwide sales force of more than 7,500 strong. I'm looking forward to leading the Allergan commercial organization, which has a great portfolio of products, as you know, an industry-leading team with deep knowledge and expertise of key therapy areas. All the talent we needed for the future organization was here within our 4 walls. And with this new integrated structure, we can begin to leverage resources globally and across product lines in lockstep with our R&D organization. We're squarely focused on leadership in each of our therapeutic areas and have -- and on having a unique connection with our customers, both of which are competitive advantages.
Turning to Slide 11. The fundamentals of our business are strong. Overall basic demand, market share growth and sales performance were robust in the first quarter, and we're well positioned to sustain the growth for these franchises for the remainder of 2016 and beyond.
In all 7 of our therapeutic areas, our teams delivered high single or double-digit sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange versus the prior year. In eye care, sales increased by 11% powered by continued strength from Restasis, Combigan and Ozurdex.
U.S. sales for Restasis, our flagship product, increased by 22%. We're preparing for the launch of Restasis MDPF, Multi-Dose Preservative-free, in the second half of the year and looking forward to the approval of Oculeve, our nasal neuro stimulator, in early 2017, which will significantly strengthen our product offering for ocular surface disease. Behind these 2 products, we have a cortisol analog and a mucin secretagogue. We are, as you know, an eye care company, and we look forward to building the deepest and broadest portfolio for ocular surface disease. 
In CNS, we delivered 21% growth with Botox migraine, Namenda XR and Vraylar. These were the key growth products in the quarter and are expected to continue driving growth in 2016 and beyond. In aesthetics, sales increased by 7% with Botox, Fillers and KYBELLA. All 3 businesses are in an excellent position, and we expect to sustain high-growth rates in 2016 and beyond, too.
Sales in aesthetics increased at an impressive rate of 16%, excluding medical dermatology. Medical derm revenue, however, was impacted by a onetime harmonization for allowances in the quarter. However, prescription trends were relatively stable, and we expect growth in the back half of the year.
In GI, Linzess, our flagship, continues to exceed expectations and post exceptional growth. And the launch of Viberzi is off to a very strong start. We expect sales for this franchise to increase at a double-digit rate in 2016 and beyond despite a decline in the Asacol/Delzicol product line.
We also see strong growth and continue to be excited about our future in Women's Health, urology and anti-infectives.
On Slide 12, we have 8 products in launch phase across each of our leading therapeutic areas. This is important as it provides new products for our sales forces, new products to deliver to our customers and new innovation to solve unmet medical need for patients. Let me talk a little bit about 3 of our newest launches, Vraylar, Viberzi and KYBELLA, all of which have blockbuster potential.
Turning to Slide 13. We launched Viberzi, our treatment for IBS-D, right at the end of 2015, and we're off to a strong start. Based on sales, Viberzi is trending at approximately 80% of Linzess IBS-C during the same time period post launch, which is in line with our expectations. More than 8,000 physicians have prescribed Viberzi to date, and about 65% of the physician base are repeat prescribers. And we're seeing a nice boost to scripts following the start of our DTC campaign in April.
Linzess, our treatment for IBS-C, continues to experience strong growth 4 years post launch. We've seen incremental growth following the launch of our long-term care-focused detailing program and DTC advertising campaigns. We now have 2 products that can cover a range of IBS needs to treat these patients.
Turning to Slide 14 and Vraylar. Vraylar was launched in mid-March in the United States and is tracking strongly with competitive products, including Rexulti and Latuda at the time of their launches, exceeding our internal expectations. Vraylar has higher script trends versus Latuda at launch, and Vraylar's volume is similar to Rexulti without occurring indication in MDD. The future of this product is very promising. Vraylar could potentially be the only approved treatment with 5 different indications or claims. That would be a significant advantage for the product and would make it a potential blockbuster in the marketplace.
Now turning to Slide 15. KYBELLA, our product for submental fat reduction or double chin, is off to a strong start. Since we acquired the product from Kythera in October 2015, we've accelerated the training of targeted accounts. So far, we've trained over 4,000 injectors or almost 50% of the potential user base, and importantly, 3,000 of those trained have already begun ordering.
In the back half of the year, we plan to launch a DTC campaign for KYBELLA. The campaign will greatly enhance the current promotional efforts, which are really laying the groundwork in the creation and development of this new market for injectables. We continue to believe this product has a very strong future potential, and our R&D team is exploring a number of new indications.
We're also continuing to develop and prepare for the launch of the product ex-U.S. in various markets, including the recent launch in Canada, and other international markets later this year and in 2017.
In summary, our commercial business continues to perform well, and we plan to continue to focus on our core therapy area leadership and in leading the industry with launches and notably in double-digit top line growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to David."

In Q1, we continue to make very significant progress, 2016 being another extremely busy year for our R&D team. We expect more than a dozen approvals and regulatory submissions, and we are on track to achieving these milestones.
I'm not going to talk about everything on this slide, but I would like to talk out a few of the key highlights.
First, approvals. We received U.S. approval of Aczone Gel 7.5% for the treatment of acne, providing a new concentration of Aczone for once a day application. And we received FDA approval of Dalvance single dose as an antibiotic for skin and skin structure infections. The single dose allows for delivery of this IV antibiotic in 30 minutes in the emergency department and infusion centers and will provide selected patients the benefit of receiving a complete course of parenteral treatment, which may avoid hospital admissions.
Regarding submissions to regulatory authorities, we submitted an NDA for Oxymetazoline as a treatment for rosacea. Also, we submitted an sNDA for Linzess, low dose, 72 micrograms, for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation or CIC, which provides another important dosing option for physicians and patients and could accelerate the conversion to the OTC market. We also filed an sNDA for a single-handed inserter with optimized packaging for Liletta, our intrauterine device. Our partner, Serenity Pharmaceuticals, submitted and the FDA has accepted an NDA for SER 120, a potential new treatment for Nocturia.
Turning to development programs, earlier this week, we announced positive top line results from Venus I, 1 of 2 Phase III clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of ulipristal acetate for the treatment of uterine fibroids. In the trial, both 10 milligrams and 5 milligram treatment arms met all co-primary and secondary endpoints over placebo, and there were no treatment-related serious adverse events. This is important progress for our Esmya program and for patients. It's estimated that uterine fibroids contribute to more than 200,000 hysterectomies annually in the U.S., so about 1/3 of all hysterectomies performed in the United States. Esmya has the potential to offer the first and only nonsurgical oral treatment option for women suffering from uterine fibroids in the United States. The results are very exciting, and we continue to anticipate the 2017 submission for this product.
In addition, in Q1, together with Gedeon Richter, we initiated Phase III trials for cariprazine in bipolar depression. Two parallel studies will be conducted at approximately 85 sites in the U.S. and Europe. Bipolar depression is one of the most difficult mental illnesses to treat, and response rates vary greatly from 1 patient to another. So it's important to continue to explore new therapies and increase the number of options that are available to help patients manage their symptoms.
Turning to Slide 18. As Brent mentioned, Allergan's R&D pipeline continues to be innovative and productive, and it is continuing to grow through our Open Science model. In 2015, we acquired, in-licensed or entered into collaborations providing more than 10 new pipeline opportunities across our key therapeutic areas. We achieved registration for 4 NMEs in the United States.
In 2016, we have already added 2 additional development programs through Open Science. First, our development and commercialization partnership with Heptares as a broad clinical and preclinical portfolio of muscarinic M1, M4 and dual M1/M4 agonists, including HTL9936 and HTL18318 for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. These muscarinic agonists have the potential to improve symptoms of this disorder, such as cognition and psychosis. Muscarinic agonists have previously been demonstrated to improve cognition in Alzheimer's, but development has been hindered due to off-target side effects. We believe that the Heptares compounds have selectivity advantages, which should result in maintenance of the beneficial effect without the deleterious side effects.
Our acquisition of Topokine adds XAF5, a potential first-in-class treatment for steatoblepharon or more easily known as undereye bags.
We've had a great start to 2016 in R&D. We have many more milestones ahead for the remainder of the year. Our pipeline continues to validate our approach to R&D innovation through our Open Science model.
I thank our more than 2,000 Allergan R&D colleagues around the world for their tremendous work and dedication in driving innovation in achieving these results and for their commitment to the work ahead.
I will now turn the call over to Rob Stewart to briefly discuss a few highlights of the Global Generics business. Rob?"

Turning to Slide 20, our generics business remains a best-in-class asset, and I could not be more proud of the accomplishments of our entire organization. The R&D team continues to achieve an incredible number of filings,",329,"Thanks, David, and good morning. Turning to Slide 20, our generics business remains a best-in-class asset, and I could not be more proud of the accomplishments of our entire organization. The R&D team continues to achieve an incredible number of filings, both in the United States as well as in key international markets. More impressive than the numbers are the quality of the assets filed, including First-to-File applications for generic Abraxane as well as generic Xifaxan. Out of all the First-to-Files published by FDA in 2016, our generic team holds 50% of those accepted. They've done this year-after-year and now have amassed over 98 First-to-File applications pending at the agency. Outside of the United States, we have filed over 1,000 marketing authorizations, so the performance remains strong not only in the U.S. but across the globe.
Price erosion is always a headwind in the generic industry, and 2016 is no different. Companies that invested in developing high-quality assets and invested in their supply chain capability are able to counter price erosion more effectively with new product launches, strong quality and reliable customer service.
This year, we've launched 13 new products in the United States, including generic Crestor last week Internationally, we launched 62 products, including Pemetrexed. We continue to see erosion within -- in expectations around mid-single digits different from the more commoditized generic models out there.
Moving to Slide 21. Our entire organization remains focused on closing the transaction with Teva in June. We are operationally ready to close once we receive the antitrust clearance. We have regulatory approvals in all countries with exception of the U.S., but both teams are working diligently to complete that process. 
In closing, our performance remains strong. Our team continues to execute, and most of our leadership team at Allergan generics is continuing on with Teva, so we expect to see continued strong performance post close.
I'll now turn the call over to Tessa to review our first quarter financial results. Tessa?"

Good morning, everyone. Please note, this discussion of results reflect continuing operations, which we have been reporting since Q3 2015 following the announcement of the divestiture of our Global Generics business to Teva.
Turning to our overall results for the first quarter of 2016 on Slide 23. In the first quarter, we delivered strong year-over-year performance. On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated net revenue for the first quarter 2016 was $3.8 billion, an increase of 48% versus the first quarter of 2015 with branded net revenues increasing 71% to $3.4 billion, primarily driven by the Allergan acquisition.
Sequentially, results were impacted by lower Anda revenues and the impact of anticipated seasonality on top promoted branded products. Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter was 80.1%, an increase of 8.1 percentage points versus first quarter 2015, which reflects our revenue mix following the acquisition of Allergan and the impact from Anda.
While Anda's revenue has declined versus prior year, the loss revenue was at the very low margin. Non-GAAP R&D investment for the quarter was $277 million compared to $172 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP SG&A was relatively flat compared to last quarter at $1.01 billion as a result of continued spending behind our new product launches, including KYBELLA, Viberzi and Vraylar. SG&A increased from the previous year period as a result of the acquisition of Allergan.
Non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was $1.75 billion, an increase of 68% versus the prior year, driven by higher revenues and higher gross margins across our business segments mainly as a result of the Allergan acquisition.
Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased 15% to $3.04 compared to $2.65 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2015. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 9.7% in the quarter. This rate was driven in part by the entire interest expense being included in our continuing operations earnings.
Cash flow from operations for the first quarter was $1.2 billion impacted by recent R&D asset acquisitions and integration expenses. Excluding these items, cash flow from operations was $1.45 billion.
Turning now to our U.S. Brands results on Slide 24. The business continued to deliver strong performance year-over-year. U.S. Brands revenue was $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 27% versus the prior year period, driven by the addition of the Allergan business and strong growth across other key branded products offset by a decline in Namenda IR with the loss of exclusivity for that product and lower revenue of the Asacol/Delzicol franchise.
Adjusted gross margin within U.S. Brands continued to show improvement with margins of approximately 89%, up 0.8 percentage points versus the prior year quarter. SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased to 21.7% versus 23.8% in the year ago quarter, driven by our continued ability to maximize our commercial infrastructure post the Allergan acquisition.
And now turning to Slide 25, our U.S. Medical business. First quarter revenues were $450 million. There's no significant prior year comparison for U.S. Medical as it was acquired as part of the Allergan acquisition in March 2015. On a pro forma basis, U.S. Medical business revenue grew 2 percentage versus prior year and 14%, excluding medical dermatology. Growth was driven by key products, including Botox at 12%, Fillers at 14% and KYBELLA.
Sequentially, revenue was impacted by typical seasonality. Our med derm business net revenue declined versus the prior year on a pro forma basis attributed to a onetime harmonization of allowances versus Q1 2015.
Prescription trends for the products were stable, and we expect strong full year performance from this business driven by Aczone.
First quarter gross margins continued to be stable at 93.1%. Sequentially, SG&A increased slightly as a result of continued KYBELLA promotional spend and sales force expansion related to the launch of this product.
Turning to Slide 26 and our International Brand results. First quarter revenues were $673 million versus $119 million in the prior year period largely due to the Allergan acquisition. Excluding FX on a pro forma basis, international revenues in the first quarter grew 16% driven by continued strong growth of Botox Cosmetics, Fillers and Ozurdex.
Gross margins were 85.3% in the quarter, and segment SG&A increased 2 percentage points to 31.9% versus fourth quarter 2015 due largely to new product launches, including earFold and Constella in various markets.
Turning to our Anda business on Slide 27. Revenues decreased 34% to $365 million versus $554 million in the prior year period, driven by anticipated lower retail business primarily from the CVS acquisition of Target in-store pharmacies. Gross margins increased 2.3 percentage points to 16.9% due to product mix.
Results in all periods include third-party revenues and related expenses of generic products manufactured by the company and distributed through Anda.
Slide 28 details our debt capitalization. We ended the first quarter 2016 with total debt of approximately $42.6 billion and equity of $77.5 billion. At quarter end, our leverage ratio was 4.43x debt to adjusted EBITDA versus 4.07x in the prior year quarter. In April, we made approximately $1.2 billion in debt payments, bringing our adjusted leverage ratio to 4.3x debt to adjusted EBITDA.
We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings.
Following the close of the divestiture of our generics business to Teva, we anticipate paying the remaining term loan balance of approximately $8 billion, which has no prepayment penalties.
Turning to Slide 29. Let me make a few comments on our 2016 guidance, which we are reiterating today. We continue to expect full year net revenues to be approximately $17 billion, including branded business revenues of approximately $15 billion, reflecting double-digit growth, driven by strong sales of key products and new launches in 2016.
Note that revenues will be back-half-weighted as a result of contribution from launches being greater in the second half and typical pharma seasonality. Our revenue forecast reflects lower year-over-year revenue expectations for Anda of approximately $500 million due to the CVS acquisition of Target in-store pharmacy.
We continue to expect our gross margins to remain strong with no material change from current levels in each segment. We continue to anticipate SG&A as a percentage of non-GAAP revenue to be approximately 25% of total net revenue. And we expect the SG&A as a percentage of revenue to trend downwards throughout the year naturally as revenues increase and as we continue to see the impact of our anticipated business simplification activities following the divestiture of our Global Generics business to Teva.
As part of the business simplification plan, we announced a new streamlined senior leadership structure. This new structure will allow us to leverage resources across therapeutic areas and product categories and focus on the key attributes of Growth Pharma, including strong top line revenue growth and operational excellence, which will result in industry-leading operating margins.
R&D spend is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion as a result of the many important late-stage programs advancing in our pipeline, including the commencement of Phase III programs of Rapastinel and Ubrogepant in the back half of this year.
Our tax rate should begin to trend gradually toward normalized levels in the range of 14%, following the close of Teva.
We will provide an updated forecast for 2016, including our expectations for earnings per share following the close of the Teva transaction, most likely on our second quarter earnings call in August.
And now starting on Slide 30, I would like to spend a few minutes on our capital deployment expectations following the close of the Teva transaction. To echo Brent's comments during his introduction, we have great conviction in our Growth Pharma strategy and in the strong future prospects of our company. Our strategy for capital deployment will involve a three-pronged approach with options that are not mutually exclusive with the goal of providing the best value and return to our shareholders.
On Slide 31. The divestiture of our Global Generics business provides us with significant liquidity. As mentioned by Rob previously, Teva has done a great job working through a very intricate process. Working together with our colleagues at Allergan, Teva is ready for a successful day 1 following the close, which is on track for June.
Moving to Slide 32. As you saw this morning, we announced our board's authorization to repurchase up to $10 billion of our own stock following the close of the Teva transaction. We realized that there was no better investment that in our own fast-growing company. We expect to execute $4 billion to $5 billion over a 4- to 6-month period buying as much as prudently possible in open market purchases subject to favorable market conditions. If favorable market conditions persist, we will have more liquidity to consider buying more after satisfying the first part of the program.
In addition to the stock repurchase program, we're also committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings and will pay down approximately $8 billion of debt, following the close of the Teva transaction. This leaves us with significant capacity to invest strategically in the growth of our company.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent for closing remarks."

Now to finish, let me provide some comments on the overall environment. Over the past 6 months, we have seen a particularly tough environment for companies relying on a strategy of highly -- of high leverage and buying low-quality noncore assets, significantly raising prices and drastically cutting lifeblood investments at R&D and commercial infrastructure. When the strategy is flawed, the outcome will be bad even if it takes time. What is left will be high-quality companies that continue to invest in R&D and those that come up with new ways to speed introduction of medical innovations.
The best of those high-quality companies will not rely only on what their teams discover in-house but will also have an open mind and use Open Science to attract innovations from across the entire ecosystem. They will have excellent R&D capabilities to bring those innovations through the rigors of clinical trials and regulatory review around the world. And the most dynamic of those companies will have commercial engines that are resilient, persistent and effective at driving growth.
Allergan is one of those high-quality, dynamic, growing pharmaceutical companies. That is how we are running this company. I am proud of our team doing this great work at every level and honored to be their CEO.
With that, let's open it up to questions. Lisa?"

And I think, we have -- as David pointed out, we did about 10 of those last year. We've done 2 in the first quarter, and they've been, I think, highly productive and potentially very successful for us. So we're going to stick to the knitting of what's created Growth Pharma.

And that's what falls -- that's the foundation of our strategy, Gregg, is that there is so much opportunity for years to continue to bolster our position, and so we will. We like every one of the 7 therapeutic areas that we're in. We think there's huge unmet medical need, huge opportunities to help patients with cures and treatments, and tremendous scientific advance. So we're going to continue to deploy Open Science and opportunities to bring in selected marketed products to bolster our position and become #1 globally in every one of those therapeutic areas. With respect to a new therapeutic area, I think the bar would be high for us to consider de novo, a new therapeutic area. It would have to be an area with strong growth potential, lots of white space and limited competition for assets in that category. There are a few that we evaluate that meet those goals, but we're not focused on doing that at this time.

And then, of course, you can look at it through both the U.S. and international lens. On the therapeutic side, the main drivers continue to be chronic migraine and overactive bladder. We also got a new indication for a neuro rehab condition lower limb spasticity. Just yesterday at the National Urology Meeting in San Diego, there was a head-to-head study published that was actually conducted by the NIH comparing Botox for overactive bladder to InterStim, Medtronic's product, which I think the urology community found very, very instructive. And so that side of the business is very strong. When you turn to the aesthetic side, as you know, it's the leading brand in the world. It has a world-class e-commerce and a customer loyalty program which continues to sustain sales levels. If you think about it geographically, the international business sales for Botox are up almost 20%. And so this is just a rock-solid product. It's got 11 different indications. It's got a unique injection pattern that users understand. It's highly economical. And of course, we have a whole series of new indications in development on both the therapeutic and the aesthetic side. This is a pure demand story."

The original indication for Namzaric included patients who are on the, essentially, the non-fix combination. But it didn't include patients who were only receiving Aricept. And I think for physicians, that's an important indication which we expect to get in the second half of '16. It's clear among neurologists and primary care physicians that Namzaric is superior to anything on the market, whether it's Namenda XR or Aricept. Once we get that indication, we will essentially launch it, and I think you'll see a very different trajectory. Overall, though, whether it's XR or Namzaric, this is a very stable business. And we have a heavy promotional effort. We're are the only one in the category that is active. Neurologists and primary care physicians know that. Our formulary coverage in '16 and in '17 is very, very strong. And I believe that we're going to at least maintain the business that we have today.

Naturally, the formulary coverage for Viberzi is developing, but the majority of the claims for Viberzi during the first several weeks of launch have been approved. And so I'm very encouraged by it. ESI and CVS/Caremark placed Viberzi on formulary in an unrestricted position, which I thought was a terrific development this early in the launch. I expect that over the next 9 to 12 months, the formulary coverage for Viberzi is going to look just like the formulary coverage for Linzess. Speaking about Linzess, it was added to CVS/Caremark formulary; and then in the Part D space, WellCare and Aetna. And those are very significant formulary wins for the product and really shore up 2016 and I think into '17. There's nothing really, in my view, at least as it relates to our product line, that is going to surprise us. We already have a line of sight to 2017. The product set are most important to our growth, are first economical. They are -- most of their growth is coming from volume and single-digit price appreciation. And so I think as long as we continue to communicate with payers and we're predictable and transparent about our future pricing decisions, I think we're going to be able to maintain access across this entire product line. And then as it relates to Vraylar, the product's off to a terrific start. And we know psychiatry very, very well. The feedback that we're getting is exceeding our expectations in terms of the actual experience with the drug. Formulary coverage is developing, as expected. This is a category where, while there are a lot of products, there's a great deal of trial and error, and so health plans are inclined to place the product on formulary, even if it's behind the use of a Seroquel or Risperdal or Zyprexa. And I think that essentially what's going to happen in this category is there'll be a changing of the guard between the older atypicals, the ones I just mentioned, to newer atypicals like Vraylar or even the 2 others, Latuda and Rexulti. Because when you look at the benefit risk ratio of the newer ones, including Vraylar, it's clearly better than what you see with the older antipsychotics. And we're very encouraged by what's going on with Vraylar in the first 8 weeks."

So let me quickly touch on pricing, then ask Bill to comment more specifically, because I think this holds true since you asked, Chris, across the entire portfolio. I think both in the branded and in the generic business, there's been a lot of debate and concern, I think, amongst the community around pricing. I think the reality is when you have innovative products that meet unmet need that can distinguish themselves from older products, pricing really isn't the central issue. It's the ability to commercialize and support your drug with data. On the generics side, it's a very similar story. When you invest in R&D, as Bob Stewart pointed out, when you have a team that has 90 first to files waiting at the FDA, when they go after complex generics and higher-barrier products, you get a better pricing environment. And so I think that the net-net is there are others that have reported weakness in price, but that's because their portfolio lacks innovation. It lacks differentiation. And even in highly innovative areas on the branded side, where there's multiple entries into the same market with very similar mechanisms of action, it drives price down. When you stand alone with your drug, like we do with Viberzi, as an example, you tend to have better pricing dynamics in the environment. It's really that straightforward. Bill, you want to comment specifically on our portfolio?"

I would just first comment that our pricing strategy stems from the intellectual property surrounding these products. And we have exclusivity periods that extends into the -- well into the 2020s, and so we price for the long term. If you want to look at the business overall in the United States, the split was roughly 50-50, with the price appreciation, of course, being in the mid-single digits. If you want to look at those products that are responsible for the majority of our growth in sales, our top almost dozen products, the growth is coming 70% from volume and 30% from price. So it's just a solid business. And again, it goes back to the fact that we're playing for the long term here. These are categories in which we have deep product offerings and strong customer relationships. And it's not -- we don't have a short-term outlook as it relates to price. And we haven't built in anything to the 2016 estimates or even beyond. That's unrealistic given the current market dynamics."

Obviously, there are always puts and takes that come to that. But we have a high degree of confidence that we could do no other deals and deliver that growth over the next few years. I think as we think about tuck-in or stepping-stone deals, as I've been calling them, the intellectual property type of deals or R&D deals are designed to get us into the 2020s, well into the 2020s with double-digit growth because that's the name of our business. It's about new product launches. It's about innovation and looking for medicines that support treatment or cures for unmet need. And so we're going to continue to do that, but we're really thinking about well into the 2020s where we have to support the deal -- our business to get -- to maintain the double-digit growth. I think with respect to our stepping-stone approach to the marketed product, we're really looking for innovative products that we think really do provide a meaningful differentiation in terms of unmet need and that fit neatly into our current therapeutic areas so that we can get more leverage out of our infrastructure, whether that be G&A or selling and marketing. And so that's really how we see -- we have this great commercial engine, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. that we want to continue to leverage and make more of. And frankly, it makes our representatives, it makes our medical affairs teams, it makes our managed care teams more relevant when we talk about those therapeutic areas. So there are multiple reasons why we like our therapeutic area leadership approach with multiple products across an entire -- a broad spectrum. So I think we're in pretty good position to continue to deliver double digit or about 10% top line growth. I don't know, Bill, anything you'd add?"

It's interesting you have spec pharma label, which is how I think most people describe us as purely a creation of many of you in that, that you're a spec pharma analyst, not all of you, but many. And so that's how -- that's a Wall Street designation. We have, a few years ago, designated ourselves as growth pharma, and that's strategically what we want to be known as. We want to be focused on top line growth, therapeutic area leadership and a sustained R&D investment through our Open Science approach. And so that's our strategy. We articulated it now for a few years. I think post Teva, it becomes even clearer that we are a focused, research-based, growth-oriented company, with strong therapeutic area leadership in the 7 areas that we compete in, with strong pipeline to support each of those areas and a commitment to being open-minded around opportunities to enhance our leadership and enhance our growth through a stepping-stone approach to M&A. You want to talk about this, Tessa?"

So I think that perhaps, if you picked up a slight change in tone, it's because as we've gotten more comfortable with the current business that we have and operate, as we've gotten more comfortable with our pipeline, it goes to how I opened the call. We have the best pharmaceutical business in the world. It's growing at pro forma of 10% branded sales. It has a deep pipeline of plus-70 mid- to late-stage pipeline opportunities. We have a strong capital deployment opportunity, both with share buybacks, debt repayment and stepping-stone deals. And we have an investment-grade rated balance sheet. And so we are in, I think, the pole position, and our focus is going to be on operating and running our company and continuing to put up quarter-after-quarter performance. If we can support that or turbo-boost that with opportunistic deals that may come along, like Allergan came along in a very unique situation, then I think this is a bold management team that's going to look at what's in the best interest of our shareholders to drive shareholder value creation, and we'll do it. But the reality is, and I've been saying this for a long time, 99% of our focus, the management team sitting around the phone right now is on running our business. And we're going to continue to put up executional excellence as our top goal. And we're going to continue to support the business with growth-oriented steppingstone deals.

We had a big week last week that was highlighted by the completion of the divestiture of our Global Generics business to Teva. With its completion, and the announcement of our plans to self our Anda Distribution, Allergan has taken major steps toward our goal of being a branded Growth Pharma leader. 
I am proud of the people who worked so hard for 12 months to make this divestiture a reality, and I'm even more proud that the Allergan team has remained so focused on execution during this time. You can see proof of that focus in the results we are announcing today. 
Turning to Slide 5. 2016 has been a year of tremendous positive transition for Allergan, and we are well-positioned to continue to deliver strong results powered by our Growth Pharma model. This model is built around 5 key elements: Top line growth, with the goal of double-digit growth; category leadership in each of our 7 therapeutic areas; customer intimacy; open science R&D to fuel innovation; and operational excellence. And our team in successfully executing on each of these elements. 
Turning to Slide 6. Top line sales of the branded business came in at $3.7 billion, up more than 9% compared to prior year, excluding NAMENDA IR, divestitures and FX. And the performance was broad-based, with strong results from all aspects of our business. Six of our most important brands grew double digits globally, excluding FX, including Botox, up 16%, RESTASIS up 21%, LINZESS up 37%, our family of Fillers, up 18%; [ph], up 33%; and LO LOESTRIN, up 28%. I'm a very pleased and impressed with this performance. 
A key attribute of our team is large excellence as demonstrated by the strong start for [ph], VRAYLAR and KYBELLA. We are also building on our therapeutic areas and 4 of the 7 grew by more than 15% this quarter. For example, GI was up 19%, Women's Health was up 34%, meanwhile, eye care, our largest therapeutic area was up 10% and Medical Aesthetics, excluding medical dermatology, was up 14%. 
I'm very impressed with what our commercial teams continue to do everyday to make Allergan the most dynamic and exciting company in our industry. Bill will talk more about the brand performance, recent launches and our international business in just a moment. 
On Slide 7. Strong top line performance and our continued focus on operational excellence and business simplification resulted in non-GAAP EPS of $3.35, which now excludes the results of Anda, our distribution business. 
For us, operational excellence is all about focusing on doing the little things very well to enable the organization to become more efficient, more productive and more profitable. With the creation of Rob Stewart's role as Chief Operating Officer, we have renewed energy on harmonizing systems and processes throughout the company and making targeted investments to upgrade critical capabilities. 
And our Open Science R&D model is working to drive innovation across each of our 7 therapeutic areas. Just this year, our R&D team has succeeded in getting approval for 13 major pharma and device products and 9 major submissions. David will provide more details later in the presentation. 
Open Science provides us with a compelling competitive strategic advantage as evidenced by our 65-plus mid- to late-stage development programs, many of which could be game-changing treatments. 
Turning to capital allocation on Slide 8. Our reloaded balance sheet provides us with significant flexibility to deploy capital to shareholders, including investing in our share repurchase program, debt repayment and additional investments in growth opportunities. 
We'll start with about $5 billion in share repurchase program during the rest of 2016, finding as much as prudently possible in the open market. As we have said before, if favorable market conditions persist, we had the capacity to consider buying additional $5 billion under the $10 billion authorization provided by our Board of Directors. 
In addition to the share repurchase program, we had pay down debt, which should reinforce our investment-grade credit ratings. Tessa will provide additional details during her presentation. Even with of those plans, we preserve capacity of more than $20 billion to invest for growth and acquire additional steppingstone assets to keep our pipeline full and provide fuel for sustainable top line growth in our therapeutic areas. Our goal is to maximize shareholder value over the long term. 
Now let me hand the call over to Bill Meury, our Chief Commercial Officer."

Turning to Slide 10, we had a strong quarter and our focus on category leadership is producing results, overall demand for products is strong and implementation metrics on launch plant are high, which is a credit to",1451,"Thanks, Brent. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 10, we had a strong quarter and our focus on category leadership is producing results, overall demand for products is strong and implementation metrics on launch plant are high, which is a credit to our sales and marketing teams, domestically and internationally.  
Sales for 6 or 7 therapeutic areas increased at a high single-digit or double-digit rate versus prior year in the second quarter, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and divestitures. 
In eye care, sales increased by 10%, powered by continued strength in RESTASIS and [ph]. Sales from RESTASIS increased by 21% based on strong physician and consumer promotion and widespread formulary coverage. 
[ph] continue to deliver strong results globally with 30% growth in the United States and 34% growth in international markets, driven by its expanded diabetic macular edema labeled. 
In Aesthetics, sales increased by 14%, driven by continued strong performance from Botox and Fillers. In fact, Botox had its strongest quarter in the United States in the last 2 years. Additionally, we've laid a strong foundation to drive demand in the second half of the year and in 2017 as well. The prospects for this business and the market dynamics in the future are excellent, more on that shortly. In GI, LINZESS, our flagship product, continued to produce outstanding results come, 37% year-over-year, and importantly, VIBERZI is off to a strong start. Now in it's second  full quarter post launch, prescriptions and [indiscernible] are climbing at a high rate consistently week-over-week. 
And finally, we continue to see some growth in our Women's Health, urology and anti-infectives businesses. 
On Slide 11, you can see the demand for LINZESS and VIBERZI is very strong for both products, growth has and will continue to be fueled by conversion of the OTC market, increased use by both gastroenterologist and primary care physicians and market-leading promotion and formulary coverage. 
For VIBERZI, our newest GI product, the number of prescribers doubled in the second quarter and physician feedback has been positive. Based on sales, VIBERZI is trending at approximately 90% of LINZESS during the same time period post launch. 
Turning to Slide 12. In KYBELLA, which is indicated for submental fat reduction or double chin. Strategically, KYBELLA expands our efficient injectable product line, which includes Botox and our Fillers. KYBELLA pioneers a new category of facial injectables. It will serve as a gateway to the lower phase and will open up an entirely new market of consumers, including males. 
And finally, KYBELLA will serve as a true practice builder for our customers, including dermatologists and plastic surgeons. We've organized a launch into 2 phases. We successfully completed the first phase, training more than 9,000 or 90% of the key injector base in the United States. We're exactly where we need to be in terms of physician education and training. We're now in the process of kicking off Phase II, where we are creating awareness and demand among consumers, which will be boosted by DTC campaign beginning this month. 
This product is an important growth of a driver and will fortify our leadership position in aesthetic medicine. Our R&D team is working on developing additional new aesthetic and the therapeutic indications for a villa, which when added to the submental fat, indication could make KYBELLA as much as Botox cosmetic over time. 
Turning to Slide 13, in VRAYLAR. VRAYLAR was launched in mid-March in the United States for schizophrenia and mania. Interest by psychiatrist and select primary care physicians is very high. We've had multiple educational events hwere the attendants reached approximately 100 physicians. We're very encouraged by what we're seeing and hearing right now. Approximately 4,000 psychiatrists have used VRAYLAR and we expect that number to climb to 10,000 by year-end. 
Based on solid performance so far, we're expanding our sales force coverage of hospitals and mental health facilities. As you can see on the slide, prescription levels for VRAYLAR are comparable to 2 recent and successfully launched atypical antipsychotics, [ph] and Rexulti. We do see a changing of the guard overtime in this market with new atypical replacing the older ones. The future of VRAYLAR can be described as nothing as promising. 
Turning to Slide 14, in our Eye Care franchise. We are continuing to add to our position as a leading Eye Care company with the dry eye and glaucoma. We expect to launch Restasis MDPF in the fourth quarter and then True Tear, which is our nasal neuro stimulator in the first quarter of 2017. So we have 2 new products for dry eye to complement Restasis and our marketed artificial tear product line. Both launches will be supported by our largest sales force, ophthalmologists and optometrists and extensive consumer advertising and education. 
The prospects for growth to dry eye market are excellent. The condition is receiving more attention due to its impact on vision, post op outcomes and quality of life. It's widely recognized, whether it's mild or site threatening Brittany, dry eye should be treated more aggressively. 
Allergan is fully committed to this area and with multiple products on the market and in development. In terms of glaucoma, we have our [indiscernible] which is minimally invasive procedure to lower IOP. In fact, it may turn out to be the most effective pressure lowering agent on the market. Glaucoma is on the verge of a transformation. For decades, eye drop therapy has been the standard of care. Looking forward, minimally invasive filtering or surgical procedures will reduce or limit the need for eye drops, which are effective but, of course, associated with low compliance rates. 
XEN was recently launched in 10 international markets and look forward to its potential approval and launch in the United States next year. 
Turning to Slide 15, our international business. Sales in our international business totaled more than $750 million in the second quarter, a 10% increase versus prior year. 
Western Europe is our largest region, and we expect Asia Pacific will be our leading international growth contributor. Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care anchor our business internationally. Sales for our Medical Aesthetics business increased at a double-digit rate in every international region. 
Sales for Botox in our Fillers line specifically were up 13% and 23%, respectively. The Medical Aesthetics market is poised for major expansion over the next several years for a number of reasons. First, attitudes towards Aesthetics are changing around the world. Awareness and Demand are rising from Europe to Asia Pacific to Latin America. Second, more physicians are practicing aesthetic medicine everyday. In fact, I was in Shanghai last month meeting with our Asia Pacific country managers and customers and the interest and enthusiasm for our products was remarkable. And finally, disposable incomes and purchasing power are climbing. Aspirational become our global business, our Medical Aesthetics business could double over time. 
In terms of eye care, glaucoma is our largest product line and retina is the fastest growing. In glaucoma, we are launching a multidose preservative formulation of GANFORT and our new surgical procedure, XEN, will be launched in more than 20 countries over the next 2 years. 
In retina, sales for Ozurdex, which is a dexamethasone implant, were up 34% in the second quarter. This product has been a big commercial success internationally and it's being used as an alternative to anti-VEGF therapy for diabetic macular edema. Ozurdex is a very strong following in Western Europe and in 2017, we will expand geographically with launches in Brazil and Australia. 
On Slide 16, we look ahead for our commercial business. Our strategy is sound. New launches are our focus and will continue to drive growth across our therapeutic areas. In 2016, we'll continue to focus our efforts in supporting the launches of VIBERZI, VRAYLAR and KYBELLA, which we talked about. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we will launch not only Restasis MDPF, which I mentioned earlier but also [indiscernible] which is of fixed dose combination of BYSTOLIC and [ph], LINZESS, 72-microgram, a low dose formulation of LINZESS, which is designed to fill the written version of the OTC category and a new indication for NAMZARIC, which is on to increase the use of combination therapy in the Alzheimer's category. 
Finally, early commercialization activities are underway to support our 2017 launches. XEN, True Tear formally known as Oculeve and Oxymetazoline for spatial, which we're now calling [ph]. 
Internationally, we're creating a GI foothold in Europe with the launches of [ph] and [ph], which is [ph] in the United States. We'll continue to invest behind them leverage our platform of capabilities, which includes highly effective physician and consumer e-commerce programs and our well-trained and customized field force. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David."

Turning to Slide 18, in our near-term development pipeline, we have continued to deliver on our strong track record of productivity. 
Year-to-date, we have achieved 13 major pharma and device approvals. We've also achieved 9 major regulatory submissions with 3 major submissions in Q2. A very strong first half of 2016 delivered by our great R&D team with Allergan. I'm not going to talk everything on this slide, but I would like to talk about a few of our Q2 highlights. Approvals. We obtain approvals globally to further enhance our Medical Aesthetics franchise, including JUVÉDERM VOLBELLA for lip augmentation and correction of perioral lines in adults in the U.S. The Japanese regulatory authorities approved the use of Botox [indiscernible] for crow's feet lines. We also received a CE marking in the European Union for JUVEDERM containing lidocaine. 
For cardiovascular franchise, we're received FDA approval for BYVALSON, a combination of [ph] and [ph] for the treatment of hypertension. In CNS, along with partners Pharmaceutical, we received approval for a new expanded label for NAMZARIC. This expanded label with lower dose combination allows patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's who are currently stabilized on Aricept to start combination therapy directly with NAMZARIC. 
Regarding submissions. The FDA accepted for review our sNDA for the 72-microgram dose [ph], for use in the treatment of adults with chronic idiopathic constipation. The FDA accepted our 510(k) notification for the XEN glaucoma, that Bill mentioned in his presentation. 
We filed an application with the FDA for True Tear, to increase natural tear production in patients with dry eye disease. Our ultimate goal is to show improvement in both of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease with this device. 
We initiated a Phase IIa proof of concept study for Setipiprant, our CH2 antagonist for enhancement of scalp har growth. 
Turning to Slide 19, I'm looking ahead towards near-term pipeline highlight. We have a robust stream of approvals, submissions and development milestones for the remainder of 2016 and 2017. Again, I won't go cover everything on this slide but I do want to mention a few highlights. 
First, upcoming approvals. In Medical Aesthetics, we expect to receive approval in many countries in the EU for KYBELLA, known as BELKYRA internationally in the second half of this year. This is one of several international approvals expected in 2016 and 2017 for this agent. Following FDA acceptance of our NDA for [ph], for the topical treatment of in adults, we anticipate approval early next year. 
In Eye Care, we have addressed questions from the FDA and resubmitted our NDA for RESTASIS and MDPF, and we anticipate approval in the fourth quarter of 2016. As a reminder, the Restasis MDPF bottle, first-of-its-kind container with patented unidirectional falls and air filter technology. Following acceptance of our submissions by FDA, we also expect to receive approval for True Tear in 2017, as Bill mentioned earlier. 
And in GI, we expect to receive approval for our 72-microgram formulation of LINZESS for CIC patients. 
Submissions. In Medical Aesthetics, we will continue to submit additional applications worldwide for Botox and KYBELLA. Also we expect to announce top line Phase III results and submit an NDA for [ph], our next-generation oral tetracycline for acne in 2017. Remember that this program would put us into a new acne category or antibiotics. It may offer patients a lower GI side effect profile, a more flexible dosing than other products currently on the market. 
In CNS, we plan to submit an NDA for Semprana, an inhalable by hydro treatment for acute migraine later this year. We have a great team working in this project and they have resolve the issues raised by the FDA during their previews review. We now have to tackle issues to really to the scale up and manufacturability. 
Development milestones. In Medical Aesthetics, we are set to begin a Phase III study for Latanoprost in suboptimal fact in 2017. In Eye Care, enrollment in our Phase III programs for Abicipar is going very well. It's on track to completion in the second half of 2017. 
Excitement is high regarding our [ph] program. The challenge has remain regarding the timing of the enrollment of our Phase III studies, utilizing both drops and an implant. We now expect to complete enrollment for this study in late 2017. 
In CNS, we have a number of updates for our development programs. Allergan and Gedeon Richter recently provided an update on our cariprazine program. The top line results from our latest Phase III study evaluating the safety and efficacy of cariprazine, as adjunctive therapy to antidepressants in major depressive disorder, did not meet the primary endpoint. Not uncommon for these types of trials to be negative or to fail. Antidepressants in the market today have failed 1 or more clinical trials in the quest to get the 2 requisite positive clinical studies required for approval. 
Remember, we have already completed 1 positive trial in this indication. Both companies have agreed to move forward with additional Phase III evaluation and MDD to support a potential indication. 
We've also continued positive discussions with the FDA on an sNDA submission for an indication of prevention of recurrence in patients with schizophrenia, where we have the necessary positive study, and we continue to work with the FDA on the regulatory path forward, the potential indication, the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. All in all, this represents important progress towards additional indications for cariprazine for the treatment of patients with these conditions. 
Regarding our [ph] agonist development programs with Heptares, we expect to enter Phase I clinical studies in 2017. These compounds are novel, subdebt selective, muscarinic receptor agonist and development for the treatment of the range of CNS disorders with a potential upside of tolerability and a more pronounced effect compared with available agents. 
Finally, our oral CGRP programs. As promised, we have been initiated a Phase III trial for our lead compound, [ph], for the acute treatment of migraine. 
[ph], the second compound, they migraine prophylaxis, will enter Phase IIb trials in the second half of this year. At I've outline, the first half of 2016 has marked tremendous results to our R&D team. There are many more and more milestones ahead of as for the remainder of the year and into 2017. The breath of our pipeline match with our therapeutic area leadership validates our Open Science approach to innovation. 
As always, I thank our global R&D team for their outstanding work and dedication in driving innovation and achieving these results and for their commitment to the work ahead for the patients we serve. 
Now I will turn the call over to Tessa."
36478,374033817,1029543,"Allergan plc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2016",2016-08-08,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Please note that this discussion of financial results reflect continuing operations which now excludes both the Global Generics business, which was sold to Teva on August 2, as well as the Anda Distribution business,",1218,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Please note that this discussion of financial results reflect continuing operations which now excludes both the Global Generics business, which was sold to Teva on August 2, as well as the Anda Distribution business, of which we announced the sale to Teva on August 3. All prior periods in this presentation reflect the exclusion of Anda and the Generics business as well. 
Turning to our overall results for the second quarter of 2016 on Slide 21. In the second quarter, we delivered strong year-over-year performance. On a GAAP basis, continuing operations net revenues, which now exclude Anda Distribution were $3.7 billion, a 2% increase versus prior year, reflecting strong growth of key products and the impact of the loss of exclusivity for NAMENDA IR in July 2015. Excluding NAMENDA IR, divestitures and FX revenues increased 9.3%. Gross margin for the second quarter was very strong at 88%. Operating margins were also very strong exceeding 50%. Operating margins declined versus last year as a result of an increase in R&D, reflecting the increased number of Phase III programs underway and an increase in SG&A. 
The increase in SG&A was primarily driven by higher selling and marketing expenses related to the 3 major ongoing launches this year, VIIBRYD, KYBELLA and VRAYLAR. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share forecast of $3.35 reflect the loss of exclusivity of NAMENDA IR when compared with the second quarter of 2015. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 7.1% in the quarter. This rate remains slow as the result of our entire interest expense being allocated to continuing operations earnings. The divestiture of Anda, which is a U.S. company also further reduce the tax rate for continuing operations. 
Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $1.4 billion, excluding adjustments, primarily recent R&D acquisitions and integration expenses, cash flow from operations was $1.85 billion. 
The GAAP equivalent to our forecast metrics can be found in our earnings release issued this morning and posted on our website. 
Turning now to our U.S. specialized therapeutics results on Slide 22. The business continued to deliver strong performance year-over-year. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics revenue was $1.5 billion for the quarter, up 11% versus the prior-year period, driven by strong growth across Medical Aesthetics of 15%, Eye Care of 10% and strong growth in Botox therapeutics of 17%. 
Key products performed well with Botox, RESTASIS, Fillers and the launch of KYBELLA as key contributors to the strong performance. Gross margin remained a high at approximately 95%. 
SG&A increased as a result of an increase in promotion efforts, including sales force expansion and launch costs related to KYBELLA. 
Turning to Slide 23. Our U.S. general medicine business second quarter revenues was $1.45 billion, reflecting the loss of $229 million of sales of NAMENDA IR, which lost exclusivity last year. 
Adjusting for this impact, sales grew 5%, driven by our strength in our key products, including LINZESS and LO LOESTRIN and new product launches of VIBERZI and VRAYLAR. Second quarter gross margins continued to be stable at approximately 85%. 
Sequentially, SG&A increased slightly as a result of VIBERZI and VRAYLAR promotional spend and sales force expansion related to these launches. 
Turning to Slide 24 in our International Brands results. Second quarter revenues were $757 million versus $717 million in the prior-year period. Excluding FX, international revenues in the second quarter grew 10%, driven by continued the strong growth of Botox, Fillers and Eye Care, driven by strong sales of Ozurdex. 
Gross margins were 84.8% in the second quarter. Segment SG&A was $238 million, up 3% versus prior year, driven by new product launches, including BELKYRA or KYBELLA in the U.S., XEN, earFold and Constella. 
Contribution margins improved versus prior year quarter from 52.2% to 53.4% reflecting continued strong sales growth. 
Turning to Slide 25, which details our debt capitalization. We have strengthened our balance sheet significantly with a continued paydown of debt following the close of the NAMENDA transaction. 
Since Q1, and following the close of the sale of our Generics business to Teva, we reduced our total debt position by approximately $9 billion in line with our previous commitment. As a result, all of our outstanding term loans have been fully paid off. We also terminated our $1 billion revolving credit facility, and we expect to renew this facility in the next few weeks. 
We continue to believe that there is no better investment than in our own fast-growing company. We plan to commence our share repurchase very shortly and we plan to execute $5 billion by the end of the year, buying as much as prudently possible in open market purchases subject to favorable market conditions. 
Note that the Allergan board has authorized up to $10 billion of share repurchases, and we expect to provide an update on our share repurchases in our next earnings release. 
Turning to Slide 26. Let me make a few comments on our 2016 full year guidance. We are refining our guidance to now include EPS as well as removing Anda. We expect full year 2016 branded revenues to be $14.75 billion to $15 billion. Note that reported that revenues will be lower by approximately $100 million reflecting the impact of our branded products, which are sold through Anda and are required to be accounted for in discontinued operations. 
Note that revenues will be back half weighted as a result of contribution from launches being greater in the second half and typical pharma seasonality. Our gross margins will remain strong at approximately 88.5%. We expects a non-GAAP SG&A -- actually, our gross margins will remain strong at approximately 89%. We expect non-GAAP SG&A of approximately $4 billion, reflecting our investment in new product launches and continued prudent G&A spent. Non-GAAP R&D spend is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion as a result of the many important late-stage programs advancing in our pipeline, including the commencement of Phase III programs of Rapastinel and [ph]. 
We expect interest expense in the range of $1.3 billion or even slightly lower. Attach rate for the full year is anticipated to be approximately 9%. Attach rate should begin to trend upward toward normalized levels in 2017. 
Our share count of 413 million shares includes approximately $5 billion in share repurchases that we plan to execute throughout the remainder of the year. 
Turning to Slide 27. I am proud of our accomplishments as a growth-oriented pure-branded company, the actions that we have taken this year to simplify our business, combined with strong revenue performance, have actually uncovered our industry-leading profitability as shown on the chart. 
We will continue to focus on strong top line growth as we look to the future. Besides revenue growth and cash generation, the 2 additional financial metrics that we watch very closely our gross margin and operating margins. Our goal is to remain among the leaders in the industry in both gross margins in the 88% range and operating margin so we are trending in the range of 53%. Our operating margins will continue to expand as we fully realize the potential of our growing revenues while investing in selling and marketing and maintaining an efficient G&A base. 
This should translate into strong cash flow generation, which will further maximize shareholder value. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent for closing remarks."

I do think that the indication for NAMZARIC for new patients is going to make a difference. I also believe that the sequencing of IR to XR to NAMZARIC is important and some time has passed since we transition from IR to XR, which, I think, is important. But in terms of looking forward, I think, NAMZARIC could expand the use of combination therapy in the Alzheimer's category because it's superior to XR. We're going to launch a DTC campaign. That's the aim. I would say at minimum though. It's going to sure up this business for that several years so that we have something that's solidly trading in this $750 million to $800 million year each."

Obviously, when you sell a business, it is dilutive for both top and bottom line, and we've been a few of those veins and arteries always difficult for companies to do. But for us, strategically, I think, prudently it was the right move at the right time, and I think with be very good deals to get us a very. I think with respect to the future, our goal, our aspiration is to continue to lead in top line growth. We are, I think, putting up arguably among the best, if not the best top line growth. That growth is broad-based. That growth is across all our product lines, all of forward most important products are growing faster than the top line average. And so we are on incredibly strong position from a sales perspective. Obviously, on an EPS basis, we hope to see leverage on the bottom line. We continued to lead as Tessa said in both gross margins and operating margins. You'll see that fleet through to the bottom line. You will see that strengthen as we do things like buyback $5 billion to $10 billion worth of stock, as we continue to do deals that are growth-oriented, both equity of deals and some pipeline deals to make sure that we do it. But that's a phase, the bottom line is our goal.

I'll start with the most important 1 right now when you think about the second half the year and that's RESTASIS. We increased the size of our sales force by 20%, essentially adding 60 more representatives. We increase the investment in direct-to-consumer advertising. The sampling program, both on Restasis as well as our artificial tears have been increased. Our coverage of ophthalmology and optometry will be greater in the second half the year that it was in the first half of the year. We've up formulary coverage and virtually every health plan across the country, both on the commercial and the Part D side. And those steps were taken to successfully launch of Restasis MDPF, of course, we're going to have an active company in the category in [ph]. We're also going to launch True Tear, which is a nasal neurostimulator for dry eye. And so I like the way the second half of the year is going to look for Restasis particularly given the incremental level of investment. As you know, we have a very highly trained experienced sales force with greater relationships in both areas of Eye Care, which is ophthalmology and optometry. There, of course, in addition to Restasis, is there's a big focus on a VIBERZI, VRAYLAR and KYBELLA and VIBERZI looks and those just like LINZESS, that's on OTC conversion play the VRAYLAR is exceeding our expectations. There is a response that have gotten from psychiatrists is exceptional. We're getting used across a broad range of patients, the prescriber base is climbing. And then, of course, we have KYBELLA, and we spent to the first 6 months training injectors. It's a very different than a pharmaceutical like VIBERZI or VRAYLAR. I would describe the first day of launch for [ph] at September 1. We'll turn on consumer advertising come all of our e-commerce programs are now covering KYBELLA, and I would expect significant step-up in sales on a quarterly basis for KYBELLA the second half of the year. It's a great expansion of our injectable product line pitted gets us to the lower face. It's opens up to a certain extent, the middle market. Those are really the priorities, of course. Botox therapeutics is growing at a double-digit rate, driven by migraine. We've only penetrated 6% of that market. I think long-term, it's going to be a growth driver even in 2018 when CGRP is launched. I hope that answers your question."

For the past years, we have been very focused on steppingstone deals where it's not like a new strategy despite our image perhaps or reputation in the market. We have been very focused on that, only acting on 1 transformational deal because it was a once in a corporate lifetime situation. I guess to the extent we look at large-cap universe or the transformational set, we ran that analyses during our stock buyback and believe that our stock is the most compelling investment we can make versus doing those types of deals. Now we've always been a flexible, nimble team. If some extraordinary situation presented itself, we would obviously evaluate it very closely. And if we filed it's in our shareholders' best interest long-term, it's conceivable we can do that.

I think what's happening this environment with all the media and voice coming from the political season and everything else is that the payors are definitely involved in a little bit and so they are being more aggressive. I think where they're having their biggest success is where there's great competition or low innovation. And as you know, we have transitioned to a very different model with our recent launches and our pipeline, and I think we have said this many times, we think pricing our pipeline is going to be infinitely easier than pricing our current products, and we've done very well pricing our current products. So what I characterize the environment as tougher in kind of the need to are highly competitive status. There are 4 drugs launching with relatively similar mechanisms and indications over a 12-month period. Pricing dynamics are more challenging than they have been. If you're launching something like even the VIBERZI, where we can get price that's almost 3x the price of LINZESS because it's a 1 of 1 and novel mechanism, it's still pretty straightforward.

When it comes to our commercial and Part D mix, it's well-balanced.

We both, I think, strongly believe that the opportunity in market like in China for cash business is massive. Now we are growing incredibly strong but off of a relatively modest pace. So we need to look at is there something more we can do there? Now the investment, I think, will be manageable.

So I did think that should change anyway you think about but the investment shouldn't change anyway if you think about it but rather we want to make sure that we continue to put up that growth.

We had a big week last week that was highlighted by the completion of the divestiture of our Global Generics business to Teva. With its completion and the announcement of our plans to sell our Anda Distribution Business, Allergan has taken major steps toward our goal of being a branded Growth Pharma leader. 
I am proud of the people who worked so hard for 12 months to make this divestiture a reality, and I'm even more proud that the Allergan team has remained so focused on execution during this time. You can see proof of that focus in the results we are announcing today. 
Turning to Slide 5. 2016 has been a year of tremendous positive transition for Allergan, and we are well-positioned to continue to deliver strong results powered by our Growth Pharma model. This model is built around 5 key elements: Top line growth, with a goal of double-digit growth; category leadership in each of our 7 therapeutic areas; customer intimacy; open science R&D to fuel innovation; and operational excellence. And our team is successfully executing on each of these elements. 
Turning to Slide 6. Top line sales of the branded business came in at $3.7 billion, up more than 9% compared to prior year, excluding Namenda IR, divestitures and FX. And the performance was broad-based with strong results from all aspects of our business. Six of our most important brands grew double digits globally, excluding FX, including Botox, up 16%, RESTASIS up 21%, Linzess up 37%, our family of Fillers, up 18%; Ozurdex, up 33%; and Lo Loestrin, up 28%. I'm very pleased and impressed with this performance. 
A key attribute of our team is large excellence as demonstrated by the strong start for Viberzi, Vraylar and Kybella. We are also building on our therapeutic areas and 4 of the 7 grew by more than 15% this quarter. For example, GI was up 19%, Women's Health was up 34%, meanwhile, eye care, our largest therapeutic area was up 10% and Medical Aesthetics, excluding medical dermatology, was up 14%. 
I'm very impressed with what our commercial teams continue to do everyday to make Allergan the most dynamic and exciting company in our industry. Bill will talk more about the brand performance, recent launches and our international business in just a moment. 
On Slide 7. Strong top line performance and our continued focus on operational excellence and business simplification resulted in non-GAAP EPS of $3.35, which now excludes the results of Anda, our distribution business. 
For us, operational excellence is all about focusing on doing the little things very well to enable the organization to become more efficient, more productive and more profitable. With the creation of Rob Stewart's role as Chief Operating Officer, we have renewed energy on harmonizing systems and processes throughout the company and making targeted investments to upgrade critical capabilities. 
And our Open Science R&D model is working to drive innovation across each of our 7 therapeutic areas. Just this year, our R&D team has succeeded in gaining approval for 13 major pharma and device products and 9 major submissions. David will provide more details later in the presentation. 
Open Science provides us with a compelling, competitive, strategic advantage as evidenced by our 65-plus mid- to late-stage development programs, many of which could be game-changing treatments. 
Turning to capital allocation on Slide 8. Our reloaded balance sheet provides us with significant flexibility to deploy capital to shareholders, including investing in our share repurchase program, debt repayment and additional investments in growth opportunities. 
We'll start with about $5 billion in share repurchase program during the rest of 2016, finding as much as prudently possible in the open market. As we have said before, if favorable market conditions persist, we have the capacity to consider buying the additional $5 billion under the $10 billion authorization provided by our Board of Directors. 
In addition to the share repurchase program, we had pay down debt, which should reinforce our investment-grade credit ratings. Tessa will provide additional details during her presentation. Even with those plans, we preserve capacity of more than $20 billion to invest for growth and acquire additional steppingstone assets to keep our pipeline full and provide fuel for sustainable top line growth in our therapeutic areas. Our goal is to maximize shareholder value over the long-term. 
Now let me hand the call over to Bill Meury, our Chief Commercial Officer."

Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 10. We had a strong quarter and our focus on category leadership is producing results, overall demand for our products is strong and implementation metrics on launch plans are high, which is a credit to our sales and marketing teams, domestically and internationally. 
Sales for 6 or 7 therapeutic areas increased at a high single-digit or double-digit rate versus prior year in the second quarter, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and divestitures. 
In eye care, sales increased by 10%, powered by continued strength in RESTASIS and Ozurdex. Sales for RESTASIS increased by 21% based on strong physician and consumer promotion and widespread formulary coverage. 
Ozurdex continued to deliver strong results globally with 30% growth in the United States and 34% growth in international markets, driven by its expanded diabetic macular edema label. 
In Aesthetics, sales increased by 14%, driven by continued strong performance from Botox and Fillers. In fact, Botox had its strongest quarter in the United States in the last 2 years. Additionally, we've laid a strong foundation to drive demand in the second half of the year and in 2017 as well. The prospects for this business and the market dynamics in the future are excellent, more on that shortly. In GI, Linzess, our flagship product, continued to produce outstanding results, up 37%, year-over-year, and importantly, Viberzi is off to a strong start. Now in it's second full quarter postlaunch, prescriptions and writers are climbing at a high rate consistently week-over-week. 
And finally, we continue to see some growth in our Women's Health, urology and anti-infective businesses. 
On Slide 11, you can see the demand for Linzess and Viberzi is very strong. For both products, growth has and will continue to be fueled by conversion of the OTC market, increased use by both gastroenterologist and primary care physicians and market-leading promotion and formulary coverage. 
For Viberzi, our newest GI product, the number of prescribers doubled in the second quarter and physician feedback has been positive. Based on sales, Viberzi is trending at approximately 90% of Linzess during the same time period, postlaunch. 
Turning to Slide 12, on KYBELLA, which is indicated for submental fat reduction or double chin. Strategically, KYBELLA expands our facial injectable product line, which includes Botox and our Fillers. KYBELLA pioneers a new category of facial injectables. It will serve as a gateway to the lower face and will open up an entirely new market of consumers, including males. 
And finally, KYBELLA will serve as a true practice builder for our customers, including dermatologists and plastic surgeons. We've organized a launch into 2 phases. We successfully completed the first phase, training more than 9,000 or 90% of the key injector base in the United States. We're exactly where we need to be in terms of physician education and training. We're now in the process of kicking off Phase II, where we are creating awareness and demand among consumers, which will be boosted by our DTC campaign beginning this month. 
This product is an important growth driver and will fortify our leadership position in aesthetic medicine. Our R&D team is working on developing additional new aesthetic and therapeutic indications for KYBELLA, which when added to the submental fat, indication could make KYBELLA as large as Botox cosmetic over time. 
Turning to Slide 13, and Vraylar. Vraylar was launched in mid-March in the United States for schizophrenia and mania. Interest by psychiatrist and select primary care physicians is very high. We've had multiple educational events where the attendants reached approximately 100 physicians. We're very encouraged by what we're seeing and hearing right now. Approximately 4,000 psychiatrists have used Vraylar, and we expect that number to climb to 10,000 by year-end. 
Based on solid performance so far, we're expanding our sales force coverage of hospitals and mental health facilities. As you can see on the slide, prescription levels for Vraylar are comparable to 2 recent and successfully launched atypical antipsychotics, Latuda and Rexulti. We do see a changing of the guard over time in this market with new atypicals replacing the older ones. The future of Vraylar can be described as nothing but very promising. 
Turning to Slide 14, in our Eye Care franchise. We are continuing to add to our position as a leading Eye Care company with innovative products for dry eye and glaucoma. We expect to launch Restasis MDPF in the fourth quarter and then True Tear, which is a nasal neuro stimulator in the first quarter of 2017. So we have 2 new products for dry eye to complement Restasis and our marketed artificial tear product line. Both launches will be supported by our largest sales force, overt ophthalmologists and optometrists and extensive consumer advertising and education. 
The prospects for growth of dry eye market are excellent. The condition is receiving more attention due to its impact on vision, postop outcomes and quality of life. It's widely recognized, whether it's mild or sight threatening, dry eye should be treated more aggressively. 
Allergan is fully committed to this area and with multiple products on the market and in development. In terms of glaucoma, we have our XEN Gel Stent which is a minimally invasive procedure to lower IOP. In fact, it may turn out to be the most effective new pressure lowering agent on the market. Glaucoma is on the verge of a transformation. For decades, eye drop therapy has been the standard of care. Looking forward, minimally-invasive filtering or surgical procedures will reduce or eliminate the need for eye drops, which are effective but are, of course, associated with low compliance rates. 
XEN was recently launched in 10 international markets, and we look forward to its potential approval and launch in the United States next year. 
Turning to Slide 15, our international business. Sales in our international business totaled more than $750 million in the second quarter, a 10% increase versus prior year. 
Western Europe is our largest region, and we expect Asia Pacific will be our leading international growth contributor. Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care anchor our business internationally. Sales for our Medical Aesthetics business increased at a double-digit rate in every international region. 
Sales for Botox and our Fillers line specifically were up 13% and 23%, respectively. The Medical Aesthetics market is poised for major expansion over the next several years for a number of reasons: First, attitudes toward Aesthetics are changing around the world. Awareness and demand is rising from Europe to Asia Pacific to Latin America; second, more physicians are practicing aesthetic medicine everyday. In fact, I was in Shanghai last month meeting with our Asia Pacific country managers and customers and the interest and enthusiasm for our products was remarkable; and finally, disposable incomes and purchasing power are climbing. Aspirationally, our global business, our Medical Aesthetics business could double over time. 
In terms of eye care, glaucoma is our largest product line and retina is the fastest growing. In glaucoma, we are launching a multi-dose preservative formulation of GANFORT and our new surgical procedure, XEN, will be launched in more than 20 countries over the next 2 years. 
In retina, sales for Ozurdex, which is a dexamethasone implant, were up 34% in the second quarter. This product has been a big commercial success internationally and is being used as an alternative to anti-VEGF therapy for diabetic macular edema. Ozurdex has a very strong following in Western Europe and in 2017, we will expand geographically with launches in Brazil and Australia. 
On Slide 16, we look ahead for our commercial business. Our strategy is sound. New launches are our focus and will continue to drive growth across our therapeutic areas. In 2016, we'll continue to focus our efforts on supporting the launches of Viberzi, Vraylar and KYBELLA, which we talked about. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we will launch not only Restasis MDPF, which I mentioned earlier, but also Byvalson, which is a fixed-dose combination of Bystolic and Valsartan, Linzess 72-microgram, a low-dose formulation of Linzess, which is designed to accelerate conversion of the OTC category and a new indication for Namzaric, which is designed to increase the use of combination therapy in the Alzheimer's category. 
Finally, early commercialization activities are underway to support our 2017 launches. XEN, True Tear, formally known as Oculeve, and Oxymetazoline for rosacea, which we're now calling Rhofade. 
Internationally, we're creating a GI foothold in Europe with the launches of Constella and [indiscernible], which is Viberzi in the United States. We'll continue to invest behind and leverage our platform of capabilities, which includes highly effective physician and consumer e-commerce programs and our well-trained and customized field force. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David."

We have continued to deliver on our strong track record of productivity. 
Year-to-date, we have achieved 13 major pharma and device approvals. We've also achieved 9 major regulatory submissions with 3 major submissions in Q2. A very strong first half of 2016 delivered by our great R&D team with Allergan. I'm not going to talk about everything on this slide, but I would like to talk about a few of our Q2 highlights. Approvals. We obtained approvals globally to further enhance our Medical Aesthetics franchise, including Juvederm, Volbella for lip augmentation and correction of perioral lines in adults in the U.S. The Japanese regulatory authorities approved the use of Botox Vista for crow's feet lines. We also received a CE mark in the European Union for Juvederm Volite containing lidocaine. 
For our cardiovascular franchise, we received FDA approval for Byvalson, a combination of nebivolol and valsartan, for the treatment of hypertension. In CNS, along with our partner, Adamas Pharmaceutical, we received approval for a new expanded label for Namzaric. This expanded label, with lower dose combination, allows patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's, who are currently stabilized on Aricept, to start combination therapy directly with Namzaric. 
Regarding submissions. The FDA accepted for review our sNDA for the 72-microgram dose of linaclotide for use in the treatment of adults with chronic idiopathic constipation. The FDA accepted our 510(k) notification for the XEN glaucoma stent that Bill mentioned in his presentation. 
We filed an application with the FDA for True Tear, to increase natural tear production in patients with dry eye disease. Our ultimate goal is to show improvement in both the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease with this device. 
We initiated a Phase IIa proof-of-concept study for Setipiprant, our [indiscernible] antagonist, for enhancement of scalp hair growth. 
Turning to Slide 19. I'm looking ahead towards near-term pipeline highlight. We have a robust stream of approvals, submissions and development milestones for the remainder of 2016 and 2017. Again, I won't cover everything on this slide, but I do want to mention a few highlights. 
First, upcoming approvals. In Medical Aesthetics, we expect to receive approval in many countries in the EU for KYBELLA, known as BELKYRA internationally in the second half of this year. This is one of several international approvals expected in 2016 and 2017 for this agent. Following FDA acceptance of our NDA for Oxymetazoline, Rhofade, for the topical treatment of rosacea in adults, we anticipate approval early next year. 
In Eye Care, we have addressed questions from the FDA and resubmitted our NDA for Restasis MDPF, and we anticipate approval in the fourth quarter of 2016. As a reminder, the Restasis MDPF bottle utilizes a first-of-its-kind container with patented unidirectional valves and air filter technology. Following acceptance of our submissions by FDA, we also expect to receive approval for True Tear and XEN in 2017, as Bill mentioned earlier. 
And in GI, we expect to receive approval for our 72-microgram formulation of Linzess for CIC patients. 
Submissions. In Medical Aesthetics, we will continue to submit additional applications worldwide for Botox and KYBELLA. Also, we expect to announce top line Phase III results and submit an NDA for sarecycline, our next-generation oral tetracycline for acne in 2017. Remember that this program would put us into a new acne category, oral antibiotics, and may offer patients a lower GI side effect profile, a more flexible dosing than other products currently on the market. 
In CNS, we plan to submit an NDA for Semprana, an inhalable dihydroergotamine treatment, for acute migraine later this year. We have a great team working on this project, and they have resolved the issues raised by the FDA during their previous review. We now have to tackle issues related to scale up and manufacturability. 
Development milestones. In Medical Aesthetics, we are set to begin a Phase III study for Latanoprost in suboptimal [indiscernible] in 2017. In Eye Care, enrollment in our Phase III programs for Abicipar is going very well. It's on track for completion in the second half of 2017. 
Excitement is high regarding our Bimatoprost SR program. The challenges remain regarding the timing of the enrollment of our Phase III studies, utilizing both drops and an implant. We now expect to complete enrollment for this study in late 2017. 
In CNS, we have a number of updates for our development programs. Allergan and Gedeon Richter recently provided an update on our cariprazine program. The top line results from our latest Phase III study evaluating the safety and efficacy of cariprazine, as adjunctive therapy to antidepressants in major depressive disorder, did not meet the primary endpoint, not uncommon for these types of trials to be negative or to fail. Antidepressants on the market today have failed 1 or more clinical trials in the quest to get the requisite 2 positive clinical studies required for approval. 
Remember, we have already completed 1 positive trial in this indication. Both companies have agreed to move forward with additional Phase III evaluation in MDD to support a potential indication. 
We've also continued positive discussions with the FDA on an sNDA submission for an indication of prevention of recurrence in patients with schizophrenia, where we have the necessary positive study, and we continue to work with the FDA on the regulatory path forward, the potential indication, the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. All in all, this represents important progress towards additional indications for cariprazine for the treatment of patients with these conditions. 
Regarding our muscarinic receptor agonist development programs with Heptares, we expect to enter Phase I clinical studies in 2017. These compounds are novel, subtype, selective muscarinic receptor agonist in development for the treatment of the range of CNS disorders with a potential upside of better tolerability and a more pronounced effect compared with available agents. 
Finally, our oral CGRP programs. As promised, we have initiated a Phase III trial for our lead compound, [indiscernible], for the acute treatment of migraine. 
[indiscernible], the second compound for migraine prophylaxis, will enter Phase IIb trials in the second half of this year. As I've outlined, the first half of 2016 has marked tremendous results for our R&D team. There are many more milestones ahead of us for the remainder of the year and into 2017. The breadth of our pipeline match with our therapeutic area leadership validates our Open Science approach to innovation. 
As always, I thank our global R&D team for their outstanding work and dedication in driving innovation in achieving these results and for their commitment to the work ahead for the patients we serve. 
Now I will turn the call over to Tessa."
36478,374033817,1029915,"Allergan plc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2016",2016-08-08,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Please note that this discussion of financial results reflect continuing operations which now excludes both the Global Generics business, which was sold to Teva on August 2, as well as the Anda Distribution business,",1220,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Please note that this discussion of financial results reflect continuing operations which now excludes both the Global Generics business, which was sold to Teva on August 2, as well as the Anda Distribution business, of which we announced the sale to Teva on August 3. All prior periods in this presentation reflect the exclusion of Anda and the Generics business as well. 
Turning to our overall results for the second quarter of 2016 on Slide 21. In the second quarter, we delivered strong year-over-year performance. On a GAAP basis, continuing operations net revenues, which now exclude Anda Distribution, were $3.7 billion, a 2% increase versus prior year, reflecting strong growth of key products and the impact of the loss of exclusivity for Namenda IR in July 2015. Excluding Namenda IR, divestitures and FX, revenues increased 9.3%. Gross margin for the second quarter was very strong at 88%. Operating margins were also very strong exceeding 50%. Operating margins declined versus last year as a result of an increase in R&D, reflecting the increased number of Phase III programs underway and an increase in SG&A. 
The increase in SG&A was primarily driven by higher selling and marketing expenses related to the 3 major ongoing launches this year, Viberzi, KYBELLA and Vraylar. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share forecast of $3.35 reflect the loss of exclusivity of Namenda IR when compared with the second quarter of 2015. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 7.1% in the quarter. This rate remains slow as the result of our entire interest expense being allocated to continuing operations earnings. The divestiture of Anda, which is a U.S. company also further reduce the tax rate for continuing operations. 
Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $1.4 billion, excluding adjustments, primarily recent R&D acquisitions and integration expenses, cash flow from operations was $1.85 billion. 
The GAAP equivalent to our forecast metrics can be found in our earnings release issued this morning and posted on our website. 
Turning now to our U.S. Specialized Therapeutics results on Slide 22. The business continued to deliver strong performance year-over-year. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics revenue was $1.5 billion for the quarter, up 11% versus the prior year period, driven by strong growth across Medical Aesthetics of 15%, Eye Care of 10% and strong growth in Botox therapeutics of 17%. 
Key products performed well with Botox, RESTASIS, Fillers and the launch of KYBELLA as key contributors to the strong performance. Gross margin remained high at approximately 95%. 
SG&A increased as a result of an increase in promotion efforts, including sales force expansion and launch costs related to KYBELLA. 
Turning to Slide 23. Our U.S. General Medicine business' second quarter revenues was $1.45 billion, reflecting the loss of $229 million of sales of Namenda IR, which lost exclusivity last year. 
Adjusting for this impact, sales grew 5%, driven by our strength in our key products, including Linzess and Lo Loestrin and new product launches of Viberzi and Vraylar. Second quarter gross margins continued to be stable at approximately 85%. 
Sequentially, SG&A increased slightly as a result of Viberzi and Vraylar promotional spend and sales force expansion related to these launches. 
Turning to Slide 24 in our International Brands results. Second quarter revenues were $757 million versus $717 million in the prior year period. Excluding FX, international revenues in the second quarter grew 10%, driven by continued strong growth of Botox, Fillers and Eye Care, driven by strong sales of Ozurdex. 
Gross margins were 84.8% in the second quarter. Segment SG&A was $238 million, up 3% versus prior year, driven by new product launches, including BELKYRA or KYBELLA in the U.S., XEN, Earfold and Constella. 
Contribution margins improved versus prior year quarter from 52.2% to 53.4% reflecting continued strong sales growth. 
Turning to Slide 25, which details our debt capitalization. We have strengthened our balance sheet significantly with a continued pay down of debt following the close of the Teva transaction. 
Since Q1, and following the close of the sale of our Generics business to Teva, we reduced our total debt position by approximately $9 billion in line with our previous commitment. As a result, all of our outstanding term loans have been fully paid off. We also terminated our $1 billion revolving credit facility, and we expect to renew this facility in the next few weeks. 
We continue to believe that there is no better investment than in our own fast-growing company. We plan to commence our share repurchase very shortly, and we plan to execute $5 billion by the end of the year, buying as much as prudently possible in open market purchases subject to favorable market conditions. 
Note that the Allergan board has authorized up to $10 billion in share repurchases, and we expect to provide an update on our share repurchases in our next earnings release. 
Turning to Slide 26. Let me make a few comments on our 2016 full year guidance. We are refining our guidance to now include EPS as well as removing Anda. We expect full year 2016 branded revenues to be $14.75 billion to $15 billion. Note that reported net revenues will be lower by approximately $100 million reflecting the impact of our branded products, which are sold through Anda, and are required to be accounted for in discontinued operations. 
Note that revenues will be back half weighted as a result of contribution from launches being greater in the second half and typical pharma seasonality. Our gross margins will remain strong at approximately 88.5%. We expect non-GAAP SG&A -- actually, our gross margins will remain strong at approximately 89%. We expect non-GAAP SG&A of approximately $4 billion, reflecting our investment in new product launches and continued prudent G&A spent. Non-GAAP R&D spend is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion as a result of the many important late-stage programs advancing in our pipeline, including the commencement of Phase III programs of Rapastinel and [indiscernible]. 
We anticipate interest expense in the range of $1.3 billion or even slightly lower. Our tax rate for the full year is anticipated to be approximately 9%. Our tax rate should begin to trend upward toward normalized levels in 2017. 
Our share count of 413 million shares includes approximately $5 billion in share repurchases that we plan to execute throughout the remainder of the year. 
Turning to Slide 27. I am proud of our accomplishments as a growth-oriented, pure-branded company. The actions that we have taken this year to simplify our business, combined with strong revenue performance, have truly uncovered our industry-leading profitability as shown in the chart. 
We will continue to focus on strong top line growth as we look to the future. Besides revenue growth and cash generation, the 2 additional financial metrics that we watch very closely are gross margins and operating margins. Our goal is to remain among the leaders in the industry in both gross margins in the 88% range and in operating margins, we are trending in the range of 53%. Our operating margins will continue to expand as we fully realize the potential of our growing revenues, while investing in selling and marketing and maintaining an efficient G&A base. 
This should translate into strong cash flow generation, which will further maximize shareholder value. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent for closing remarks."

And we -- as we've announced recently, we are initiating studies for Botox in platysma, completing the Phase II study in Masseter, and we're evaluating the potential use of toxins in preventing some of the consequent -- atrial fibrillation following open heart surgery. You asked about the topical toxin. Well, we recently acquired the technology from Anterios. The technology is really useful to get large molecules potentially across the dermal barrier and indeed one use of that is potentially for Botox or for toxins like Botox, and we are presently finalizing our work on the formulation for use in some Medical Aesthetics studies.

So one comment you made in the -- in your release was just that the revenues are impacted by higher levels of investments. I'm assuming that has to do with co-pay cards or something along those lines that's bringing down the net sales, if you can just confirm that? And then, obviously, you talked about the IR generics impact that's going forward here. Just how should we think about this franchise, I guess, as we've looked at the uptake of XR and then Namzaric. So far, I know you have the new approval for Namzaric. But is this something that you see as a real sort of growth franchise going forward? Or is it kind of going to stay in the level that it is right now?"

In terms of the second quarter results versus 2015, the variance was largely due -- the cost of obtaining formulary coverage, both for '16 and for 2017, I would think about it as a onetime cost, not something that is going to escalate or read through to the next year. I do think that the indication for Namzaric for new patients is going to make a difference. I also believe that the sequencing of IR to XR to Namzaric is important and some time has passed since we transitioned from IR to XR, which, I think, is important. And in terms of looking forward, I think, Namzaric could expand the use of combination therapy in the Alzheimer's category because it's superior to XR. We're going to launch a DTC campaign. That's the aim. I would say at minimum, though, it's going to sure up this business for the next several years so that we have something that's solidly trading in this $750 million to $800 million year range."

Now that your company has been through multiple iterations over the last few years and just massive change this year, we've seen numbers kind of come down across the board on revenues and earnings and that's largely due to the divestitures. But I'm wondering if you can kind of take a step back and help us to think about where revenues and where earnings might go over the next 3 to 4 years or so. I recognize you're not prepared to give us on point estimates guidance today. But there are some sale numbers out there, the $25 number from 2017, for example. And so it just seems that $25 is a long ways away from $14 this year.

And I think we've kind of finally hit the point that we've been trying to get to over that period of time to a focused branded Growth Pharma innovative company, and we're very excited that we've gotten here. We just have to complete the final sale of the Anda business -- or the final sale, which is the Anda business to Teva. And then we've gotten this kind of 2 years of incredible transformation essentially behind us. As a result, I think that has changed the numbers. Obviously, when you sell a business, it is dilutive for both top and bottom line. And we've done a few of those things and that's always difficult for companies to do. But for us, strategically and, I think, prudently, it was the right move at the right time, and I think we did very good deals to get us there. I think with respect to the future, our goal or our aspiration is to continue to lead in top line growth. We are, I think, putting up arguably among the best, if not the best top line growth. That growth is broad-based. That growth is across all of our product lines. All of our most important products are growing faster than the top line average. And so we are in an incredibly strong position from a sales perspective. Obviously, on an EPS basis, we hope to see leverage on the bottom line. We've continued to lead, as Tessa said, in both gross margin and operating margins. You see that bleed through to the bottom line. You'll see that strengthen as we do things like buy back $5 billion to $10 billion worth of stock; as we continue to do deals that are growth-oriented, both accretive deals and some pipeline deals to make sure that we do it. But let's face it, the bottom line is our goal. It's difficult but quite simple, which is to maximize shareholder value over the long term.

We increased the size of our sales force by 20%, essentially adding 60 more representatives. We increased the investment in direct-to-consumer advertising. The sampling program, both on Restasis as well as on our artificial tears has been increased. Our coverage of ophthalmology and optometry will be greater in the second half of the year than it was in the first half of the year. We sured up formulary coverage at virtually every health plan across the country, both on the commercial and the Part D side. And those steps were taken to successfully launch Restasis MDPF. Of course, we're going to have an active company in the category in Shire. We're also going to launch True Tear, which is a nasal neurostimulator for dry eye. And so I like the way the second half of the year is going to look for Restasis, particularly given the incremental level of investment. As you know, we have a very highly-trained experienced sales force with great relationships in both areas of eye care, which is ophthalmology and optometry. There, of course, in addition to Restasis, is there's a big focus on a Viberzi, Vraylar and KYBELLA. And Viberzi looks and feels just like Linzess, that's on OTC conversion clay. Vraylar is exceeding our expectations. The a response that we've gotten from psychiatrists is exceptional. We're getting used across a broad range of patients. The prescriber base is climbing. And then, of course, we have KYBELLA, and we spent the first 6 months training injectors. It's very different than a pharmaceutical like Viberzi or Vraylar. I would describe the first day of launch for KYBELLA at September 1. We'll turn on consumer advertising. All of our e-commerce programs are now covering KYBELLA, and I would expect a significant step-up in sales on a quarterly basis for KYBELLA in the second half of the year. It's a great expansion of our injectable product line. It gets us into the lower face. It's opens up, to a certain extent, the middle market. Those are really the priorities, of course. Botox therapeutics is growing at a double-digit rate driven by migraine. We've only penetrated 6% of that market. I think, long term, it's going to be a growth driver, even in 2018 when the CGRP is launched. Hope that answers your question."

And we also have the setipiprant, which is the CRTH-2 antagonist, where we plan to start Phase II studies. Later this year, the CRTH-2 program came out of some academic work showing changes in Prostaglandin D2 expression in male pattern baldness. So there is CRTH-2 receptor, the receptor for Prostaglandin D2. So we have genetic validation of the targets in male pattern baldness, and it's that genetic validation that we're exploiting with the compound that we acquired from Kythera along with KYBELLA."

Look, the only time in the last few years we've done a major transformational deal was when we bought legacy Allergan, and that was put in play and we got to act as a white knight. For the last few years, we have been very focused on stepping-stone deals. So it's not like it's a new strategy, despite our image perhaps or reputation in the market. We have been very focused on that, only acting on one transformational deal because it was a once-in-a-corporate-lifetime situation. I guess to the extent we look at the large-cap universe or the transformational set, we ran that analysis vis-à-vis during our stock buyback and believe that our stock is the most compelling investment we can make versus doing those types of deals. Now we've always been a flexible, nimble team. If some extraordinary situation presented itself, we would obviously evaluate it very closely. And if we felt it was in our shareholders' best interest long term, it's conceivable we can do that. But to be clear -- and Ken, I know you know this, our strategy is stepping-stones. We are not out looking for big trends for M&A. The odds are something compelling, becoming clearer or exceptionally low, but they're not 0, and so you never say never. That would be silly in our situation to be close-minded and close off all avenues. But I can tell you that we don't need a big deal, we're not looking at big deals and we're going to continue our strategy of stepping-stones."

I think we've seen relative stability. I think what's happened in this environment with all the media and noise coming from the political season and everything else is that the payers are definitely involved in a little bit and so they're being more aggressive. I think where they're having their biggest success is where there is great competition or low innovation. And as you know, we have transitioned to a very different model with our recent launches and our pipeline. And I think we have said this many times, we think pricing our pipeline is going to be infinitely easier than pricing our current products, and we've done very well pricing our current products. So what -- I'd characterize the environment as tougher in kind of the me-to or highly competitive spaces that there are 4 drugs launching with relatively similar mechanisms and indications over a 12-month period. Pricing dynamics are more challenging than they have been. If you're launching something like even Viberzi, where we can get a price that's almost 3x the price of Linzess because it's a 1 of 1 and novel mechanism, it's still pretty straightforward.

And I would make one final comment. Keep in mind, our business is got good balance. 40% of the $15 billion, I wouldn't even describe as subject to the pricing pressures that we're talking about right now. When it comes to our commercial and Part D mix, it's well-balanced. And just generally speaking, we have exclusivity periods on our products that extend well into the 2020s, which means our pricing approach is aimed at garnering market share and real estate so to speak, and we price for the long term not the short term. And I do think that has a positive impact on the partnerships that we have with health plans."

And we both, I think, strongly believe that the opportunity in a market like China for a cash-pay Medical Aesthetics business is massive. Now we're growing incredibly strong, but off a relatively modest pace. So we need to look at is there something more bold we can do there. Now the investment, I think, will be manageable. I don't think you'll see it make huge fluctuations in the numbers if we decide to do it, and the payback will be strong. So I don't think that should change anyway you think about -- but the investment shouldn't change anyway if you think about it, but rather we want to make sure that we continue to put up that growth.

The norm -- the new normal at Allergan is launch excellence and launching products, but we tend to also look at building out our pipeline and our shots on goal a bit like a bond portfolio, where we can both ladder out the launches as well as the exclusivity periods of our products to keep that constant growth rate.

We had a big week last week that was highlighted by the completion of the divestiture of our Global Generics business to Teva. With its completion and the announcement of our plans to sell our Anda Distribution Business, Allergan has taken major steps toward our goal of being a branded Growth Pharma leader. 
I am proud of the people who worked so hard for 12 months to make this divestiture a reality, and I'm even more proud that the Allergan team has remained so focused on execution during this time. You can see proof of that focus in the results we are announcing today. 
Turning to Slide 5. 2016 has been a year of tremendous positive transition for Allergan, and we are well-positioned to continue to deliver strong results powered by our Growth Pharma model. This model is built around 5 key elements: Top line growth, with a goal of double-digit growth; category leadership in each of our 7 therapeutic areas; customer intimacy; open science R&D to fuel innovation; and operational excellence. And our team is successfully executing on each of these elements. 
Turning to Slide 6. Top line sales of the branded business came in at $3.7 billion, up more than 9% compared to prior year, excluding Namenda IR, divestitures and FX. And the performance was broad-based with strong results from all aspects of our business. Six of our most important brands grew double digits globally, excluding FX, including Botox, up 16%, RESTASIS up 21%, Linzess up 37%, our family of Fillers, up 18%; Ozurdex, up 33%; and Lo Loestrin, up 28%. I'm very pleased and impressed with this performance. 
A key attribute of our team is launch excellence as demonstrated by the strong start for Viberzi, Vraylar and Kybella. We are also building on our therapeutic areas and 4 of the 7 grew by more than 15% this quarter. For example, GI was up 19%, Women's Health was up 34%, meanwhile, eye care, our largest therapeutic area, was up 10% and Medical Aesthetics, excluding medical dermatology, was up 14%. 
I'm very impressed with what our commercial teams continue to do every day to make Allergan the most dynamic and exciting company in our industry. Bill will talk more about the brand performance, recent launches and our international business in just a moment. 
On Slide 7. Strong top line performance and our continued focus on operational excellence and business simplification resulted in non-GAAP EPS of $3.35, which now excludes the results of Anda, our distribution business. 
For us, operational excellence is all about focusing on doing the little things very well to enable the organization to become more efficient, more productive and more profitable. With the creation of Rob Stewart's role as Chief Operating Officer, we have renewed energy on harmonizing systems and processes throughout the company and making targeted investments to upgrade critical capabilities. 
And our Open Science R&D model is working to drive innovation across each of our 7 therapeutic areas. Just this year, our R&D team has succeeded in gaining approval for 13 major pharma and device products and 9 major submissions. David will provide more details later in the presentation. 
Open Science provides us with a compelling, competitive, strategic advantage as evidenced by our 65-plus mid- to late-stage development programs, many of which could be game-changing treatments. 
Turning to capital allocation on Slide 8. Our reloaded balance sheet provides us with significant flexibility to deploy capital to shareholders, including investing in our share repurchase program, debt repayment and additional investments in growth opportunities. 
We'll start with about $5 billion in share repurchase program during the rest of 2016, buying as much as prudently possible in the open market. As we have said before, if favorable market conditions persist, we have the capacity to consider buying the additional $5 billion under the $10 billion authorization provided by our Board of Directors. 
In addition to the share repurchase program, we had paid down debt, which should reinforce our investment-grade credit ratings. Tessa will provide additional details during her presentation. Even with those plans, we preserve capacity of more than $20 billion to invest for growth and acquire additional steppingstone assets to keep our pipeline full and provide fuel for sustainable top line growth in our therapeutic areas. Our goal is to maximize shareholder value over the long-term. 
Now let me hand the call over to Bill Meury, our Chief Commercial Officer."

We had a strong quarter and our focus on category leadership is producing results, overall demand for our products is strong and implementation metrics on launch plans are high, which is a credit to our sales and marketing teams, domestically and internationally. 
Sales for 6 of 7 therapeutic areas increased at a high single-digit or double-digit rate versus prior year in the second quarter, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and divestitures. 
In eye care, sales increased by 10%, powered by continued strength in RESTASIS and Ozurdex. Sales for RESTASIS increased by 21% based on strong physician and consumer promotion and widespread formulary coverage. 
Ozurdex continued to deliver strong results globally with 30% growth in the United States and 34% growth in international markets, driven by its expanded diabetic macular edema label. 
In Aesthetics, sales increased by 14%, driven by continued strong performance from Botox and Fillers. In fact, Botox had its strongest quarter in the United States in the last 2 years. Additionally, we've laid a strong foundation to drive demand in the second half of the year and in 2017 as well. The prospects for this business and the market dynamics in the future are excellent, more on that shortly. In GI, Linzess, our flagship product, continued to produce outstanding results, up 37%, year-over-year, and importantly, Viberzi is off to a strong start. Now in its second full quarter postlaunch, prescriptions and writers [ph] are climbing at a high rate consistently week-over-week. 
And finally, we continue to see some growth in our Women's Health, urology and anti-infective businesses. 
On Slide 11, you can see the demand for Linzess and Viberzi is very strong. For both products, growth has and will continue to be fueled by conversion of the OTC market, increased use by both gastroenterologist and primary care physicians and market-leading promotion and formulary coverage. 
For Viberzi, our newest GI product, the number of prescribers doubled in the second quarter and physician feedback has been positive. Based on sales, Viberzi is trending at approximately 90% of Linzess during the same time period, postlaunch. 
Turning to Slide 12, on KYBELLA, which is indicated for submental fat reduction or double chin. Strategically, KYBELLA expands our facial injectable product line, which includes Botox and our Fillers. KYBELLA pioneers a new category of facial injectables. It will serve as a gateway to the lower face and will open up an entirely new market of consumers, including males. 
And finally, KYBELLA will serve as a true practice builder for our customers, including dermatologists and plastic surgeons. We've organized a launch into 2 phases. We successfully completed the first phase, training more than 9,000 or 90% of the key injector base in the United States. We're exactly where we need to be in terms of physician education and training. We're now in the process of kicking off Phase II, where we are creating awareness and demand among consumers, which will be boosted by our DTC campaign beginning this month. 
This product is an important growth driver and will fortify our leadership position in aesthetic medicine. Our R&D team is working on developing additional new aesthetic and therapeutic indications for KYBELLA, which, when added to the submental fat, indication could make KYBELLA as large as Botox cosmetic over time. 
Turning to Slide 13, and Vraylar. Vraylar was launched in mid-March in the United States for schizophrenia and mania. Interest by psychiatrist and select primary care physicians is very high. We've had multiple educational events where the attendance reached approximately 100 physicians. We're very encouraged by what we're seeing and hearing right now. Approximately 4,000 psychiatrists have used Vraylar, and we expect that number to climb to 10,000 by year-end. 
Based on solid performance so far, we're expanding our sales force coverage of hospitals and mental health facilities. As you can see on the slide, prescription levels for Vraylar are comparable to 2 recent and successfully launched atypical antipsychotics, Latuda and Rexulti. We do see a changing of the guard over time in this market with new atypicals replacing the older ones. The future of Vraylar can be described as nothing but very promising. 
Turning to Slide 14, in our Eye Care franchise. We are continuing to add to our position as a leading Eye Care company with innovative products for dry eye and glaucoma. We expect to launch Restasis MDPF in the fourth quarter and then True Tear, which is a nasal neuro stimulator in the first quarter of 2017. So we have 2 new products for dry eye to complement Restasis and our marketed artificial tear product line. Both launches will be supported by our largest sales force ever to ophthalmologists and optometrists and extensive consumer advertising and education. 
The prospects for growth of dry eye market are excellent. The condition is receiving more attention due to its impact on vision, postop outcomes and quality of life. It's widely recognized, whether it's mild or sight threatening, dry eye should be treated more aggressively. 
Allergan is fully committed to this area and with multiple products on the market and in development. In terms of glaucoma, we have our XEN Gel Stent which is a minimally invasive procedure to lower IOP. In fact, it may turn out to be the most effective new pressure lowering agent on the market. Glaucoma is on the verge of a transformation. For decades, eye drop therapy has been the standard of care. Looking forward, minimally-invasive filtering or surgical procedures will reduce or eliminate the need for eye drops, which are effective but are, of course, associated with low compliance rates. 
XEN was recently launched in 10 international markets, and we look forward to its potential approval and launch in the United States next year. 
Turning to Slide 15, our international business. Sales in our international business totaled more than $750 million in the second quarter, a 10% increase versus prior year. 
Western Europe is our largest region, and we expect Asia-Pacific will be our leading international growth contributor. Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care anchor our business internationally. Sales for our Medical Aesthetics business increased at a double-digit rate in every international region. 
Sales for Botox and our Fillers line specifically were up 13% and 23%, respectively. The Medical Aesthetics market is poised for major expansion over the next several years for a number of reasons: First, attitudes toward Aesthetics are changing around the world. Awareness and demand is rising from Europe to Asia-Pacific to Latin America; second, more physicians are practicing aesthetic medicine every day. In fact, I was in Shanghai last month meeting with our Asia-Pacific country managers and customers and the interest and enthusiasm for our products was remarkable and finally, disposable incomes and purchasing power are climbing. Aspirationally, our global business, our Medical Aesthetics business could double over time. 
In terms of eye care, glaucoma is our largest product line and Retina is the fastest growing. In glaucoma, we are launching a multi-dose preservative formulation of Ganfort and our new surgical procedure, XEN, will be launched in more than 20 countries over the next 2 years. 
In Retina, sales for Ozurdex, which is a dexamethasone implant, were up 34% in the second quarter. This product has been a big commercial success internationally and is being used as an alternative to anti-VEGF therapy for diabetic macular edema. Ozurdex has a very strong following in Western Europe and in 2017, we will expand geographically with launches in Brazil and Australia. 
On Slide 16, we look ahead for our commercial business. Our strategy is sound. New launches are our focus and will continue to drive growth across our therapeutic areas. In 2016, we'll continue to focus our efforts on supporting the launches of Viberzi, Vraylar and KYBELLA, which we talked about. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we will launch not only Restasis MDPF, which I mentioned earlier, but also Byvalson, which is a fixed-dose combination of Bystolic and valsartan, Linzess 72-microgram, a low-dose formulation of Linzess, which is designed to accelerate conversion of the OTC category and a new indication for Namzaric, which is designed to increase the use of combination therapy in the Alzheimer's category. 
Finally, early commercialization activities are underway to support our 2017 launches. XEN, True Tear, formally known as Oculeve, and Oxymetazoline for rosacea, which we're now calling Rhofade. 
Internationally, we're creating a GI foothold in Europe with the launches of Constella and Qberzi [ph], which is Viberzi in the United States. We'll continue to invest behind and leverage our platform of capabilities, which includes highly effective physician and consumer e-commerce programs and our well-trained and customized field force. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David."

We have continued to deliver on our strong track record of productivity. 
Year-to-date, we have achieved 13 major pharma and device approvals. We've also achieved 9 major regulatory submissions with 3 major submissions in Q2. A very strong first half of 2016 delivered by our great R&D team with Allergan. I'm not going to talk about everything on this slide, but I would like to talk about a few of our Q2 highlights. Approvals. We obtained approvals globally to further enhance our Medical Aesthetics franchise, including Juvederm, Volbella for lip augmentation and correction of perioral lines in adults in the U.S. The Japanese regulatory authorities approved the use of Botox Vista for crow's feet lines. We also received a CE mark in the European Union for Juvederm Volite containing lidocaine. 
For our cardiovascular franchise, we received FDA approval for Byvalson, a combination of nebivolol and valsartan, for the treatment of hypertension. In CNS, along with our partner, Adamas Pharmaceutical, we received approval for a new expanded label for Namzaric. This expanded label, with lower dose combination, allows patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's, who are currently stabilized on Aricept, to start combination therapy directly with Namzaric. 
Regarding submissions. The FDA accepted for review our sNDA for the 72-microgram dose of linaclotide for use in the treatment of adults with chronic idiopathic constipation. The FDA accepted our 510(k) notification for the XEN glaucoma stent that Bill mentioned in his presentation. 
We filed an application with the FDA for True Tear, to increase natural tear production in patients with dry eye disease. Our ultimate goal is to show improvement in both the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease with this device. 
We initiated a Phase IIa proof-of-concept study for Setipiprant, our CRTH-2 antagonist, for enhancement of scalp hair growth. 
Turning to Slide 19. I'm looking ahead towards near-term pipeline highlight. We have a robust stream of approvals, submissions and development milestones for the remainder of 2016 and 2017. Again, I won't cover everything on this slide, but I do want to mention a few highlights. 
First, upcoming approvals. In Medical Aesthetics, we expect to receive approval in many countries in the EU for KYBELLA, known as BELKYRA internationally in the second half of this year. This is one of several international approvals expected in 2016 and 2017 for this agent. Following FDA acceptance of our NDA for Oxymetazoline, Rhofade, for the topical treatment of rosacea in adults, we anticipate approval early next year. 
In Eye Care, we have addressed questions from the FDA and resubmitted our NDA for Restasis MDPF, and we anticipate approval in the fourth quarter of 2016. As a reminder, the Restasis MDPF bottle utilizes a first-of-its-kind container with patented unidirectional valves and air filter technology. Following acceptance of our submissions by FDA, we also expect to receive approval for True Tear and XEN in 2017, as Bill mentioned earlier. 
And in GI, we expect to receive approval for our 72-microgram formulation of Linzess for CIC patients. 
Submissions. In Medical Aesthetics, we will continue to submit additional applications worldwide for Botox and KYBELLA. Also, we expect to announce top line Phase III results and submit an NDA for sarecycline, our next-generation oral tetracycline for acne in 2017. Remember that this program would put us into a new acne category, oral antibiotics, and may offer patients a lower GI side effect profile, a more flexible dosing than other products currently on the market. 
In CNS, we plan to submit an NDA for Semprana, an inhalable dihydroergotamine treatment, for acute migraine later this year. We have a great team working on this project, and they have resolved the issues raised by the FDA during their previous review. We now have to tackle issues related to scale up and manufacturability. 
Development milestones. In Medical Aesthetics, we are set to begin a Phase III study for Latanoprost in suboptimal fat in 2017. In Eye Care, enrollment in our Phase III programs for Abicipar is going very well. It's on track for completion in the second half of 2017. 
Excitement is high regarding our Bimatoprost SR program. The challenges remain regarding the timing of the enrollment of our Phase III studies, utilizing both drops and an implant. We now expect to complete enrollment for this study in late 2017. 
In CNS, we have a number of updates for our development programs. Allergan and Gedeon Richter recently provided an update on our cariprazine program. The top line results from our latest Phase III study evaluating the safety and efficacy of cariprazine, as adjunctive therapy to antidepressants in major depressive disorder, did not meet the primary endpoint, not uncommon for these types of trials to be negative or to fail. Antidepressants on the market today have failed 1 or more clinical trials in the quest to get the requisite 2 positive clinical studies required for approval. 
Remember, we have already completed 1 positive trial in this indication. Both companies have agreed to move forward with additional Phase III evaluation in MDD to support a potential indication. 
We've also continued positive discussions with the FDA on an sNDA submission for an indication of prevention of recurrence in patients with schizophrenia, where we have the necessary positive study, and we continue to work with the FDA on the regulatory path forward for a potential indication, the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. All in all, this represents important progress towards additional indications for cariprazine for the treatment of patients with these conditions. 
Regarding our muscarinic receptor agonist development programs with Heptares, we expect to enter Phase I clinical studies in 2017. These compounds are novel, subtype, selective muscarinic receptor agonists in development for the treatment of the range of CNS disorders with a potential upside of better tolerability and a more pronounced effect compared with available agents. 
Finally, our oral CGRP program. As promised, we have initiated a Phase III trial for our lead compound, ubrogepant, for the acute treatment of migraine. 
Atogepant, the second compound for migraine prophylaxis, will enter Phase IIb trials in the second half of this year. As I've outlined, the first half of 2016 has marked tremendous results for our R&D team. There are many more milestones ahead of us for the remainder of the year and into 2017. The breadth of our pipeline matched with our therapeutic area leadership validates our Open Science approach to innovation. 
As always, I thank our global R&D team for their outstanding work and dedication in driving innovation in achieving these results and for their commitment to the work ahead for the patients we serve. 
Now I will turn the call over to Tessa."
36478,374033817,1030381,"Allergan plc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2016",2016-08-08,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Please note that this discussion of financial results reflect continuing operations which now excludes both the Global Generics business, which was sold to Teva on August 2, as well as the Anda Distribution business,",1220,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Please note that this discussion of financial results reflect continuing operations which now excludes both the Global Generics business, which was sold to Teva on August 2, as well as the Anda Distribution business, of which we announced the sale to Teva on August 3. All prior periods in this presentation reflect the exclusion of Anda and the Generics business as well. 
Turning to our overall results for the second quarter of 2016 on Slide 21. In the second quarter, we delivered strong year-over-year performance. On a GAAP basis, continuing operations net revenues, which now exclude Anda Distribution, were $3.7 billion, a 2% increase versus prior year, reflecting strong growth of key products and the impact of the loss of exclusivity for Namenda IR in July 2015. Excluding Namenda IR, divestitures and FX, revenues increased 9.3%. Gross margin for the second quarter was very strong at 88%. Operating margins were also very strong exceeding 50%. Operating margins declined versus last year as a result of an increase in R&D, reflecting the increased number of Phase III programs underway and an increase in SG&A. 
The increase in SG&A was primarily driven by higher selling and marketing expenses related to the 3 major ongoing launches this year of Viberzi, KYBELLA and Vraylar. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share forecast of $3.35 reflect the loss of exclusivity of Namenda IR when compared with the second quarter of 2015. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 7.1% in the quarter. This rate remains low as the result of our entire interest expense being allocated to continuing operations earnings. The divestiture of Anda, which is a U.S. company, also further reduce the tax rate for continuing operations. 
Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $1.4 billion, excluding adjustments, primarily recent R&D acquisitions and integration expenses, cash flow from operations was $1.85 billion. 
The GAAP equivalents to our forecast metrics can be found in our earnings release issued this morning and posted on our website. 
Turning now to our U.S. Specialized Therapeutics results on Slide 22. The business continued to deliver strong performance year-over-year. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics revenue was $1.5 billion for the quarter, up 11% versus the prior year period, driven by strong growth across Medical Aesthetics of 15%, Eye Care of 10% and strong growth in Botox therapeutics of 17%. 
Key products performed well with Botox, RESTASIS, Fillers and the launch of KYBELLA as key contributors to the strong performance. Gross margin remained high at approximately 95%. 
SG&A increased as a result of an increase in promotion efforts, including sales force expansion and launch costs related to KYBELLA. 
Turning to Slide 23. Our U.S. General Medicine business' second quarter revenues was $1.45 billion, reflecting the loss of $229 million of sales of Namenda IR, which lost exclusivity last year. 
Adjusting for this impact, sales grew 5%, driven by our strength in our key products, including Linzess and Lo Loestrin and new product launches of Viberzi and Vraylar. Second quarter gross margins continued to be stable at approximately 85%. 
Sequentially, SG&A increased slightly as a result of Viberzi and Vraylar promotional spend and sales force expansion related to these launches. 
Turning to Slide 24 and our International Brands results. Second quarter revenues were $757 million versus $717 million in the prior year period. Excluding FX, international revenues in the second quarter grew 10%, driven by continued strong growth of Botox, Fillers and Eye Care, driven by strong sales of Ozurdex. 
Gross margins were 84.8% in the second quarter. Segment SG&A was $238 million, up 3% versus prior year, driven by new product launches, including BELKYRA or KYBELLA in the U.S., XEN, earFold and Constella. 
Contribution margins improved versus prior year quarter from 52.2% to 53.4% reflecting continued strong sales growth. 
Turning to Slide 25, which details our debt capitalization. We have strengthened our balance sheet significantly with a continued pay down of debt following the close of the Teva transaction. 
Since Q1, and following the close of the sale of our Generics business to Teva, we reduced our total debt position by approximately $9 billion in line with our previous commitment. As a result, all of our outstanding term loans have been fully paid off. We also terminated our $1 billion revolving credit facility, and we expect to renew this facility in the next few weeks. 
We continue to believe that there is no better investment than in our own fast-growing company. We plan to commence our share repurchase very shortly, and we plan to execute $5 billion by the end of the year, buying as much as prudently possible in open market purchases subject to favorable market conditions. 
Note that the Allergan board has authorized up to $10 billion in share repurchases, and we expect to provide an update on our share repurchases in our next earnings release. 
Turning to Slide 26. Let me make a few comments on our 2016 full year guidance. We are refining our guidance to now include EPS as well as removing Anda. We expect full year 2016 branded revenues to be $14.75 billion to $15 billion. Note that reported net revenues will be lower by approximately $100 million reflecting the impact of our branded products, which are sold through Anda, and are required to be accounted for in discontinued operations. 
Note that revenues will be back-half weighted as a result of contribution from launches being greater in the second half and typical pharma seasonality. Our gross margins will remain strong at approximately 88.5%. We expect non-GAAP SG&A -- actually, our gross margins will remain strong at approximately 89%. We expect non-GAAP SG&A of approximately $4 billion, reflecting our investment in new product launches and continued prudent G&A spend. Non-GAAP R&D spend is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion as a result of the many important late-stage programs advancing in our pipeline, including the commencement of Phase III programs of Rapastinel and ubrogepant. 
We anticipate interest expense in the range of $1.3 billion or even slightly lower. Our tax rate for the full year is anticipated to be approximately 9%. Our tax rate should begin to trend upward toward normalized levels in 2017. 
Our share count of 413 million shares includes approximately $5 billion in share repurchases that we plan to execute throughout the remainder of the year. 
Turning to Slide 27. I am proud of our accomplishments as a growth-oriented, pure-branded company. The actions that we have taken this year to simplify our business, combined with strong revenue performance, have truly uncovered our industry-leading profitability as shown in the chart. 
We will continue to focus on strong top line growth as we look to the future. Besides revenue growth and cash generation, the 2 additional financial metrics that we watch very closely are gross margins and operating margins. Our goal is to remain among the leaders in the industry in both gross margins in the 88% range and in operating margins, we are trending in the range of 53%. Our operating margins will continue to expand as we fully realize the potential of our growing revenues, while investing in selling and marketing and maintaining an efficient G&A base. 
This should translate into strong cash flow generation, which will further maximize shareholder value. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent for closing remarks."

And we -- as we've announced recently, we are initiating studies for Botox in platysma, completing the Phase II study in Masseter, and we're evaluating the potential use of toxins in preventing some of the consequent -- atrial fibrillation following open heart surgery. You asked about the topical toxin. Well, we recently acquired the technology from Anterios. The technology is really useful to get large molecules potentially across the dermal barrier and indeed one use of that is potentially for Botox or for toxins like Botox, and we are presently finalizing our work on the formulation for use in some Medical Aesthetics studies.

I do think that the indication for Namzaric for new patients is going to make a difference. I also believe that the sequencing of IR to XR to Namzaric is important and some time has passed since we transitioned from IR to XR, which, I think, is important. And in terms of looking forward, I think, Namzaric could expand the use of combination therapy in the Alzheimer's category because it's superior to XR. We're going to launch a DTC campaign. That's the aim. I would say at minimum, though, it's going to shore up this business for the next several years so that we have something that's solidly trading in this $750 million to $800 million year range."

And I think we've kind of finally hit the point that we've been trying to get to over that period of time to a focused branded Growth Pharma innovative company, and we're very excited that we've gotten here. We just have to complete the final sale of the Anda business -- or the final sale, which is the Anda business to Teva. And then we've gotten this kind of 2 years of incredible transformation that's essentially behind us. As a result, I think that has changed the numbers. Obviously, when you sell a business, it is dilutive to both top and bottom line. And we've done a few of those things and that's always difficult for companies to do. But for us, strategically and, I think, prudently, it was the right move at the right time, and I think we did very good deals to get us there. I think with respect to the future, our goal or our aspiration is to continue to lead in top line growth. We are, I think, putting up arguably among the best, if not the best top line growth. That growth is broad-based. That growth is across all of our product lines. All of our most important products are growing faster than the top line average. And so we are in an incredibly strong position from a sales perspective. Obviously, on an EPS basis, we hope to see leverage on the bottom line. We've continued to lead, as Tessa said, in both gross margin and operating margins. You see that bleed through to the bottom line. You'll see that strengthen as we do things like buy back $5 billion to $10 billion worth of stock; as we continue to do deals that are growth-oriented, both accretive deals and some pipeline deals to make sure that we do it. But let's face it, the bottom line is our goal. It's difficult but quite simple, which is to maximize shareholder value over the long term.

G&A will probably remain relatively flat, and there's definitely opportunity there. And you will see obviously SG&A as a percentage of revenue decline over time.

We increased the size of our sales force by 20%, essentially adding 60 more representatives. We increased the investment in direct-to-consumer advertising. The sampling program, both on Restasis as well as in our artificial tears has been increased. Our coverage of ophthalmology and optometry will be greater in the second half of the year than it was in the first half of the year. We shored up formulary coverage at virtually every health plan across the country, both on the commercial and the Part D side. And those steps were taken to successfully launch Restasis MDPF. Of course, we're going to have an active company in the category in Shire. We're also going to launch True Tear, which is a nasal neurostimulator for dry eye. And so I like the way the second half of the year is going to look for Restasis, particularly given the incremental level of investment. As you know, we have a very highly-trained experienced sales force with great relationships in both areas of eye care, which is ophthalmology and optometry. There, of course, in addition to Restasis, is there's a big focus on a Viberzi, Vraylar and KYBELLA. And Viberzi looks and feels just like Linzess, that's on OTC conversion play. Vraylar is exceeding our expectations. The response that we've gotten from psychiatrists is -- it's exceptional. We're getting used across a broad range of patients. The prescriber base is climbing. And then, of course, we have KYBELLA, and we spent the first 6 months training injectors. It's very different than a pharmaceutical like Viberzi or Vraylar. I would describe the first day of launch for KYBELLA at September 1. We'll turn on consumer advertising. All of our e-commerce programs are now covering KYBELLA, and I would expect a significant step-up in sales on a quarterly basis for KYBELLA in the second half of the year. It's a great expansion of our injectable product line. It gets us into the lower face. It opens up, to a certain extent, the male market. Those are really the priorities. Of course Botox therapeutics is growing at a double-digit rate driven by migraine. We've only penetrated 6% of that market. I think, long term, it's going to be a growth driver, even in 2018 when the CGRP is launched. Hope that answers your question."

Shire experienced that with their own program with lifitegrast, the results from one study to the next can be variable and somewhat unpredictable.

The CRTH-2 program came out of some academic work showing changes in Prostaglandin D2 expression in male pattern baldness. So there is CRTH-2 receptor, the receptor for Prostaglandin D2. So we have genetic validation of the targets in male pattern baldness, and it's that genetic validation that we're exploiting with the compound that we acquired from Kythera along with KYBELLA."

Look, the only time in the last few years we've done a major transformational deal was when we bought legacy Allergan, and that was put in play and we got to act as a white knight. For the last few years, we have been very focused on stepping-stone deals. So it's not like it's a new strategy, despite our image perhaps or reputation in the market. We have been very focused on that, only acting on one transformational deal because it was a once-in-a-corporate-lifetime situation. I guess to the extent we look at the large-cap universe or the transformational set, we ran that analysis vis-à-vis during our stock buyback and believe that our stock is the most compelling investment we can make versus doing those types of deals. Now we've always been a flexible, nimble team. If some extraordinary situation presented itself, we would obviously evaluate it very closely. And if we felt it was in our shareholders' best interest long term, it's conceivable we can do that. But to be clear -- and Ken, I know you know this, our strategy is stepping-stones. We are not out looking for big trends for M&A. The odds are something compelling, becoming clear are exceptionally low, but they're not 0, and so you never say never. That would be silly in our situation to be close-minded and close off all avenues.

I think we've seen relative stability. I think what's happened in this environment with all the media and noise coming from the political season and everything else is that the payers are definitely involved in a little bit and so they're being more aggressive. I think where they're having their biggest success is where there is great competition or low innovation. And as you know, we have transitioned to a very different model with our recent launches and our pipeline. And I think we have said this many times, we think pricing our pipeline is going to be infinitely easier than pricing our current products, and we've done very well pricing our current products. So what -- I'd characterize the environment as tougher in kind of the me-too or highly competitive spaces that there are 4 drugs launching with relatively similar mechanisms and indications over a 12-month period, pricing dynamics are more challenging than they have been. If you're launching something like even Viberzi, where we can get a price that's almost 3x the price of Linzess because it's a 1 of 1 and novel mechanism, it's still pretty straightforward. Is that fair, Bill?"

And I would make one final comment. Keep in mind, our business is got good balance. 40% of the $15 billion, I wouldn't even describe as subject to the pricing pressures that we're talking about right now. When it comes to our commercial and Part D mix, it's well-balanced. And just generally speaking, we have exclusivity periods on our products that extend well into the 2020s, which means our pricing approach is aimed at garnering market share and real estate so to speak, and we price for the long term not the short term. And I do think that has a positive impact on the partnerships that we have with health plans."

And we both, I think, strongly believe that the opportunity in a market like China for a cash-pay Medical Aesthetics business is massive. Now we're growing incredibly strong, but off a relatively modest base. So we need to look at is there something more bold we can do there. Now the investment, I think, will be manageable. I don't think you'll see it make huge fluctuations in the numbers if we decide to do it, and the payback will be strong. So I don't think that should change anyway you think about -- but the investment shouldn't change anyway if you think about it, but rather we want to make sure that we continue to put up that growth.

We had a big week last week that was highlighted by the completion of the divestiture of our Global Generics business to Teva. With its completion and the announcement of our plans to sell our Anda Distribution Business, Allergan has taken major steps toward our goal of being a branded Growth Pharma leader. 
I am proud of the people who worked so hard for 12 months to make this divestiture a reality, and I'm even more proud that the Allergan team has remained so focused on execution during this time. You can see proof of that focus in the results we are announcing today. 
Turning to Slide 5. 2016 has been a year of tremendous positive transition for Allergan, and we are well-positioned to continue to deliver strong results powered by our Growth Pharma model. This model is built around 5 key elements: Top line growth, with a goal of double-digit growth; category leadership in each of our 7 therapeutic areas; customer intimacy; open science R&D to fuel innovation; and operational excellence. And our team is successfully executing on each of these elements. 
Turning to Slide 6. Top line sales of the branded business came in at $3.7 billion, up more than 9% compared to prior year, excluding Namenda IR, divestitures and FX. And the performance was broad-based with strong results from all aspects of our business. Six of our most important brands grew double digits globally, excluding FX, including Botox, up 16%, RESTASIS up 21%, Linzess up 37%, our family of Fillers, up 18%; Ozurdex, up 33%; and Lo Loestrin, up 28%. I'm very pleased and impressed with this performance. 
A key attribute of our team is launch excellence as demonstrated by the strong start for Viberzi, Vraylar and Kybella. We are also building on our therapeutic areas and 4 of the 7 grew by more than 15% this quarter. For example, GI was up 19%, Women's Health was up 34%, meanwhile, eye care, our largest therapeutic area, was up 10% and Medical Aesthetics, excluding medical dermatology, was up 14%. 
I'm very impressed with what our commercial teams continue to do every day to make Allergan the most dynamic and exciting company in our industry. Bill will talk more about the brand performance, recent launches and our international business in just a moment. 
On Slide 7. Strong top line performance and our continued focus on operational excellence and business simplification resulted in non-GAAP EPS of $3.35, which now excludes the results of Anda, our distribution business. 
For us, operational excellence is all about focusing on doing the little things very well to enable the organization to become more efficient, more productive and more profitable. With the creation of Rob Stewart's role as Chief Operating Officer, we have renewed energy on harmonizing systems and processes throughout the company and making targeted investments to upgrade critical capabilities. 
And our Open Science R&D model is working to drive innovation across each of our 7 therapeutic areas. Just this year, our R&D team has succeeded in gaining approval for 13 major pharma and device products and 9 major submissions. David will provide more details later in the presentation. 
Open Science provides us with a compelling, competitive, strategic advantage as evidenced by our 65-plus mid- to late-stage development programs, many of which could be game-changing treatments. 
Turning to capital allocation on Slide 8. Our reloaded balance sheet provides us with significant flexibility to deploy capital to shareholders, including investing in our share repurchase program, debt repayment and additional investments in growth opportunities. 
We'll start with about $5 billion in share repurchase program during the rest of 2016, buying as much as prudently possible in the open market. As we have said before, if favorable market conditions persist, we have the capacity to consider buying the additional $5 billion under the $10 billion authorization provided by our Board of Directors. 
In addition to the share repurchase program, we had paid down debt, which should reinforce our investment-grade credit ratings. Tessa will provide additional details during her presentation. Even with those plans, we preserve capacity of more than $20 billion to invest for growth and acquire additional steppingstone assets to keep our pipeline full and provide fuel for sustainable top line growth in our therapeutic areas. Our goal is to maximize shareholder value over the long-term. 
Now let me hand the call over to Bill Meury, our Chief Commercial Officer."

Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 10. We had a strong quarter and our focus on category leadership is producing results, overall demand for our products is strong and implementation metrics on launch plans are high, which is a credit to our sales and marketing teams, domestically and internationally. 
Sales for 6 of 7 therapeutic areas increased at a high single-digit or double-digit rate versus prior year in the second quarter, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and divestitures. 
In eye care, sales increased by 10%, powered by continued strength in RESTASIS and Ozurdex. Sales for RESTASIS increased by 21% based on strong physician and consumer promotion and widespread formulary coverage. 
Ozurdex continued to deliver strong results globally with 30% growth in the United States and 34% growth in international markets, driven by its expanded diabetic macular edema label. 
In Aesthetics, sales increased by 14%, driven by continued strong performance from Botox and Fillers. In fact, Botox had its strongest quarter in the United States in the last 2 years. Additionally, we've laid a strong foundation to drive demand in the second half of the year and in 2017 as well. The prospects for this business and the market dynamics in the future are excellent, more on that shortly. In GI, Linzess, our flagship product, continued to produce outstanding results, up 37%, year-over-year, and importantly, Viberzi is off to a strong start. Now in its second full quarter postlaunch, prescriptions and writers [ph] are climbing at a high rate consistently week-over-week. 
And finally, we continue to see some growth in our Women's Health, urology and anti-infective businesses. 
On Slide 11, you can see the demand for Linzess and Viberzi is very strong. For both products, growth has and will continue to be fueled by conversion of the OTC market, increased use by both gastroenterologist and primary care physicians and market-leading promotion and formulary coverage. 
For Viberzi, our newest GI product, the number of prescribers doubled in the second quarter and physician feedback has been positive. Based on sales, Viberzi is trending at approximately 90% of Linzess during the same time period, postlaunch. 
Turning to Slide 12, on KYBELLA, which is indicated for submental fat reduction or double chin. Strategically, KYBELLA expands our facial injectable product line, which includes Botox and our Fillers. KYBELLA pioneers a new category of facial injectables. It will serve as a gateway to the lower face and will open up an entirely new market of consumers, including males. 
And finally, KYBELLA will serve as a true practice builder for our customers, including dermatologists and plastic surgeons. We've organized a launch into 2 phases. We successfully completed the first phase, training more than 9,000 or 90% of the key injector base in the United States. We're exactly where we need to be in terms of physician education and training. We're now in the process of kicking off Phase II, where we are creating awareness and demand among consumers, which will be boosted by our DTC campaign beginning this month. 
This product is an important growth driver and will fortify our leadership position in aesthetic medicine. Our R&D team is working on developing additional new aesthetic and therapeutic indications for KYBELLA, which, when added to the submental fat, indication could make KYBELLA as large as Botox cosmetic over time. 
Turning to Slide 13, and Vraylar. Vraylar was launched in mid-March in the United States for schizophrenia and mania. Interest by psychiatrist and select primary care physicians is very high. We've had multiple educational events where the attendance reached approximately 100 physicians. We're very encouraged by what we're seeing and hearing right now. Approximately 4,000 psychiatrists have used Vraylar, and we expect that number to climb to 10,000 by year-end. 
Based on solid performance so far, we're expanding our sales force coverage of hospitals and mental health facilities. As you can see on the slide, prescription levels for Vraylar are comparable to 2 recent and successfully launched atypical antipsychotics, Latuda and Rexulti. We do see a changing of the guard over time in this market with new atypicals replacing the older ones. The future of Vraylar can be described as nothing but very promising. 
Turning to Slide 14, in our Eye Care franchise. We are continuing to add to our position as a leading Eye Care company with innovative products for dry eye and glaucoma. We expect to launch Restasis MDPF in the fourth quarter and then True Tear, which is a nasal neuro stimulator in the first quarter of 2017. So we have 2 new products for dry eye to complement Restasis and our marketed artificial tear product line. Both launches will be supported by our largest sales force ever to ophthalmologists and optometrists and extensive consumer advertising and education. 
The prospects for growth of dry eye market are excellent. The condition is receiving more attention due to its impact on vision, postop outcomes and quality of life. It's widely recognized, whether it's mild or sight threatening, dry eye should be treated more aggressively. 
Allergan is fully committed to this area and with multiple products on the market and in development. In terms of glaucoma, we have our XEN Gel Stent which is a minimally invasive procedure to lower IOP. In fact, it may turn out to be the most effective new pressure lowering agent on the market. Glaucoma is on the verge of a transformation. For decades, eye drop therapy has been the standard of care. Looking forward, minimally-invasive filtering or surgical procedures will reduce or eliminate the need for eye drops, which are effective but are, of course, associated with low compliance rates. 
XEN was recently launched in 10 international markets, and we look forward to its potential approval and launch in the United States next year. 
Turning to Slide 15, our international business. Sales in our international business totaled more than $750 million in the second quarter, a 10% increase versus prior year. 
Western Europe is our largest region, and we expect Asia-Pacific will be our leading international growth contributor. Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care anchor our business internationally. Sales for our Medical Aesthetics business increased at a double-digit rate in every international region. 
Sales for Botox and our Fillers line specifically were up 13% and 23%, respectively. The Medical Aesthetics market is poised for major expansion over the next several years for a number of reasons: First, attitudes toward Aesthetics are changing around the world. Awareness and demand is rising from Europe to Asia-Pacific to Latin America; second, more physicians are practicing aesthetic medicine every day. In fact, I was in Shanghai last month meeting with our Asia-Pacific country managers and customers and the interest and enthusiasm for our products was remarkable and finally, disposable incomes and purchasing power are climbing. Aspirationally, our global business, our Medical Aesthetics business could double over time. 
In terms of eye care, glaucoma is our largest product line and Retina is the fastest growing. In glaucoma, we are launching a multi-dose preservative formulation of Ganfort and our new surgical procedure, XEN, will be launched in more than 20 countries over the next 2 years. 
In Retina, sales for Ozurdex, which is a dexamethasone implant, were up 34% in the second quarter. This product has been a big commercial success internationally and is being used as an alternative to anti-VEGF therapy for diabetic macular edema. Ozurdex has a very strong following in Western Europe and in 2017, we will expand geographically with launches in Brazil and Australia. 
On Slide 16, we look ahead for our commercial business. Our strategy is sound. New launches are our focus and will continue to drive growth across our therapeutic areas. In 2016, we'll continue to focus our efforts on supporting the launches of Viberzi, Vraylar and KYBELLA, which we talked about. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we will launch not only Restasis MDPF, which I mentioned earlier, but also Byvalson, which is a fixed-dose combination of Bystolic and valsartan, Linzess 72-microgram, a low-dose formulation of Linzess, which is designed to accelerate conversion of the OTC category and a new indication for Namzaric, which is designed to increase the use of combination therapy in the Alzheimer's category. 
Finally, early commercialization activities are underway to support our 2017 launches. XEN, True Tear, formally known as Oculeve, and Oxymetazoline for rosacea, which we're now calling Rhofade. 
Internationally, we're creating a GI foothold in Europe with the launches of Constella and Qberzi [ph], which is Viberzi in the United States. We'll continue to invest behind and leverage our platform of capabilities, which includes highly effective physician and consumer e-commerce programs and our well-trained and customized field force. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David."

We have continued to deliver on our strong track record of productivity. 
Year-to-date, we have achieved 13 major pharma and device approvals. We've also achieved 9 major regulatory submissions with 3 major submissions in Q2. A very strong first half of 2016 delivered by our great R&D team with Allergan. I'm not going to talk about everything on this slide, but I would like to talk about a few of our Q2 highlights. Approvals. We obtained approvals globally to further enhance our Medical Aesthetics franchise, including Juvederm, Volbella for lip augmentation and correction of perioral lines in adults in the U.S. The Japanese regulatory authorities approved the use of Botox Vista for crow's feet lines. We also received a CE mark in the European Union for Juvederm Volite containing lidocaine. 
For our cardiovascular franchise, we received FDA approval for Byvalson, a combination of nebivolol and valsartan, for the treatment of hypertension. In CNS, along with our partner, Adamas Pharmaceutical, we received approval for a new expanded label for Namzaric. This expanded label, with lower dose combination, allows patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's, who are currently stabilized on Aricept, to start combination therapy directly with Namzaric. 
Regarding submissions. The FDA accepted for review our sNDA for the 72-microgram dose of linaclotide for use in the treatment of adults with chronic idiopathic constipation. The FDA accepted our 510(k) notification for the XEN glaucoma stent that Bill mentioned in his presentation. 
We filed an application with the FDA for True Tear, to increase natural tear production in patients with dry eye disease. Our ultimate goal is to show improvement in both the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease with this device. 
We initiated a Phase IIa proof-of-concept study for Setipiprant, our CRTH-2 antagonist, for enhancement of scalp hair growth. 
Turning to Slide 19. I'm looking ahead towards near-term pipeline highlight. We have a robust stream of approvals, submissions and development milestones for the remainder of 2016 and 2017. Again, I won't cover everything on this slide, but I do want to mention a few highlights. 
First, upcoming approvals. In Medical Aesthetics, we expect to receive approval in many countries in the EU for KYBELLA, known as BELKYRA internationally in the second half of this year. This is one of several international approvals expected in 2016 and 2017 for this agent. Following FDA acceptance of our NDA for Oxymetazoline, Rhofade, for the topical treatment of rosacea in adults, we anticipate approval early next year. 
In Eye Care, we have addressed questions from the FDA and resubmitted our NDA for Restasis MDPF, and we anticipate approval in the fourth quarter of 2016. As a reminder, the Restasis MDPF bottle utilizes a first-of-its-kind container with patented unidirectional valves and air filter technology. Following acceptance of our submissions by FDA, we also expect to receive approval for True Tear and XEN in 2017, as Bill mentioned earlier. 
And in GI, we expect to receive approval for our 72-microgram formulation of Linzess for CIC patients. 
Submissions. In Medical Aesthetics, we will continue to submit additional applications worldwide for Botox and KYBELLA. Also, we expect to announce top line Phase III results and submit an NDA for sarecycline, our next-generation oral tetracycline for acne in 2017. Remember that this program would put us into a new acne category, oral antibiotics, and may offer patients a lower GI side effect profile, a more flexible dosing than other products currently on the market. 
In CNS, we plan to submit an NDA for Semprana, an inhalable dihydroergotamine treatment, for acute migraine later this year. We have a great team working on this project, and they have resolved the issues raised by the FDA during their previous review. We now have to tackle issues related to scale up and manufacturability. 
Development milestones. In Medical Aesthetics, we are set to begin a Phase III study for Latanoprost in submental fat in 2017. In Eye Care, enrollment in our Phase III programs for Abicipar is going very well. It's on track for completion in the second half of 2017. 
Excitement is high regarding our Bimatoprost SR program. The challenges remain regarding the timing of the enrollment of our Phase III studies, utilizing both drops and an implant. We now expect to complete enrollment for this study in late 2017. 
In CNS, we have a number of updates for our development programs. Allergan and Gedeon Richter recently provided an update on our cariprazine program. The top line results from our latest Phase III study evaluating the safety and efficacy of cariprazine, as adjunctive therapy to antidepressants in major depressive disorder, did not meet the primary endpoint, not uncommon for these types of trials to be negative or to fail. Antidepressants on the market today have failed 1 or more clinical trials in the quest to get the requisite 2 positive clinical studies required for approval. 
Remember, we have already completed 1 positive trial in this indication. Both companies have agreed to move forward with additional Phase III evaluation in MDD to support a potential indication. 
We've also continued positive discussions with the FDA on an sNDA submission for an indication of prevention of recurrence in patients with schizophrenia, where we have the necessary positive study, and we continue to work with the FDA on the regulatory path forward for a potential indication, the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. All in all, this represents important progress towards additional indications for cariprazine for the treatment of patients with these conditions. 
Regarding our muscarinic receptor agonist development programs with Heptares, we expect to enter Phase I clinical studies in 2017. These compounds are novel, subtype, selective muscarinic receptor agonists in development for the treatment of the range of CNS disorders with a potential upside of better tolerability and a more pronounced effect compared with available agents. 
Finally, our oral CGRP program. As promised, we have initiated a Phase III trial for our lead compound, ubrogepant, for the acute treatment of migraine. 
Atogepant, the second compound for migraine prophylaxis, will enter Phase IIb trials in the second half of this year. As I've outlined, the first half of 2016 has marked tremendous results for our R&D team. There are many more milestones ahead of us for the remainder of the year and into 2017. The breadth of our pipeline matched with our therapeutic area leadership validates our Open Science approach to innovation. 
As always, I thank our global R&D team for their outstanding work and dedication in driving innovation in achieving these results and for their commitment to the work ahead for the patients we serve. 
Now I will turn the call over to Tessa."
36478,374033817,1030415,"Allergan plc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2016",2016-08-08,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Please note that this discussion of financial results reflect continuing operations which now excludes both the Global Generics business, which was sold to Teva on August 2, as well as the Anda Distribution business,",1220,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Please note that this discussion of financial results reflect continuing operations which now excludes both the Global Generics business, which was sold to Teva on August 2, as well as the Anda Distribution business, of which we announced the sale to Teva on August 3. All prior periods in this presentation reflect the exclusion of Anda and the Generics business as well. 
Turning to our overall results for the second quarter of 2016 on Slide 21. In the second quarter, we delivered strong year-over-year performance. On a GAAP basis, continuing operations net revenues, which now exclude Anda Distribution, were $3.7 billion, a 2% increase versus prior year, reflecting strong growth of key products and the impact of the loss of exclusivity for Namenda IR in July 2015. Excluding Namenda IR, divestitures and FX, revenues increased 9.3%. Gross margin for the second quarter was very strong at 88%. Operating margins were also very strong exceeding 50%. Operating margins declined versus last year as a result of an increase in R&D, reflecting the increased number of Phase III programs underway and an increase in SG&A. 
The increase in SG&A was primarily driven by higher selling and marketing expenses related to the 3 major ongoing launches this year of Viberzi, KYBELLA and Vraylar. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share forecast of $3.35 reflect the loss of exclusivity of Namenda IR when compared with the second quarter of 2015. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 7.1% in the quarter. This rate remains low as the result of our entire interest expense being allocated to continuing operations earnings. The divestiture of Anda, which is a U.S. company, also further reduce the tax rate for continuing operations. 
Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $1.4 billion, excluding adjustments, primarily recent R&D acquisitions and integration expenses, cash flow from operations was $1.85 billion. 
The GAAP equivalents to our forecast metrics can be found in our earnings release issued this morning and posted on our website. 
Turning now to our U.S. Specialized Therapeutics results on Slide 22. The business continued to deliver strong performance year-over-year. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics revenue was $1.5 billion for the quarter, up 11% versus the prior year period, driven by strong growth across Medical Aesthetics of 15%, Eye Care of 10% and strong growth in Botox therapeutics of 17%. 
Key products performed well with Botox, RESTASIS, Fillers and the launch of KYBELLA as key contributors to the strong performance. Gross margin remained high at approximately 95%. 
SG&A increased as a result of an increase in promotion efforts, including sales force expansion and launch costs related to KYBELLA. 
Turning to Slide 23. Our U.S. General Medicine business' second quarter revenues was $1.45 billion, reflecting the loss of $229 million of sales of Namenda IR, which lost exclusivity last year. 
Adjusting for this impact, sales grew 5%, driven by our strength in our key products, including Linzess and Lo Loestrin and new product launches of Viberzi and Vraylar. Second quarter gross margins continued to be stable at approximately 85%. 
Sequentially, SG&A increased slightly as a result of Viberzi and Vraylar promotional spend and sales force expansion related to these launches. 
Turning to Slide 24 and our International Brands results. Second quarter revenues were $757 million versus $717 million in the prior year period. Excluding FX, international revenues in the second quarter grew 10%, driven by continued strong growth of Botox, Fillers and Eye Care, driven by strong sales of Ozurdex. 
Gross margins were 84.8% in the second quarter. Segment SG&A was $238 million, up 3% versus prior year, driven by new product launches, including BELKYRA or KYBELLA in the U.S., XEN, earFold and Constella. 
Contribution margins improved versus prior year quarter from 52.2% to 53.4% reflecting continued strong sales growth. 
Turning to Slide 25, which details our debt capitalization. We have strengthened our balance sheet significantly with a continued pay down of debt following the close of the Teva transaction. 
Since Q1, and following the close of the sale of our Generics business to Teva, we reduced our total debt position by approximately $9 billion in line with our previous commitment. As a result, all of our outstanding term loans have been fully paid off. We also terminated our $1 billion revolving credit facility, and we expect to renew this facility in the next few weeks. 
We continue to believe that there is no better investment than in our own fast-growing company. We plan to commence our share repurchase very shortly, and we plan to execute $5 billion by the end of the year, buying as much as prudently possible in open market purchases subject to favorable market conditions. 
Note that the Allergan board has authorized up to $10 billion in share repurchases, and we expect to provide an update on our share repurchases in our next earnings release. 
Turning to Slide 26. Let me make a few comments on our 2016 full year guidance. We are refining our guidance to now include EPS as well as removing Anda. We expect full year 2016 branded revenues to be $14.75 billion to $15 billion. Note that reported net revenues will be lower by approximately $100 million reflecting the impact of our branded products, which are sold through Anda, and are required to be accounted for in discontinued operations. 
Note that revenues will be back-half weighted as a result of contribution from launches being greater in the second half and typical pharma seasonality. Our gross margins will remain strong at approximately 88.5%. We expect non-GAAP SG&A -- actually, our gross margins will remain strong at approximately 89%. We expect non-GAAP SG&A of approximately $4 billion, reflecting our investment in new product launches and continued prudent G&A spend. Non-GAAP R&D spend is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion as a result of the many important late-stage programs advancing in our pipeline, including the commencement of Phase III programs of Rapastinel and ubrogepant. 
We anticipate interest expense in the range of $1.3 billion or even slightly lower. Our tax rate for the full year is anticipated to be approximately 9%. Our tax rate should begin to trend upward toward normalized levels in 2017. 
Our share count of 413 million shares includes approximately $5 billion in share repurchases that we plan to execute throughout the remainder of the year. 
Turning to Slide 27. I am proud of our accomplishments as a growth-oriented, pure-branded company. The actions that we have taken this year to simplify our business, combined with strong revenue performance, have truly uncovered our industry-leading profitability as shown in the chart. 
We will continue to focus on strong top line growth as we look to the future. Besides revenue growth and cash generation, the 2 additional financial metrics that we watch very closely are gross margins and operating margins. Our goal is to remain among the leaders in the industry in both gross margins in the 88% range and in operating margins, we are trending in the range of 53%. Our operating margins will continue to expand as we fully realize the potential of our growing revenues, while investing in selling and marketing and maintaining an efficient G&A base. 
This should translate into strong cash flow generation, which will further maximize shareholder value. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent for closing remarks."

So we're expanding geographically in Medical Aesthetics, and we're expanding the number of indications that we have in Medical Aesthetics in Europe and the U.S. Of course, we're also looking at additional therapeutic uses of Botox, and we have the depression study ongoing, which we'll report out early next year, the Phase II data. And we -- as we've announced recently, we are initiating studies for Botox in platysma, completing the Phase II study in Masseter, and we're evaluating the potential use of toxins in preventing some of the consequent -- atrial fibrillation following open heart surgery. You asked about the topical toxin. Well, we recently acquired the technology from Anterios. The technology is really useful to get large molecules potentially across the dermal barrier and indeed one use of that is potentially for Botox or for toxins like Botox, and we are presently finalizing our work on the formulation for use in some Medical Aesthetics studies. The hyperhydrosis study that Anterios performed was finalized. You also asked about Medytox. Medytox should be -- will be submitting an IND before the end of this year, and we anticipate being able to perform clinical studies with the Medytox toxin early next year."

I do think that the indication for Namzaric for new patients is going to make a difference. I also believe that the sequencing of IR to XR to Namzaric is important and some time has passed since we transitioned from IR to XR, which, I think, is important. And in terms of looking forward, I think, Namzaric could expand the use of combination therapy in the Alzheimer's category because it's superior to XR. We're going to launch a DTC campaign. That's the aim. I would say at minimum, though, it's going to shore up this business for the next several years so that we have something that's solidly trading in this $750 million to $800 million year range."

And I think we've kind of finally hit the point that we've been trying to get to over that period of time to a focused branded Growth Pharma innovative company, and we're very excited that we've gotten here. We just have to complete the final sale of the Anda business -- or the final sale, which is the Anda business to Teva. And then we've gotten this kind of 2 years of incredible transformation that's essentially behind us. As a result, I think that has changed the numbers. Obviously, when you sell a business, it is dilutive to both top and bottom line. And we've done a few of those things and that's always difficult for companies to do. But for us, strategically and, I think, prudently, it was the right move at the right time, and I think we did very good deals to get us there. I think with respect to the future, our goal or our aspiration is to continue to lead in top line growth. We are, I think, putting up arguably among the best, if not the best top line growth. That growth is broad-based. That growth is across all of our product lines. All of our most important products are growing faster than the top line average. And so we are in an incredibly strong position from a sales perspective. Obviously, on an EPS basis, we hope to see leverage on the bottom line. We've continued to lead, as Tessa said, in both gross margin and operating margins. You see that bleed through to the bottom line. You'll see that strengthen as we do things like buy back $5 billion to $10 billion worth of stock; as we continue to do deals that are growth-oriented, both accretive deals and some pipeline deals to make sure that we do it. But let's face it, the bottom line is our goal. It's difficult but quite simple, which is to maximize shareholder value over the long term.

G&A will probably remain relatively flat, and there's definitely opportunity there. And you will see obviously SG&A as a percentage of revenue decline over time.

We increased the size of our sales force by 20%, essentially adding 60 more representatives. We increased the investment in direct-to-consumer advertising. The sampling program, both on Restasis as well as in our artificial tears has been increased. Our coverage of ophthalmology and optometry will be greater in the second half of the year than it was in the first half of the year. We shored up formulary coverage at virtually every health plan across the country, both on the commercial and the Part D side. And those steps were taken to successfully launch Restasis MDPF. Of course, we're going to have an active company in the category in Shire. We're also going to launch True Tear, which is a nasal neurostimulator for dry eye. And so I like the way the second half of the year is going to look for Restasis, particularly given the incremental level of investment. As you know, we have a very highly-trained experienced sales force with great relationships in both areas of eye care, which is ophthalmology and optometry. There, of course, in addition to Restasis, is there's a big focus on a Viberzi, Vraylar and KYBELLA. And Viberzi looks and feels just like Linzess, that's on OTC conversion play. Vraylar is exceeding our expectations. The response that we've gotten from psychiatrists is -- it's exceptional. We're getting used across a broad range of patients. The prescriber base is climbing. And then, of course, we have KYBELLA, and we spent the first 6 months training injectors. It's very different than a pharmaceutical like Viberzi or Vraylar. I would describe the first day of launch for KYBELLA at September 1. We'll turn on consumer advertising. All of our e-commerce programs are now covering KYBELLA, and I would expect a significant step-up in sales on a quarterly basis for KYBELLA in the second half of the year. It's a great expansion of our injectable product line. It gets us into the lower face. It opens up, to a certain extent, the male market. Those are really the priorities. Of course Botox therapeutics is growing at a double-digit rate driven by migraine. We've only penetrated 6% of that market. I think, long term, it's going to be a growth driver, even in 2018 when the CGRP is launched. Hope that answers your question."

Shire experienced that with their own program with lifitegrast, the results from one study to the next can be variable and somewhat unpredictable.

The CRTH-2 program came out of some academic work showing changes in Prostaglandin D2 expression in male pattern baldness. So there is CRTH-2 receptor, the receptor for Prostaglandin D2. So we have genetic validation of the targets in male pattern baldness, and it's that genetic validation that we're exploiting with the compound that we acquired from Kythera along with KYBELLA."

Look, the only time in the last few years we've done a major transformational deal was when we bought legacy Allergan, and that was put in play and we got to act as a white knight. For the last few years, we have been very focused on stepping-stone deals. So it's not like it's a new strategy, despite our image perhaps or reputation in the market. We have been very focused on that, only acting on one transformational deal because it was a once-in-a-corporate-lifetime situation. I guess to the extent we look at the large-cap universe or the transformational set, we ran that analysis vis-à-vis during our stock buyback and believe that our stock is the most compelling investment we can make versus doing those types of deals. Now we've always been a flexible, nimble team. If some extraordinary situation presented itself, we would obviously evaluate it very closely. And if we felt it was in our shareholders' best interest long term, it's conceivable we can do that. But to be clear -- and Ken, I know you know this, our strategy is stepping-stones. We are not out looking for big trends for M&A. The odds are something compelling, becoming clear are exceptionally low, but they're not 0, and so you never say never.

I think we've seen relative stability. I think what's happened in this environment with all the media and noise coming from the political season and everything else is that the payers are definitely involved in a little bit and so they're being more aggressive. I think where they're having their biggest success is where there is great competition or low innovation. And as you know, we have transitioned to a very different model with our recent launches and our pipeline. And I think we have said this many times, we think pricing our pipeline is going to be infinitely easier than pricing our current products, and we've done very well pricing our current products. So what -- I'd characterize the environment as tougher in kind of the me-too or highly competitive spaces that there are 4 drugs launching with relatively similar mechanisms and indications over a 12-month period, pricing dynamics are more challenging than they have been. If you're launching something like even Viberzi, where we can get a price that's almost 3x the price of Linzess because it's a 1 of 1 and novel mechanism, it's still pretty straightforward. Is that fair, Bill?"

And I would make one final comment. Keep in mind, our business is got good balance. 40% of the $15 billion, I wouldn't even describe as subject to the pricing pressures that we're talking about right now. When it comes to our commercial and Part D mix, it's well-balanced. And just generally speaking, we have exclusivity periods on our products that extend well into the 2020s, which means our pricing approach is aimed at garnering market share and real estate so to speak, and we price for the long term not the short term.

And we both, I think, strongly believe that the opportunity in a market like China for a cash-pay Medical Aesthetics business is massive. Now we're growing incredibly strong, but off a relatively modest base. So we need to look at is there something more bold we can do there. Now the investment, I think, will be manageable. I don't think you'll see it make huge fluctuations in the numbers if we decide to do it, and the payback will be strong. So I don't think that should change anyway you think about -- but the investment shouldn't change anyway if you think about it, but rather we want to make sure that we continue to put up that growth.

We had a big week last week that was highlighted by the completion of the divestiture of our Global Generics business to Teva. With its completion and the announcement of our plans to sell our Anda Distribution Business, Allergan has taken major steps toward our goal of being a branded Growth Pharma leader. 
I am proud of the people who worked so hard for 12 months to make this divestiture a reality, and I'm even more proud that the Allergan team has remained so focused on execution during this time. You can see proof of that focus in the results we are announcing today. 
Turning to Slide 5. 2016 has been a year of tremendous positive transition for Allergan, and we are well-positioned to continue to deliver strong results powered by our Growth Pharma model. This model is built around 5 key elements: Top line growth, with a goal of double-digit growth; category leadership in each of our 7 therapeutic areas; customer intimacy; open science R&D to fuel innovation; and operational excellence. And our team is successfully executing on each of these elements. 
Turning to Slide 6. Top line sales of the branded business came in at $3.7 billion, up more than 9% compared to prior year, excluding Namenda IR, divestitures and FX. And the performance was broad-based with strong results from all aspects of our business. Six of our most important brands grew double digits globally, excluding FX, including Botox, up 16%, RESTASIS up 21%, Linzess up 37%, our family of Fillers, up 18%; Ozurdex, up 33%; and Lo Loestrin, up 28%. I'm very pleased and impressed with this performance. 
A key attribute of our team is launch excellence as demonstrated by the strong start for Viberzi, Vraylar and Kybella. We are also building on our therapeutic areas and 4 of the 7 grew by more than 15% this quarter. For example, GI was up 19%, Women's Health was up 34%, meanwhile, eye care, our largest therapeutic area, was up 10% and Medical Aesthetics, excluding medical dermatology, was up 14%. 
I'm very impressed with what our commercial teams continue to do every day to make Allergan the most dynamic and exciting company in our industry. Bill will talk more about the brand performance, recent launches and our international business in just a moment. 
On Slide 7. Strong top line performance and our continued focus on operational excellence and business simplification resulted in non-GAAP EPS of $3.35, which now excludes the results of Anda, our distribution business. 
For us, operational excellence is all about focusing on doing the little things very well to enable the organization to become more efficient, more productive and more profitable. With the creation of Rob Stewart's role as Chief Operating Officer, we have renewed energy on harmonizing systems and processes throughout the company and making targeted investments to upgrade critical capabilities. 
And our Open Science R&D model is working to drive innovation across each of our 7 therapeutic areas. Just this year, our R&D team has succeeded in gaining approval for 13 major pharma and device products and 9 major submissions. David will provide more details later in the presentation. 
Open Science provides us with a compelling, competitive, strategic advantage as evidenced by our 65-plus mid- to late-stage development programs, many of which could be game-changing treatments. 
Turning to capital allocation on Slide 8. Our reloaded balance sheet provides us with significant flexibility to deploy capital to shareholders, including investing in our share repurchase program, debt repayment and additional investments in growth opportunities. 
We'll start with about $5 billion in share repurchase program during the rest of 2016, buying as much as prudently possible in the open market. As we have said before, if favorable market conditions persist, we have the capacity to consider buying the additional $5 billion under the $10 billion authorization provided by our Board of Directors. 
In addition to the share repurchase program, we had paid down debt, which should reinforce our investment-grade credit ratings. Tessa will provide additional details during her presentation. Even with those plans, we preserve capacity of more than $20 billion to invest for growth and acquire additional steppingstone assets to keep our pipeline full and provide fuel for sustainable top line growth in our therapeutic areas. Our goal is to maximize shareholder value over the long-term. 
Now let me hand the call over to Bill Meury, our Chief Commercial Officer."

Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 10. We had a strong quarter and our focus on category leadership is producing results, overall demand for our products is strong and implementation metrics on launch plans are high, which is a credit to our sales and marketing teams, domestically and internationally. 
Sales for 6 of 7 therapeutic areas increased at a high single-digit or double-digit rate versus prior year in the second quarter, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and divestitures. 
In eye care, sales increased by 10%, powered by continued strength in RESTASIS and Ozurdex. Sales for RESTASIS increased by 21% based on strong physician and consumer promotion and widespread formulary coverage. 
Ozurdex continued to deliver strong results globally with 30% growth in the United States and 34% growth in international markets, driven by its expanded diabetic macular edema label. 
In Aesthetics, sales increased by 14%, driven by continued strong performance from Botox and Fillers. In fact, Botox had its strongest quarter in the United States in the last 2 years. Additionally, we've laid a strong foundation to drive demand in the second half of the year and in 2017 as well. The prospects for this business and the market dynamics in the future are excellent, more on that shortly. In GI, Linzess, our flagship product, continued to produce outstanding results, up 37%, year-over-year, and importantly, Viberzi is off to a strong start. Now in its second full quarter postlaunch, prescriptions and writers [ph] are climbing at a high rate consistently week-over-week. 
And finally, we continue to see some growth in our Women's Health, urology and anti-infective businesses. 
On Slide 11, you can see the demand for Linzess and Viberzi is very strong. For both products, growth has and will continue to be fueled by conversion of the OTC market, increased use by both gastroenterologist and primary care physicians and market-leading promotion and formulary coverage. 
For Viberzi, our newest GI product, the number of prescribers doubled in the second quarter and physician feedback has been positive. Based on sales, Viberzi is trending at approximately 90% of Linzess during the same time period, postlaunch. 
Turning to Slide 12, on KYBELLA, which is indicated for submental fat reduction or double chin. Strategically, KYBELLA expands our facial injectable product line, which includes Botox and our Fillers. KYBELLA pioneers a new category of facial injectables. It will serve as a gateway to the lower face and will open up an entirely new market of consumers, including males. 
And finally, KYBELLA will serve as a true practice builder for our customers, including dermatologists and plastic surgeons. We've organized a launch into 2 phases. We successfully completed the first phase, training more than 9,000 or 90% of the key injector base in the United States. We're exactly where we need to be in terms of physician education and training. We're now in the process of kicking off Phase II, where we are creating awareness and demand among consumers, which will be boosted by our DTC campaign beginning this month. 
This product is an important growth driver and will fortify our leadership position in aesthetic medicine. Our R&D team is working on developing additional new aesthetic and therapeutic indications for KYBELLA, which, when added to the submental fat, indication could make KYBELLA as large as Botox cosmetic over time. 
Turning to Slide 13, and Vraylar. Vraylar was launched in mid-March in the United States for schizophrenia and mania. Interest by psychiatrist and select primary care physicians is very high. We've had multiple educational events where the attendance reached approximately 100 physicians. We're very encouraged by what we're seeing and hearing right now. Approximately 4,000 psychiatrists have used Vraylar, and we expect that number to climb to 10,000 by year-end. 
Based on solid performance so far, we're expanding our sales force coverage of hospitals and mental health facilities. As you can see on the slide, prescription levels for Vraylar are comparable to 2 recent and successfully launched atypical antipsychotics, Latuda and Rexulti. We do see a changing of the guard over time in this market with new atypicals replacing the older ones. The future of Vraylar can be described as nothing but very promising. 
Turning to Slide 14, in our Eye Care franchise. We are continuing to add to our position as a leading Eye Care company with innovative products for dry eye and glaucoma. We expect to launch Restasis MDPF in the fourth quarter and then True Tear, which is a nasal neuro stimulator in the first quarter of 2017. So we have 2 new products for dry eye to complement Restasis and our marketed artificial tear product line. Both launches will be supported by our largest sales force ever to ophthalmologists and optometrists and extensive consumer advertising and education. 
The prospects for growth of dry eye market are excellent. The condition is receiving more attention due to its impact on vision, postop outcomes and quality of life. It's widely recognized, whether it's mild or sight threatening, dry eye should be treated more aggressively. 
Allergan is fully committed to this area and with multiple products on the market and in development. In terms of glaucoma, we have our XEN Gel Stent which is a minimally invasive procedure to lower IOP. In fact, it may turn out to be the most effective new pressure lowering agent on the market. Glaucoma is on the verge of a transformation. For decades, eye drop therapy has been the standard of care. Looking forward, minimally-invasive filtering or surgical procedures will reduce or eliminate the need for eye drops, which are effective but are, of course, associated with low compliance rates. 
XEN was recently launched in 10 international markets, and we look forward to its potential approval and launch in the United States next year. 
Turning to Slide 15, our international business. Sales in our international business totaled more than $750 million in the second quarter, a 10% increase versus prior year. 
Western Europe is our largest region, and we expect Asia-Pacific will be our leading international growth contributor. Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care anchor our business internationally. Sales for our Medical Aesthetics business increased at a double-digit rate in every international region. 
Sales for Botox and our Fillers line specifically were up 13% and 23%, respectively. The Medical Aesthetics market is poised for major expansion over the next several years for a number of reasons: First, attitudes toward Aesthetics are changing around the world. Awareness and demand is rising from Europe to Asia-Pacific to Latin America; second, more physicians are practicing aesthetic medicine every day. In fact, I was in Shanghai last month meeting with our Asia-Pacific country managers and customers and the interest and enthusiasm for our products was remarkable and finally, disposable incomes and purchasing power are climbing. Aspirationally, our global business, our Medical Aesthetics business could double over time. 
In terms of eye care, glaucoma is our largest product line and Retina is the fastest growing. In glaucoma, we are launching a multi-dose preservative formulation of Ganfort and our new surgical procedure, XEN, will be launched in more than 20 countries over the next 2 years. 
In Retina, sales for Ozurdex, which is a dexamethasone implant, were up 34% in the second quarter. This product has been a big commercial success internationally and is being used as an alternative to anti-VEGF therapy for diabetic macular edema. Ozurdex has a very strong following in Western Europe and in 2017, we will expand geographically with launches in Brazil and Australia. 
On Slide 16, we look ahead for our commercial business. Our strategy is sound. New launches are our focus and will continue to drive growth across our therapeutic areas. In 2016, we'll continue to focus our efforts on supporting the launches of Viberzi, Vraylar and KYBELLA, which we talked about. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we will launch not only Restasis MDPF, which I mentioned earlier, but also Byvalson, which is a fixed-dose combination of Bystolic and valsartan, Linzess 72-microgram, a low-dose formulation of Linzess, which is designed to accelerate conversion of the OTC category and a new indication for Namzaric, which is designed to increase the use of combination therapy in the Alzheimer's category. 
Finally, early commercialization activities are underway to support our 2017 launches. XEN, True Tear, formally known as Oculeve, and Oxymetazoline for rosacea, which we're now calling Rhofade. 
Internationally, we're creating a GI foothold in Europe with the launches of Constella and Qberzi [ph], which is Viberzi in the United States. We'll continue to invest behind and leverage our platform of capabilities, which includes highly effective physician and consumer e-commerce programs and our well-trained and customized field force. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David."

We have continued to deliver on our strong track record of productivity. 
Year-to-date, we have achieved 13 major pharma and device approvals. We've also achieved 9 major regulatory submissions with 3 major submissions in Q2. A very strong first half of 2016 delivered by our great R&D team with Allergan. I'm not going to talk about everything on this slide, but I would like to talk about a few of our Q2 highlights. Approvals. We obtained approvals globally to further enhance our Medical Aesthetics franchise, including Juvederm, Volbella for lip augmentation and correction of perioral lines in adults in the U.S. The Japanese regulatory authorities approved the use of Botox Vista for crow's feet lines. We also received a CE mark in the European Union for Juvederm Volite containing lidocaine. 
For our cardiovascular franchise, we received FDA approval for Byvalson, a combination of nebivolol and valsartan, for the treatment of hypertension. In CNS, along with our partner, Adamas Pharmaceutical, we received approval for a new expanded label for Namzaric. This expanded label, with lower dose combination, allows patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's, who are currently stabilized on Aricept, to start combination therapy directly with Namzaric. 
Regarding submissions. The FDA accepted for review our sNDA for the 72-microgram dose of linaclotide for use in the treatment of adults with chronic idiopathic constipation. The FDA accepted our 510(k) notification for the XEN glaucoma stent that Bill mentioned in his presentation. 
We filed an application with the FDA for True Tear, to increase natural tear production in patients with dry eye disease. Our ultimate goal is to show improvement in both the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease with this device. 
We initiated a Phase IIa proof-of-concept study for Setipiprant, our CRTH-2 antagonist, for enhancement of scalp hair growth. 
Turning to Slide 19. I'm looking ahead towards near-term pipeline highlight. We have a robust stream of approvals, submissions and development milestones for the remainder of 2016 and 2017. Again, I won't cover everything on this slide, but I do want to mention a few highlights. 
First, upcoming approvals. In Medical Aesthetics, we expect to receive approval in many countries in the EU for KYBELLA, known as BELKYRA internationally in the second half of this year. This is one of several international approvals expected in 2016 and 2017 for this agent. Following FDA acceptance of our NDA for Oxymetazoline, Rhofade, for the topical treatment of rosacea in adults, we anticipate approval early next year. 
In Eye Care, we have addressed questions from the FDA and resubmitted our NDA for Restasis MDPF, and we anticipate approval in the fourth quarter of 2016. As a reminder, the Restasis MDPF bottle utilizes a first-of-its-kind container with patented unidirectional valves and air filter technology. Following acceptance of our submissions by FDA, we also expect to receive approval for True Tear and XEN in 2017, as Bill mentioned earlier. 
And in GI, we expect to receive approval for our 72-microgram formulation of Linzess for CIC patients. 
Submissions. In Medical Aesthetics, we will continue to submit additional applications worldwide for Botox and KYBELLA. Also, we expect to announce top line Phase III results and submit an NDA for sarecycline, our next-generation oral tetracycline for acne in 2017. Remember that this program would put us into a new acne category, oral antibiotics, and may offer patients a lower GI side effect profile, a more flexible dosing than other products currently on the market. 
In CNS, we plan to submit an NDA for Semprana, an inhalable dihydroergotamine treatment, for acute migraine later this year. We have a great team working on this project, and they have resolved the issues raised by the FDA during their previous review. We now have to tackle issues related to scale up and manufacturability. 
Development milestones. In Medical Aesthetics, we are set to begin a Phase III study for Latanoprost in submental fat in 2017. In Eye Care, enrollment in our Phase III programs for Abicipar is going very well. It's on track for completion in the second half of 2017. 
Excitement is high regarding our Bimatoprost SR program. The challenges remain regarding the timing of the enrollment of our Phase III studies, utilizing both drops and an implant. We now expect to complete enrollment for this study in late 2017. 
In CNS, we have a number of updates for our development programs. Allergan and Gedeon Richter recently provided an update on our cariprazine program. The top line results from our latest Phase III study evaluating the safety and efficacy of cariprazine, as adjunctive therapy to antidepressants in major depressive disorder, did not meet the primary endpoint, not uncommon for these types of trials to be negative or to fail. Antidepressants on the market today have failed 1 or more clinical trials in the quest to get the requisite 2 positive clinical studies required for approval. 
Remember, we have already completed 1 positive trial in this indication. Both companies have agreed to move forward with additional Phase III evaluation in MDD to support a potential indication. 
We've also continued positive discussions with the FDA on an sNDA submission for an indication of prevention of recurrence in patients with schizophrenia, where we have the necessary positive study, and we continue to work with the FDA on the regulatory path forward for a potential indication, the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. All in all, this represents important progress towards additional indications for cariprazine for the treatment of patients with these conditions. 
Regarding our muscarinic receptor agonist development programs with Heptares, we expect to enter Phase I clinical studies in 2017. These compounds are novel, subtype, selective muscarinic receptor agonists in development for the treatment of the range of CNS disorders with a potential upside of better tolerability and a more pronounced effect compared with available agents. 
Finally, our oral CGRP program. As promised, we have initiated a Phase III trial for our lead compound, ubrogepant, for the acute treatment of migraine. 
Atogepant, the second compound for migraine prophylaxis, will enter Phase IIb trials in the second half of this year. As I've outlined, the first half of 2016 has marked tremendous results for our R&D team. There are many more milestones ahead of us for the remainder of the year and into 2017. The breadth of our pipeline matched with our therapeutic area leadership validates our Open Science approach to innovation. 
As always, I thank our global R&D team for their outstanding work and dedication in driving innovation in achieving these results and for their commitment to the work ahead for the patients we serve. 
Now I will turn the call over to Tessa."
36478,374033817,1030593,"Allergan plc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2016",2016-08-08,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Please note that this discussion of financial results reflect continuing operations which now excludes both the Global Generics business, which was sold to Teva on August 2, as well as the Anda Distribution business,",1220,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Please note that this discussion of financial results reflect continuing operations which now excludes both the Global Generics business, which was sold to Teva on August 2, as well as the Anda Distribution business, of which we announced the sale to Teva on August 3. All prior periods in this presentation reflect the exclusion of Anda and the Generics business as well. 
Turning to our overall results for the second quarter of 2016 on Slide 21. In the second quarter, we delivered strong year-over-year performance. On a GAAP basis, continuing operations net revenues, which now exclude Anda Distribution, were $3.7 billion, a 2% increase versus prior year, reflecting strong growth of key products and the impact of the loss of exclusivity for Namenda IR in July 2015. Excluding Namenda IR, divestitures and FX, revenues increased 9.3%. Gross margin for the second quarter was very strong at 88%. Operating margins were also very strong exceeding 50%. Operating margins declined versus last year as a result of an increase in R&D, reflecting the increased number of Phase III programs underway and an increase in SG&A. 
The increase in SG&A was primarily driven by higher selling and marketing expenses related to the 3 major ongoing launches this year of Viberzi, KYBELLA and Vraylar. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share forecast of $3.35 reflect the loss of exclusivity of Namenda IR when compared with the second quarter of 2015. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 7.1% in the quarter. This rate remains low as the result of our entire interest expense being allocated to continuing operations earnings. The divestiture of Anda, which is a U.S. company, also further reduce the tax rate for continuing operations. 
Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $1.4 billion, excluding adjustments, primarily recent R&D acquisitions and integration expenses, cash flow from operations was $1.85 billion. 
The GAAP equivalents to our forecast metrics can be found in our earnings release issued this morning and posted on our website. 
Turning now to our U.S. Specialized Therapeutics results on Slide 22. The business continued to deliver strong performance year-over-year. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics revenue was $1.5 billion for the quarter, up 11% versus the prior year period, driven by strong growth across Medical Aesthetics of 15%, Eye Care of 10% and strong growth in Botox therapeutics of 17%. 
Key products performed well with Botox, RESTASIS, Fillers and the launch of KYBELLA as key contributors to the strong performance. Gross margin remained high at approximately 95%. 
SG&A increased as a result of an increase in promotion efforts, including sales force expansion and launch costs related to KYBELLA. 
Turning to Slide 23. Our U.S. General Medicine business' second quarter revenues was $1.45 billion, reflecting the loss of $229 million of sales of Namenda IR, which lost exclusivity last year. 
Adjusting for this impact, sales grew 5%, driven by our strength in our key products, including Linzess and Lo Loestrin and new product launches of Viberzi and Vraylar. Second quarter gross margins continued to be stable at approximately 85%. 
Sequentially, SG&A increased slightly as a result of Viberzi and Vraylar promotional spend and sales force expansion related to these launches. 
Turning to Slide 24 and our International Brands results. Second quarter revenues were $757 million versus $717 million in the prior year period. Excluding FX, international revenues in the second quarter grew 10%, driven by continued strong growth of Botox, Fillers and Eye Care, driven by strong sales of Ozurdex. 
Gross margins were 84.8% in the second quarter. Segment SG&A was $238 million, up 3% versus prior year, driven by new product launches, including BELKYRA or KYBELLA in the U.S., XEN, earFold and Constella. 
Contribution margins improved versus prior year quarter from 52.2% to 53.4% reflecting continued strong sales growth. 
Turning to Slide 25, which details our debt capitalization. We have strengthened our balance sheet significantly with a continued pay down of debt following the close of the Teva transaction. 
Since Q1, and following the close of the sale of our Generics business to Teva, we reduced our total debt position by approximately $9 billion in line with our previous commitment. As a result, all of our outstanding term loans have been fully paid off. We also terminated our $1 billion revolving credit facility, and we expect to renew this facility in the next few weeks. 
We continue to believe that there is no better investment than in our own fast-growing company. We plan to commence our share repurchase very shortly, and we plan to execute $5 billion by the end of the year, buying as much as prudently possible in open market purchases subject to favorable market conditions. 
Note that the Allergan board has authorized up to $10 billion in share repurchases, and we expect to provide an update on our share repurchases in our next earnings release. 
Turning to Slide 26. Let me make a few comments on our 2016 full year guidance. We are refining our guidance to now include EPS as well as removing Anda. We expect full year 2016 branded revenues to be $14.75 billion to $15 billion. Note that reported net revenues will be lower by approximately $100 million reflecting the impact of our branded products, which are sold through Anda, and are required to be accounted for in discontinued operations. 
Note that revenues will be back-half weighted as a result of contribution from launches being greater in the second half and typical pharma seasonality. Our gross margins will remain strong at approximately 88.5%. We expect non-GAAP SG&A -- actually, our gross margins will remain strong at approximately 89%. We expect non-GAAP SG&A of approximately $4 billion, reflecting our investment in new product launches and continued prudent G&A spend. Non-GAAP R&D spend is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion as a result of the many important late-stage programs advancing in our pipeline, including the commencement of Phase III programs of Rapastinel and ubrogepant. 
We anticipate interest expense in the range of $1.3 billion or even slightly lower. Our tax rate for the full year is anticipated to be approximately 9%. Our tax rate should begin to trend upward toward normalized levels in 2017. 
Our share count of 413 million shares includes approximately $5 billion in share repurchases that we plan to execute throughout the remainder of the year. 
Turning to Slide 27. I am proud of our accomplishments as a growth-oriented, pure-branded company. The actions that we have taken this year to simplify our business, combined with strong revenue performance, have truly uncovered our industry-leading profitability as shown in the chart. 
We will continue to focus on strong top line growth as we look to the future. Besides revenue growth and cash generation, the 2 additional financial metrics that we watch very closely are gross margins and operating margins. Our goal is to remain among the leaders in the industry in both gross margins in the 88% range and in operating margins, we are trending in the range of 53%. Our operating margins will continue to expand as we fully realize the potential of our growing revenues, while investing in selling and marketing and maintaining an efficient G&A base. 
This should translate into strong cash flow generation, which will further maximize shareholder value. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent for closing remarks."

So we're expanding geographically in Medical Aesthetics, and we're expanding the number of indications that we have in Medical Aesthetics in Europe and the U.S. Of course, we're also looking at additional therapeutic uses of Botox, and we have the depression study ongoing, which we'll report out early next year, the Phase II data. And we -- as we've announced recently, we are initiating studies for Botox in platysma, completing the Phase II study in Masseter, and we're evaluating the potential use of toxins in preventing some of the consequent -- atrial fibrillation following open heart surgery. You asked about the topical toxin. Well, we recently acquired the technology from Anterios. The technology is really useful to get large molecules potentially across the dermal barrier and indeed one use of that is potentially for Botox or for toxins like Botox, and we are presently finalizing our work on the formulation for use in some Medical Aesthetics studies. The hyperhydrosis study that Anterios performed was finalized. You also asked about Medytox. Medytox should be -- will be submitting an IND before the end of this year, and we anticipate being able to perform clinical studies with the Medytox toxin early next year."

I do think that the indication for Namzaric for new patients is going to make a difference. I also believe that the sequencing of IR to XR to Namzaric is important and some time has passed since we transitioned from IR to XR, which, I think, is important. And in terms of looking forward, I think, Namzaric could expand the use of combination therapy in the Alzheimer's category because it's superior to XR. We're going to launch a DTC campaign. That's the aim. I would say at minimum, though, it's going to shore up this business for the next several years so that we have something that's solidly trading in this $750 million to $800 million year range."

Now that your company has been through multiple iterations over the last few years and just massive change this year, we've seen numbers kind of come down across the board on revenues and earnings and that's largely due to the divestitures.

I recognize you're not prepared to give us on point estimates guidance today. But there are some sale numbers out there, the $25 number from 2017, for example.

And I think we've kind of finally hit the point that we've been trying to get to over that period of time to a focused branded Growth Pharma innovative company, and we're very excited that we've gotten here. We just have to complete the final sale of the Anda business -- or the final sale, which is the Anda business to Teva. And then we've gotten this kind of 2 years of incredible transformation that's essentially behind us. As a result, I think that has changed the numbers. Obviously, when you sell a business, it is dilutive to both top and bottom line. And we've done a few of those things and that's always difficult for companies to do. But for us, strategically and, I think, prudently, it was the right move at the right time, and I think we did very good deals to get us there. I think with respect to the future, our goal or our aspiration is to continue to lead in top line growth. We are, I think, putting up arguably among the best, if not the best top line growth. That growth is broad-based. That growth is across all of our product lines. All of our most important products are growing faster than the top line average. And so we are in an incredibly strong position from a sales perspective. Obviously, on an EPS basis, we hope to see leverage on the bottom line. We've continued to lead, as Tessa said, in both gross margin and operating margins. You see that bleed through to the bottom line. You'll see that strengthen as we do things like buy back $5 billion to $10 billion worth of stock; as we continue to do deals that are growth-oriented, both accretive deals and some pipeline deals to make sure that we do it. But let's face it, the bottom line is our goal. It's difficult but quite simple, which is to maximize shareholder value over the long term.

G&A will probably remain relatively flat, and there's definitely opportunity there. And you will see obviously SG&A as a percentage of revenue decline over time.

We increased the size of our sales force by 20%, essentially adding 60 more representatives. We increased the investment in direct-to-consumer advertising. The sampling program, both on Restasis as well as in our artificial tears has been increased. Our coverage of ophthalmology and optometry will be greater in the second half of the year than it was in the first half of the year. We shored up formulary coverage at virtually every health plan across the country, both on the commercial and the Part D side. And those steps were taken to successfully launch Restasis MDPF. Of course, we're going to have an active company in the category in Shire. We're also going to launch True Tear, which is a nasal neurostimulator for dry eye. And so I like the way the second half of the year is going to look for Restasis, particularly given the incremental level of investment. As you know, we have a very highly-trained experienced sales force with great relationships in both areas of eye care, which is ophthalmology and optometry. There, of course, in addition to Restasis, is there's a big focus on a Viberzi, Vraylar and KYBELLA. And Viberzi looks and feels just like Linzess, that's on OTC conversion play. Vraylar is exceeding our expectations. The response that we've gotten from psychiatrists is -- it's exceptional. We're getting used across a broad range of patients. The prescriber base is climbing. And then, of course, we have KYBELLA, and we spent the first 6 months training injectors. It's very different than a pharmaceutical like Viberzi or Vraylar. I would describe the first day of launch for KYBELLA at September 1. We'll turn on consumer advertising. All of our e-commerce programs are now covering KYBELLA, and I would expect a significant step-up in sales on a quarterly basis for KYBELLA in the second half of the year. It's a great expansion of our injectable product line. It gets us into the lower face. It opens up, to a certain extent, the male market. Those are really the priorities. Of course Botox therapeutics is growing at a double-digit rate driven by migraine. We've only penetrated 6% of that market. I think, long term, it's going to be a growth driver, even in 2018 when the CGRP is launched. Hope that answers your question."

Shire experienced that with their own program with lifitegrast, the results from one study to the next can be variable and somewhat unpredictable.

Look, the only time in the last few years we've done a major transformational deal was when we bought legacy Allergan, and that was put in play and we got to act as a white knight. For the last few years, we have been very focused on stepping-stone deals. So it's not like it's a new strategy, despite our image perhaps or reputation in the market. We have been very focused on that, only acting on one transformational deal because it was a once-in-a-corporate-lifetime situation. I guess to the extent we look at the large-cap universe or the transformational set, we ran that analysis vis-à-vis during our stock buyback and believe that our stock is the most compelling investment we can make versus doing those types of deals. Now we've always been a flexible, nimble team. If some extraordinary situation presented itself, we would obviously evaluate it very closely. And if we felt it was in our shareholders' best interest long term, it's conceivable we can do that. But to be clear -- and Ken, I know you know this, our strategy is stepping-stones. We are not out looking for big trends for M&A. The odds are something compelling, becoming clear are exceptionally low, but they're not 0, and so you never say never.

I think we've seen relative stability. I think what's happened in this environment with all the media and noise coming from the political season and everything else is that the payers are definitely involved in a little bit and so they're being more aggressive. I think where they're having their biggest success is where there is great competition or low innovation. And as you know, we have transitioned to a very different model with our recent launches and our pipeline. And I think we have said this many times, we think pricing our pipeline is going to be infinitely easier than pricing our current products, and we've done very well pricing our current products. So what -- I'd characterize the environment as tougher in kind of the me-too or highly competitive spaces that there are 4 drugs launching with relatively similar mechanisms and indications over a 12-month period, pricing dynamics are more challenging than they have been. If you're launching something like even Viberzi, where we can get a price that's almost 3x the price of Linzess because it's a 1 of 1 and novel mechanism, it's still pretty straightforward. Is that fair, Bill?"

That's not to say it's 0, but I would describe it as manageable. And I would second what Brent said about our pipeline, it's going to be easier to price than our marketed products. And I would make one final comment. Keep in mind, our business is got good balance. 40% of the $15 billion, I wouldn't even describe as subject to the pricing pressures that we're talking about right now. When it comes to our commercial and Part D mix, it's well-balanced. And just generally speaking, we have exclusivity periods on our products that extend well into the 2020s, which means our pricing approach is aimed at garnering market share and real estate so to speak, and we price for the long term not the short term. And I do think that has a positive impact on the partnerships that we have with health plans."

And we both, I think, strongly believe that the opportunity in a market like China for a cash-pay Medical Aesthetics business is massive. Now we're growing incredibly strong, but off a relatively modest base. So we need to look at is there something more bold we can do there. Now the investment, I think, will be manageable. I don't think you'll see it make huge fluctuations in the numbers if we decide to do it, and the payback will be strong. So I don't think that should change anyway you think about -- but the investment shouldn't change anyway if you think about it, but rather we want to make sure that we continue to put up that growth.

We had a big week last week that was highlighted by the completion of the divestiture of our Global Generics business to Teva. With its completion and the announcement of our plans to sell our Anda Distribution Business, Allergan has taken major steps toward our goal of being a branded Growth Pharma leader. 
I am proud of the people who worked so hard for 12 months to make this divestiture a reality, and I'm even more proud that the Allergan team has remained so focused on execution during this time. You can see proof of that focus in the results we are announcing today. 
Turning to Slide 5. 2016 has been a year of tremendous positive transition for Allergan, and we are well-positioned to continue to deliver strong results powered by our Growth Pharma model. This model is built around 5 key elements: Top line growth, with a goal of double-digit growth; category leadership in each of our 7 therapeutic areas; customer intimacy; open science R&D to fuel innovation; and operational excellence. And our team is successfully executing on each of these elements. 
Turning to Slide 6. Top line sales of the branded business came in at $3.7 billion, up more than 9% compared to prior year, excluding Namenda IR, divestitures and FX. And the performance was broad-based with strong results from all aspects of our business. Six of our most important brands grew double digits globally, excluding FX, including Botox, up 16%, RESTASIS up 21%, Linzess up 37%, our family of Fillers, up 18%; Ozurdex, up 33%; and Lo Loestrin, up 28%. I'm very pleased and impressed with this performance. 
A key attribute of our team is launch excellence as demonstrated by the strong start for Viberzi, Vraylar and Kybella. We are also building on our therapeutic areas and 4 of the 7 grew by more than 15% this quarter. For example, GI was up 19%, Women's Health was up 34%, meanwhile, eye care, our largest therapeutic area, was up 10% and Medical Aesthetics, excluding medical dermatology, was up 14%. 
I'm very impressed with what our commercial teams continue to do every day to make Allergan the most dynamic and exciting company in our industry. Bill will talk more about the brand performance, recent launches and our international business in just a moment. 
On Slide 7. Strong top line performance and our continued focus on operational excellence and business simplification resulted in non-GAAP EPS of $3.35, which now excludes the results of Anda, our distribution business. 
For us, operational excellence is all about focusing on doing the little things very well to enable the organization to become more efficient, more productive and more profitable. With the creation of Rob Stewart's role as Chief Operating Officer, we have renewed energy on harmonizing systems and processes throughout the company and making targeted investments to upgrade critical capabilities. 
And our Open Science R&D model is working to drive innovation across each of our 7 therapeutic areas. Just this year, our R&D team has succeeded in gaining approval for 13 major pharma and device products and 9 major submissions. David will provide more details later in the presentation. 
Open Science provides us with a compelling, competitive, strategic advantage as evidenced by our 65-plus mid- to late-stage development programs, many of which could be game-changing treatments. 
Turning to capital allocation on Slide 8. Our reloaded balance sheet provides us with significant flexibility to deploy capital to shareholders, including investing in our share repurchase program, debt repayment and additional investments in growth opportunities. 
We'll start with about $5 billion in share repurchase program during the rest of 2016, buying as much as prudently possible in the open market. As we have said before, if favorable market conditions persist, we have the capacity to consider buying the additional $5 billion under the $10 billion authorization provided by our Board of Directors. 
In addition to the share repurchase program, we had paid down debt, which should reinforce our investment-grade credit ratings. Tessa will provide additional details during her presentation. Even with those plans, we preserve capacity of more than $20 billion to invest for growth and acquire additional steppingstone assets to keep our pipeline full and provide fuel for sustainable top line growth in our therapeutic areas. Our goal is to maximize shareholder value over the long-term. 
Now let me hand the call over to Bill Meury, our Chief Commercial Officer."

Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 10. We had a strong quarter and our focus on category leadership is producing results, overall demand for our products is strong and implementation metrics on launch plans are high, which is a credit to our sales and marketing teams, domestically and internationally. 
Sales for 6 of 7 therapeutic areas increased at a high single-digit or double-digit rate versus prior year in the second quarter, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and divestitures. 
In eye care, sales increased by 10%, powered by continued strength in RESTASIS and Ozurdex. Sales for RESTASIS increased by 21% based on strong physician and consumer promotion and widespread formulary coverage. 
Ozurdex continued to deliver strong results globally with 30% growth in the United States and 34% growth in international markets, driven by its expanded diabetic macular edema label. 
In Aesthetics, sales increased by 14%, driven by continued strong performance from Botox and Fillers. In fact, Botox had its strongest quarter in the United States in the last 2 years. Additionally, we've laid a strong foundation to drive demand in the second half of the year and in 2017 as well. The prospects for this business and the market dynamics in the future are excellent, more on that shortly. In GI, Linzess, our flagship product, continued to produce outstanding results, up 37%, year-over-year, and importantly, Viberzi is off to a strong start. Now in its second full quarter postlaunch, prescriptions and writers [ph] are climbing at a high rate consistently week-over-week. 
And finally, we continue to see some growth in our Women's Health, urology and anti-infective businesses. 
On Slide 11, you can see the demand for Linzess and Viberzi is very strong. For both products, growth has and will continue to be fueled by conversion of the OTC market, increased use by both gastroenterologist and primary care physicians and market-leading promotion and formulary coverage. 
For Viberzi, our newest GI product, the number of prescribers doubled in the second quarter and physician feedback has been positive. Based on sales, Viberzi is trending at approximately 90% of Linzess during the same time period, postlaunch. 
Turning to Slide 12, on KYBELLA, which is indicated for submental fat reduction or double chin. Strategically, KYBELLA expands our facial injectable product line, which includes Botox and our Fillers. KYBELLA pioneers a new category of facial injectables. It will serve as a gateway to the lower face and will open up an entirely new market of consumers, including males. 
And finally, KYBELLA will serve as a true practice builder for our customers, including dermatologists and plastic surgeons. We've organized a launch into 2 phases. We successfully completed the first phase, training more than 9,000 or 90% of the key injector base in the United States. We're exactly where we need to be in terms of physician education and training. We're now in the process of kicking off Phase II, where we are creating awareness and demand among consumers, which will be boosted by our DTC campaign beginning this month. 
This product is an important growth driver and will fortify our leadership position in aesthetic medicine. Our R&D team is working on developing additional new aesthetic and therapeutic indications for KYBELLA, which, when added to the submental fat, indication could make KYBELLA as large as Botox cosmetic over time. 
Turning to Slide 13, and Vraylar. Vraylar was launched in mid-March in the United States for schizophrenia and mania. Interest by psychiatrist and select primary care physicians is very high. We've had multiple educational events where the attendance reached approximately 100 physicians. We're very encouraged by what we're seeing and hearing right now. Approximately 4,000 psychiatrists have used Vraylar, and we expect that number to climb to 10,000 by year-end. 
Based on solid performance so far, we're expanding our sales force coverage of hospitals and mental health facilities. As you can see on the slide, prescription levels for Vraylar are comparable to 2 recent and successfully launched atypical antipsychotics, Latuda and Rexulti. We do see a changing of the guard over time in this market with new atypicals replacing the older ones. The future of Vraylar can be described as nothing but very promising. 
Turning to Slide 14, in our Eye Care franchise. We are continuing to add to our position as a leading Eye Care company with innovative products for dry eye and glaucoma. We expect to launch Restasis MDPF in the fourth quarter and then True Tear, which is a nasal neuro stimulator in the first quarter of 2017. So we have 2 new products for dry eye to complement Restasis and our marketed artificial tear product line. Both launches will be supported by our largest sales force ever to ophthalmologists and optometrists and extensive consumer advertising and education. 
The prospects for growth of dry eye market are excellent. The condition is receiving more attention due to its impact on vision, postop outcomes and quality of life. It's widely recognized, whether it's mild or sight threatening, dry eye should be treated more aggressively. 
Allergan is fully committed to this area and with multiple products on the market and in development. In terms of glaucoma, we have our XEN Gel Stent which is a minimally invasive procedure to lower IOP. In fact, it may turn out to be the most effective new pressure lowering agent on the market. Glaucoma is on the verge of a transformation. For decades, eye drop therapy has been the standard of care. Looking forward, minimally-invasive filtering or surgical procedures will reduce or eliminate the need for eye drops, which are effective but are, of course, associated with low compliance rates. 
XEN was recently launched in 10 international markets, and we look forward to its potential approval and launch in the United States next year. 
Turning to Slide 15, our international business. Sales in our international business totaled more than $750 million in the second quarter, a 10% increase versus prior year. 
Western Europe is our largest region, and we expect Asia-Pacific will be our leading international growth contributor. Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care anchor our business internationally. Sales for our Medical Aesthetics business increased at a double-digit rate in every international region. 
Sales for Botox and our Fillers line specifically were up 13% and 23%, respectively. The Medical Aesthetics market is poised for major expansion over the next several years for a number of reasons: First, attitudes toward Aesthetics are changing around the world. Awareness and demand is rising from Europe to Asia-Pacific to Latin America; second, more physicians are practicing aesthetic medicine every day. In fact, I was in Shanghai last month meeting with our Asia-Pacific country managers and customers and the interest and enthusiasm for our products was remarkable and finally, disposable incomes and purchasing power are climbing. Aspirationally, our global business, our Medical Aesthetics business could double over time. 
In terms of eye care, glaucoma is our largest product line and Retina is the fastest growing. In glaucoma, we are launching a multi-dose preservative formulation of Ganfort and our new surgical procedure, XEN, will be launched in more than 20 countries over the next 2 years. 
In Retina, sales for Ozurdex, which is a dexamethasone implant, were up 34% in the second quarter. This product has been a big commercial success internationally and is being used as an alternative to anti-VEGF therapy for diabetic macular edema. Ozurdex has a very strong following in Western Europe and in 2017, we will expand geographically with launches in Brazil and Australia. 
On Slide 16, we look ahead for our commercial business. Our strategy is sound. New launches are our focus and will continue to drive growth across our therapeutic areas. In 2016, we'll continue to focus our efforts on supporting the launches of Viberzi, Vraylar and KYBELLA, which we talked about. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we will launch not only Restasis MDPF, which I mentioned earlier, but also Byvalson, which is a fixed-dose combination of Bystolic and valsartan, Linzess 72-microgram, a low-dose formulation of Linzess, which is designed to accelerate conversion of the OTC category and a new indication for Namzaric, which is designed to increase the use of combination therapy in the Alzheimer's category. 
Finally, early commercialization activities are underway to support our 2017 launches. XEN, True Tear, formally known as Oculeve, and Oxymetazoline for rosacea, which we're now calling Rhofade. 
Internationally, we're creating a GI foothold in Europe with the launches of Constella and Qberzi [ph], which is Viberzi in the United States. We'll continue to invest behind and leverage our platform of capabilities, which includes highly effective physician and consumer e-commerce programs and our well-trained and customized field force. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David."

We have continued to deliver on our strong track record of productivity. 
Year-to-date, we have achieved 13 major pharma and device approvals. We've also achieved 9 major regulatory submissions with 3 major submissions in Q2. A very strong first half of 2016 delivered by our great R&D team with Allergan. I'm not going to talk about everything on this slide, but I would like to talk about a few of our Q2 highlights. Approvals. We obtained approvals globally to further enhance our Medical Aesthetics franchise, including Juvederm, Volbella for lip augmentation and correction of perioral lines in adults in the U.S. The Japanese regulatory authorities approved the use of Botox Vista for crow's feet lines. We also received a CE mark in the European Union for Juvederm Volite containing lidocaine. 
For our cardiovascular franchise, we received FDA approval for Byvalson, a combination of nebivolol and valsartan, for the treatment of hypertension. In CNS, along with our partner, Adamas Pharmaceutical, we received approval for a new expanded label for Namzaric. This expanded label, with lower dose combination, allows patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's, who are currently stabilized on Aricept, to start combination therapy directly with Namzaric. 
Regarding submissions. The FDA accepted for review our sNDA for the 72-microgram dose of linaclotide for use in the treatment of adults with chronic idiopathic constipation. The FDA accepted our 510(k) notification for the XEN glaucoma stent that Bill mentioned in his presentation. 
We filed an application with the FDA for True Tear, to increase natural tear production in patients with dry eye disease. Our ultimate goal is to show improvement in both the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease with this device. 
We initiated a Phase IIa proof-of-concept study for Setipiprant, our CRTH-2 antagonist, for enhancement of scalp hair growth. 
Turning to Slide 19. I'm looking ahead towards near-term pipeline highlight. We have a robust stream of approvals, submissions and development milestones for the remainder of 2016 and 2017. Again, I won't cover everything on this slide, but I do want to mention a few highlights. 
First, upcoming approvals. In Medical Aesthetics, we expect to receive approval in many countries in the EU for KYBELLA, known as BELKYRA internationally in the second half of this year. This is one of several international approvals expected in 2016 and 2017 for this agent. Following FDA acceptance of our NDA for Oxymetazoline, Rhofade, for the topical treatment of rosacea in adults, we anticipate approval early next year. 
In Eye Care, we have addressed questions from the FDA and resubmitted our NDA for Restasis MDPF, and we anticipate approval in the fourth quarter of 2016. As a reminder, the Restasis MDPF bottle utilizes a first-of-its-kind container with patented unidirectional valves and air filter technology. Following acceptance of our submissions by FDA, we also expect to receive approval for True Tear and XEN in 2017, as Bill mentioned earlier. 
And in GI, we expect to receive approval for our 72-microgram formulation of Linzess for CIC patients. 
Submissions. In Medical Aesthetics, we will continue to submit additional applications worldwide for Botox and KYBELLA. Also, we expect to announce top line Phase III results and submit an NDA for sarecycline, our next-generation oral tetracycline for acne in 2017. Remember that this program would put us into a new acne category, oral antibiotics, and may offer patients a lower GI side effect profile, a more flexible dosing than other products currently on the market. 
In CNS, we plan to submit an NDA for Semprana, an inhalable dihydroergotamine treatment, for acute migraine later this year. We have a great team working on this project, and they have resolved the issues raised by the FDA during their previous review. We now have to tackle issues related to scale up and manufacturability. 
Development milestones. In Medical Aesthetics, we are set to begin a Phase III study for Latanoprost in submental fat in 2017. In Eye Care, enrollment in our Phase III programs for Abicipar is going very well. It's on track for completion in the second half of 2017. 
Excitement is high regarding our Bimatoprost SR program. The challenges remain regarding the timing of the enrollment of our Phase III studies, utilizing both drops and an implant. We now expect to complete enrollment for this study in late 2017. 
In CNS, we have a number of updates for our development programs. Allergan and Gedeon Richter recently provided an update on our cariprazine program. The top line results from our latest Phase III study evaluating the safety and efficacy of cariprazine, as adjunctive therapy to antidepressants in major depressive disorder, did not meet the primary endpoint, not uncommon for these types of trials to be negative or to fail. Antidepressants on the market today have failed 1 or more clinical trials in the quest to get the requisite 2 positive clinical studies required for approval. 
Remember, we have already completed 1 positive trial in this indication. Both companies have agreed to move forward with additional Phase III evaluation in MDD to support a potential indication. 
We've also continued positive discussions with the FDA on an sNDA submission for an indication of prevention of recurrence in patients with schizophrenia, where we have the necessary positive study, and we continue to work with the FDA on the regulatory path forward for a potential indication, the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. All in all, this represents important progress towards additional indications for cariprazine for the treatment of patients with these conditions. 
Regarding our muscarinic receptor agonist development programs with Heptares, we expect to enter Phase I clinical studies in 2017. These compounds are novel, subtype, selective muscarinic receptor agonists in development for the treatment of the range of CNS disorders with a potential upside of better tolerability and a more pronounced effect compared with available agents. 
Finally, our oral CGRP program. As promised, we have initiated a Phase III trial for our lead compound, ubrogepant, for the acute treatment of migraine. 
Atogepant, the second compound for migraine prophylaxis, will enter Phase IIb trials in the second half of this year. As I've outlined, the first half of 2016 has marked tremendous results for our R&D team. There are many more milestones ahead of us for the remainder of the year and into 2017. The breadth of our pipeline matched with our therapeutic area leadership validates our Open Science approach to innovation. 
As always, I thank our global R&D team for their outstanding work and dedication in driving innovation in achieving these results and for their commitment to the work ahead for the patients we serve. 
Now I will turn the call over to Tessa."
36478,374033817,1030594,"Allergan plc, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 08, 2016",2016-08-08,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Please note that this discussion of financial results reflect continuing operations which now excludes both the Global Generics business, which was sold to Teva on August 2, as well as the Anda Distribution business,",1220,"Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Please note that this discussion of financial results reflect continuing operations which now excludes both the Global Generics business, which was sold to Teva on August 2, as well as the Anda Distribution business, of which we announced the sale to Teva on August 3. All prior periods in this presentation reflect the exclusion of Anda and the Generics business as well. 
Turning to our overall results for the second quarter of 2016 on Slide 21. In the second quarter, we delivered strong year-over-year performance. On a GAAP basis, continuing operations net revenues, which now exclude Anda Distribution, were $3.7 billion, a 2% increase versus prior year, reflecting strong growth of key products and the impact of the loss of exclusivity for Namenda IR in July 2015. Excluding Namenda IR, divestitures and FX, revenues increased 9.3%. Gross margin for the second quarter was very strong at 88%. Operating margins were also very strong exceeding 50%. Operating margins declined versus last year as a result of an increase in R&D, reflecting the increased number of Phase III programs underway and an increase in SG&A. 
The increase in SG&A was primarily driven by higher selling and marketing expenses related to the 3 major ongoing launches this year of Viberzi, KYBELLA and Vraylar. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share forecast of $3.35 reflect the loss of exclusivity of Namenda IR when compared with the second quarter of 2015. 
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 7.1% in the quarter. This rate remains low as the result of our entire interest expense being allocated to continuing operations earnings. The divestiture of Anda, which is a U.S. company, also further reduce the tax rate for continuing operations. 
Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $1.4 billion, excluding adjustments, primarily recent R&D acquisitions and integration expenses, cash flow from operations was $1.85 billion. 
The GAAP equivalents to our forecast metrics can be found in our earnings release issued this morning and posted on our website. 
Turning now to our U.S. Specialized Therapeutics results on Slide 22. The business continued to deliver strong performance year-over-year. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics revenue was $1.5 billion for the quarter, up 11% versus the prior year period, driven by strong growth across Medical Aesthetics of 15%, Eye Care of 10% and strong growth in Botox therapeutics of 17%. 
Key products performed well with Botox, RESTASIS, Fillers and the launch of KYBELLA as key contributors to the strong performance. Gross margin remained high at approximately 95%. 
SG&A increased as a result of an increase in promotion efforts, including sales force expansion and launch costs related to KYBELLA. 
Turning to Slide 23. Our U.S. General Medicine business' second quarter revenues was $1.45 billion, reflecting the loss of $229 million of sales of Namenda IR, which lost exclusivity last year. 
Adjusting for this impact, sales grew 5%, driven by our strength in our key products, including Linzess and Lo Loestrin and new product launches of Viberzi and Vraylar. Second quarter gross margins continued to be stable at approximately 85%. 
Sequentially, SG&A increased slightly as a result of Viberzi and Vraylar promotional spend and sales force expansion related to these launches. 
Turning to Slide 24 and our International Brands results. Second quarter revenues were $757 million versus $717 million in the prior year period. Excluding FX, international revenues in the second quarter grew 10%, driven by continued strong growth of Botox, Fillers and Eye Care, driven by strong sales of Ozurdex. 
Gross margins were 84.8% in the second quarter. Segment SG&A was $238 million, up 3% versus prior year, driven by new product launches, including BELKYRA or KYBELLA in the U.S., XEN, earFold and Constella. 
Contribution margins improved versus prior year quarter from 52.2% to 53.4% reflecting continued strong sales growth. 
Turning to Slide 25, which details our debt capitalization. We have strengthened our balance sheet significantly with a continued pay down of debt following the close of the Teva transaction. 
Since Q1, and following the close of the sale of our Generics business to Teva, we reduced our total debt position by approximately $9 billion in line with our previous commitment. As a result, all of our outstanding term loans have been fully paid off. We also terminated our $1 billion revolving credit facility, and we expect to renew this facility in the next few weeks. 
We continue to believe that there is no better investment than in our own fast-growing company. We plan to commence our share repurchase very shortly, and we plan to execute $5 billion by the end of the year, buying as much as prudently possible in open market purchases subject to favorable market conditions. 
Note that the Allergan board has authorized up to $10 billion in share repurchases, and we expect to provide an update on our share repurchases in our next earnings release. 
Turning to Slide 26. Let me make a few comments on our 2016 full year guidance. We are refining our guidance to now include EPS as well as removing Anda. We expect full year 2016 branded revenues to be $14.75 billion to $15 billion. Note that reported net revenues will be lower by approximately $100 million reflecting the impact of our branded products, which are sold through Anda, and are required to be accounted for in discontinued operations. 
Note that revenues will be back-half weighted as a result of contribution from launches being greater in the second half and typical pharma seasonality. Our gross margins will remain strong at approximately 88.5%. We expect non-GAAP SG&A -- actually, our gross margins will remain strong at approximately 89%. We expect non-GAAP SG&A of approximately $4 billion, reflecting our investment in new product launches and continued prudent G&A spend. Non-GAAP R&D spend is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion as a result of the many important late-stage programs advancing in our pipeline, including the commencement of Phase III programs of Rapastinel and ubrogepant. 
We anticipate interest expense in the range of $1.3 billion or even slightly lower. Our tax rate for the full year is anticipated to be approximately 9%. Our tax rate should begin to trend upward toward normalized levels in 2017. 
Our share count of 413 million shares includes approximately $5 billion in share repurchases that we plan to execute throughout the remainder of the year. 
Turning to Slide 27. I am proud of our accomplishments as a growth-oriented, pure-branded company. The actions that we have taken this year to simplify our business, combined with strong revenue performance, have truly uncovered our industry-leading profitability as shown in the chart. 
We will continue to focus on strong top line growth as we look to the future. Besides revenue growth and cash generation, the 2 additional financial metrics that we watch very closely are gross margins and operating margins. Our goal is to remain among the leaders in the industry in both gross margins in the 88% range and in operating margins, we are trending in the range of 53%. Our operating margins will continue to expand as we fully realize the potential of our growing revenues, while investing in selling and marketing and maintaining an efficient G&A base. 
This should translate into strong cash flow generation, which will further maximize shareholder value. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent for closing remarks."

So we see this as, I think, David Pyott used to say, a pipeline and a product. We see that going for the next decade or more as a key growth driver for Allergan. David, you want to comment specifically on the pipeline, Medytox and the topical program?"

Clearly, during my presentation, I walked you through the recent and the forthcoming approvals and submissions for Botox, particularly in Medical Aesthetics, which includes Botox for headlines in the U.S. and Europe, Botox for crow's feet lines in China. So we're expanding geographically in Medical Aesthetics, and we're expanding the number of indications that we have in Medical Aesthetics in Europe and the U.S. Of course, we're also looking at additional therapeutic uses of Botox, and we have the depression study ongoing, which we'll report out early next year, the Phase II data. And we -- as we've announced recently, we are initiating studies for Botox in platysma, completing the Phase II study in Masseter, and we're evaluating the potential use of toxins in preventing some of the consequent -- atrial fibrillation following open heart surgery. You asked about the topical toxin. Well, we recently acquired the technology from Anterios. The technology is really useful to get large molecules potentially across the dermal barrier and indeed one use of that is potentially for Botox or for toxins like Botox, and we are presently finalizing our work on the formulation for use in some Medical Aesthetics studies. The hyperhydrosis study that Anterios performed was finalized. You also asked about Medytox. Medytox should be -- will be submitting an IND before the end of this year, and we anticipate being able to perform clinical studies with the Medytox toxin early next year."

I do think that the indication for Namzaric for new patients is going to make a difference. I also believe that the sequencing of IR to XR to Namzaric is important and some time has passed since we transitioned from IR to XR, which, I think, is important. And in terms of looking forward, I think, Namzaric could expand the use of combination therapy in the Alzheimer's category because it's superior to XR. We're going to launch a DTC campaign. That's the aim. I would say at minimum, though, it's going to shore up this business for the next several years so that we have something that's solidly trading in this $750 million to $800 million year range."

I recognize you're not prepared to give us on point estimates guidance today. But there are some sale numbers out there, the $25 number from 2017, for example.

And I think we've kind of finally hit the point that we've been trying to get to over that period of time to a focused branded Growth Pharma innovative company, and we're very excited that we've gotten here. We just have to complete the final sale of the Anda business -- or the final sale, which is the Anda business to Teva. And then we've gotten this kind of 2 years of incredible transformation that's essentially behind us. As a result, I think that has changed the numbers. Obviously, when you sell a business, it is dilutive to both top and bottom line. And we've done a few of those things and that's always difficult for companies to do. But for us, strategically and, I think, prudently, it was the right move at the right time, and I think we did very good deals to get us there. I think with respect to the future, our goal or our aspiration is to continue to lead in top line growth. We are, I think, putting up arguably among the best, if not the best top line growth. That growth is broad-based. That growth is across all of our product lines. All of our most important products are growing faster than the top line average. And so we are in an incredibly strong position from a sales perspective. Obviously, on an EPS basis, we hope to see leverage on the bottom line. We've continued to lead, as Tessa said, in both gross margin and operating margins. You see that bleed through to the bottom line. You'll see that strengthen as we do things like buy back $5 billion to $10 billion worth of stock; as we continue to do deals that are growth-oriented, both accretive deals and some pipeline deals to make sure that we do it. But let's face it, the bottom line is our goal. It's difficult but quite simple, which is to maximize shareholder value over the long term.

We increased the size of our sales force by 20%, essentially adding 60 more representatives. We increased the investment in direct-to-consumer advertising. The sampling program, both on Restasis as well as in our artificial tears has been increased. Our coverage of ophthalmology and optometry will be greater in the second half of the year than it was in the first half of the year. We shored up formulary coverage at virtually every health plan across the country, both on the commercial and the Part D side. And those steps were taken to successfully launch Restasis MDPF. Of course, we're going to have an active company in the category in Shire. We're also going to launch True Tear, which is a nasal neurostimulator for dry eye. And so I like the way the second half of the year is going to look for Restasis, particularly given the incremental level of investment. As you know, we have a very highly-trained experienced sales force with great relationships in both areas of eye care, which is ophthalmology and optometry. There, of course, in addition to Restasis, is there's a big focus on a Viberzi, Vraylar and KYBELLA. And Viberzi looks and feels just like Linzess, that's on OTC conversion play. Vraylar is exceeding our expectations. The response that we've gotten from psychiatrists is -- it's exceptional. We're getting used across a broad range of patients. The prescriber base is climbing. And then, of course, we have KYBELLA, and we spent the first 6 months training injectors. It's very different than a pharmaceutical like Viberzi or Vraylar. I would describe the first day of launch for KYBELLA at September 1. We'll turn on consumer advertising. All of our e-commerce programs are now covering KYBELLA, and I would expect a significant step-up in sales on a quarterly basis for KYBELLA in the second half of the year. It's a great expansion of our injectable product line. It gets us into the lower face. It opens up, to a certain extent, the male market. Those are really the priorities. Of course Botox therapeutics is growing at a double-digit rate driven by migraine. We've only penetrated 6% of that market. I think, long term, it's going to be a growth driver, even in 2018 when the CGRP is launched. Hope that answers your question."

Shire experienced that with their own program with lifitegrast, the results from one study to the next can be variable and somewhat unpredictable.

We will only do that when we see a distortion or opportunity in the market. We are a growth-oriented company and we'll continue to invest our cash flow to either maintain or improve our credit ratings by paying down debt or invest for growth."

Look, the only time in the last few years we've done a major transformational deal was when we bought legacy Allergan, and that was put in play and we got to act as a white knight. For the last few years, we have been very focused on stepping-stone deals. So it's not like it's a new strategy, despite our image perhaps or reputation in the market. We have been very focused on that, only acting on one transformational deal because it was a once-in-a-corporate-lifetime situation. I guess to the extent we look at the large-cap universe or the transformational set, we ran that analysis vis-à-vis during our stock buyback and believe that our stock is the most compelling investment we can make versus doing those types of deals. Now we've always been a flexible, nimble team. If some extraordinary situation presented itself, we would obviously evaluate it very closely. And if we felt it was in our shareholders' best interest long term, it's conceivable we can do that. But to be clear -- and Ken, I know you know this, our strategy is stepping-stones. We are not out looking for big trends for M&A. The odds are something compelling, becoming clear are exceptionally low, but they're not 0, and so you never say never. That would be silly in our situation to be close-minded and close off all avenues.

I think we've seen relative stability. I think what's happened in this environment with all the media and noise coming from the political season and everything else is that the payers are definitely involved in a little bit and so they're being more aggressive. I think where they're having their biggest success is where there is great competition or low innovation. And as you know, we have transitioned to a very different model with our recent launches and our pipeline. And I think we have said this many times, we think pricing our pipeline is going to be infinitely easier than pricing our current products, and we've done very well pricing our current products. So what -- I'd characterize the environment as tougher in kind of the me-too or highly competitive spaces that there are 4 drugs launching with relatively similar mechanisms and indications over a 12-month period, pricing dynamics are more challenging than they have been. If you're launching something like even Viberzi, where we can get a price that's almost 3x the price of Linzess because it's a 1 of 1 and novel mechanism, it's still pretty straightforward.

And I would make one final comment. Keep in mind, our business is got good balance. 40% of the $15 billion, I wouldn't even describe as subject to the pricing pressures that we're talking about right now. When it comes to our commercial and Part D mix, it's well-balanced. And just generally speaking, we have exclusivity periods on our products that extend well into the 2020s, which means our pricing approach is aimed at garnering market share and real estate so to speak, and we price for the long term not the short term.

And we both, I think, strongly believe that the opportunity in a market like China for a cash-pay Medical Aesthetics business is massive. Now we're growing incredibly strong, but off a relatively modest base. So we need to look at is there something more bold we can do there. Now the investment, I think, will be manageable. I don't think you'll see it make huge fluctuations in the numbers if we decide to do it, and the payback will be strong. So I don't think that should change anyway you think about -- but the investment shouldn't change anyway if you think about it, but rather we want to make sure that we continue to put up that growth.

We continued to drive top-tier revenue growth and top-tier profitability. We are also making strategic Open Science investments to build even greater depth, breadth and capabilities in our R&D pipeline. 
In the third quarter, we added shareholder-friendly capital allocation to our story with a $5 billion share buyback that we completed ahead of schedule. And today, we are announcing a new board-approved action to increase return for shareholders and take our capital allocation plans to a new level. In addition to doing the things that make Allergan strong financially, we're also taking bold actions in these turbulent times when the price of healthcare is in the spotlight. A good example is our contract with patients. We are leading the way with responsible pricing ideals for our branded therapeutic products, and we are leading the conversation to [indiscernible] what our social contract means to us. It means balancing investment and innovation with pricing and access as well as quality and education. The social contract is Allergan's commitment to the people who count on us to find new treatments with their most pressing medical needs. And it is good for Allergan. So why are we able to be so bold and adapt to social contract? Because it is the right thing to do and because we have such strong confidence that our business and our R&D pipeline will sustain our future growth. 
Turning to Slide 6. The 2 major actions we announced today demonstrate our deep-seated conviction in the future revenue growth as well as strong cash flows from our business. Over the last quarter, we have spent a lot of time looking at various opportunities to deploy our reloaded balance sheet to increase shareholder return, and our Board of Directors has acted. The actions we are taking today illustrate that we are focused on increasing shareholder return. First, we are beefing up our share repurchase program to a total of $15 billion. Second, we are initiating a $0.70 per share quarterly dividend for the very first time. 
Let me start with the enhanced share repurchase program. Since the Teva close, we've been aggressively buying our stock in the open market and have already repurchased $5 billion of our own stock, but we believe that our stock should be trading significantly higher than it is today. The current market conditions create an opportunity to repurchase significantly more stock. There is no more accretive asset on our radar than our own stock, so our Board of Directors have authorized an additional $5 billion repurchase. This brings our total share repurchase authorization to $15 billion. Now we are moving quickly to purchase the remaining $10 billion through an accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR, which allows us for significant upfront share count reduction. 
Next, the dividend. For the first time, our board has approved a cash dividend to return cash flow to shareholders on an ongoing basis. The initiation of a dividend is consistent with our growth pharma profile, the free cash flow of our business generates and our desire to increase shareholder return. This dividend will be funded from our ongoing cash flow without dipping into the proceeds from our Teva transaction, and we expect it to grow in Italy while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings. And we retained the vast majority of our firepower and flexibility to continue to invest in our business, acquire additional steppingstone assets and provide fuel for sustainable top line growth. Our capital allocation actions are intended to balance shareholder return with the investment for future growth. 
Turning to our operating performance on Slide 7 and our report card on how we did this quarter. Obviously, we are disappointed that our results this quarter did not meet our expectations, and therefore, we are revising our 2016 full year guidance. However, we believe that we are incredibly well positioned for 2017 and beyond. So let's look at the health of our company. In my view, there are 5 key measures to gauge the health and growth prospects of any biopharmaceutical company. First, how are the promoted products doing; second, how are the new product launch is going; third, how are the established products bearing near the end of their patent lives when they are no longer being promoted; fourth, how is the pipeline progressing; and finally, how is the company performing against key profitability metrics. 
Allergan continues to generate sales growth that is at the top end of our peer group. Sales were $3.6 billion, up more than 7%, excluding the MedIR, divestitures, FX and other adjustments. Our key promoted products are growing nicely, most of them double digit. Our new product launches are performing exceptionally well. I'm absolutely thrilled with how we are doing with our key brands and future growth drivers. Our pipeline is on a roll, and our profitability metrics are in the top tier of our peer group. Where we missed the mark was among a few of our established brands and non-promoted products. All in all, the report card for growth looks good this quarter, setting us up for growth in 2017 and beyond. 
Even with the weakness in our established and non-promoted products, we retain a top-tier profitability profile with a gross margin of 87.8% and an operating margin of 49.3%. These metrics were a little lighter this quarter partly due to investments we are making in manufacturing to support continued strong growth of BOTOX and our eyecare products and continued promotional investment behind our brands and increased R&D investment versus last year. Our non-GAAP EPS was $3.32. I'm confident that our team has made the right investments in our business and has laid a strong foundation for top-tier growth and profitability.
You can see on Slide 8 that the majority of our top global products are growing, and along with the new lunches, they represent 73% of our total revenue, many of them are growing double-digit rates, including BOTOX, up 15%; RESTASIS, up 13%; LINZESS, up 42%; our Filler lineup, 21%; lo lostream, up 16%; OZURDEX, up 25%. I'm also proud to see new product launches contributing more than $90 million this quarter. This is the top-tier growth story. 
On the established and non-promoted products, we have more erosion than expected on the NAMENDA XR and our [indiscernible] containing products, which are phrasing in-class competition from generic drugs and have had some formulary disruption. Our future is not driven by these established products. Our future is built on our growth products, which is why I am so confident in it. 
Overall, our business is very healthy, and it's a very good picture to have so many products growing so strongly. Before handing off to Bill, I'd like to mention the progress we're making in R&D to build and deliver our pipeline. The team is doing exceptional job. Our R&D productivity is strong. Already this year, we've had 19 major pharma and device product approvals and 11 major submission. We've also reached some key milestones such as the approval of our multidose RESTASIS and a positive relamorelin Phase IIb results that were announced just last week. Relamorelin was one of our early Open Science deals. We used an option agreement to gain access to this promising treatment for gastroparesis. Now that relamorelin has demonstrated broad efficacy and tolerability in a Phase IIb trial, we have exercised our option to acquire Modus and plan to take relamorelin in to Phase III trials within Allergan. 
We have also completed 6 new steppingstone deals this quarter, which are helping to build even greater pipeline depth and breadth in our therapeutic areas. In addition to pipeline-building acquisition, we are also very interested in accretive acquisitions. While we continue to look for these accretive acquisitions, the most accretive acquisition for us today is in our own stock. 
Now let me turn the call over to Bill Meury, our Chief Commercial Officer."
36478,404686862,1069682,"Allergan plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thanks, Brent. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 11. Our core business was strong in the third quarter. Sales in all 7 therapeutic areas increased versus prior year. 5 of the 7 therapeutic areas grew to high-single or double-digit rate. And as Bren",1634,"Thanks, Brent. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 11. Our core business was strong in the third quarter. Sales in all 7 therapeutic areas increased versus prior year. 5 of the 7 therapeutic areas grew to high-single or double-digit rate. And as Brent mentioned, the majority of our revenues made up of top products and new launches that all together are growing at double-digit rate. This is a high-quality business and the foundation for 2017. Eye Care sales increased by 10% powered by RESTASIS, which showed durability in the third quarter with a sales increase of 13% versus prior year; and OZURDEX, which was up 19% in the United States and 29% internationally. And we look forward to the launch of 2 new dry eye products over the next 6 months. 
And CNS sales increased by 3%. BOTOX therapeutic sales increased 16% globally versus the prior year, coupled with continued strong performance by VRAYLAR. Offsetting the growth in these products was a reduction in NAMENDA XR sales, driven by lower demand and a higher discount rate to maintain broad formulary coverage. We're seeing an early and strong market response to the new indication for Namzaric. 
In aesthetics, sales increased by 14%, driven by BOTOX and Fillers. Demand for KYBELLA is projected to increase significantly in the next 2 quarters as our DTC campaign reaches more and more consumers. Overall, demand for our aesthetic product line in the United States and internationally among dermatologists and plastic surgeons and across age demographics is very strong, and we're as optimistic of this part of the business as we've ever been.
In GI, sales increased by 9%. LINZESS, our flagship fastest-growing product continues to produce strong results, up 42% year-over-year. And VIBERZI demand has been exceptional. Mesalamine's revenue declined overall due to lower promotion, loss of formulary coverage and a loss of exclusivity for [indiscernible] HD. And finally, we continue to see strong growth in our Women's Health franchise with sales up 15% as well as nice performance from urology. 
Let's take in some of our products. On Slide 12, you see our flagship IBS products LINZESS and VIBERZI. Demand for both products is very strong across-the-board and regardless of metric. Both products are attracting new users each week. Both products are being used in a broad range of patients. Both products are taking from -- share from the OTC market. Both have excellent formulary coverage, and both are being supported by significant promotional programs. The outlook for LINZESS and VIBERZI is excellent. Sales for LINZESS are up 42% versus prior year, and approximately 73% of new business for LINZESS is coming from the OTC market, which is exactly what we want. And we're preparing to launch the LINZESS 72-microgram product, which is designed to accelerate conversion of the OTC market. 
Based on sales, VIBERZI is trending at approximately 90% of LINZESS during the same time period post-launch. Demand for this product is robust, and with IMS prescription levels having reached an all-time high last week, we are very optimistic about the future.
Turning to Slide 13. Our Medical Aesthetics business accounts for approximately 20% of total sales and includes 3 key products: BOTOX, Fillers and KYBELLA. This is a high-quality, double-digit growth, cash business in an expanding market both domestically and internationally. The fundamentals here are the following: Allergan has product line depth, which no other company can match and which creates cross-selling opportunities; in other words, one product builds on the next. BOTOX is a gateway for the Fillers, and KYBELLA is a gateway to BOTOX. Allergan has a steady stream of new innovative product launches on the way. We invest more in education and training than any other company in the space, and we have market share leadership in a category that could double in size the next 5-plus years. There are 4 major trends driving aesthetics market expansion. First, more physicians are moving into aesthetics worldwide. Next, we are training more injectors. Third, there's a youth movement. Attitude towards aesthetic procedures are changing across the world. That is especially true in 20- to 30-year-old age segment. And finally, there's a male movement. With the launch of KYBELLA, we're seeing more interest by men in aesthetic procedures, and we expect this trend to accelerate over time.
Now I'm often get asked about the stability of BOTOX and future sales growth, which is an important topic. What you can see on Slide 14 is this. As successful as we've been with BOTOX, as popular and widely used as BOTOX is, we've only scratched the surface of our 3 primary growth indications: aesthetics, migraine and overactive bladder. Utilization by the eligible patient population in each area is the still low, ranging from 3% to 7%. If these numbers were in the 15% to 20% range, one might anticipate growth moderation, but they're not. We believe it will stay in high-growth rates for BOTOX for at least several more years, and that is why we continue to invest in sales and marketing, manufacturing and research and development and why we are confident in the future. 
Turning to Slide 15. With Vraylar, we're about 33 weeks into the launch, and prescription levels are increasing week-over-week and faster than the market. The product is clearly distinguished by its pharmacology, symptom relief and metabolic profile for both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Vraylar trajectory is strong, and the future of VRAYLAR is promising. With Namzaric, we're relaunching on all fronts, with the sales force engaged and a DTC campaign ready to go in less than 2 weeks. We are already seeing a significant increase in sales in both the retail and long-term care settings. This is the first time we have an option for transitioning patients for monotherapy to Namzaric, and we're capitalizing on that opportunity with starter kit that early on is getting a great deal of traction. So the differences here as compared several months ago are: the indications for Namzaric is complete, the availability of storage kits is plentiful and formulary coverage is widespread. I think this franchise demonstrates the nimbleness and power of our commercial capabilities as we move from one  innovation to the next. 
Turning to Slide 16. No company has more to offer in the eye care space than Allergan. Overall, the dryer market has expanded significantly since the launch of a second treatment option. At the same time, volume and sales for RESTASIS have been durable. Sales for RESTASIS were up 13% versus prior year. This growth was supported by strong unit demand in both ophthalmology and optometry. The growth in the overall market is being fueled primarily by new patients who are on OTC tier products or receiving no treatment at all. New investments and innovations for dry eye will continue to drive the market and our business. We recently received FDA approval for RESTASIS multidose, which will launch in fourth quarter; and then True Tear, which is a nasal neurostimulator that we are planning to a stage launch beginning in 2017. True Tear is a non-drop treatment for dry eye. I just returned from the AAO meeting, and this is getting a great deal of interest from the eye care community.
Turning to Slide 17 in our international business. Sales in our international business totaled nearly $700 million in the third quarter. Every single region grew in the high-single or double-digit rate. Western Europe is our largest region, and we expect the Asia Pacific will be our leading international growth contributor, with China the fastest-growing aesthetics market in the world. NESE, North East and Southeast Europe, is our fastest-growing region, up 26% this quarter, excluding FX. Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care anchor our business internationally. Sales for BOTOX Cosmetic and our Filler line were up 18% and 25%, excluding FX, respectively. We've launched BELKYRA, KYBELLA in the United States in Europe and plan to have ahead in 10 countries by the end of the year. In terms of Eye Care, glaucoma is our largest product line; and Revlimid is the fastest growing.  In glaucoma, we're launching a Multi-Dose Preservative-Free formulation of [indiscernible] and we have our Zen Gel stent, which is a minimally invasive procedure to lower IOP. XEN launched in 10 international markets already this year, and we look forward to its potential approval and launch in 2017 in the United States.
In retina, Ozurdex has a very strong following in Western Europe, and in 2017, we will expand geographically with launches in Brazil and Australia. GI product launches are also underway in our international markets with Constella, LINZESS in the United States launched in key countries and [indiscernible] VIBERZI in the United States planned for 2017. Beyond the results of the quarter, we're excited about the upcoming new product launches. In Eye Care, we're focused on the launch of RESTASIS Multidose, XEN and True Tear; and in Medical Dermatology, Oxymetazoline, now called [indiscernible] In the GI space, we're launching a lower dose of LINZESS or LINZESS 72-microgram, as I mentioned. In cardiology, we recently launched [indiscernible] which is a combination of [indiscernible] and [indiscernible]. In infectious disease, we will see [indiscernible] return to full supply before year-end and with full indications for  UTI and intra-abdominal infections. We expect formulary coverage to continue to be strong in 2017. We will continue to invest and leverage our platform of capabilities, which include physician and consumer e-commerce programs, DPC and a well-trained and customized sales force. Allergan has share of voice leadership in nearly every market. It's #2 in the industry in direct-to-consumer spending and has one of the most productive sales forces in the industry. And that is why I believe the fundamentals of our business are healthy and our growth outlook is excellent. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David."

Before I discuss our R&D productivity, a few remarks on our Open Science model. Open Science is in R&D philosophy focused on 2 key elements. The first, building the pipeline defines our approach to identifying, acquiring and developing the best game-changing ideas and innovation. We are agnostic where innovation comes from. Academic research centers, venture-backed, start-up companies, R&D base public companies were our own research centers. This maximizes our ability to deliver true innovation to the healthcare system and, most importantly, to the patients who need breakthrough medicine to treat their unmet needs. The second and very important element of Open Science is our ability and success in delivering the pipeline. Once we complete an acquisition or in license the product, our teams advanced development, prepare for regulatory approval and drive lifecycle innovation for innovative products that helps patients. We do this whilst remaining a true partner with our external collaborators. As Brent mentioned, we have achieved in 19 total major pharma and device glaucoma approvals and 11 major regulatory submissions so far this year. These outstanding results have been delivered by a team of more than 2,000 dedicated scientists, R&D professionals who are delivering important new treatments for patients. This team will be the fuel that delivers more products from our pipeline of 7 [ph] mid- to late-stage programs. 
Turning to Slide 21. We are adding differentiated compounds and programs across our key therapeutic areas. We've added 6 steppingstone acquisitions since the second quarter. These are: Channel Reduction 2, a novel and innovative gene therapy for the treatment of Retinitis Pigmentosa, a leading cause of blindness. Second, the periocular ring, designed for extended drug delivery to the eye. The first product reduces elevated intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients. Third, [indiscernible] t inhibitors and LXR-beta agonist, highly differentiated compounds for the treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Fourth and fifth, [indiscernible] or CVC, and our FXR agonist. These established portfolio of differentiated match compounds that could provide combination therapy for this multifactorial disease. Finally, a monoclonal antibody selectively targeting IL 23 for the treatment of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and potentially other autoimmune disorders. 
Turning to Slide 22. We have made significant progress in advancing major programs. In Eye Care, last week, we announced FDA approval for RESTASIS multidose, a preservative free, multidose bottle of RESTASIS. Bill has already discussed the launch of this new product for patients suffering from dry eye disease. In CNS, and as we previously promised, we have now initiated our Phase III program for Japan for the treatment of migraine, and we have initiated our Phase IIb program for Atogepant migraine prophylaxis. 
As we have also previously promised it, we have started the Phase III study for rapastinel in major depressive disorder. We have expect to have top line results for the short-term studies in early 2019. But remember, we need to complete the maintenance study before we can file. As a reminder, we're also developing [indiscernible] and an earlier small molecule compound as next-generation oral NMDA receptor modulators for the treatment of MBD. 
Internationally, we received a positive opinion from the EU for Truversi in GI disorders, and we expect to launch our product in international markets in 2017. In urology, the FDA bone, reproductive and neurological Advisory Committee voted recently in favor of approval for, SIR-120 for the treatment of [indiscernible] We look forward to working with the agency on the approval of this product. 
Looking ahead, we have a number of near-term pipeline deliverables. In CNS, many of you have asked me about our plans regarding cariprazine and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. After discussions with the FDA, we plan to file an sNDA for cariprazine for this disorder in the first half of 2017. We also expect to announced Phase II top line results for BOTOX in depression in the second half of next year. 
Regarding Semprana, our inhalable dihydrotestosterone treatment for acute migraine, we have resolved the issue raised by the FDA during their previous review and continue to work on scale at the manufacturability, which may result in submission in the second half of 2017. 
Turning to Medical Dermatology. We will shortly initiate later Phase II studies with our lead ROR gamma t inhibitor in psoriasis. Also, we will complete Phase III trials for [indiscernible] a potential treatment for acne, in early 2017. We recently received data from an early development study with our LXR-beta agonist. In this study target engagement was not satisfactorily achieved, so we need to reevaluate the concentration use and formulation 
Now, GI. First, some breaking news for CVC, We plan to initiate Phase III trials mid-next year. At the recent and in Phase II meeting, the FDA agreed about the compound is Phase III ready and that the primary endpoint should be reduction in fibrosis by one stage without worsening of hepatitis. Remember, this is the endpoint that was achieved at year 1 in the ongoing CVC CENTAUR study. The 1-year data will be presented as an oral at the forthcoming liver meeting in Boston. The CENTAUR study meanwhile continues with 2-year data available mid next year. 
We also expect a have to Phase IIa data for [indiscernible] an oral IL 23 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of Crohn's disease in the first half of 2017. In Women's Health, we will have the second Phase III results for Esmya in uterine fibroids early next year. We file and plan later in the year. 
Turning to Eye Care. Bill has already discussed True Tear [indiscernible] As you know, we have an option agreement with Mimetogen for [indiscernible] in dry eye disease. The first 2 Phase III trials have been completed, and the team are presently evaluating the data. 
Turning to Slide 23. We recently announced our decision to exercise our option for relamorelin. Data obtained from both the Phase IIa and Phase IIb trials are shown on this slide. I'm showing here the efficacy and relamorelin in comparison to placebo on a 4-point composite endpoint of nausea, post [indiscernible] or anxiety, abdominal pain and bloating. In both studies, relamorelin was significantly more effective than placebo. In the Phase IIa study, on the left, I am showing the result in the subgroup of patients with a high incidence of vomiting with a dose of 10 micrograms of relamorelin. In this subgroup, vomiting was also significantly decreased following relamorelin administration. For the Phase IIb trial, I am showing the average efficacy of 3 doses of relamorelin, 10 30 and 100 micrograms in comparison to placebo in all patients. In these patients, there was a substantial reduction in vomiting in relamorelin-treated patients in this trial. There was also substantial placebo reduction in vomiting. This placebo effect was surprising to investigators, KOLs and our internal team. We are working to understand this placebo effect, which, as you all know, can occur in clinical studies. 
Recent draft FDA guidance on diabetic gastroparesis drug development specifies that the use of an endpoint that measures each of the core symptoms and signs of the disease separately or as a composite with a responded definition is recommended for the development of novel agent, so we believe that the data shown on this slide will be suitable for progression of the compound into Phase III. We are very excited about the prospect of bringing a new treatment to millions of patients who are suffering from this condition. No new drug has been approved since 1983. 
As I have outlined, we continue to make great progress with our Open Science model, with tremendous results just in the third quarter. We have many more milestones ahead to deliver for the remainder of the year and into 2017. Our ability to identify and acquire the best science, matched with our strong results and advancing innovation validates Open Science. As always, we thank our global R&D team for their outstanding work and dedication in driving innovation, delivering results and for their commitment to the work ahead for the patients we serve. 
I will now turn the call over to [indiscernible]"
36478,404686862,1069682,"Allergan plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Please note that the discussion of continuing operations, financial results excludes both Global Generics and ANDA, following the completion of our Global Generics divestiture in Q3 and the sale of Anda in Q4. T",1618,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Please note that the discussion of continuing operations, financial results excludes both Global Generics and ANDA, following the completion of our Global Generics divestiture in Q3 and the sale of Anda in Q4. 
Turning to Slide 25. Before I begin reviewing the results for the quarter, I wanted to first expand on some of Brent's earlier remarks on our capital allocation decision announced this morning. Following the receipt of the Teva proceeds, we immediately took steps to strengthen our balance sheet through debt paydown. We started repurchasing our shares in late August, and we completed $5 billion in share repurchases in October ahead of schedule. We purchased a total of 21 million shares at an average price of approximately $238 per share. We also continued to focus on evaluating options to further increase shareholder value. We therefore expanded our share repurchase by $5 billion to $15 billion in total and announced the initiation of a dividend to begin in 2017. 
First, I want to expand on the share repurchase. We concluded that there is no better investment than in our own stock. As we announced this morning, we will be executing the remaining $10 billion, utilizing an accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR. As you may all know, an ASR program allows us to reduce the significant portion of shares upfront. Since the last conference call, we continue to evaluate various methods to repurchase shares. In conjunction with our advisers, we have since developed an ASR structure that meets Irish legal requirements. Approximately 8 billion worth of shares will be retired during the month of November 2016. The remaining shares, if any, under the program would be received and retired by the third quarter of 2017 upon completion of the ASR. Completion of the ASR could occur sooner, subject to market conditions. Up to 50% of the ASR program will be hedged based upon the stock price over reference period through a caller transaction. 
Second, we initiated the dividend starting in Q1 2017. Our company has transformed over the last 18 months to a fewer branded growth pharma company with a strong pipeline and strong growth prospects. Given our conviction in the future of our current business and our ability to generate strong cash flow, we decided to initiate the dividend. The dividend will be funded by our ongoing cash flow while allowing for further investment and growth. We are committed to growing this dividend annually for shareholders. 
Turning to Slide 26. We remain committed to our investment-grade ratings. We expect to continue to strengthen our balance sheet through debt repayment. We've already repaid close to $10 billion in debt this year, and we have an additional $6.5 billion in contractual maturities, which we intend to pay over the next 18 months. In addition, we ended the quarter with $27.4 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Turning to our overall results for the third quarter of 2016 on Slide 27. In Q3, we delivered strong year-over-year performance. Continuing operations net revenues, which now exclude Anda Distribution, were $3.62 billion, a 4.5% increase versus prior year, primarily impacted by HD loss of exclusivity, divestitures and lower-than-expected Namenda IR and XR. Excluding NAMENDA IR, divestitures and FX and an out-of-period adjustment related to discontinued operations, which impacted the third quarter of last year by $31.7 million, net revenues increased 7.4%. Gross margins for the third quarter remained strong at almost 88%. The decline versus prior year was driven primarily by higher production cost related to capacity expansion and manufacturing variances. These were cost that were accounted for within corporate and did not impact any of the segment margins, which remained very strong. Operating margins declined versus last year to 49.3%, impacted by higher sales and marketing investments to continue to support ongoing launches such as VRAYLAR, VIBERZI and KYBELLA and other marketing spend for key products as well as higher investment in R&D as a result of more projects versus the prior year. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.32 primarily reflect the loss of exclusivity of NAMENDA IR and HD and lower sales of NAMENDA XR, higher SG&A and R&D spend compared with the third quarter of 2015. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 8.2% in the quarter. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was negative this quarter at approximately $1 billion, primarily as a result of cash tax payments of approximately $2.6 billion related to the gain from the sale of our generics business to Teva. Excluding this and the impact of R&D asset acquisition and restructuring payments, cash flow from operations remained very strong at positive $1.72 billion. The GAAP equivalent to our financial metrics can be found in our earnings release issued this morning and posted in our website. 
Turning now to our U.S. Specialized Therapeutics results on Slide 28. The business continued to deliver strong performance year-over-year. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics revenue was $1.45 billion for the quarter, up 12.1% versus the prior year period, driven by strong growth across Medical Aesthetics of 14%; Eye Care of 13%; and strong growth in BOTOX therapeutics of 17%. Key products perform well with BOTOX, RESTASIS, Fillers and the launch of KYBELLA as key contributors to the strong performance. Sequential 2% revenue decline was driven by the typical seasonality of Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care in the summer. Gross margin continued to expand at 95.2%. 
SG&A increased versus prior year as a result of an increase in promotion efforts, including aesthetics sales force expansion and KYBELLA DTC. 
Turning to Slide 29. Our U.S. General Medicine business third quarter revenues were $1.49 billion, 4% lower than last year, primarily attributed to [indiscernible] HD generic entry, lower NAMENDA IR and XR revenues and lower established brands due to the divestiture and a generic entry. Adjusting for this impact, trends in our key products, including LINZESS and lo lostream continues to grow at low double-digit rates. Third quarter gross margins continued to be stable at 85%. Sequentially, SG&A increased versus the prior year, primarily related to higher sales and marketing to support launches of VIBERZI and VRAYLAR. The decline in SG&A versus prior quarter is due primarily to timing of promotional spending. 
Turning to Slide 30 in our international result. Third quarter revenues were $698 million versus $661 million in the prior year period. Excluding foreign exchange and then out-of-period adjustment of $31.7 million, international revenues in the third quarter grew 12% versus prior year, driven by continued strong growth of BOTOX Therapeutics, BOTOX Cosmetics, Fillers and OZURDEX. Sequential revenue decline was driven by seasonality of Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care, primarily in Europe. Gross margins were 86.4% in the third quarter. Segment SG&A was $216 million, up 14.3% versus prior year, driven by continued support in Medical Aesthetics and new product launches, including BELKYRA or KYBELLA in the U.S., XEN, and Constella. Contribution margins improved versus prior quarter from 53.4% to 55.4%, reflected continued strong sales growth. 
Turning to Slide 31. Let me make a few comments on our 2016 full year revised guidance. We are revising our guidance for full year 2016. While we are clearly disappointed that we have to revise our guidance, the level of transformation our company has seen over the last 18 months has been unprecedented. We've carved out 2 major businesses, a very complex process. We have now completed that process this quarter with the close of Anda. We are looking forward to focusing on the future as a pure branded pro forma company. We now expect full year 2016 branded revenues to be between $14,450,000,000 to $14,650,000,000 at or modestly below the low end of our previous range, reflecting the impact of sales that we saw in the third quarter and the assumption that does trends on non-promoted established products carry into the fourth quarter. We expect continued strong performance of our top promoted products and new launches. 
Our gross margins, which were slightly lower sequentially, are now expected to finish the year between 87% to 88%, consistent with our historical performance. Our non-GAAP SG&A of approximately $4 billion and our non-GAAP R&D spend of approximately $1.5 billion remain unchanged. Net interest expense and other is in the range of $1.25 billion. Our tax rate for the full year is anticipated to be between 8% and 9%. Our tax rate should begin to trend upward toward normalized levels in early 2017. Our revised average share count for 2016 of 408 million shares includes the impact of the completed 5 billion in share repurchases as well as the impact of that 10 billion ASR we just announced. Year-end 2016 diluted share count is forecasted to be approximately 365 million, reflecting more fully the impact of the share repurchases. As mentioned earlier, there could be further adjustments in share count depending on Allergan stock price during the settlement period. Approximately 8 billion worth of shares will be retired during the month of November 2016, and the remaining shares, if any, under the program will be received and retired by the third quarter of 2017 upon completion of the ASR. As a result, we expect full year non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $13.30 and $13.50. For the fourth quarter, we expect a forecast average share count of 383 million shares for the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 32. We have strong long-duration assets and a sound strategy. We have leading top line growth and margins, driven by new innovative products and excellent manufacturing capabilities. We have strong conviction in the earnings potential and cash generation of our company, and we remain focused on long-term shareholder value creation. 
With that, I'll the call over to Brent for closing remarks."

I don't want to take too long, but I guess, first of all, Brent and Tessa, maybe you could just frame how you plan to balance your optimism about the business and your motivation to drive the sales force while also ensuring that consensus expectations can be achievable going forward? That's my first question. And tying into that, how you guys next year in the face of NAMENDA XR early generic risk? And then the second question is on VRAYLAR in negative symptoms. You've mentioned a first half '17 data submission. I'm assuming that incremental data could show up in the body of the label in early '18, but when do you expect to be able to file for a formal indication for negative symptoms to be on the topical label?"

Thank you for a full list of questions. I think with respect to motivating the sales force and balancing the need to meet or beat expectations or consensus, it's something obviously we take very seriously at.",373,"Yes. So let me see if I can take those, David. Thank you for a full list of questions. I think with respect to motivating the sales force and balancing the need to meet or beat expectations or consensus, it's something obviously we take very seriously at. I'm not sure the 2 are entirely connected. Our sales force around the world is, frankly, one of the prides of Allergan. We take great amount of our time and effort to make sure that our front-line sales people have all the tools and training and skills necessary to do the therapeutic line calls and promote our products in a compliant and risk and balanced way to build customer intimacy and relationships. I think across a number of different dynamics, our sales force is the most productive, hardest working sales force in the industry. I think -- and we've been expanding it. So in Eye Care, we've expanded it. In key markets like Brazil and China, we've been expanding it. I'd also say that we have had a relatively strong stability in our sales force despite the transformation of Allergan. Our sales reps and our sales leadership is entirely, almost entirely intact from the early days of company's transformation. So it is a very important group of individuals and colleagues for us, and it's a highly motivated, highly productive function in the company. I think the question with respect to consensus is something that Tessa and I and our entire management team take very seriously. But at the end of the day, we run the business to make the right decisions to propel growth and the high profitability in the future. And so things that we did this quarter like bringing on a second BOTOX manufacturing plant in Ireland, expanding our capacity in Waco to make many of our eye care products, investing behind our launches, pulling towards some DTC -- or not DTC, but promotional spend behind the Namzaric are all the types of things that I think we need to do to continue to drive the growth and do the right thing for the business, in fairness, irrespective of consensus. And so that's kind of how -- Tessa, do you want to add anything?"

I think the better thing that we can focus on is what we can control on a day-to-day basis, which is our promotion of the better product for patients, which is Namzaric. Reducing the pill burden from 3 pills twice a day to 1 pill once a day is something that we know that caregivers and patients suffering from Alzheimer's really to benefit from. And look, the early data on Namzaric Bill put that up on the slide is encouraging, so we should keep in mind, it's early.

I think looking at earnings for the companies that have reported before us, many of them have seen less-than-stellar growth in their key promoter products, but they achieved their results by price increases in their established products. I'm not sure that is sustainable. And so while some may criticize our social contract and our pricing discipline, we would have not taken those price increases irregardless of the contract because it's not the right thing to do, and I think it does create the additional risks or inappropriate risk for the company.

And so my question is, obviously, guidance is really important. Market takes it very seriously. We're just trying to understand your company. What are you doing for your own internal control so that you have better visibility to communicate with investors? This quarter allows shortfall came from or products that I would have thought you would have foreseen. So I'm just wondering what you're doing about that going forward? And most importantly, will this be the last -- I mean, I don't think you can -- I don't know how definitive you can be, but to help us understand, will this be the last of the rebasing? And then my second question is, if you can help us to understand how to think about the pushes and pulls in 2017? Obviously, the buyback should be a positive to your bottom line, but at the same time, investors are questioning your level of R&D spend to sustain top line growth; SG&A, which is coming in at about that obviously important to sustain new product launches.

Look, I think I have to just mention, we're not going to provide 2017 guidance today. We'll do that in the normal course in early next year, in just a few months. But that being said, look, we have a business that I think has some very important characteristics that even despite the miss today on some of the older products are the thing I hope investors focus on. We have top-tier growth. We have a portfolio that's diverse with many growth drivers, not one big growth driver but many growth drivers. You can look at products like BOTOX, up 15%; RESTASIS, up 13%; LINZESS, up 42%. Even drugs like [indiscernible] up 16%. OZURDEX is up 25%. And I think -- see the pattern of that, the previous quarter, the previous quarter and the previous quarter and get a feel for the growth trajectory of this business. You can look at the new launches which I say contributed about $90 million in the quarter. VIBERZI, VRAYLAR, KYBELLA, all off to either at or expectations or exceeding expectations start. You've heard David talk about filing for negative symptoms on VRAYLAR, could be if approved by the FDA, certainly multiple change or in terms of the sales multiples for that drug. But then I think most importantly, the question I take the most exemption to is this idea that the percentage of R&D spend is too weak to propel innovation. I mean, I think that's ridiculous. I think, just to be straightforward, it's the quality of the spent against the programs and the productivity that you have. And I think when you look at our 70 late-stage programs and you think about some of the big ones that are coming over the next year or 2, whether be it [indiscernible] Esmya, relamorelin, just to name a few, let alone drugs like [indiscernible] and others or Sir120 that are kind of forgotten about in the context. We have ample new product flow, and we have several shots on goal that would, could be blockbuster new drugs for unmet medical needs. So would you rather that or have us spend $8 billion or $9 billion or in R&D that have no productivity and late-stage failures and all the other things that come with it? I'm not saying we won't have failures. Of course, we'll have a few. But I think we spend our money more wisely, and hopefully, over time, we'll prove in a more efficient way to get meaningful innovation out to market. And just as an aside, R&D is up 29% year-to-date, so it's not that we're not increasing R&D. So hopefully, that answers some of your questions. We can continue next time I see you. But we feel very good about our position. We feel very good about our growth profile, and I think we feel very confident that we will be continuing top-tier growth and top-tier profitability in 2017 and beyond."

And there are few countries that I think we really believe we would have a high return on investment, and we have already started making many of those investments. Bill, you want to talk about?"

I would say there's 3 regions of our international business that are getting a great deal of focus right now. That's the Asia Pacific; Northeast, Southeast, Europe, essentially everything other than Western Europe; and Turkey, Middle East and Africa. The investments that we make right now relate to expansion of the field force, especially in Asia Pacific and namely, in China. We dramatically increased the scale and scope and intensity of our injector training program, not just in Asia Pacific but in the other 2 regions as well. And internationally, there are opportunities to run consumer advertising campaigns namely on our Fillers line, which is growing at 25% year-over-year. Not a major increase in sales force is required, but the 3 things I mentioned that is the largest one. And the business is really a very well resourced. The regional presence in the country managers that run this business are very, very capable. And the trends just look very, very good. Business is up 12% versus prior year and is experiencing price erosion of 1% to 2%, so it's a very, very strong product line. The same can be said for the Eye Care business as well where we're launching new products for glaucoma and looks. The second question was about..."

If you look at new prescriptions, it's up over 20% -- excuse me, if you look at total prescriptions, it's up over 20%. If you look at new prescriptions, it's closer to 30%. Most of the expansion is coming from, as I mentioned earlier, patients who are on over-the-counter tier products or were receiving no treatment at all. The next observation is that the revenue stream for RESTASIS has been very durable. If you look at the 6-week period, for example, before the launch of [indiscernible] and the 6-week period after. And then the next final point I would make his we're focused right now on launching RESTASIS and DPF and True Tear at the end of 2016 and 2017. And I still believe that when the dust settles here, I'm sure people at Shire feel the same way, this is going to be a fight to the death between 2 companies and the 2 product, but this is going to be a larger market. There's a lot more attention being paid to ocular disease. I think we're seeing a second treatment option, appears to have created an expansion event in eye care, which is good. I believe that Allergan, because of our product line to and capability, is going to maintain a majority share in a much larger market. And I think things look pretty good in that regard."

At Allergan, we continue to take bold actions as we move forward with our Growth Pharma agenda. We continue to drive top-tier revenue growth and top-tier profitability. We are also making strategic Open",1342,"Great. Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. At Allergan, we continue to take bold actions as we move forward with our Growth Pharma agenda. We continue to drive top-tier revenue growth and top-tier profitability. We are also making strategic Open Science investments to build even greater depth, breadth and capabilities in our R&D pipeline. 
In the third quarter, we added shareholder-friendly capital allocation to our story with a $5 billion share buyback that we completed ahead of schedule. And today, we are announcing a new board-approved action to increase return for shareholders and take our capital allocation plans to a new level. In addition to doing the things that make Allergan strong financially, we're also taking bold actions in these turbulent times when the price of healthcare is in the spotlight. A good example is our social contract with patients. We are leading the way with responsible pricing ideals for our branded therapeutic products, and we are leading the conversation to quantify what our social contract means to us. It means balancing investment and innovation with pricing and access as well as quality and education. The social contract is Allergan's commitment to the people who count on us to find new treatments for their most pressing medical needs. And it is good for Allergan. So why are we able to be so bold and adapt a social -- adopt to social contract? Because it is the right thing to do and because we have such strong confidence that our business and our R&D pipeline will sustain our future growth. 
Turning to Slide 6. The 2 major actions we announced today demonstrate our deep-seated conviction in the future revenue growth as well as strong cash flows from our business. Over the last quarter, we have spent a lot of time looking at various opportunities to deploy our reloaded balance sheet to increase shareholder return, and our Board of Directors has acted. The actions we are taking today illustrate that we are focused on increasing shareholder return. First, we are beefing up our share repurchase program to a total of $15 billion. Second, we are initiating a $0.70 per share quarterly dividend for the very first time. 
Let me start with the enhanced share repurchase program. Since the Teva close, we've been aggressively buying our stock in the open market and have already repurchased $5 billion of our own stock. While we believe that our stock should be trading significantly higher than it is today, the current market conditions create an opportunity to repurchase significantly more stock. There is no more accretive asset on our radar than our own stock. So our Board of Directors has authorized an additional $5 billion repurchase. This brings our total share repurchase authorization to $15 billion. Now we are moving quickly to purchase the remaining $10 billion through an accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR, which allows us for significant upfront share count reduction. 
Next, the dividend. For the first time, our board has approved a cash dividend to return cash flow to shareholders on an ongoing basis. The initiation of a dividend is consistent with our Growth Pharma profile, the free cash flow that our business generates and our desire to increase shareholder return. This dividend will be funded from our ongoing cash flow without dipping into the proceeds from our Teva transaction. And we expect it to grow annually while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings. And we retain the vast majority of our firepower and flexibility to continue to invest in our business, acquire additional steppingstone assets and provide fuel for sustainable top line growth. Our capital allocation actions are intended to balance shareholder return with the investment for future growth. 
Turning to our operating performance on Slide 7 and our report card on how we did this quarter. Obviously, we are disappointed that our results this quarter did not meet our expectations, and therefore, we are revising our 2016 full year guidance. However, we believe that we are incredibly well positioned for 2017 and beyond. So let's look at the health of our company. In my view, there are 5 key measures to gauge the health and growth prospects of any biopharmaceutical company. First, how are the promoted products doing; second, how are the new product launches going; third, how are the established products faring near the end of their patent lives or when they are no longer being promoted; fourth, how is the pipeline progressing; and finally, how is the company performing against key profitability metrics. 
Allergan continues to generate sales growth that is at the top end of our peer group. Sales were $3.6 billion, up more than 7%, excluding NAMENDA IR, divestitures, FX and other adjustments. Our key promoted products are growing nicely, most of them double digit. Our new product launches are performing exceptionally well. I'm absolutely thrilled with how we are doing with our key brands and future growth drivers. Our pipeline is on a roll, and our profitability metrics are in the top tier of our peer group. Where we missed the mark was among a few of our established brands and non-promoted products. All in all, the report card for growth looks good this quarter, setting us up for growth in 2017 and beyond. 
Even with the weakness in our established and non-promoted products, we retain a top-tier profitability profile with a gross margin of 87.8% and an operating margin of 49.3%. These metrics were a little lighter this quarter, partly due to investments we are making in manufacturing to support continued strong growth of BOTOX and our Eye Care products and continued promotional investment behind our brands and increased R&D investment versus last year. Our non-GAAP EPS was $3.32. I'm confident that our team has made the right investments in our business and has laid a strong foundation for top-tier growth and profitability.
You can see on Slide 8 that the majority of our top global products are growing and along with the new launches, they represent 73% of our total revenue, many of them are growing double-digit rates, including BOTOX, up 15%; RESTASIS, up 13%; LINZESS, up 42%; our Filler line, up 21%; LO LOESTRIN, up 16%; OZURDEX, up 25%. I'm also proud to see new product launches contributing more than $90 million this quarter. This is a top-tier growth story. 
On the established and non-promoted products, we had more erosion than expected on NAMENDA XR and our mesalamine-containing products, which are facing in-class competition from generic drugs and have had some formulary disruption. Our future is not driven by these established products. Our future is built on our growth products, which is why I am so confident in it. 
Overall, our business is very healthy, and it's a very good picture to have so many products growing so strongly. Before handing off to Bill, I'd like to mention the progress we're making in R&D to build and deliver our pipeline. The team is doing an exceptional job. Our R&D productivity is strong. Already this year, we've had 19 major pharma and device product approvals and 11 major submission. We've also reached some key milestones such as the approval of our multidose RESTASIS and a positive relamorelin Phase IIb results that were announced just last week. Relamorelin was one of our early Open Science deals. We used an option agreement to gain access to this promising treatment for gastroparesis. Now that relamorelin has demonstrated broad efficacy and tolerability in a Phase IIb trial, we have exercised our option to acquire Motus and plan to take relamorelin into Phase III trials within Allergan. 
We have also completed 6 new steppingstone deals this quarter, which are helping to build even greater pipeline depth and breadth in our therapeutic areas. In addition to pipeline-building acquisition, we are also very interested in accretive acquisitions. While we continue to look for these accretive acquisitions, the most accretive acquisition for us today is in our own stock. 
Now let me turn the call over to Bill Meury, our Chief Commercial Officer."
36478,404686862,1070200,"Allergan plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thanks, Brent. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 11. Our core business was strong in the third quarter. Sales in all 7 therapeutic areas increased versus prior year. 5 of the 7 therapeutic areas grew at a high single- or double-digit rate. And as B",1646,"Thanks, Brent. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 11. Our core business was strong in the third quarter. Sales in all 7 therapeutic areas increased versus prior year. 5 of the 7 therapeutic areas grew at a high single- or double-digit rate. And as Brent mentioned, the majority of our revenues made up of top products and new launches that all together are growing at double-digit rate. This is a high-quality business and the foundation for 2017. Eye Care sales increased by 10% powered by RESTASIS, which showed durability in the third quarter with a sales increase of 13% versus prior year; and OZURDEX, which was up 19% in the United States and 29% internationally. And we look forward to the launch of 2 new dry eye products over the next 6 months. 
In CNS, sales increased by 3%. BOTOX therapeutic sales increased 16% globally versus the prior year, coupled with continued strong performance by VRAYLAR. Offsetting the growth in these products was a reduction in NAMENDA XR sales, driven by lower demand and a higher discount rate to maintain broad formulary coverage. We're seeing an early and strong market response to the new indication for NAMZARIC. 
In aesthetics, sales increased by 14%, driven by BOTOX and Fillers. Demand for KYBELLA is projected to increase significantly in the next 2 quarters as our DTC campaign reaches more and more consumers. Overall, demand for our aesthetic product line in the United States and internationally among dermatologists and plastic surgeons and across age demographics is very strong, and we're as optimistic about this part of the business as we've ever been.
In GI, sales increased by 9%. LINZESS, our flagship and fastest-growing product continues to produce strong results, up 42% year-over-year. And VIBERZI demand has been exceptional. Mesalamine's revenue declined overall due to lower promotion, loss of formulary coverage and the loss of exclusivity for ASACOL HD. And finally, we continue to see strong growth in our Women's Health franchise with sales up 15% as well as nice performance from urology. 
Let's take in some of our products. On Slide 12, you see our flagship IBS products LINZESS and VIBERZI. Demand for both products is very strong across-the-board and regardless of metric. Both products are attracting new users each week. Both products are being used in a broad range of patients. Both products are taking from -- share from the OTC market. Both have excellent formulary coverage, and both are being supported by significant promotional programs. The outlook for LINZESS and VIBERZI is excellent. Sales for LINZESS are up 42% versus prior year, and approximately 73% of new business for LINZESS is coming from the OTC market, which is exactly what we want. And we're preparing to launch the LINZESS 72-microgram product, which is designed to accelerate conversion of the OTC market. 
Based on sales, VIBERZI is trending at approximately 90% of LINZESS during the same time period post launch. Demand for this product is robust, and with IMS prescription levels having reached an all-time high last week, we are very optimistic about the future.
Turning to Slide 13. Our Medical Aesthetics business accounts for approximately 20% of total sales and includes 3 key products: BOTOX, Fillers and KYBELLA. This is a high-quality, double-digit-growth cash business in an expanding market, both domestically and internationally. The fundamentals here are the following: Allergan has product line depth, which no other company can match and which creates cross-selling opportunities; in other words, one product builds on the next. BOTOX is a gateway for the Fillers, and KYBELLA is a gateway to BOTOX. Allergan has a steady stream of new innovative product launches on the way. We invest more in education and training than any other company in the space, and we have market share leadership in a category that could double in size the next 5-plus years. There are 4 major trends driving aesthetics market expansion. First, more physicians are moving into aesthetics worldwide. Next, we are training more injectors. Third, there is a youth movement. Attitudes towards aesthetic procedures are changing across the world. That is especially true in the 20- to 30-year-old age segment. And finally, there is a male movement. With the launch of KYBELLA, we're seeing more interest by men in aesthetic procedures, and we expect this trend to accelerate over time.
Now I often get asked about the durability of BOTOX and future sales growth, which is an important topic. What you can see on Slide 14 is this. As successful as we've been with BOTOX, as popular and widely used as BOTOX is, we've only scratched the surface of our 3 primary growth indications: aesthetics, migraine and overactive bladder. Utilization by the eligible patient population in each area is still low, ranging from 3% to 7%. If these numbers were in the 15% to 20% range, one might anticipate growth moderation, but they're not. We believe we will stay in high growth rates for BOTOX for at least several more years, and that is why we continue to invest in sales and marketing, manufacturing and research and development and why we are confident in the future. 
Turning to Slide 15. With VRAYLAR, we're about 33 weeks into the launch and prescription levels are increasing week-over-week and faster than the market. The product is clearly distinguished by its pharmacology, symptom relief and metabolic profile for both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. VRAYLAR's trajectory is strong, and the future of VRAYLAR is promising. With NAMZARIC, we're relaunching on all fronts, with the sales force engaged and a DTC campaign ready to go in less than 2 weeks. We are already seeing a significant increase in sales in both the retail and long-term care settings. This is the first time we have an option for transitioning patients from monotherapy Aricept to NAMZARIC, and we're capitalizing on that opportunity with a starter kit that early on is getting a great deal of traction. So the differences here as compared to several months ago are: the indication for NAMZARIC is complete, the availability of starter kits is plentiful and formulary coverage is widespread. I think this franchise demonstrates the nimbleness and power of our commercial capabilities as we move from one  innovation to the next. 
Turning to Slide 16. No company has more to offer in the Eye Care space than Allergan. Overall, the dry eye market has expanded significantly since the launch of a second treatment option. At the same time, volume and sales for RESTASIS have been durable. Sales for RESTASIS were up 13% versus prior year. This growth was supported by strong unit demand in both ophthalmology and optometry. The growth in the overall market is being fueled primarily by new patients, who are on OTC tier products or receiving no treatment at all. New investments in innovations for dry eye will continue to drive the market and our business. We recently received FDA approval for RESTASIS MULTIDOSE, which we'll launch in the fourth quarter and then True Tear, which is a nasal neurostimulator that we are planning for a staged launch beginning in 2017. True Tear is a non-drop treatment for dry eye. I just returned from the AAO meeting, and this is getting a great deal of interest from the eye care community.
Turning to Slide 17 and our international business. Sales in our international business totaled nearly $700 million in the third quarter. Every single region grew in the high single- or double-digit rate. Western Europe is our largest region, and we expect Asia Pacific will be our leading international growth contributor, with China the fastest-growing aesthetics market in the world. NESEE, North East and South East Europe, is our fastest-growing region, up 26% this quarter, excluding FX. Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care anchor our business internationally. Sales for BOTOX Cosmetic and our Filler line were up 18% and 25%, excluding FX, respectively. We've launched BELKYRA, KYBELLA in the United States, in Europe and plan to have it in 10 countries by the end of the year. In terms of Eye Care, glaucoma is our largest product line and retina is the fastest growing.  In glaucoma, we're launching a multi-dose preservative-free formulation of GANFORT, and we have our XEN Gel stent, which is a minimally invasive procedure to lower IOP. XEN launched in 10 international markets already this year, and we look forward to its potential approval and launch in 2017 in the United States.
In retina, OZURDEX has a very strong following in Western Europe, and in 2017, we will expand geographically with launches in Brazil and Australia. GI product launches are also underway in our international markets with CONSTELLA, LINZESS in the United States, launched in key countries and TRUBERZI, VIBERZI in the United States, planned for 2017. Beyond the results of the quarter, we're excited about the upcoming new product launches. In Eye Care, we're focused on the launch of RESTASIS MULTIDOSE, XEN and True Tear; and in Medical Dermatology, Oxymetazoline, now called RHOFADE. In the GI space, we're launching a lower dose of LINZESS or LINZESS 72-microgram as I mentioned. In cardiology, we've recently launched BYVALSON, which is a combination of Bystolic and Valsartan. In infectious disease, we will see AVYCAZ return to full supply before year-end and with full indications for UTI and intra-abdominal infections. We expect formulary coverage to continue to be strong in 2017. We will continue to invest and leverage our platform of capabilities, which include physician and consumer e-commerce programs, DTC and a well-trained and customized sales force. Allergan has share of voice leadership in nearly every market. It's #2 in the industry in direct-to-consumer spending and has one of the most productive sales forces in the industry. And that is why I believe the fundamentals of our business are healthy and our growth outlook is excellent. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David."
36478,404686862,1070200,"Allergan plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 20. Before I discuss our R&D productivity, a few remarks on our Open Science model. Open Science is an R&D philosophy focused on 2 key elements. The first, building the pipeline defines our approach t",1351,"Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 20. Before I discuss our R&D productivity, a few remarks on our Open Science model. Open Science is an R&D philosophy focused on 2 key elements. The first, building the pipeline defines our approach to identifying, acquiring and developing the best game-changing ideas and innovation. We are agnostic where innovation comes from; academic research centers, venture-backed start-up companies, R&D based public companies or our own research centers. This maximizes our ability to deliver true innovation to the healthcare system and, most importantly, to the patients who need breakthrough medicine to treat their unmet needs. The second and very important element of Open Science is our ability and success in delivering the pipeline. Once we complete an acquisition or in-license a product, our teams advance development, prepare for regulatory approval and drive life-cycle innovation for innovative products that helps patients. We do this whilst remaining a true partner with our external collaborators. As Brent mentioned, we have achieved 19 total major pharma and device global approvals and 11 major regulatory submissions so far this year. These outstanding results have been delivered by a team of more than 2,000 dedicated scientists, R&D professionals who are delivering important new treatments for patients. This team will be the fuel that delivers more products from our pipeline of 70 mid- to late-stage programs. 
Turning to Slide 21. We are adding differentiated compounds and programs across our key therapeutic areas. We've added 6 steppingstone acquisitions since the second quarter. These are: Channel Reduction 2, a novel and innovative gene therapy for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa, a leading cause of blindness. Second, the periocular ring, designed for extended drug delivery to the eye. The first product reduces elevated intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients. Third, RORgammat inhibitors and LXR-beta agonists, highly differentiated compounds for the treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Fourth and fifth, Cenicriviroc or CVC, Evogliptin and our FXR agonist. These establish a portfolio of differentiated NASH compounds that could provide combination therapy for this multifactorial disease. Finally, a monoclonal antibody selectively targeting IL-23 for the treatment of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and potentially other autoimmune disorders. 
Turning to Slide 22. We have made significant progress in advancing major programs. In Eye Care, last week, we announced FDA approval for RESTASIS MULTIDOSE, a preservative free, multidose bottle of RESTASIS. Bill has already discussed the launch of this new product for patients suffering from dry eye disease. In CNS, and as we previously promised, we have now initiated our Phase III program for ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine, and we have initiated our Phase IIb program for atogepant in migraine prophylaxis. 
As we have also previously promised it, we have started the Phase III study for rapastinel in major depressive disorder. We expect to have top line results for the short-term studies in early 2019. But remember, we need to complete the maintenance study before we can file. As a reminder, we're also developing [indiscernible] and an earlier small molecule compound as next-generation oral NMDA receptor modulator for the treatment of MDD. 
Internationally, we received a positive opinion from the EU for TRUBERZI in GI disorders, and we expect to launch our product in international markets in 2017. In urology, the FDA's Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Drugs Advisory Committee voted recently in favor of approval for SER120 for the treatment of nocturia. We look forward to working with the agency on the approval of this product. 
Looking ahead, we have a number of near-term pipeline deliverables. In CNS, many of you have asked me about our plans regarding Cariprazine and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. After discussions with the FDA, we plan to file an sNDA for Cariprazine for this disorder in the first half of 2017. We also expect to announce Phase II top line results for BOTOX in depression in the second half of next year. 
Regarding Semprana, our inhalable dihydroergotamine treatment for acute migraine, we have resolved the issues raised by the FDA during their previous review and continue to work on scale up and manufacturability, which may result in submission in the second half of 2017. 
Turning to Medical Dermatology. We will shortly initiate later Phase II studies with our lead RORgammat inhibitor in psoriasis. Also we will complete Phase III trials for Sarecycline a potential treatment for acne, in early 2017. We recently received data from an early development study with our LXR-beta agonist. In this study target engagement was not satisfactorily achieved. So we need to reevaluate the concentration use and formulation utilized.
Now, GI. First, some breaking news for CVC, Cenicriviroc. We plan to initiate Phase III trials mid-next year. At the recent end of Phase II meeting, the FDA agreed that the compound is Phase III ready and that the primary endpoint should be reduction in fibrosis by one stage without worsening of steatohepatitis. Remember, this is the endpoint that was achieved at year 1 in the ongoing CVC CENTAUR study. The 1-year data will be presented as an oral late-breaker at the forthcoming liver meeting in Boston. The CENTAUR study meanwhile continues with 2-year data available mid-next year. 
We also expect to have Phase IIa data for Brazikumab, an oral IL-23 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of Crohn's disease in the first half of 2017. In Women's Health, we will have the second Phase III results for Esmya in uterine fibroids early next year with filing plans later in the year. 
Turning to Eye Care. Bill has already discussed True Tear and XEN. As you know, we have an option agreement with Mimetogen for Tavilermide in dry eye disease. The first 2 Phase III trials have been completed and the Mimetogen team are presently evaluating the data. 
Turning to Slide 23. We recently announced our decision to exercise our option for relamorelin. Data obtained from both the Phase IIa and Phase IIb trials are shown on this slide. I'm showing here the efficacy of relamorelin in comparison to placebo on a 4-point composite endpoint of nausea, postprandial fullness or early satiety, abdominal pain and bloating. In both studies, relamorelin was significantly more effective than placebo. In the Phase IIa study on the left, I am showing the results in a subgroup of patients with a high incidence of vomiting at a dose of 10 micrograms of relamorelin. In this subgroup, vomiting was also significantly decreased following relamorelin administration. For the Phase IIb trial, I am showing the average of efficacy of 3 doses of relamorelin, 10, 30 and 100 micrograms in comparison to placebo in all patients. In these patients, there was a substantial reduction in vomiting in relamorelin-treated patients in this trial. There was also substantial placebo reduction in vomiting. This placebo effect was surprising to investigators, KOLs and our internal team. We are working to understand this placebo effect, which, as you all know, can occur in clinical studies. 
Recent draft FDA guidance on diabetic gastroparesis drug development specifies that the use of an endpoint that measures each of the core symptoms and signs of the disease separately or as a composite with a responded affinition is recommended for the development of novel agents. So we believe that the data shown on this slide will be suitable for progression of the compound into Phase III. We are very excited about the prospect of bringing a new treatment to millions of patients who are suffering from this condition. No new drug has been approved since 1983. 
As I have outlined, we continue to make great progress with our Open Science model, with tremendous results just in the third quarter. We have many more milestones ahead to deliver for the remainder of the year and into 2017. Our ability to identify and acquire the best science, matched with our strong results and advancing innovation validates Open Science. As always, we thank our global R&D team for their outstanding work and dedication in driving innovation, delivering results and for their commitment to the work ahead for the patients we serve. 
I will now turn the call over to Tessa."
36478,404686862,1070200,"Allergan plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Please note that the discussion of continuing operations financial results excludes both Global Generics and Anda, following the completion of our Global Generics divestiture in Q3 and the sale of Anda in Q4. Tu",1626,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Please note that the discussion of continuing operations financial results excludes both Global Generics and Anda, following the completion of our Global Generics divestiture in Q3 and the sale of Anda in Q4. 
Turning to Slide 25. Before I begin reviewing the results for the quarter, I wanted to first expand on some of Brent's earlier remarks on our capital allocation decisions announced this morning. Following the receipt of the Teva proceeds, we immediately took steps to strengthen our balance sheet through debt paydown. We started repurchasing our shares in late August, and we completed $5 billion in share repurchases in October ahead of schedule. We purchased a total of 21 million shares at an average price of approximately $238 per share. We also continued to focus on evaluating options to further increase shareholder value. We therefore expanded our share repurchases by $5 billion to $15 billion in total and announced the initiation of a dividend to begin in 2017. 
First, I want to expand on the share repurchase. We concluded that there is no better investment than in our own stock. As we announced this morning, we will be executing the remaining $10 billion, utilizing an accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR. As you may all know, an ASR program allows us to reduce a significant portion of shares upfront. Since the last conference call, we continued to evaluate various methods to repurchase shares. In conjunction with our advisers, we have since developed an ASR structure that meets Irish legal requirements. Approximately 8 billion worth of shares will be retired during the month of November 2016. The remaining shares, if any, under the program would be received and retired by the third quarter of 2017 upon completion of the ASR. Completion of the ASR could occur sooner, subject to market conditions. Up to 50% of the ASR program will be hedged based upon the stock price over a reference period through a caller transaction. 
Second, we initiated a dividend starting in Q1 2017. Our company has transformed over the last 18 months to a pure branded Growth Pharma company with a strong pipeline and strong growth prospects. Given our conviction in the future of our current business and our ability to generate strong cash flow, we decided to initiate the dividend. The dividend will be funded by our ongoing cash flow while allowing for further investment in growth. We are committed to growing this dividend annually for shareholders. 
Turning to Slide 26. We remain committed to our investment-grade ratings. We expect to continue to strengthen our balance sheet through debt repayment. We've already repaid close to $10 billion in debt this year, and we have an additional $6.5 billion in contractual maturities, which we intend to pay over the next 18 months. In addition, we ended the quarter with $27.4 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Turning to our overall results for the third quarter of 2016 on Slide 27. In Q3, we delivered strong year-over-year performance. Continuing operations net revenues, which now exclude Anda Distribution, were $3.62 billion, a 4.5% increase versus prior year, primarily impacted by ASACOL HD loss of exclusivity, divestitures and lower-than-expected NAMENDA IR and XR. Excluding NAMENDA IR, divestitures and FX and an out-of-period adjustment related to discontinued operations, which impacted the third quarter of last year by $31.7 million, net revenues increased 7.4%. Gross margins for the third quarter remained strong at almost 88%. The decline versus prior year was driven primarily by higher production costs related to capacity expansion and manufacturing variances. These were costs that are accounted for within corporate and did not impact any of the segment margins, which remained very strong. Operating margins declined versus last year to 49.3%, impacted by higher sales and marketing investments to continue to support ongoing launches such as VRAYLAR, VIBERZI and KYBELLA and other marketing spend for key products as well as higher investments in R&D as a result of more projects versus the prior year. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.32 primarily reflect the loss of exclusivity of NAMENDA IR and ASACOL HD and lower sales of NAMENDA XR, higher SG&A and R&D spend compared with the third quarter of 2015. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 8.2% in the quarter. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was negative this quarter at approximately $1 billion, primarily as a result of cash tax payments of approximately $2.6 billion related to the gain from the sale of our generics business to Teva. Excluding this and the impact of R&D asset acquisitions and restructuring payments, cash flow from operations remained very strong at positive $1.72 billion. The GAAP equivalents to our financial metrics can be found in our earnings release issued this morning and posted on our website. 
Turning now to our U.S. Specialized Therapeutics results on Slide 28. The business continued to deliver strong performance year-over-year. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics revenue was $1.45 billion for the quarter, up 12.1% versus the prior year period, driven by strong growth across Medical Aesthetics of 14%, Eye Care of 13% and the strong growth in BOTOX therapeutic of 17%. Key products performed well with BOTOX, RESTASIS, Fillers and the launch of KYBELLA as key contributors to the strong performance. Sequential 2% revenue decline was driven by the typical seasonality of Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care in the summer. Gross margin continued to expand at 95.2%. 
SG&A increased versus prior year as a result of an increase in promotion efforts, including aesthetics sales force expansion and KYBELLA DTC. 
Turning to Slide 29. Our U.S. General Medicine business third quarter revenues were $1.49 billion, 4% lower than last year, primarily attributed to ASACOL HD generic entry, lower NAMENDA IR and XR revenues and lower established brands due to the CERVIDIL divestiture and ENABLEX generic entry. Adjusting for this impact, trends in our key products, including LINZESS and LO LOESTRIN continued to grow at strong double-digit rates. Third quarter gross margins continued to be stable at 85%. Sequentially, SG&A increased versus the prior year, primarily related to higher sales and marketing to support launches of VIBERZI and VRAYLAR. The decline in SG&A versus prior quarter is due primarily to timing of promotional spending. 
Turning to Slide 30 and our international results. Third quarter revenues were $698 million versus $661 million in the prior year period. Excluding foreign exchange and an out-of-period adjustment of $31.7 million, international revenues in the third quarter grew 12% versus prior year, driven by continued strong growth of BOTOX Therapeutics, BOTOX Cosmetics, Fillers and OZURDEX. Sequential revenue decline was driven by seasonality of Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care, primarily in Europe. Gross margins were 86.4% in the third quarter. Segment SG&A was $216 million, up 14.3% versus prior year, driven by continued support of Medical Aesthetics and new product launches, including BELKYRA, or KYBELLA in the U.S., XEN, Earfold, and CONSTELLA. Contribution margins improved versus prior quarter from 53.4% to 55.4%, reflected continued strong sales growth. 
Turning to Slide 31. Let me make a few comments on our 2016 full year revised guidance. We are revising our guidance for full year 2016. While we are clearly disappointed that we have to revise our guidance, the level of transformation our company has seen over the last 18 months has been unprecedented. We've carved out 2 major businesses, a very complex process. We have now completed that process this quarter with the close of Anda. We are looking forward to focusing on the future as a pure branded Growth Pharma company. We now expect full year 2016 branded revenues to be between $14,450,000,000 to $14,650,000,000, at or modestly below the low end of our previous range, reflecting the impact to sales that we saw in the third quarter and the assumption that those trends on our non-promoted established products carry into the fourth quarter. We expect continued strong performance of our top promoted products and new launches. 
Our gross margins, which were slightly lower sequentially, are now expected to finish the year between 87% to 88%, consistent with our historical performance. Our non-GAAP SG&A of approximately $4 billion and our non-GAAP R&D spend of approximately $1.5 billion remain unchanged. Net interest expense and other is in the range of $1.25 billion. Our tax rate for the full year is anticipated to be between 8% and 9%. Our tax rate should begin to trend upward toward normalized levels in early 2017. Our revised average share count for 2016 of 408 million shares includes the impact of the completed 5 billion in share repurchases as well as the impact of the 10 billion ASR we just announced. Year-end 2016 diluted share count is forecasted to be approximately 365 million, reflecting more fully the impact of the share repurchases. As mentioned earlier, there could be further adjustments in share count depending on Allergan stock price during the settlement period. Approximately 8 billion worth of shares will be retired during the month of November 2016 and the remaining shares, if any, under the program will be received and retired by the third quarter of 2017 upon completion of the ASR. As a result, we expect full year non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $13.30 and $13.50. For the fourth quarter, we expect a forecast average share count of 383 million shares for the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 32. We have strong long-duration assets and a sound strategy. We have leading top line growth and margins, driven by new innovative products and excellent manufacturing capabilities. We have strong conviction in the earnings potential and cash generation of our company, and we remain focused on long-term shareholder value creation. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent for closing remarks."

I don't want to take too long, but I guess, first of all, Brent and Tessa, maybe you could just frame how you plan to balance your optimism about the business and your motivation to drive the sales force while also ensuring that consensus expectations can be achievable going forward? That's my first question. And tying into that, how you guide next year in the face of NAMENDA XR early generic risk? And then the second question is on VRAYLAR in negative symptoms. You've mentioned a first half '17 data submission. I'm assuming that incremental data could show up in the body of the label in early '18, but when do you expect to be able to file for a formal indication for negative symptoms to be on the topical label?"

I think with respect to motivating the sales force and balancing the need to meet or beat expectations or consensus, it's something obviously we take very seriously at.",376,"Yes. So let me see if I can take those, David. Thank you for a full list of questions. I think with respect to motivating the sales force and balancing the need to meet or beat expectations or consensus, it's something obviously we take very seriously at. I'm not sure the 2 are entirely connected. Our sales force around the world is, frankly, one of the prides of Allergan. We take great amount of our time and effort to make sure that our front-line salespeople have all the tools and training and skills necessary to do the therapeutic line calls and promote our products in a compliant and risk and balanced way to build customer intimacy and relationships. And I think across a number of different dynamics, our sales force is the most productive, hardest-working sales force in the industry. I think that -- and we've been expanding it. So in Eye Care, we've expanded it. In key markets like Brazil and China, we've been expanding it. I'd also say that we have had a relatively strong stability in our sales force despite the transformation of Allergan. Our sales reps and our sales leadership is entirely, almost entirely intact from the early days of the company's transformation. So it is a very important group of individuals and colleagues for us, and it's a highly motivated, highly productive function in the company. I think the question with respect to consensus is something that Tessa and I and our entire management team take very seriously. But at the end of the day, we run the business to make the right decisions to propel growth and high profitability in the future. And so things that we did this quarter, like bringing on a second BOTOX manufacturing plant in Ireland, expanding our capacity in Waco to make many of our eye care products, investing behind our launches, pulling forward some DTC -- or not DTC, but promotional spend behind NAMZARIC, are all the types of things that I think we need to do to continue to drive the growth and do the right thing for the business, in fairness, irrespective of consensus. And so that's kind of how -- I don't know if, Tessa, do you want to add anything?"

I've done that in the past, and that has not worked out well for me, so I'm going to stay away from that. I think the better thing that we can focus on is what we can control on a day-to-day basis, which is our promotion of the better product for patients, which is NAMZARIC. Reducing the pill burden from 3 pills twice a day to 1 pill once a day is something that we know that caregivers and these patients suffering from Alzheimer's really do benefit from. And look, the early data on NAMZARIC, that Bill put up on the slide, is encouraging, so we should keep in mind, it's early. And our entire sales force and our entire promotional effort is focused on driving the better therapy in NAMZARIC, but we have work to do. Bill, anything you'd add on that?"

I'm not sure that is sustainable. And so while some may criticize our social contract and our pricing discipline, we would have not taken those price increases irregardless of the contract because it's not the right thing to do, and I think it does create additional risk or inappropriate risk for the company.

And so we're looking at lots of things. I think in terms of size, we look at everything from $100 million to several billion dollars, and I think we still retain ample capacity to continue to looking at everything that we used to do. And so we're looking at accretive deals that are in our therapeutic areas or adjacent therapeutic areas. But for now, we should just point out, the most accretive deal, overwhelmingly accretive thing we can do is buy our stock.

I don't mean to beat the dead horse but it's obviously very important and it explains why the share price is where it is. Allergan is a new company. It's a new collection of assets. You've been through tremendous transition over the last many years, not just the divestitures. And so investors listen to what you say and take what you say at face value. And for the last 12 months, I would characterize your guidance as having dripped, dripped, dripped. I mean, from double-digit top line to the $25 aspirational number that was pushed out to gross margin guidance to revenue guidance. And so my question is, obviously, guidance is really important. Market takes it very seriously. We're just trying to understand your company. What are you doing for your own internal control so that you have better visibility to communicate with investors? This quarter allows the shortfalls came from older products that I would have thought you would have foreseen. So I'm just wondering what you're doing about that going forward? And most importantly, will this be the last -- I mean, I don't think you can -- I don't know how definitive you can be, but to help us understand, will this be the last of the rebasing? And then my second question is, if you could help us to understand how to think about the pushes and pulls in 2017? Obviously, the buyback should be a positive to your bottom line, but at the same time, investors are questioning your level of R&D spend to sustain top line growth, SG&A, which is coming at and above but obviously important to sustain new product launches. So if you could sort of give us a preliminary vision for what 2017 might look like."

We'll do that in the normal course in early next year, in just a few months. But that being",514,"Yes. So thanks, Jamie. That was a lot. I'm trying to think of where to start. Look, I think I have to just mention, we're not going to provide 2017 guidance today. We'll do that in the normal course in early next year, in just a few months. But that being said, look, I -- we have a business that I think has some very important characteristics that even despite the miss today on some of the older products are the thing I hope investors focus on. We have top-tier growth. We have a portfolio that's diverse with many growth drivers, not one big growth driver but many growth drivers. You can look at products like BOTOX, up 15%; RESTASIS, up 13%; LINZESS, up 42%. Even drugs like LoLoestrin, up 16%; OZURDEX, up 25%. And I think -- see the pattern of that, the previous quarter, the previous quarter and the previous quarter and get a feel for the growth trajectory of this business. You can look at the new launches, which I said, contributed about $90 million in the quarter. VIBERZI, VRAYLAR, KYBELLA, all off to either at or expectations or exceeding expectations start. You heard David talking about filing for negative symptoms on VRAYLAR, could be, if approved by the FDA, a certainly multiple change or in terms of the sales multiples for that drug. But then I think most importantly, the question I take the most exception to is this idea that the percentage of R&D spend is too weak to propel innovation. I mean, I think that's ridiculous. I think, just to be straightforward, it's the quality of the spend against the programs and the productivity that you have. And I think when you look at our 70 late-stage programs and you think about some of the big ones that are coming over the next year or 2, whether it be Abicipar, rapastinel, ubrogepant, Esmya, relamorelin, just to name a few. Let alone drugs like [indiscernible] and others or SER120 that were kind of forgotten about in the context. We have ample new product flow, and we have several shots on goal that would -- could be blockbuster new drugs for unmet medical needs. So would you rather have that or have us spend $8 billion or $9 billion on R&D that have no productivity and late-stage failures and all the other things that come with it? I'm not saying we won't have failures. Of course, we'll have a few. But I think we spend our money more wisely, and hopefully, over time, we'll prove in a more efficient way to get meaningful innovation out to market. And just as an aside, R&D is up 29% year-to-date, so it's not that we're not increasing R&D. So hopefully, that answers some of your questions. We can continue to debate next time I see you, but we feel very good about our position. We feel very good about our growth profile, and I think we feel very confident that we will be continuing top-tier growth and top-tier profitability in 2017 and beyond."

We saw that business up about 12% this quarter after FX and one other adjustment. And so that team around the world is performing at very high levels.

That's Asia Pacific; Northeast, Southeast, Europe, essentially everything other than Western Europe; and Turkey, Middle East and Africa.

We've dramatically increased the scale and scope and intensity of our injector training program, not just in Asia Pacific but in the other 2 regions as well. And internationally, there are opportunities to run consumer advertising campaigns namely on our Fillers line, which is growing at 25% year-over-year. Not a major increase in sales force is required, but of the 3 things I mentioned that is the largest one. And the business is really very, very well resourced. The regional presidents and the country managers that run this business are very, very capable. And the trends just look very, very good. Our business hits up 12% versus prior year and is experiencing a price erosion of 1% to 2%. So it's a very, very strong product line.

If you look at new prescriptions, it's up over 20% -- excuse me, if you look at total prescriptions, it's up over 20%. If you look at new prescriptions, it's closer to 30%. Most of the expansion is coming from, as I mentioned earlier, patients who are on over-the-counter tier products or were receiving no treatment at all. The next observation is that the revenue stream for RESTASIS has been very durable. If you look at the 6-week period, for example, before the launch of [indiscernible] and the 6-week period after. And then the next final point I would make is we're focused right now on launching RESTASIS and DPF and True Tear at the end of 2016 and 2017. And I still believe that when the dust settles here, I'm sure that people at Shire feel the same way, this isn't going to be a fight to the death between 2 companies and the 2 products, but this is going to be a larger market. There's a lot more attention being paid to ocular service disease. And I think we're seeing it, a new -- a second treatment option appears to have created an expansion event in eye care, which is good. I believe that Allergan, because of our product line depth and capability, is going to maintain a majority share in a much larger market. And I think things look pretty good in that regard."

We continue to drive top-tier revenue growth and top-tier profitability. We are also making strategic Open Science investments to build even greater depth, breadth and capabilities in our R&D pipeline. 
In the third quarter, we added shareholder-friendly capital allocation to our story with a $5 billion share buyback that we completed ahead of schedule. And today, we are announcing a new board-approved action to increase return for shareholders and take our capital allocation plans to a new level. In addition to doing the things that make Allergan strong financially, we're also taking bold actions in these turbulent times when the price of healthcare is in the spotlight. A good example is our social contract with patients. We are leading the way with responsible pricing ideals for our branded therapeutic products, and we are leading the conversation to codify what our social contract means to us. It means balancing investment and innovation with pricing and access as well as quality and education. The social contract is Allergan's commitment to the people who count on us to find new treatments for their most pressing medical needs. And it is good for Allergan. So why are we able to be so bold and adapt a social -- adopt to social contract? Because it is the right thing to do and because we have such strong confidence that our business and our R&D pipeline will sustain our future growth. 
Turning to Slide 6. The 2 major actions we announced today demonstrate our deep-seated conviction in the future revenue growth as well as strong cash flows from our business. Over the last quarter, we have spent a lot of time looking at various opportunities to deploy our reloaded balance sheet to increase shareholder return, and our Board of Directors has acted. The actions we are taking today illustrate that we are focused on increasing shareholder return. First, we are beefing up our share repurchase program to a total of $15 billion. Second, we are initiating a $0.70 per share quarterly dividend for the very first time. 
Let me start with the enhanced share repurchase program. Since the Teva close, we've been aggressively buying our stock in the open market and have already repurchased $5 billion of our own stock. While we believe that our stock should be trading significantly higher than it is today, the current market conditions create an opportunity to repurchase significantly more stock. There is no more accretive asset on our radar than our own stock. So our Board of Directors has authorized an additional $5 billion repurchase. This brings our total share repurchase authorization to $15 billion. Now we are moving quickly to purchase the remaining $10 billion through an accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR, which allows us for significant upfront share count reduction. 
Next, the dividend. For the first time, our board has approved a cash dividend to return cash flow to shareholders on an ongoing basis. The initiation of a dividend is consistent with our Growth Pharma profile, the free cash flow that our business generates and our desire to increase shareholder return. This dividend will be funded from our ongoing cash flow without dipping into the proceeds from our Teva transaction. And we expect it to grow annually while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings. And we retain the vast majority of our firepower and flexibility to continue to invest in our business, acquire additional steppingstone assets and provide fuel for sustainable top line growth. Our capital allocation actions are intended to balance shareholder return with the investment for future growth. 
Turning to our operating performance on Slide 7 and our report card on how we did this quarter. Obviously, we are disappointed that our results this quarter did not meet our expectations, and therefore, we are revising our 2016 full year guidance. However, we believe that we are incredibly well positioned for 2017 and beyond. So let's look at the health of our company. In my view, there are 5 key measures to gauge the health and growth prospects of any biopharmaceutical company. First, how are the promoted products doing; second, how are the new product launches going; third, how are the established products faring near the end of their patent lives or when they are no longer being promoted; fourth, how is the pipeline progressing; and finally, how is the company performing against key profitability metrics. 
Allergan continues to generate sales growth that is at the top end of our peer group. Sales were $3.6 billion, up more than 7%, excluding NAMENDA IR, divestitures, FX and other adjustments. Our key promoted products are growing nicely, most of them double digit. Our new product launches are performing exceptionally well. I'm absolutely thrilled with how we are doing with our key brands and future growth drivers. Our pipeline is on a roll, and our profitability metrics are in the top tier of our peer group. Where we missed the mark was among a few of our established brands and non-promoted products. All in all, the report card for growth looks good this quarter, setting us up for growth in 2017 and beyond. 
Even with the weakness in our established and non-promoted products, we retain a top-tier profitability profile with a gross margin of 87.8% and an operating margin of 49.3%. These metrics were a little lighter this quarter, partly due to investments we are making in manufacturing to support continued strong growth of BOTOX and our Eye Care products and continued promotional investment behind our brands and increased R&D investment versus last year. Our non-GAAP EPS was $3.32. I'm confident that our team has made the right investments in our business and has laid a strong foundation for top-tier growth and profitability.
You can see on Slide 8 that the majority of our top global products are growing and along with the new launches, they represent 73% of our total revenue, many of them are growing double-digit rates, including BOTOX, up 15%; RESTASIS, up 13%; LINZESS, up 42%; our Filler line, up 21%; LO LOESTRIN, up 16%; OZURDEX, up 25%. I'm also proud to see new product launches contributing more than $90 million this quarter. This is a top-tier growth story. 
On the established and non-promoted products, we had more erosion than expected on NAMENDA XR and our mesalamine-containing products, which are facing in-class competition from generic drugs and have had some formulary disruption. Our future is not driven by these established products. Our future is built on our growth products, which is why I am so confident in it. 
Overall, our business is very healthy, and it's a very good picture to have so many products growing so strongly. Before handing off to Bill, I'd like to mention the progress we're making in R&D to build and deliver our pipeline. The team is doing an exceptional job. Our R&D productivity is strong. Already this year, we've had 19 major pharma and device product approvals and 11 major submissions. We've also reached some key milestones such as the approval of our multidose RESTASIS and a positive relamorelin Phase IIb results that were announced just last week. Relamorelin was one of our early Open Science deals. We used an option agreement to gain access to this promising treatment for gastroparesis. Now that relamorelin has demonstrated broad efficacy and tolerability in a Phase IIb trial, we have exercised our option to acquire Motus and plan to take relamorelin into Phase III trials within Allergan. 
We have also completed 6 new steppingstone deals this quarter, which are helping to build even greater pipeline depth and breadth in our therapeutic areas. In addition to pipeline-building acquisitions, we are also very interested in accretive acquisitions. While we continue to look for these accretive acquisitions, the most accretive acquisition for us today is in our own stock. 
Now let me turn the call over to Bill Meury, our Chief Commercial Officer."

Sales in all 7 therapeutic areas increased versus prior year. 5 of the 7 therapeutic areas grew at a high single- or double-digit rate. And as Brent mentioned, the majority of our revenues made up of top products and new launches that all together are growing at double-digit rate. This is a high-quality business and the foundation for 2017. Eye Care sales increased by 10% powered by RESTASIS, which showed durability in the third quarter with a sales increase of 13% versus prior year; and OZURDEX, which was up 19% in the United States and 29% internationally. And we look forward to the launch of 2 new dry eye products over the next 6 months. 
In CNS, sales increased by 3%. BOTOX therapeutic sales increased 16% globally versus the prior year, coupled with continued strong performance by VRAYLAR. Offsetting the growth in these products was a reduction in NAMENDA XR sales, driven by lower demand and a higher discount rate to maintain broad formulary coverage. We're seeing an early and strong market response to the new indication for NAMZARIC. 
In aesthetics, sales increased by 14%, driven by BOTOX and Fillers. Demand for KYBELLA is projected to increase significantly in the next 2 quarters as our DTC campaign reaches more and more consumers. Overall, demand for our aesthetic product line in the United States and internationally among dermatologists and plastic surgeons and across age demographics is very strong, and we're as optimistic about this part of the business as we've ever been.
In GI, sales increased by 9%. LINZESS, our flagship and fastest-growing product continues to produce strong results, up 42% year-over-year. And VIBERZI demand has been exceptional. Mesalamine's revenue declined overall due to lower promotion, loss of formulary coverage and the loss of exclusivity for ASACOL HD. And finally, we continue to see strong growth in our Women's Health franchise with sales up 15% as well as nice performance from urology. 
Let's dig into some of our products. On Slide 12, you see our flagship IBS products LINZESS and VIBERZI. Demand for both products is very strong across-the-board and regardless of metric. Both products are attracting new users each week. Both products are being used in a broad range of patients. Both products are taking from -- share from the OTC market. Both have excellent formulary coverage, and both are being supported by significant promotional programs. The outlook for LINZESS and VIBERZI is excellent. Sales for LINZESS are up 42% versus prior year, and approximately 73% of new business for LINZESS is coming from the OTC market, which is exactly what we want. And we're preparing to launch the LINZESS 72-microgram product, which is designed to accelerate conversion of the OTC market. 
Based on sales, VIBERZI is trending at approximately 90% of LINZESS during the same time period post launch. Demand for this product is robust, and with IMS prescription levels having reached an all-time high last week, we are very optimistic about the future.
Turning to Slide 13. Our Medical Aesthetics business accounts for approximately 20% of total sales and includes 3 key products: BOTOX, Fillers and KYBELLA. This is a high-quality, double digit growth, cash business in an expanding market, both domestically and internationally. The fundamentals here are the following: Allergan has product line depth, which no other company can match and which creates cross-selling opportunities; in other words, one product builds on the next. BOTOX is a gateway for the Fillers, and KYBELLA is a gateway to BOTOX. Allergan has a steady stream of new innovative product launches on the way. We invest more in education and training than any other company in the space, and we have market share leadership in a category that could double in size the next 5-plus years. There are 4 major trends driving aesthetics market expansion. First, more physicians are moving into aesthetics worldwide. Next, we are training more injectors. Third, there is a youth movement. Attitudes towards aesthetic procedures are changing across the world. That is especially true in the 20- to 30-year-old age segment. And finally, there is a male movement. With the launch of KYBELLA, we're seeing more interest by men in aesthetic procedures, and we expect this trend to accelerate over time.
Now I often get asked about the durability of BOTOX and future sales growth, which is an important topic. What you can see on Slide 14 is this. As successful as we've been with BOTOX, as popular and widely used as BOTOX is, we've only scratched the surface of our 3 primary growth indications: aesthetics, migraine and overactive bladder. Utilization by the eligible patient population in each area is still low, ranging from 3% to 7%. If these numbers were in the 15% to 20% range, one might anticipate growth moderation, but they're not. We believe we will stay in high growth rates for BOTOX for at least several more years, and that is why we continue to invest in sales and marketing, manufacturing and research and development and why we are confident in the future. 
Turning to Slide 15. With VRAYLAR, we're about 33 weeks into the launch and prescription levels are increasing week-over-week and faster than the market. The product is clearly distinguished by its pharmacology, symptom relief and metabolic profile for both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. VRAYLAR's trajectory is strong, and the future of VRAYLAR is promising. With NAMZARIC, we're relaunching on all fronts. With the sales force engaged and a DTC campaign ready to go in less than 2 weeks, we are already seeing a significant increase in sales in both the retail and long-term care settings. This is the first time we have an option for transitioning patients from monotherapy Aricept to NAMZARIC, and we're capitalizing on that opportunity with a starter kit that early on is getting a great deal of traction. So the differences here as compared to several months ago are: the indication for NAMZARIC is complete, the availability of starter kits is plentiful and formulary coverage is widespread. I think this franchise demonstrates the nimbleness and power of our commercial capabilities as we move from one  innovation to the next. 
Turning to Slide 16. No company has more to offer in the Eye Care space than Allergan. Overall, the dry eye market has expanded significantly since the launch of a second treatment option. At the same time, volume and sales for RESTASIS have been durable. Sales for RESTASIS were up 13% versus prior year. This growth was supported by strong unit demand in both ophthalmology and optometry. The growth in the overall market is being fueled primarily by new patients who are on OTC tier products or receiving no treatment at all. New investments in innovations for dry eye will continue to drive the market and our business. We recently received FDA approval for RESTASIS MULTIDOSE, which we'll launch in the fourth quarter and then True Tear, which is a nasal neurostimulator that we are planning for a staged launch beginning in 2017. True Tear is a non-drop treatment for dry eye. I just returned from the AAO meeting, and this is getting a great deal of interest from the eye care community.
Turning to Slide 17 and our international business. Sales in our international business totaled nearly $700 million in the third quarter. Every single region grew in the high single- or double-digit rate. Western Europe is our largest region, and we expect Asia Pacific will be our leading international growth contributor, with China the fastest-growing aesthetics market in the world. NESEE, North East and South East Europe, is our fastest-growing region, up 26% this quarter, excluding FX. Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care anchor our business internationally. Sales for BOTOX Cosmetic and our Filler line were up 18% and 25%, excluding FX, respectively. We've launched BELKYRA, KYBELLA in the United States, in Europe and plan to have it in 10 countries by the end of the year. In terms of Eye Care, glaucoma is our largest product line and retina is the fastest growing.  In glaucoma, we're launching a multi-dose preservative-free formulation of GANFORT, and we have our XEN Gel stent, which is a minimally invasive procedure to lower IOP. XEN launched in 10 international markets already this year, and we look forward to its potential approval and launch in 2017 in the United States.
In retina, OZURDEX has a very strong following in Western Europe, and in 2017, we will expand geographically with launches in Brazil and Australia. GI product launches are also underway in our international markets with CONSTELLA, LINZESS in the United States, launched in key countries and TRUBERZI, VIBERZI in the United States, planned for 2017. Beyond the results of the quarter, we're excited about the upcoming new product launches. In Eye Care, we're focused on the launch of RESTASIS MULTIDOSE, XEN and True Tear; and in Medical Dermatology, Oxymetazoline, now called RHOFADE. In the GI space, we're launching a lower dose of LINZESS or LINZESS 72-microgram as I mentioned. In cardiology, we've recently launched BYVALSON, which is a combination of Bystolic and Valsartan. In infectious disease, we will see AVYCAZ return to full supply before year-end and with full indications for UTI and intra-abdominal infections. We expect formulary coverage to continue to be strong in 2017. We will continue to invest and leverage our platform of capabilities, which include physician and consumer e-commerce programs, DTC and a well-trained and customized sales force. Allergan has share of voice leadership in nearly every market. It's #2 in the industry in direct-to-consumer spending and has one of the most productive sales forces in the industry. And that is why I believe the fundamentals of our business are healthy and our growth outlook is excellent. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David."

Before I discuss our R&D productivity, a few remarks on our Open Science model. Open Science is an R&D philosophy focused on 2 key elements. The first, building the pipeline defines our approach to identifying, acquiring and developing the best game-changing ideas and innovation. We are agnostic where innovation comes from; academic research centers, venture-backed start-up companies, R&D based public companies or our own research centers. This maximizes our ability to deliver true innovation to the healthcare system and, most importantly, to the patients who need breakthrough medicine to treat their unmet needs. The second and very important element of Open Science is our ability and success in delivering the pipeline. Once we complete an acquisition or in-license a product, our teams advance development, prepare for regulatory approval and drive life-cycle innovation for innovative products that help patients. We do this whilst remaining a true partner with our external collaborators. As Brent mentioned, we have achieved 19 total major pharma and device global approvals and 11 major regulatory submissions so far this year. These outstanding results have been delivered by a team of more than 2,000 dedicated scientists, R&D professionals who are delivering important new treatments for patients. This team will be the fuel that delivers more products from our pipeline of 70 mid- to late stage programs. 
Turning to Slide 21. We are adding differentiated compounds and programs across our key therapeutic areas. We've added 6 steppingstone acquisitions since the second quarter. These are: Channel Reduction 2, a novel and innovative gene therapy for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa, a leading cause of blindness. Second, the periocular ring, designed for extended drug delivery to the eye. The first product reduces elevated intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients. Third, RORgammat inhibitors and LXR-beta agonists, highly differentiated compounds for the treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Fourth and fifth, Cenicriviroc or CVC, Evogliptin and our FXR agonist. These establish a portfolio of differentiated NASH compounds that could provide combination therapy for this multifactorial disease. Finally, a monoclonal antibody selectively targeting IL-23 for the treatment of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and potentially other autoimmune disorders. 
Turning to Slide 22. We have made significant progress in advancing major programs. In Eye Care, last week, we announced FDA approval for RESTASIS MULTIDOSE, a preservative free, multidose bottle of RESTASIS. Bill has already discussed the launch of this new product for patients suffering from dry eye disease. In CNS, and as we previously promised, we have now initiated our Phase III program for ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine, and we have initiated a Phase IIb program for atogepant in migraine prophylaxis. 
As we have also previously promised, we have started the Phase III study for rapastinel in major depressive disorder. We expect to have top line results for the short-term studies in early 2019. But remember, we need to complete the maintenance study before we can file. As a reminder, we're also developing [indiscernible] and an earlier small molecule compound as next-generation oral NMDA receptor modulator for the treatment of MDD. 
Internationally, we received a positive opinion from the EU for TRUBERZI in GI disorders, and we expect to launch our product in international markets in 2017. In urology, the FDA's Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Drugs Advisory Committee voted recently in favor of approval for SER120 for the treatment of nocturia. We look forward to working with the agency on the approval of this product. 
Looking ahead, we have a number of near-term pipeline deliverables. In CNS, many of you have asked me about our plans regarding Cariprazine and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. After discussions with the FDA, we plan to file an sNDA for Cariprazine for this disorder in the first half of 2017. We also expect to announce Phase II top line results for BOTOX in depression in the second half of next year. 
Regarding Semprana, our inhalable dihydroergotamine treatment for acute migraine, we have resolved the issues raised by the FDA during their previous review and continue to work on scale up and manufacturability, which may result in submission in the second half of 2017. 
Turning to Medical Dermatology. We will shortly initiate later Phase II studies with our lead RORgammat inhibitor in psoriasis. Also we will complete Phase III trials for Sarecycline a potential treatment for acne, in early 2017. We recently received data from an early development study with our LXR-beta agonist. In this study target engagement was not satisfactorily achieved. So we need to reevaluate the concentration used and formulation utilized.
Now, GI. First, some breaking news for CVC, Cenicriviroc. We plan to initiate Phase III trials mid-next year. At the recent end of Phase II meeting, the FDA agreed that the compound is Phase III ready and that the primary endpoint should be reduction in fibrosis by one stage without worsening of steatohepatitis. Remember, this is the endpoint that was achieved at year 1 in the ongoing CVC CENTAUR study. The 1-year data will be presented as an oral late-breaker at the forthcoming liver meeting in Boston. The CENTAUR study meanwhile continues with 2-year data available mid-next year. 
We also expect to have Phase IIa data for Brazikumab, an oral IL-23 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of Crohn's disease in the first half of 2017. In Women's Health, we will have the second Phase III results for Esmya in uterine fibroids early next year with filing plans later in the year. 
Turning to Eye Care. Bill has already discussed True Tear and XEN. As you know, we have an option agreement with Mimetogen for Tavilermide in dry eye disease. The first 2 Phase III trials have been completed and the Mimetogen team are presently evaluating the data. 
Turning to Slide 23. We recently announced our decision to exercise our option for relamorelin. Data obtained from both the Phase IIa and Phase IIb trials are shown on this slide. I'm showing here the efficacy of relamorelin in comparison to placebo on a 4-point composite endpoint of nausea, postprandial fullness or early satiety, abdominal pain and bloating. In both studies, relamorelin was significantly more effective than placebo. In the Phase IIa study on the left, I am showing the results in a subgroup of patients with a high incidence of vomiting at a dose of 10 micrograms of relamorelin. In this subgroup, vomiting was also significantly decreased following relamorelin administration. For the Phase IIb trial, I am showing the average of efficacy of 3 doses of relamorelin, 10, 30 and 100 micrograms in comparison to placebo in all patients. In these patients, there was a substantial reduction in vomiting in relamorelin-treated patients in this trial. There was also substantial placebo reduction in vomiting. This placebo effect was surprising to investigators, KOLs and our internal team. We are working to understand this placebo effect, which, as you all know, can occur in clinical studies. 
Recent draft FDA guidance on diabetic gastroparesis drug development specifies that the use of an endpoint that measures each of the core symptoms and signs of the disease separately or as a composite with a responded affinition is recommended for the development of novel agents. So we believe that the data shown on this slide will be suitable for progression of the compound into Phase III. We are very excited about the prospect of bringing a new treatment to millions of patients who are suffering from this condition. No new drug has been approved since 1983. 
As I have outlined, we continue to make great progress with our Open Science model, with tremendous results just in the third quarter. We have many more milestones ahead to deliver for the remainder of the year and into 2017. Our ability to identify and acquire the best science, matched with our strong results and advancing innovation validates Open Science. As always, we thank our global R&D team for their outstanding work and dedication in driving innovation, delivering results and for their commitment to the work ahead for the patients we serve. 
I will now turn the call over to Tessa."
36478,404686862,1070485,"Allergan plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Please note that the discussion of continuing operations financial results excludes both Global Generics and Anda, following the completion of our Global Generics divestiture in Q3 and the sale of Anda in Q4. Tu",1627,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Please note that the discussion of continuing operations financial results excludes both Global Generics and Anda, following the completion of our Global Generics divestiture in Q3 and the sale of Anda in Q4. 
Turning to Slide 25. Before I begin reviewing the results for the quarter, I wanted to first expand on some of Brent's earlier remarks on our capital allocation decisions announced this morning. Following the receipt of the Teva proceeds, we immediately took steps to strengthen our balance sheet through debt pay down. We started repurchasing our shares in late August, and we completed $5 billion in share repurchases in October ahead of schedule. We purchased a total of 21 million shares at an average price of approximately $238 per share. We also continued to focus on evaluating options to further increase shareholder value. We therefore expanded our share repurchases by $5 billion to $15 billion in total and announced the initiation of a dividend to begin in 2017. 
First, I want to expand on the share repurchase. We concluded that there is no better investment than in our own stock. As we announced this morning, we will be executing the remaining $10 billion, utilizing an accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR. As you may all know, an ASR program allows us to reduce a significant portion of shares upfront. Since the last conference call, we continued to evaluate various methods to repurchase shares. In conjunction with our advisers, we have since developed an ASR structure that meets Irish legal requirements. Approximately 8 billion worth of shares will be retired during the month of November 2016. The remaining shares, if any, under the program would be received and retired by the third quarter of 2017 upon completion of the ASR. Completion of the ASR could occur sooner, subject to market conditions. Up to 50% of the ASR program will be hedged based upon the stock price over a reference period through a collar transaction. 
Second, we initiated a dividend starting in Q1 2017. Our company has transformed over the last 18 months to a pure branded Growth Pharma company with a strong pipeline and strong growth prospects. Given our conviction in the future of our current business and our ability to generate strong cash flow, we decided to initiate the dividend. The dividend will be funded by our ongoing cash flow while allowing for further investment in growth. We are committed to growing this dividend annually for shareholders. 
Turning to Slide 26. We remain committed to our investment-grade ratings. We expect to continue to strengthen our balance sheet through debt repayment. We've already repaid close to $10 billion in debt this year, and we have an additional $6.5 billion in contractual maturities, which we intend to pay over the next 18 months. In addition, we ended the quarter with $27.4 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Turning to our overall results for the third quarter of 2016 on Slide 27. In Q3, we delivered strong year-over-year performance. Continuing operations net revenues, which now exclude Anda Distribution, were $3.62 billion, a 4.5% increase versus prior year, primarily impacted by ASACOL HD loss of exclusivity, divestitures and lower-than-expected NAMENDA IR and XR. Excluding NAMENDA IR, divestitures and FX and an out-of-period adjustment related to discontinued operations, which impacted the third quarter of last year by $31.7 million, net revenues increased 7.4%. Gross margins for the third quarter remained strong at almost 88%. The decline versus prior year was driven primarily by higher production costs related to capacity expansion and manufacturing variances. These were costs that are accounted for within corporate and did not impact any of the segment margins, which remained very strong. Operating margins declined versus last year to 49.3%, impacted by higher sales and marketing investments to continue to support ongoing launches such as VRAYLAR, VIBERZI and KYBELLA and other marketing spend for key products as well as higher investments in R&D as a result of more projects versus the prior year. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.32 primarily reflect the loss of exclusivity of NAMENDA IR and ASACOL HD and lower sales of NAMENDA XR, higher SG&A and R&D spend compared with the third quarter of 2015. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 8.2% in the quarter. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was negative this quarter at approximately $1 billion, primarily as a result of cash tax payments of approximately $2.6 billion related to the gain from the sale of our generics business to Teva. Excluding this and the impact of R&D asset acquisitions and restructuring payments, cash flow from operations remained very strong at positive $1.72 billion. The GAAP equivalents to our financial metrics can be found in our earnings release issued this morning and posted on our website. 
Turning now to our U.S. Specialized Therapeutics results on Slide 28. The business continued to deliver strong performance year-over-year. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics revenue was $1.45 billion for the quarter, up 12.1% versus the prior year period, driven by strong growth across Medical Aesthetics of 14%, Eye Care of 13% and the strong growth in BOTOX therapeutic of 17%. Key products performed well with BOTOX, RESTASIS, Fillers and the launch of KYBELLA as key contributors to the strong performance. Sequential 2% revenue decline was driven by the typical seasonality of Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care in the summer. Gross margin continued to expand at 95.2%. 
SG&A increased versus prior year as a result of an increase in promotion efforts, including aesthetics sales force expansion and KYBELLA DTC. 
Turning to Slide 29. Our U.S. General Medicine business third quarter revenues were $1.49 billion, 4% lower than last year, primarily attributed to ASACOL HD generic entry, lower NAMENDA IR and XR revenues and lower established brands due to the CERVIDIL divestiture and ENABLEX generic entry. Adjusting for this impact, trends in our key products, including LINZESS and LO LOESTRIN continued to grow at strong double-digit rates. Third quarter gross margins continued to be stable at 85%. Sequentially, SG&A increased versus the prior year, primarily related to higher sales and marketing to support launches of VIBERZI and VRAYLAR. The decline in SG&A versus prior quarter is due primarily to timing of promotional spending. 
Turning to Slide 30 and our international results. Third quarter revenues were $698 million versus $661 million in the prior year period. Excluding foreign exchange and an out-of-period adjustment of $31.7 million, international revenues in the third quarter grew 12% versus prior year, driven by continued strong growth of BOTOX Therapeutics, BOTOX Cosmetics, Fillers and OZURDEX. Sequential revenue decline was driven by seasonality of Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care, primarily in Europe. Gross margins were 86.4% in the third quarter. Segment SG&A was $216 million, up 14.3% versus prior year, driven by continued support of Medical Aesthetics and new product launches, including BELKYRA, or KYBELLA in the U.S., XEN, Earfold, and CONSTELLA. Contribution margins improved versus prior quarter from 53.4% to 55.4%, reflected continued strong sales growth. 
Turning to Slide 31. Let me make a few comments on our 2016 full year revised guidance. We are revising our guidance for full year 2016. While we are clearly disappointed that we have to revise our guidance, the level of transformation our company has seen over the last 18 months has been unprecedented. We've carved out 2 major businesses, a very complex process. We have now completed that process this quarter with the close of Anda. We are looking forward to focusing on the future as a pure branded Growth Pharma company. We now expect full year 2016 branded revenues to be between $14,450,000,000 to $14,650,000,000, at or modestly below the low end of our previous range.  Reflecting the impact to sales that we saw in the third quarter and the assumption that those trends on our non-promoted established products carry into the fourth quarter, we expect continued strong performance of our top promoted products and new launches. 
Our gross margins, which were slightly lower sequentially, are now expected to finish the year between 87% to 88%, consistent with our historical performance. Our non-GAAP SG&A of approximately $4 billion and our non-GAAP R&D spend of approximately $1.5 billion remain unchanged. Net interest expense and other is in the range of $1.25 billion. Our tax rate for the full year is anticipated to be between 8% and 9%. Our tax rate should begin to trend upward toward normalized levels in early 2017. Our revised average share count for 2016 of 408 million shares includes the impact of the completed 5 billion in share repurchases as well as the impact of the 10 billion ASR we just announced. Year-end 2016 diluted share count is forecasted to be approximately 365 million, reflecting more fully the impact of the share repurchases. As mentioned earlier, there could be further adjustments in share count depending on Allergan stock price during the settlement period. Approximately 8 billion worth of shares will be retired during the month of November 2016 and the remaining shares, if any, under the program will be received and retired by the third quarter of 2017 upon completion of the ASR. As a result, we expect full year non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $13.30 and $13.50. For the fourth quarter, we expect a forecast average share count of 383 million shares for the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 32. We have strong long-duration assets and a sound strategy. We have leading top line growth and margins, driven by new innovative products and excellent manufacturing capabilities. We have strong conviction in the earnings potential and cash generation of our company, and we remain focused on long-term shareholder value creation. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent for closing remarks."

That's my first question. And tying into that, how you guide next year in the face of NAMENDA XR early generic risk? And then the second question is on VRAYLAR in negative symptoms. You've mentioned a first half '17 data submission.

So let me see if I can take those, David. Thank you for a full list of questions. I think with respect to motivating the sales force and balancing the need to meet or beat expectations or consensus, it's something obviously we take very seriously at. I'm not sure the 2 are entirely connected. Our sales force around the world is, frankly, one of the prides of Allergan. We take great amount of our time and effort to make sure that our front-line salespeople have all the tools and training and skills necessary to do the therapeutic line calls and promote our products in a compliant and risk and balanced way to build customer intimacy and relationships. And I think across a number of different dynamics, our sales force is the most productive, hardest-working sales force in the industry. I think that -- and we've been expanding it. So in Eye Care, we've expanded it. In key markets like Brazil and China, we've been expanding it. I'd also say that we have had a relatively strong stability in our sales force despite the transformation of Allergan. Our sales reps and our sales leadership is entirely, almost entirely intact from the early days of the company's transformation. So it is a very important group of individuals and colleagues for us, and it's a highly motivated, highly productive function in the company. I think the question with respect to consensus is something that Tessa and I and our entire management team take very seriously. But at the end of the day, we run the business to make the right decisions to propel growth and high profitability in the future. And so things that we did this quarter, like bringing on a second BOTOX manufacturing plant in Ireland, expanding our capacity in Waco to make many of our eye care products, investing behind our launches, pulling forward some DTC -- or not DTC, but promotional spend behind NAMZARIC, are all the types of things that I think we need to do to continue to drive the growth and do the right thing for the business, in fairness, irrespective of consensus. And so that's kind of how -- I don't know if, Tessa, do you want to add anything?"

I've done that in the past, and that has not worked out well for me, so I'm going to step away from that. I think the better thing that we can focus on is what we can control on a day-to-day basis, which is our promotion of the better product for patients, which is NAMZARIC. Reducing the pill burden from 3 pills twice a day to 1 pill once a day is something that we know that caregivers and these patients suffering from Alzheimer's really do benefit from. And look, the early data on NAMZARIC, that Bill put up on the slide, is encouraging, so we should keep in mind, it's early. And our entire sales force and our entire promotional effort is focused on driving the better therapy in NAMZARIC, but we have work to do. Bill, anything you'd add on that?"

I think I'm not -- I don't want to make excuses, but rather I accept full responsibility and accountability for the situation. But we did have a lot going on this year with the transformation of the company, almost a complete transformation of the company. And perhaps we didn't anticipate some of these older product erosions that happened. And to be fair, I think this is true across the industry. I think competing in categories where there is strong generic alternatives is becoming increasingly more difficult. And then, frankly, with the mesalamine franchise, we were excluded by one major exclusion list with that particular product, and that does -- was unanticipated, unlikely to happen to any of our other products in 2017, frankly, or maybe even '18, but something that when it happens does have an impact on sales.

I think looking at earnings for the companies that have reported before us, many of them have seen less-than-stellar growth in their key promoter products, but they've achieved their results by price increases in their established products. I'm not sure that is sustainable. And so while some may criticize our social contract and our pricing discipline, we would have not taken those price increases irregardless of the contract because it's not the right thing to do, and I think it does create additional risk or inappropriate risk for the company.

And so we're looking at lots of things. I think in terms of size, we look at everything from $100 million to several billion dollars, and I think we still retain ample capacity to continue to looking at everything that we used to do. And so we're looking at accretive deals that are in our therapeutic areas or adjacent to our therapeutic areas.

I don't mean to beat the dead horse but it's obviously very important and it explains why the share price is where it is. Allergan is a new company. It's a new collection of assets. You've been through tremendous transition over the last many years, not just the divestitures. And so investors listen to what you say and take what you say at face value. And for the last 12 months, I would characterize your guidance as having dripped, dripped, dripped. I mean, from double-digit top line to the $25 aspirational number that was pushed out to gross margin guidance to revenue guidance. And so my question is, obviously, guidance is really important. Market takes it very seriously. We're just trying to understand your company. What are you doing for your own internal control so that you have better visibility to communicate with investors? This quarter a lot of the shortfalls came from older products that I would have thought you would have foreseen. So I'm just wondering what you're doing about that going forward? And most importantly, will this be the last -- I mean, I don't think you can -- I don't know how definitive you can be, but to help us understand, will this be the last of the rebasing? And then my second question is, if you could help us to understand how to think about the pushes and pulls in 2017? Obviously, the buyback should be a positive to your bottom line, but at the same time, investors are questioning your level of R&D spend to sustain top line growth, SG&A, which is coming in above but obviously important to sustain new product launches. So if you could sort of give us a preliminary vision for what 2017 might look like."

We'll do that in the normal course in early next year, in just a few months. But that being",514,"Yes. So thanks, Jamie. That was a lot. I'm trying to think of where to start. Look, I think I have to just mention, we're not going to provide 2017 guidance today. We'll do that in the normal course in early next year, in just a few months. But that being said, look, I -- we have a business that I think has some very important characteristics that even despite the miss today on some of the older products are the thing I hope investors focus on. We have top-tier growth. We have a portfolio that's diverse with many growth drivers, not one big growth driver but many growth drivers. You can look at products like BOTOX, up 15%; RESTASIS, up 13%; LINZESS, up 42%. Even drugs like LoLoestrin, up 16%; OZURDEX, up 25%. And I think -- see the pattern of that, the previous quarter, the previous quarter and the previous quarter and get a feel for the growth trajectory of this business. You can look at the new launches, which I said, contributed about $90 million in the quarter. VIBERZI, VRAYLAR, KYBELLA, all off to either at our expectations or exceeding expectations start. You heard David talking about filing for negative symptoms on VRAYLAR, could be, if approved by the FDA, a certainly multiple change or in terms of the sales multiples for that drug. But then I think most importantly, the question I take the most exception to is this idea that the percentage of R&D spend is too weak to propel innovation. I mean, I think that's ridiculous. I think, just to be straightforward, it's the quality of the spend against the programs and the productivity that you have. And I think when you look at our 70 late-stage programs and you think about some of the big ones that are coming over the next year or 2, whether it be Abicipar, rapastinel, ubrogepant, Esmya, relamorelin, just to name a few. Let alone drugs like RHOFADE and others or SER120 that were kind of forgotten about in the context. We have ample new product flow, and we have several shots on goal that would -- could be blockbuster new drugs for unmet medical needs. So would you rather have that or have us spend $8 billion or $9 billion on R&D to have no productivity and late-stage failures and all the other things that come with it? I'm not saying we won't have failures. Of course, we'll have a few. But I think we spend our money more wisely, and hopefully, over time, we'll prove in a more efficient way to get meaningful innovation out to market. And just as an aside, R&D is up 29% year-to-date, so it's not that we're not increasing R&D. So hopefully, that answers some of your questions. We can continue to debate next time I see you, but we feel very good about our position. We feel very good about our growth profile, and I think we feel very confident that we will be continuing top-tier growth and top-tier profitability in 2017 and beyond."

We saw that business up about 12% this quarter after FX and one other adjustment. And so that team around the world is performing at very high levels.

That's Asia Pacific; Northeast, Southeast, Europe, essentially everything other than Western Europe; and Turkey, Middle East and Africa.

We've dramatically increased the scale and scope and intensity of our injector training program, not just in Asia Pacific but in the other 2 regions as well. And internationally, there are opportunities to run consumer advertising campaigns namely on our fillers line, which is growing at 25% year-over-year. Not a major increase in sales force is required, but of the 3 things I mentioned that is the largest one. And the business is really very, very well resourced. The regional presidents and the country managers that run this business are very, very capable. And the trends just look very, very good. Our business hits up 12% versus prior year and is experiencing a price erosion of 1% to 2%. So it's a very, very strong product line.

If you look at new prescriptions, it's up over 20% -- excuse me, if you look at total prescriptions, it's up over 20%. If you look at new prescriptions, it's closer to 30%. Most of the expansion is coming from, as I mentioned earlier, patients who are on over-the-counter tear products or were receiving no treatment at all. The next observation is that the revenue stream for RESTASIS has been very durable. If you look at the 6-week period, for example, before the launch of [indiscernible] and the 6-week period after. And then the next final point I would make is we're focused right now on launching RESTASIS and DPF and True Tear at the end of 2016 and 2017. And I still believe that when the dust settles here, I'm sure that people at Shire feel the same way, this isn't going to be a fight to the death between the 2 companies and the 2 products, but this is going to be a larger market. There's a lot more attention being paid to ocular surface disease. And I think we're seeing it, a new -- a second treatment option appears to have created an expansion event in eye care, which is good. I believe that Allergan, because of our product line depth and capability, is going to maintain a majority share in a much larger market. And I think things look pretty good in that regard."

36478,404686862,1071462,"Allergan plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Great. Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. At Allergan, we continue to take bold actions as we move forward with our Growth Pharma agenda. We continue to drive top-tier revenue growth and top-tier profitability. We are also making strategic Open",1342,"Great. Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. At Allergan, we continue to take bold actions as we move forward with our Growth Pharma agenda. We continue to drive top-tier revenue growth and top-tier profitability. We are also making strategic Open Science investments to build even greater depth, breadth and capabilities in our R&D pipeline. 
In the third quarter, we added shareholder-friendly capital allocation to our story with a $5 billion share buyback that we completed ahead of schedule. And today, we are announcing a new board-approved action to increase return for shareholders and take our capital allocation plans to a new level. In addition to doing the things that make Allergan strong financially, we're also taking bold actions in these turbulent times when the price of healthcare is in the spotlight. A good example is our social contract with patients. We are leading the way with responsible pricing ideals for our branded therapeutic products, and we are leading the conversation to codify what our social contract means to us. It means balancing investment and innovation with pricing and access as well as quality and education. The social contract is Allergan's commitment to the people who count on us to find new treatments for their most pressing medical needs. And it is good for Allergan. So why are we able to be so bold and adapt a social -- adopt to social contract? Because it is the right thing to do and because we have such strong confidence that our business and our R&D pipeline will sustain our future growth. 
Turning to Slide 6. The 2 major actions we announced today demonstrate our deep-seated conviction in the future revenue growth as well as strong cash flows from our business. Over the last quarter, we have spent a lot of time looking at various opportunities to deploy our reloaded balance sheet to increase shareholder return, and our Board of Directors has acted. The actions we are taking today illustrate that we are focused on increasing shareholder return. First, we are beefing up our share repurchase program to a total of $15 billion. Second, we are initiating a $0.70 per share quarterly dividend for the very first time. 
Let me start with the enhanced share repurchase program. Since the Teva close, we've been aggressively buying our stock in the open market and have already repurchased $5 billion of our own stock. While we believe that our stock should be trading significantly higher than it is today, the current market conditions create an opportunity to repurchase significantly more stock. There is no more accretive asset on our radar than our own stock. So our Board of Directors has authorized an additional $5 billion repurchase. This brings our total share repurchase authorization to $15 billion. Now we are moving quickly to purchase the remaining $10 billion through an accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR, which allows us for significant upfront share count reduction. 
Next, the dividend. For the first time, our board has approved a cash dividend to return cash flow to shareholders on an ongoing basis. The initiation of a dividend is consistent with our Growth Pharma profile, the free cash flow that our business generates and our desire to increase shareholder return. This dividend will be funded from our ongoing cash flow without dipping into the proceeds from our Teva transaction. And we expect it to grow annually while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings. And we retain the vast majority of our firepower and flexibility to continue to invest in our business, acquire additional steppingstone assets and provide fuel for sustainable top line growth. Our capital allocation actions are intended to balance shareholder return with the investment for future growth. 
Turning to our operating performance on Slide 7 and our report card on how we did this quarter. Obviously, we are disappointed that our results this quarter did not meet our expectations, and therefore, we are revising our 2016 full year guidance. However, we believe that we are incredibly well positioned for 2017 and beyond. So let's look at the health of our company. In my view, there are 5 key measures to gauge the health and growth prospects of any biopharmaceutical company. First, how are the promoted products doing; second, how are the new product launches going; third, how are the established products faring near the end of their patent lives or when they are no longer being promoted; fourth, how is the pipeline progressing; and finally, how is the company performing against key profitability metrics. 
Allergan continues to generate sales growth that is at the top end of our peer group. Sales were $3.6 billion, up more than 7%, excluding NAMENDA IR, divestitures, FX and other adjustments. Our key promoted products are growing nicely, most of them double digit. Our new product launches are performing exceptionally well. I'm absolutely thrilled with how we are doing with our key brands and future growth drivers. Our pipeline is on a roll, and our profitability metrics are in the top tier of our peer group. Where we missed the mark was among a few of our established brands and non-promoted products. All in all, the report card for growth looks good this quarter, setting us up for growth in 2017 and beyond. 
Even with the weakness in our established and non-promoted products, we retain a top-tier profitability profile with a gross margin of 87.8% and an operating margin of 49.3%. These metrics were a little lighter this quarter, partly due to investments we are making in manufacturing to support continued strong growth of BOTOX and our Eye Care products and continued promotional investment behind our brands and increased R&D investment versus last year. Our non-GAAP EPS was $3.32. I'm confident that our team has made the right investments in our business and has laid a strong foundation for top-tier growth and profitability.
You can see on Slide 8 that the majority of our top global products are growing and along with the new launches, they represent 73% of our total revenue, many of them are growing double-digit rates, including BOTOX, up 15%; RESTASIS, up 13%; LINZESS, up 42%; our Filler line, up 21%; LO LOESTRIN, up 16%; OZURDEX, up 25%. I'm also proud to see new product launches contributing more than $90 million this quarter. This is a top-tier growth story. 
On the established and non-promoted products, we had more erosion than expected on NAMENDA XR and our mesalamine-containing products, which are facing in-class competition from generic drugs and have had some formulary disruption. Our future is not driven by these established products. Our future is built on our growth products, which is why I am so confident in it. 
Overall, our business is very healthy, and it's a very good picture to have so many products growing so strongly. Before handing off to Bill, I'd like to mention the progress we're making in R&D to build and deliver our pipeline. The team is doing an exceptional job. Our R&D productivity is strong. Already this year, we've had 19 major pharma and device product approvals and 11 major submissions. We've also reached some key milestones such as the approval of our multidose RESTASIS and a positive relamorelin Phase IIb results that were announced just last week. Relamorelin was one of our early Open Science deals. We used an option agreement to gain access to this promising treatment for gastroparesis. Now that relamorelin has demonstrated broad efficacy and tolerability in a Phase IIb trial, we have exercised our option to acquire Motus and plan to take relamorelin into Phase III trials within Allergan. 
We have also completed 6 new steppingstone deals this quarter, which are helping to build even greater pipeline depth and breadth in our therapeutic areas. In addition to pipeline-building acquisitions, we are also very interested in accretive acquisitions. While we continue to look for these accretive acquisitions, the most accretive acquisition for us today is in our own stock. 
Now let me turn the call over to Bill Meury, our Chief Commercial Officer."
36478,404686862,1071462,"Allergan plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thanks, Brent. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 11. Our core business was strong in the third quarter. Sales in all 7 therapeutic areas increased versus prior year. 5 of the 7 therapeutic areas grew at a high single- or double-digit rate. And as B",1648,"Thanks, Brent. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 11. Our core business was strong in the third quarter. Sales in all 7 therapeutic areas increased versus prior year. 5 of the 7 therapeutic areas grew at a high single- or double-digit rate. And as Brent mentioned, the majority of our revenues made up of top products and new launches that all together are growing at double-digit rate. This is a high-quality business and the foundation for 2017. Eye Care sales increased by 10% powered by RESTASIS, which showed durability in the third quarter with a sales increase of 13% versus prior year; and OZURDEX, which was up 19% in the United States and 29% internationally. And we look forward to the launch of 2 new dry eye products over the next 6 months. 
In CNS, sales increased by 3%. BOTOX therapeutic sales increased 16% globally versus the prior year, coupled with continued strong performance by VRAYLAR. Offsetting the growth in these products was a reduction in NAMENDA XR sales, driven by lower demand and a higher discount rate to maintain broad formulary coverage. We're seeing an early and strong market response to the new indication for NAMZARIC. 
In aesthetics, sales increased by 14%, driven by BOTOX and Fillers. Demand for KYBELLA is projected to increase significantly in the next 2 quarters as our DTC campaign reaches more and more consumers. Overall, demand for our aesthetic product line in the United States and internationally among dermatologists and plastic surgeons and across age demographics is very strong, and we're as optimistic about this part of the business as we've ever been.
In GI, sales increased by 9%. LINZESS, our flagship and fastest-growing product continues to produce strong results, up 42% year-over-year. And VIBERZI demand has been exceptional. Mesalamine's revenue declined overall due to lower promotion, loss of formulary coverage and the loss of exclusivity for ASACOL HD. And finally, we continue to see strong growth in our Women's Health franchise with sales up 15% as well as nice performance from urology. 
Let's dig into some of our products. On Slide 12, you see our flagship IBS products LINZESS and VIBERZI. Demand for both products is very strong across-the-board and regardless of metric. Both products are attracting new users each week. Both products are being used in a broad range of patients. Both products are taking from -- share from the OTC market. Both have excellent formulary coverage, and both are being supported by significant promotional programs. The outlook for LINZESS and VIBERZI is excellent. Sales for LINZESS are up 42% versus prior year, and approximately 73% of new business for LINZESS is coming from the OTC market, which is exactly what we want. And we're preparing to launch the LINZESS 72-microgram product, which is designed to accelerate conversion of the OTC market. 
Based on sales, VIBERZI is trending at approximately 90% of LINZESS during the same time period post launch. Demand for this product is robust, and with IMS prescription levels having reached an all-time high last week, we are very optimistic about the future.
Turning to Slide 13. Our Medical Aesthetics business accounts for approximately 20% of total sales and includes 3 key products: BOTOX, Fillers and KYBELLA. This is a high-quality, double digit growth, cash business in an expanding market, both domestically and internationally. The fundamentals here are the following: Allergan has product line depth, which no other company can match and which creates cross-selling opportunities; in other words, one product builds on the next. BOTOX is a gateway for the Fillers, and KYBELLA is a gateway to BOTOX. Allergan has a steady stream of new innovative product launches on the way. We invest more in education and training than any other company in the space, and we have market share leadership in a category that could double in size the next 5-plus years. There are 4 major trends driving aesthetics market expansion. First, more physicians are moving into aesthetics worldwide. Next, we are training more injectors. Third, there is a youth movement. Attitudes towards aesthetic procedures are changing across the world. That is especially true in the 20- to 30-year-old age segment. And finally, there is a male movement. With the launch of KYBELLA, we're seeing more interest by men in aesthetic procedures, and we expect this trend to accelerate over time.
Now I often get asked about the durability of BOTOX and future sales growth, which is an important topic. What you can see on Slide 14 is this. As successful as we've been with BOTOX, as popular and widely used as BOTOX is, we've only scratched the surface of our 3 primary growth indications: aesthetics, migraine and overactive bladder. Utilization by the eligible patient population in each area is still low, ranging from 3% to 7%. If these numbers were in the 15% to 20% range, one might anticipate growth moderation, but they're not. We believe we will stay in high growth rates for BOTOX for at least several more years, and that is why we continue to invest in sales and marketing, manufacturing and research and development and why we are confident in the future. 
Turning to Slide 15. With VRAYLAR, we're about 33 weeks into the launch and prescription levels are increasing week-over-week and faster than the market. The product is clearly distinguished by its pharmacology, symptom relief and metabolic profile for both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. VRAYLAR's trajectory is strong, and the future of VRAYLAR is promising. With NAMZARIC, we're relaunching on all fronts. With the sales force engaged and a DTC campaign ready to go in less than 2 weeks, we are already seeing a significant increase in sales in both the retail and long-term care settings. This is the first time we have an option for transitioning patients from monotherapy Aricept to NAMZARIC, and we're capitalizing on that opportunity with a starter kit that early on is getting a great deal of traction. So the differences here as compared to several months ago are: the indication for NAMZARIC is complete, the availability of starter kits is plentiful and formulary coverage is widespread. I think this franchise demonstrates the nimbleness and power of our commercial capabilities as we move from one  innovation to the next. 
Turning to Slide 16. No company has more to offer in the Eye Care space than Allergan. Overall, the dry eye market has expanded significantly since the launch of a second treatment option. At the same time, volume and sales for RESTASIS have been durable. Sales for RESTASIS were up 13% versus prior year. This growth was supported by strong unit demand in both ophthalmology and optometry. The growth in the overall market is being fueled primarily by new patients who are on OTC tier products or receiving no treatment at all. New investments in innovations for dry eye will continue to drive the market and our business. We recently received FDA approval for RESTASIS MULTIDOSE, which we'll launch in the fourth quarter and then True Tear, which is a nasal neurostimulator that we are planning for a staged launch beginning in 2017. True Tear is a non-drop treatment for dry eye. I just returned from the AAO meeting, and this is getting a great deal of interest from the eye care community.
Turning to Slide 17 and our international business. Sales in our international business totaled nearly $700 million in the third quarter. Every single region grew in the high single- or double-digit rate. Western Europe is our largest region, and we expect Asia Pacific will be our leading international growth contributor, with China the fastest-growing aesthetics market in the world. NESEE, North East and South East Europe, is our fastest-growing region, up 26% this quarter, excluding FX. Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care anchor our business internationally. Sales for BOTOX Cosmetic and our Filler line were up 18% and 25%, excluding FX, respectively. We've launched BELKYRA, KYBELLA in the United States, in Europe and plan to have it in 10 countries by the end of the year. In terms of Eye Care, glaucoma is our largest product line and retina is the fastest growing.  In glaucoma, we're launching a multi-dose preservative-free formulation of GANFORT, and we have our XEN Gel stent, which is a minimally invasive procedure to lower IOP. XEN launched in 10 international markets already this year, and we look forward to its potential approval and launch in 2017 in the United States.
In retina, OZURDEX has a very strong following in Western Europe, and in 2017, we will expand geographically with launches in Brazil and Australia. GI product launches are also underway in our international markets with CONSTELLA, LINZESS in the United States, launched in key countries and TRUBERZI, VIBERZI in the United States, planned for 2017. Beyond the results of the quarter, we're excited about the upcoming new product launches. In Eye Care, we're focused on the launch of RESTASIS MULTIDOSE, XEN and True Tear; and in Medical Dermatology, Oxymetazoline, now called RHOFADE. In the GI space, we're launching a lower dose of LINZESS or LINZESS 72-microgram as I mentioned. In cardiology, we've recently launched BYVALSON, which is a combination of Bystolic and Valsartan. In infectious disease, we will see AVYCAZ return to full supply before year-end and with full indications for UTI and intra-abdominal infections. We expect formulary coverage to continue to be strong in 2017. We will continue to invest and leverage our platform of capabilities, which include physician and consumer e-commerce programs, DTC and a well-trained and customized sales force. Allergan has share of voice leadership in nearly every market. It's #2 in the industry in direct-to-consumer spending and has one of the most productive sales forces in the industry. And that is why I believe the fundamentals of our business are healthy and our growth outlook is excellent. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to David."

Before I discuss our R&D productivity, a few remarks on our Open Science model. Open Science is an R&D philosophy focused on 2 key elements. The first, building the pipeline defines our approach to identifying, acquiring and developing the best game-changing ideas and innovation. We are agnostic where innovation comes from; academic research centers, venture-backed start-up companies, R&D based public companies or our own research centers. This maximizes our ability to deliver true innovation to the healthcare system and, most importantly, to the patients who need breakthrough medicine to treat their unmet needs. The second and very important element of Open Science is our ability and success in delivering the pipeline. Once we complete an acquisition or in-license a product, our teams advance development, prepare for regulatory approval and drive life-cycle innovation for innovative products that help patients. We do this whilst remaining a true partner with our external collaborators. As Brent mentioned, we have achieved 19 total major pharma and device global approvals and 11 major regulatory submissions so far this year. These outstanding results have been delivered by a team of more than 2,000 dedicated scientists, R&D professionals who are delivering important new treatments for patients. This team will be the fuel that delivers more products from our pipeline of 70 mid- to late stage programs. 
Turning to Slide 21. We are adding differentiated compounds and programs across our key therapeutic areas. We've added 6 steppingstone acquisitions since the second quarter. These are: Channel Reduction 2, a novel and innovative gene therapy for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa, a leading cause of blindness. Second, the periocular ring, designed for extended drug delivery to the eye. The first product reduces elevated intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients. Third, RORgammat inhibitors and LXR-beta agonists, highly differentiated compounds for the treatment of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Fourth and fifth, Cenicriviroc or CVC, Evogliptin and our FXR agonist. These establish a portfolio of differentiated NASH compounds that could provide combination therapy for this multifactorial disease. Finally, a monoclonal antibody selectively targeting IL-23 for the treatment of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and potentially other autoimmune disorders. 
Turning to Slide 22. We have made significant progress in advancing major programs. In Eye Care, last week, we announced FDA approval for RESTASIS MULTIDOSE, a preservative free, multidose bottle of RESTASIS. Bill has already discussed the launch of this new product for patients suffering from dry eye disease. In CNS, and as we previously promised, we have now initiated our Phase III program for ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine, and we have initiated a Phase IIb program for atogepant in migraine prophylaxis. 
As we have also previously promised, we have started the Phase III study for rapastinel in major depressive disorder. We expect to have top line results for the short-term studies in early 2019. But remember, we need to complete the maintenance study before we can file. As a reminder, we're also developing [indiscernible] and an earlier small molecule compound as next-generation oral NMDA receptor modulator for the treatment of MDD. 
Internationally, we received a positive opinion from the EU for TRUBERZI in GI disorders, and we expect to launch our product in international markets in 2017. In urology, the FDA's Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Drugs Advisory Committee voted recently in favor of approval for SER120 for the treatment of nocturia. We look forward to working with the agency on the approval of this product. 
Looking ahead, we have a number of near-term pipeline deliverables. In CNS, many of you have asked me about our plans regarding Cariprazine and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. After discussions with the FDA, we plan to file an sNDA for Cariprazine for this disorder in the first half of 2017. We also expect to announce Phase II top line results for BOTOX in depression in the second half of next year. 
Regarding Semprana, our inhalable dihydroergotamine treatment for acute migraine, we have resolved the issues raised by the FDA during their previous review and continue to work on scale up and manufacturability, which may result in submission in the second half of 2017. 
Turning to Medical Dermatology. We will shortly initiate later Phase II studies with our lead RORgammat inhibitor in psoriasis. Also we will complete Phase III trials for Sarecycline a potential treatment for acne, in early 2017. We recently received data from an early development study with our LXR-beta agonist. In this study target engagement was not satisfactorily achieved. So we need to reevaluate the concentration used and formulation utilized.
Now, GI. First, some breaking news for CVC, Cenicriviroc. We plan to initiate Phase III trials mid-next year. At the recent end of Phase II meeting, the FDA agreed that the compound is Phase III ready and that the primary endpoint should be reduction in fibrosis by one stage without worsening of steatohepatitis. Remember, this is the endpoint that was achieved at year 1 in the ongoing CVC CENTAUR study. The 1-year data will be presented as an oral late-breaker at the forthcoming liver meeting in Boston. The CENTAUR study meanwhile continues with 2-year data available mid-next year. 
We also expect to have Phase IIa data for Brazikumab, an oral IL-23 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of Crohn's disease in the first half of 2017. In Women's Health, we will have the second Phase III results for Esmya in uterine fibroids early next year with filing plans later in the year. 
Turning to Eye Care. Bill has already discussed True Tear and XEN. As you know, we have an option agreement with Mimetogen for Tavilermide in dry eye disease. The first 2 Phase III trials have been completed and the Mimetogen team are presently evaluating the data. 
Turning to Slide 23. We recently announced our decision to exercise our option for relamorelin. Data obtained from both the Phase IIa and Phase IIb trials are shown on this slide. I'm showing here the efficacy of relamorelin in comparison to placebo on a 4-point composite endpoint of nausea, postprandial fullness or early satiety, abdominal pain and bloating. In both studies, relamorelin was significantly more effective than placebo. In the Phase IIa study on the left, I am showing the results in a subgroup of patients with a high incidence of vomiting at a dose of 10 micrograms of relamorelin. In this subgroup, vomiting was also significantly decreased following relamorelin administration. For the Phase IIb trial, I am showing the average of efficacy of 3 doses of relamorelin, 10, 30 and 100 micrograms in comparison to placebo in all patients. In these patients, there was a substantial reduction in vomiting in relamorelin-treated patients in this trial. There was also substantial placebo reduction in vomiting. This placebo effect was surprising to investigators, KOLs and our internal team. We are working to understand this placebo effect, which, as you all know, can occur in clinical studies. 
Recent draft FDA guidance on diabetic gastroparesis drug development specifies that the use of an endpoint that measures each of the core symptoms and signs of the disease separately or as a composite with a responded affinition is recommended for the development of novel agents. So we believe that the data shown on this slide will be suitable for progression of the compound into Phase III. We are very excited about the prospect of bringing a new treatment to millions of patients who are suffering from this condition. No new drug has been approved since 1983. 
As I have outlined, we continue to make great progress with our Open Science model, with tremendous results just in the third quarter. We have many more milestones ahead to deliver for the remainder of the year and into 2017. Our ability to identify and acquire the best science, matched with our strong results and advancing innovation validates Open Science. As always, we thank our global R&D team for their outstanding work and dedication in driving innovation, delivering results and for their commitment to the work ahead for the patients we serve. 
I will now turn the call over to Tessa."
36478,404686862,1071462,"Allergan plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Allergan plc","Executives","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Please note that the discussion of continuing operations financial results excludes both Global Generics and Anda, following the completion of our Global Generics divestiture in Q3 and the sale of Anda in Q4. Tu",1627,"Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Please note that the discussion of continuing operations financial results excludes both Global Generics and Anda, following the completion of our Global Generics divestiture in Q3 and the sale of Anda in Q4. 
Turning to Slide 25. Before I begin reviewing the results for the quarter, I wanted to first expand on some of Brent's earlier remarks on our capital allocation decisions announced this morning. Following the receipt of the Teva proceeds, we immediately took steps to strengthen our balance sheet through debt pay down. We started repurchasing our shares in late August, and we completed $5 billion in share repurchases in October ahead of schedule. We purchased a total of 21 million shares at an average price of approximately $238 per share. We also continued to focus on evaluating options to further increase shareholder value. We therefore expanded our share repurchases by $5 billion to $15 billion in total and announced the initiation of a dividend to begin in 2017. 
First, I want to expand on the share repurchase. We concluded that there is no better investment than in our own stock. As we announced this morning, we will be executing the remaining $10 billion, utilizing an accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR. As you may all know, an ASR program allows us to reduce a significant portion of shares upfront. Since the last conference call, we continued to evaluate various methods to repurchase shares. In conjunction with our advisers, we have since developed an ASR structure that meets Irish legal requirements. Approximately 8 billion worth of shares will be retired during the month of November 2016. The remaining shares, if any, under the program would be received and retired by the third quarter of 2017 upon completion of the ASR. Completion of the ASR could occur sooner, subject to market conditions. Up to 50% of the ASR program will be hedged based upon the stock price over a reference period through a collar transaction. 
Second, we initiated a dividend starting in Q1 2017. Our company has transformed over the last 18 months to a pure branded Growth Pharma company with a strong pipeline and strong growth prospects. Given our conviction in the future of our current business and our ability to generate strong cash flow, we decided to initiate the dividend. The dividend will be funded by our ongoing cash flow while allowing for further investment in growth. We are committed to growing this dividend annually for shareholders. 
Turning to Slide 26. We remain committed to our investment-grade ratings. We expect to continue to strengthen our balance sheet through debt repayment. We've already repaid close to $10 billion in debt this year, and we have an additional $6.5 billion in contractual maturities, which we intend to pay over the next 18 months. In addition, we ended the quarter with $27.4 billion in cash and marketable securities.
Turning to our overall results for the third quarter of 2016 on Slide 27. In Q3, we delivered strong year-over-year performance. Continuing operations net revenues, which now exclude Anda Distribution, were $3.62 billion, a 4.5% increase versus prior year, primarily impacted by ASACOL HD loss of exclusivity, divestitures and lower-than-expected NAMENDA IR and XR. Excluding NAMENDA IR, divestitures and FX and an out-of-period adjustment related to discontinued operations, which impacted the third quarter of last year by $31.7 million, net revenues increased 7.4%. Gross margins for the third quarter remained strong at almost 88%. The decline versus prior year was driven primarily by higher production costs related to capacity expansion and manufacturing variances. These were costs that are accounted for within corporate and did not impact any of the segment margins, which remained very strong. Operating margins declined versus last year to 49.3%, impacted by higher sales and marketing investments to continue to support ongoing launches such as VRAYLAR, VIBERZI and KYBELLA and other marketing spend for key products as well as higher investments in R&D as a result of more projects versus the prior year. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.32 primarily reflect the loss of exclusivity of NAMENDA IR and ASACOL HD and lower sales of NAMENDA XR, higher SG&A and R&D spend compared with the third quarter of 2015. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 8.2% in the quarter. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was negative this quarter at approximately $1 billion, primarily as a result of cash tax payments of approximately $2.6 billion related to the gain from the sale of our generics business to Teva. Excluding this and the impact of R&D asset acquisitions and restructuring payments, cash flow from operations remained very strong at positive $1.72 billion. The GAAP equivalents to our financial metrics can be found in our earnings release issued this morning and posted on our website. 
Turning now to our U.S. Specialized Therapeutics results on Slide 28. The business continued to deliver strong performance year-over-year. U.S. Specialized Therapeutics revenue was $1.45 billion for the quarter, up 12.1% versus the prior year period, driven by strong growth across Medical Aesthetics of 14%, Eye Care of 13% and the strong growth in BOTOX therapeutic of 17%. Key products performed well with BOTOX, RESTASIS, Fillers and the launch of KYBELLA as key contributors to the strong performance. Sequential 2% revenue decline was driven by the typical seasonality of Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care in the summer. Gross margin continued to expand at 95.2%. 
SG&A increased versus prior year as a result of an increase in promotion efforts, including aesthetics sales force expansion and KYBELLA DTC. 
Turning to Slide 29. Our U.S. General Medicine business third quarter revenues were $1.49 billion, 4% lower than last year, primarily attributed to ASACOL HD generic entry, lower NAMENDA IR and XR revenues and lower established brands due to the CERVIDIL divestiture and ENABLEX generic entry. Adjusting for this impact, trends in our key products, including LINZESS and LO LOESTRIN continued to grow at strong double-digit rates. Third quarter gross margins continued to be stable at 85%. Sequentially, SG&A increased versus the prior year, primarily related to higher sales and marketing to support launches of VIBERZI and VRAYLAR. The decline in SG&A versus prior quarter is due primarily to timing of promotional spending. 
Turning to Slide 30 and our international results. Third quarter revenues were $698 million versus $661 million in the prior year period. Excluding foreign exchange and an out-of-period adjustment of $31.7 million, international revenues in the third quarter grew 12% versus prior year, driven by continued strong growth of BOTOX Therapeutics, BOTOX Cosmetics, Fillers and OZURDEX. Sequential revenue decline was driven by seasonality of Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care, primarily in Europe. Gross margins were 86.4% in the third quarter. Segment SG&A was $216 million, up 14.3% versus prior year, driven by continued support of Medical Aesthetics and new product launches, including BELKYRA, or KYBELLA in the U.S., XEN, Earfold, and CONSTELLA. Contribution margins improved versus prior quarter from 53.4% to 55.4%, reflected continued strong sales growth. 
Turning to Slide 31. Let me make a few comments on our 2016 full year revised guidance. We are revising our guidance for full year 2016. While we are clearly disappointed that we have to revise our guidance, the level of transformation our company has seen over the last 18 months has been unprecedented. We've carved out 2 major businesses, a very complex process. We have now completed that process this quarter with the close of Anda. We are looking forward to focusing on the future as a pure branded Growth Pharma company. We now expect full year 2016 branded revenues to be between $14,450,000,000 to $14,650,000,000, at or modestly below the low end of our previous range.  Reflecting the impact to sales that we saw in the third quarter and the assumption that those trends on our non-promoted established products carry into the fourth quarter, we expect continued strong performance of our top promoted products and new launches. 
Our gross margins, which were slightly lower sequentially, are now expected to finish the year between 87% to 88%, consistent with our historical performance. Our non-GAAP SG&A of approximately $4 billion and our non-GAAP R&D spend of approximately $1.5 billion remain unchanged. Net interest expense and other is in the range of $1.25 billion. Our tax rate for the full year is anticipated to be between 8% and 9%. Our tax rate should begin to trend upward toward normalized levels in early 2017. Our revised average share count for 2016 of 408 million shares includes the impact of the completed 5 billion in share repurchases as well as the impact of the 10 billion ASR we just announced. Year-end 2016 diluted share count is forecasted to be approximately 365 million, reflecting more fully the impact of the share repurchases. As mentioned earlier, there could be further adjustments in share count depending on Allergan stock price during the settlement period. Approximately 8 billion worth of shares will be retired during the month of November 2016 and the remaining shares, if any, under the program will be received and retired by the third quarter of 2017 upon completion of the ASR. As a result, we expect full year non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $13.30 and $13.50. For the fourth quarter, we expect a forecast average share count of 383 million shares for the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 32. We have strong long-duration assets and a sound strategy. We have leading top line growth and margins, driven by new innovative products and excellent manufacturing capabilities. We have strong conviction in the earnings potential and cash generation of our company, and we remain focused on long-term shareholder value creation. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brent for closing remarks."

I don't want to take too long, but I guess, first of all, Brent and Tessa, maybe you could just frame how you plan to balance your optimism about the business and your motivation to drive the sales force while also ensuring that consensus expectations can be achievable going forward? That's my first question. And tying into that, how you guide next year in the face of NAMENDA XR early generic risk? And then the second question is on VRAYLAR in negative symptoms. You've mentioned a first half '17 data submission. I'm assuming that incremental data could show up in the body of the label in early '18, but when do you expect to be able to file for a formal indication for negative symptoms to be on the top of the label?"

So let me see if I can take those, David. Thank you for a full list of questions. I think with respect to motivating the sales force and balancing the need to meet or beat expectations or consensus, it's something obviously we take very seriously at. I'm not sure the 2 are entirely connected. Our sales force around the world is, frankly, one of the prides of Allergan. We take great amount of our time and effort to make sure that our front-line salespeople have all the tools and training and skills necessary to do the therapeutic line calls and promote our products in a compliant and risk and balanced way to build customer intimacy and relationships. And I think across a number of different dynamics, our sales force is the most productive, hardest-working sales force in the industry. I think that -- and we've been expanding it. So in Eye Care, we've expanded it. In key markets like Brazil and China, we've been expanding it. I'd also say that we have had a relatively strong stability in our sales force despite the transformation of Allergan. Our sales reps and our sales leadership is entirely, almost entirely intact from the early days of the company's transformation. So it is a very important group of individuals and colleagues for us, and it's a highly motivated, highly productive function in the company. I think the question with respect to consensus is something that Tessa and I and our entire management team take very seriously. But at the end of the day, we run the business to make the right decisions to propel growth and high profitability in the future. And so things that we did this quarter, like bringing on a second BOTOX manufacturing plant in Ireland, expanding our capacity in Waco to make many of our eye care products, investing behind our launches, pulling forward some DTC -- or not DTC, but promotional spend behind NAMZARIC, are all the types of things that I think we need to do to continue to drive the growth and do the right thing for the business, in fairness, irrespective of consensus. And so that's kind of how -- I don't know if, Tessa, do you want to add anything?"

I've done that in the past, and that has not worked out well for me, so I'm going to step away from that. I think the better thing that we can focus on is what we can control on a day-to-day basis, which is our promotion of the better product for patients, which is NAMZARIC. Reducing the pill burden from 3 pills twice a day to 1 pill once a day is something that we know that caregivers and these patients suffering from Alzheimer's really do benefit from. And look, the early data on NAMZARIC, that Bill put up on the slide, is encouraging, so we should keep in mind, it's early. And our entire sales force and our entire promotional effort is focused on driving the better therapy in NAMZARIC, but we have work to do. Bill, anything you'd add on that?"

But we did have a lot going on this year with the transformation of the company, almost a complete transformation of the company. And perhaps we didn't anticipate some of these older product erosions that happened. And to be fair, I think this is true across the industry. I think competing in categories where there is strong generic alternatives is becoming increasingly more difficult.

I think looking at earnings for the companies that have reported before us, many of them have seen less-than-stellar growth in their key promoter products, but they've achieved their results by price increases in their established products. I'm not sure that is sustainable. And so while some may criticize our social contract and our pricing discipline, we would have not taken those price increases irregardless of the contract because it's not the right thing to do, and I think it does create additional risk or inappropriate risk for the company.

I don't mean to beat the dead horse but it's obviously very important and it explains why the share price is where it is. Allergan is a new company. It's a new collection of assets. You've been through tremendous transition over the last many years, not just the divestitures. And so investors listen to what you say and take what you say at face value. And for the last 12 months, I would characterize your guidance as having dripped, dripped, dripped. I mean, from double-digit top line to the $25 aspirational number that was pushed out to gross margin guidance to revenue guidance. And so my question is, obviously, guidance is really important. Market takes it very seriously. We're just trying to understand your company. What are you doing for your own internal control so that you have better visibility to communicate with investors? This quarter a lot of the shortfalls came from older products that I would have thought you would have foreseen. So I'm just wondering what you're doing about that going forward? And most importantly, will this be the last -- I mean, I don't think you can -- I don't know how definitive you can be, but to help us understand, will this be the last of the rebasing? And then my second question is, if you could help us to understand how to think about the pushes and pulls in 2017? Obviously, the buyback should be a positive to your bottom line, but at the same time, investors are questioning your level of R&D spend to sustain top line growth, SG&A, which is coming in above but obviously important to sustain new product launches.

We'll do that in the normal course in early next year, in just a few months. But that being",514,"Yes. So thanks, Jamie. That was a lot. I'm trying to think of where to start. Look, I think I have to just mention, we're not going to provide 2017 guidance today. We'll do that in the normal course in early next year, in just a few months. But that being said, look, I -- we have a business that I think has some very important characteristics that even despite the miss today on some of the older products are the thing I hope investors focus on. We have top-tier growth. We have a portfolio that's diverse with many growth drivers, not one big growth driver but many growth drivers. You can look at products like BOTOX, up 15%; RESTASIS, up 13%; LINZESS, up 42%. Even drugs like LoLoestrin, up 16%; OZURDEX, up 25%. And I think -- see the pattern of that, the previous quarter, the previous quarter and the previous quarter and get a feel for the growth trajectory of this business. You can look at the new launches, which I said, contributed about $90 million in the quarter. VIBERZI, VRAYLAR, KYBELLA, all off to either at our expectations or exceeding expectations start. You heard David talking about filing for negative symptoms on VRAYLAR, could be, if approved by the FDA, a certainly multiple change or in terms of the sales multiples for that drug. But then I think most importantly, the question I take the most exception to is this idea that the percentage of R&D spend is too weak to propel innovation. I mean, I think that's ridiculous. I think, just to be straightforward, it's the quality of the spend against the programs and the productivity that you have. And I think when you look at our 70 late-stage programs and you think about some of the big ones that are coming over the next year or 2, whether it be Abicipar, rapastinel, ubrogepant, Esmya, relamorelin, just to name a few. Let alone drugs like RHOFADE and others or SER120 that were kind of forgotten about in the context. We have ample new product flow, and we have several shots on goal that would -- could be blockbuster new drugs for unmet medical needs. So would you rather have that or have us spend $8 billion or $9 billion on R&D to have no productivity and late-stage failures and all the other things that come with it? I'm not saying we won't have failures. Of course, we'll have a few. But I think we spend our money more wisely, and hopefully, over time, we'll prove in a more efficient way to get meaningful innovation out to market. And just as an aside, R&D is up 29% year-to-date, so it's not that we're not increasing R&D. So hopefully, that answers some of your questions. We can continue to debate next time I see you, but we feel very good about our position. We feel very good about our growth profile, and I think we feel very confident that we will be continuing top-tier growth and top-tier profitability in 2017 and beyond."

Obviously, Shire, has been very aggressive or generous, or whatever you want to it, giving away product. Just give us a sense of what's going on out there, what you're seeing and what you're doing, we're seeing the IMS data obviously."

So I'll turn it over to Bill in a second, but I'm glad you raised international expansion. When we think of our leverage for growth, we tend to talk about new product launches, R&D, late-stage success, expanding markets like medical aesthetics. But clearly, another very important lever for Allergan that sometimes isn't discussed as much as international expansion. We saw that business up about 12% this quarter after FX and one other adjustment. And so that team around the world is performing at very high levels. And there are a few countries that I think we really believe we would have a high return on investment, and we have already started making many of those investments. Bill, you want to talk about those?"

I would say there's 3 regions of our international business that are getting a great deal of focus right now. That's Asia Pacific; Northeast, Southeast, Europe, essentially everything other than Western Europe; and Turkey, Middle East and Africa. The investments that we make right now relate to expansion of the field force, especially in Asia Pacific and mainly in China. We've dramatically increased the scale and scope and intensity of our injector training program, not just in Asia Pacific but in the other 2 regions as well. And internationally, there are opportunities to run consumer advertising campaigns namely on our fillers line, which is growing at 25% year-over-year. Not a major increase in sales force is required, but of the 3 things I mentioned that is the largest one. And the business is really very, very well resourced. The regional presidents and the country managers that run this business are very, very capable. And the trends just look very, very good. Our business hits up 12% versus prior year and is experiencing a price erosion of 1% to 2%. So it's a very, very strong product line. The same can be said for the Eye Care business as well where we're launching new products for glaucoma and I like how it looks. The second question was about..."

The first is, as you know, from the IMS data, and I think that this is a good development. The market for dry eye is up. If you look at new prescriptions, it's up over 20% -- excuse me, if you look at total prescriptions, it's up over 20%. If you look at new prescriptions, it's closer to 30%. Most of the expansion is coming from, as I mentioned earlier, patients who are on over-the-counter tear products or were receiving no treatment at all. The next observation is that the revenue stream for RESTASIS has been very durable. If you look at the 6-week period, for example, before the launch of [indiscernible] and the 6-week period after. And then the next final point I would make is we're focused right now on launching RESTASIS and DPF and True Tear at the end of 2016 and 2017. And I still believe that when the dust settles here, I'm sure that people at Shire feel the same way, this isn't going to be a fight to the death between the 2 companies and the 2 products, but this is going to be a larger market. There's a lot more attention being paid to ocular surface disease. And I think we're seeing it, a new -- a second treatment option appears to have created an expansion event in eye care, which is good. I believe that Allergan, because of our product line depth and capability, is going to maintain a majority share in a much larger market. And I think things look pretty good in that regard."
