On the call today, John will give a rundown of our recent results and update you on some of the delineation that we have underway in 2016. Joe will provide an operational overview. 
I'd like to give up the call with some overview remarks in our direction in 2016 and beyond. During 2015, we put a lot of energy into long-range planning, and we developed capabilities for running detailed iterations on current and future years CapEx, cash flow and balance sheet configuration. We scrubbed our assets and developed net asset value models that help us to fully understand our outside and plan accordingly. Today, we're making decisions for 2016 with a close eye on 2017, 2018 and beyond. Cimarex is better positioned for the future by slowing down a bit, preserving our cash and assets and living within our means. Our focus is on preservation of our assets and balance sheet. We don't have any special insight on when or how commodity prices will recover. We do know that we will probably be as surprised by the recovery as we were by the collapse. When prices recover, Cimarex will be ready and will be stronger and healthier as ever. We have never been more bullish on our assets, our inventory and our organizational capability. Our Delaware Basin and Meramec Woodford assets are top tier. We continue to be pleased with our well results and associated returns on investment. On the call today, you'll hear updates on our Wolfcamp spacing pilots and the implications for future development. We continue to be extremely pleased with our Wolfcamp well performance and have room to run in achieving further performance improvements. You will hear an update on the Meramec Woodford spacing pilots that is underway in Cana. We're testing a combined 19 wells per section in the Meramec and Woodford. The Meramec continues to surprise to the upside. We're currently flowing back Woodford spacing pilots that are testing 10 and 12 Woodford wells per section. Results are very encouraging. Furthermore, our improved Woodford results are showing remarkable consistency across the Cana core. In both the Delaware and Woolford Meramec, long horizontal wells are an increasingly important part of our story, and our assets are well configured to allow for them. We have a manageable lease exploration issue, and we will preserve all of our prime acreage. 
In spite of the downturn of activity, we're emphasizing our core strengths and idea generation and innovation. Our teams are hard at work developing new plays and new concepts. During the downturn of 2009, our activity level dropped from 43 operated rigs to 3. At that time, we challenged the organization to be innovative, creative and to find ways to make a living in spite of the downturn. We were not victims. During 2008, we developed plays that were going to carry us on ensuing years and are still among our core programs today. In 2016, our challenge to organization is to do it again. We are built for these times, however difficult they may be. We will make the tough decisions around capital investments and activity level. We will remain disciplined and preserve our assets and the deep inventory that is our future. We will also seek to build new things and to take advantage of this downturn. No one is hanging their head at Cimarex. We are hard at work to control our own destiny. 
I recently heard a CEO describe some advice that one of his board members have given them. The board member was a retired military officer who told the CEO that he had always told his troops that, ""When the map doesn't match the terrain, go with the terrain."" Here at Cimarex, we're going with the terrain. During 2015, we increased our rig count to a high of 12 rigs, with an original plan to keep 12 operated rigs throughout 2016. As the year wore and the commodity outlook continued to worsen, we determined that a 12-rig program was no longer prudent. Although we have the inventory to justify the higher activity level at current prices, we've decided to slow down and preserve our cash on hand. Production growth will have to take a backseat to flexibility and balance sheet preservation. Our focus is on a multiyear outlook. We currently have 11 operated rigs running and will be decreasing our rig count to 4 rigs in the coming months. Our 2016 program is designed to preserve our assets on leasehold and finish up delineation and spacing pilots are underway. We plan to invest between $600 million and $650 million in exploration and development. The range of investment is driven by timing of completions in one of the projects currently underway, the Woodford infill well in the eastern core of Cana. Whatever we do not spend in 2016 will be pushed into early 2017. We will also continue to delineate the Meramec drill spacing test in the Wolfcamp in the Delaware Basin and hold leasehold. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we were impacted by severe weather events and took direct hits at both the Western Delaware Basin and in our core Cana field. Furthermore, a planned outage in Delaware Basin added to our problems. I cannot overstate how pleased we were with the response to these events by our organization. Although they had a significant impact on our production volumes, our teams worked valiantly and safely in an extremely hostile conditions in order to restore our production and find creative workarounds to market interruptions. These extraordinary actions don't always evidence themselves in top line reported production numbers, but they humble us and make us deeply proud to be part of an organization that is so dedicated and focused. 
With that, I will turn the call over to John to provide further details on our program."

I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our 2016 plans.

I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our 2016 plans. Cimarex invested $191 million during the fourth quarter on exploration and development. This brought the total to $877 million for the full year. About 55% was invested in the Permian region with the rest going toward activities in the Mid-Continent region. Company-wide, we brought 65 gross, 28 net wells on production during the quarter, which brought the total for 2015 to 219 gross, 99 net wells. 
Cimarex continues to push the envelope on well completions. In the Permian, we completed 2 upper Wolfcamp wells in the fourth quarter using a larger stimulation. As you can see on Slide 14 of our presentation, these wells have seen a 34% higher cumulative production in the first 120 days versus the previous upper Wolfcamp wells. In fact, in one of the wells, [indiscernible] 38 unit #1-H had an average 30-day peak production rate of 2,020 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 51% was gas, 30 -- excuse me, 51% oil, 30% gas and 19% NGL. A record IP from a 7,500-foot Upper Wolfcamp lateral in Culberson County. 
As discussed previously, we started downspacing pilot in the upper Wolfcamp and Culberson County in the fourth quarter. Drilling on these wells will finish this month with completion scheduled to begin in April. First production is expected by the end of May. This fixed well, 7,500-foot lateral pilot will test 2 different spacing designs. One testing 8 wells per section, while the other will test 6 wells per section. Both will be drilled in a staggered pattern. The larger completion I just discussed will be used on this pilot. 
For the rest of 2016, the vast majority of the capital that we will spend in the Permian will be earmarked for acreage obligations across our Wolfcamp position in both Culberson and Reeves County. Part of this obligation drilling will include 6, 2-mile-long infield wells in Reeves County. These infill wells are located next to a our temper well, the best Wolfcamp well we drilled in rescanning. Similar to our Anaconda pilot, these wells will be drilled using a back staggered pattern, resulting in equivalent of 12 wells per section. We currently have 6 rigs running in the Permian, with one of them drilling a saltwater disposal well in Culberson County. By June, we will be down to 2 rigs for the remainder of the year. 
Now onto the Mid-Continent. You will recall that we began drilling on the Cana Woodford row 4 infill development program in the fourth quarter of 2014. Completion from the 7 sections are now finished and all 57 gross wells are producing. Cimarex operated 2 of these sections. Typical development in the Woodford calls for 8 new wells in addition to the parent well on a section. The [indiscernible] section was infield with 9 additional wells, while the Philip section was infilled with 11 new well. For the [indiscernible] section, the average 30-day peak production [indiscernible] was 9.1 million cubic feet equivalent per day, 61% gas, 8% oil, 31% NGL. And the Philips wells produce an average 30-day peak rate of 9.3 million cubic feet equivalent per day, 54% gas, 13% oil, 33% NGL. As you can see on Slide 20 of our presentation, these increased density infill sections are performing very similar to previously infill Woodford section with only 8 new wells. A very encouraging results for us. 
In the fourth quarter 2015, we commenced drilling another Woodford infill well in the East side of the core. This development covers 6 sections, of which Cimarex again operates 2 sections. The entire infill project consists of 50 gross, 23 net wells. Depending on the timing of completions, something that will be worked out with our partner, production from this Cana development is expected to come on line as early as October or perhaps as late as the first quarter of 2017. 
In our emerging Meramec play, we now have production data on 17 operated 5,000-foot laterals. In addition, our second 10,000-foot lateral in the Meramec has been on production since early October. This well, called the vessels 1H-3526x have a 30-day peak IP rate of 14 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 791 barrels of oil per day. Page 1 and 2 [ph] of the presentation illustrates the average uplift we've seen from the 2 long laterals versus the 5,000-foot laterals drilled to date. They have outperformed the shorter laterals by 69% within 120 days. While we are very encouraged by the initial uplift in IP that we're seeing in these 10,000-foot laterals, we will be carefully monitoring the decline profile in order to determine the ultimate EURs for these long lateral wells. 
To better understand the multizone potential for this area, we have designed a downspacing pilot with commenced drilling in the fourth quarter 2015. See Slide 23 for an illustration of this design. Due to the commodity price environment, this pilot has been downsized, and will now consist of 8 new wells to be stacked and staggered in both the Meramec and Woodford formations. The spacing of the Meramec will be the equivalent of 10 wells per section made up of 5 upper and 5 lower staggered Meramec wells. The Woodford will be drilled with our standard 9 wells per section development plan. Drilling should be finished by mid-April with first production expected late in the second quarter. Once Drilling is finished on the pilot and infill sections, we will be focused on holding our Meramec acreage. Since late 2014, we've added 12,250 net acres in the Meramec at an average cost of $1,650 per acre. We'll need to drill approximately 40 to 45 wells over the next 3 years in order to HPV our position. In 2016, we will drill 12 operated wells to hold this acreage position, with 10 of the 12 wells being 10,000-foot laterals. We currently have 5 rigs operating in the Mid-Continent region, with plans to go down to 1 rig by July of this year. 
with that, I'll turn the call over to the Joe Albi."

I'll touch on the usual items, our fourth quarter production, our Q1 and full year 2016 production outlook and then I'll finish with a few comments on LOE and service cost. Our f",1498,"Well, thank you, John, and thank you all for joining us on our call today. I'll touch on the usual items, our fourth quarter production, our Q1 and full year 2016 production outlook and then I'll finish with a few comments on LOE and service cost. 
Our fourth quarter total company net equivalent production came in at 985.7 million a day, up 4% from the 949.5 million a day that we posted in Q4 '14 and within our guidance of 0.98 to 1.01 Bcfe per day. Late in the quarter, as Tom mentioned, winter weather and facility disruptions negatively impacted our production by approximately 30 million cubic feet a day equivalent, with the majority of that occurring in the Permian. Late December winter storms caused significant downtime in not only the Delaware Basin, but also impacted our Cana production as well, albeit to a lesser degree. When we adjust for the estimated impact of the weather and the facility downtime, we would have exceeded the upper end of our guidance by more than 5 million a day. With Q4 now on the books, our full year 2015 equivalent production came in at 985 million a day. That's up 13% over 2014 average of 869 million a day. During Q4, our Permian equivalent production averaged 520 million a day. That's down 42 million a day from Q3 '15. But as I mentioned, a significant portion of the decrease was a result of not only the -- was a result of the weather and facility downtime, but we also completed fewer Permian wells during the latter half of the year than we did in the first half as we've talked about in our previous call. As expected, with our Cana row 4 wells coming online, we saw a very nice bump in our Q4 Mid-Continent production, with our Mid-Continent volumes coming in at 461 million a day. That's up 14% or 56 million a day from the 405 million a day that we reported just prior in Q3. For 2016, with a number of moving parts, the most sensitive of which is the timing of our 2016 completions, we've issued full year total company equivalent production guidance of 890 million to 930 million equivalents today. With our focus on preserving our assets and protecting our balance sheet and the low price environment we're in, we've opted to slow down and more consistently spread out or completion activity throughout the year. As John mentioned, we also find ourselves needing to coordinate the timing of our Cana Woodford completion activity with the completion timing of our offset operator. As a result, there is considerable variability in the inventory of uncompleted wells that we will have on the books at the end of the year. As we best can project at this time, we anticipate and we've modeled that our Cana infill frac-ing operations will begin in late the third -- late third to fourth quarter and continue into 2017 with first production from the project not hitting our books until early 2017. This program represents a lion's share of our 2016 Mid-Continent activity, consisting of 50 gross and 23 net wells. With our current modeling, we expect to see first production from approximately 50 gross or 16 net Mid-Continent wells during '16, and that's down from 134 gross or 39 net wells that we completed in 2015. With the anticipated Cana infill completion delay, we expect to next year the 57 gross or 24 net wells awaiting completion, hence, moving associated production from those wells into early 2017. 
In the Permian, we also planned for a slower place of completion activity, which will likely only require to utilize just 1 completion crew the majority of the year. We are forecasting approximately 31 net Permian wells to come online in 2016. That's down about half of the 60 net wells that we completed in 2015. As we progress through the year, we project the number of Permian drilled and uncompleted wells to increase to approximately 18 net wells by midyear and then drop off to just 6 net wells by the end of the year, primarily a result of dropping to the 2 [ph] rigs that John mentioned in the Permian in the middle of the year. 
I want to take a moment to make a special point that a quick glance at our 2016 full year guidance could very easily imply a decline in our 2016 exit rate. What's not so easy to see is the forecast of production increase associated with the delayed Cana infill programs back-to-back completion activity in early 2017, which, along with a handful of carryover permit completions, is forecasted to bring our total company production back up to Q4 '15 levels by as early as Q2 '17. It's all about the timing of our completions. 
As far as our Q1 total company production is concerned, incorporating anticipated Permian pipeline and facility curtailments of about 30 million a day for the first quarter, our projected guidance for Q1 comes in at 925 million to 955 million a day. 
Jumping over to CapEx. With our production groups continued focus on trimming operating costs, our Q4 lifting cost came in at $0.85 per Mcfe. That's in line with our guidance of $0.77 to $0.87 and was down 19% from the $1.05 that we posted in Q4 '14. For the year, our 2015 lifting cost came in at $0.83 per Mcfe. That's down a respectable 23% from our 2014 average of $1.08. As we look forward into 2016, our full year lifting cost guidance range of $0.80 and $0.90 per Mcfe takes into account our regional forecasts of production mix as well as a variable nature of work expenses. 
You may have also noted that our Q4 '15 transportation and processing expense came in at $0.58. So it's slightly above our guidance range of $0.45 to $0.55. As I mentioned, our current production modeling forecast a slowdown in our completion activity during the year, which resulted in a onetime accrual of approximately $8 million for anticipated minimum volume agreement shortfalls, which increased our reported cost on a nonrecurring basis by approximately $0.09 per Mcfe. 
We've made great strides cutting our LOE, and we'll continue our efforts to reduce them further. As we mentioned last call, important by-product of our LOE reductions is the additional funding we're providing our drilling program. Our Q4 '15 average monthly LOE came in at $25.7 million a month. And that's $5 million below our Q4 '14 average of $30.7 million a month. But if we average over 12-month time period, has freed up nearly $60 million of the direct to our drawing program. 
A few comments on our drilling and completion cost. Although we continue to push hard for further cost relief, any cost reductions we've seen have been small, single-digit reductions and modest in nature. That said, we continue our focus on operating efficiencies. On the drilling side, we hydrated the rigs, we're bidding out each and every service. We're consolidating our equipment and resources everywhere we can, all the while we're staying focused on reducing drilling days. On the completion side, we're focused on optimizing the cost of water sourcing by more efficient frac-ing our wells, in particular, when we're completing multi-well pads. The bottom line is that while we continue to experience -- experiment with various frac designs, our generic well [indiscernible] has remained relatively flat. Our current Cana core 1 mile lateral Woodford [indiscernible] continues to run in the range of 6.6 million to 7 million. That's unchanged from the last call. While at the Meramec, our current 1-mile lateral AFB is also -- is in the range of $7 million to $7.4 million. That's also unchanged from last quarter. In the Permian, as we've mentioned last call, we've made great progress with our drilling efficiencies, cutting our Wolfcamp 2-mile laterals rig release times down 20% from 35 days in 2014 to 28 days in 2015, with a record of 20.5 days. We're accomplishing similar drill time reductions at our 1-mile lateral Bone Spring and Avalon program as well, cutting average days from spud-to-rig release 35% from 23 days in '14 to just '15 in Q4 '15. We continue to get more done with fewer rigs. 
And with all that, our current 2-mile lateral Wolfcamp AFE is running $10.8 million to $11.6 million. That's flat again to the figures we quoted last call. 
So in closing, we had another great quarter. We fought a significant Q4 downstream weather -- downtime to stay within guidance and provide us with a strong springboard for production into 2016. We posted solid year-over-year production gains over 2014. We've made significant strides cutting our LOE, our drilling group stays focused in cost reductions and efficiencies. And as an organization, we remain vigilant to keep our cost and check, protect our assets and optimize our investment program results. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to question-and-answer."

But as you look ahead in running the company, we have to look at the ins and outs of cash flow balance. And so we look into what -- as said in my opening remarks, we spent a lot of time last year looking at our assets and looking at the future drilling inventory and the value that adds. And we've made a tremendous amount of progress in our flexibility and our ability to do real-time modeling of future increases in price, future increases in activity and actually modeling the impact that has fully looking at our cash flow and our balance sheet. But when you do that, one of the reasons that we're doing that is because if prices don't pick up at any point, we want to make sure that Cimarex stays healthy and stays competitive. And we don't want to put ourselves in a situation where we've lost our flexibly. So inherently, that modeling is kind of a downside model. It's really easy to run an upside model. But you have to kind of plan of the downside. And so we're -- as we look ahead to the next few years, I would say that if things don't materially improve over the current strip, Cimarex will be just fine. We'll be healthy financially and will be in a position where we attempt to throttle into that future without increasing debt. But if things increase, if commodity prices pick up, we are ready to roll. I know I'm not giving you -- I'm not giving you detailed answer on what our 2017 and beyond model looks like, but we're making decisions to keep Cimarex competitive and to preserve our assets.

And somebody with the questions alluded to the fact that these are big projects. You've got multiple wells all coming on at once. And you saw what go forward you did it for us from Q3 to Q4, significant increase in the Cana production, 405 in Mid-Continent, 405 million to 461 million a day. So those are big swings. You can see the difference between our Q4 -- if you apply Q4 exit rate of -- with a typical decline or whatever. We're going to be in the high 800s. And all of a sudden, 2 quarters later, we're 100 million a day higher than that. So it's just the nature of the beast, and it's all about timing."

There are some really good wells up there that are hard to explain if you only have the Meramec to explain it with.

On the call today, John will give a rundown of our recent results and update you on some of the delineation that we have underway in 2016. Joe will provide an operational overview. 
I would like to kick off the call with some overview remarks and our direction in 2016 and beyond. During 2015, we put a lot of energy into long-range planning and we developed capabilities for running detailed iterations on current and future years CapEx, cash flow and balance sheet configuration. We scrubbed our assets and developed net asset value models that help us to fully understand our upside and plan accordingly. 
Today, we are making decisions for 2016 with a close eye on 2017, 2018 and beyond. Cimarex is better positioned for the future by slowing down a bit, preserving our cash and assets and living within our means. Our focus is on preservation of our assets and balance sheet. We don't have any special insight on when or how commodity prices will recover. We do know that we will probably be as surprised by the recovery as we were by the collapse. When prices recover, Cimarex will be ready and will be stronger and healthier as ever. 
We have never been more bullish on our assets, our inventory and our organizational capability. Our Delaware Basin and Meramec/Woodford assets are top tier. We continue to be pleased with our well results and associated returns on investment. On the call today, you'll hear updates on our Wolfcamp spacing pilots and the implications for future development. 
We continue to be extremely pleased with our Wolfcamp well performance and have room to run in achieving further performance improvements. You will hear an update on the Meramec/Woodford spacing pilots that is underway in Cana. We're testing a combined 19 wells per section in the Meramec and Woodford. The Meramec continues to surprise to the upside. We are currently flowing back Woodford spacing pilots that are testing 10 and 12 Woodford wells per section. Results are very encouraging. 
Furthermore, our improved Woodford results are showing remarkable consistency across the Cana core. In both the Delaware and Woodford/Meramec, long horizontal wells are an increasingly important part of our story and our assets are well configured to allow for them. We have a manageable lease exploration issue and we will preserve all of our prime acreage. 
In spite of the downturn of activity, we're emphasizing our core strengths and idea generation and innovation. Our teams are hard at work developing new plays and new concepts. During the downturn of 2009, our activity level dropped from 43 operated rigs to 3. At that time, we challenged the organization to be innovative, creative and to find ways to make a living in spite of the downturn. We were not victims. 
During 2009, we developed plays that were going to carry us on the ensuing years and are still among our core programs today. In 2016, our challenge to the organization is to do it again. We are built for these times, however difficult they may be. We will make the tough decisions around capital investments and activity level. We will remain disciplined and preserve our assets and the deep inventory that is our future. We will also seek to build new things and to take advantage of this downturn. No one is hanging their head at Cimarex. We are hard at work to control our own destiny. 
I recently heard a CEO describe some advice that one of his board members have given them. The board member was a retired military officer who told the CEO that he had always told his troops that, ""When the map doesn't match the terrain, go with the terrain."" Here at Cimarex, we're going with the terrain. During 2015, we increased our rig count to a high of 12 rigs, with an original plan to keep 12 operated rigs throughout 2016. As the year wore on and the commodity outlook continued to worsen, we determined that a 12-rig program was no longer prudent. 
Although we have the inventory to justify the higher activity level even at current prices, we have decided to slow down and preserve our cash on hand. Production growth will have to take a backseat to flexibility and balance sheet preservation. Our focus is on a multiyear outlook. We currently have 11 operated rigs running and we'll be decreasing our rig count to 4 rigs in the coming months. Our 2016 program is designed to preserve our assets on leasehold and finish up some delineation and spacing pilots that are underway. 
We plan to invest between $600 million and $650 million in exploration and development. The range of investment is driven by timing of completions in one of the projects currently underway, the Woodford infill well in the Eastern core of Cana. Whatever we do not spend in 2016 will be pushed into early 2017. We will also continue to delineate the Meramec drill spacing test in the Wolfcamp in the Delaware Basin and hold leasehold. 
In the fourth quarter of 2015, we were impacted by severe weather events and took direct hits at both the Western Delaware Basin and in our core Cana field. Furthermore, a planned outage in Delaware Basin added to our problems. I cannot overstate how pleased we were with the response to these events by our organization. Although they had a significant impact on our production volumes, our teams worked valiantly and safely in extremely hostile conditions in order to restore our production and find creative workarounds to market interruptions. These extraordinary actions don't always evidence themselves in top line reported production numbers, but they humble us and make us deeply proud to be part of an organization that is so dedicated and focused. 
With that, I will turn the call over to John to provide further details on our program."

I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our 2016 plans. Cimarex invested $191 million during the fourth quarter on exploration and development. This brought the total to $877 million for the full year. About 55% was invested in the Permian region with the rest going toward activities in the Mid-Continent region. Company-wide, we brought 65 gross, 28 net wells on production during the quarter, which brought the total for 2015 to 219 gross, 99 net wells. 
Cimarex continues to push the envelope on well completions. In the Permian, we completed 2 Upper Wolfcamp wells in the fourth quarter using a larger stimulation. As you can see on Slide 14 of our presentation, these wells have seen a 34% higher cumulative production in the first 120 days versus the previous Upper Wolfcamp wells. In fact, one of the wells, Mine That Bird 38 Unit #1-H had an average 30-day peak production rate of 2,020 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 51% was gas, 30% -- excuse me, 51% oil, 30% gas and 19% NGL. A record IP from a 7,500-foot Upper Wolfcamp lateral in Culberson County. 
As discussed previously, we spud a downspacing pilot in the Upper Wolfcamp and Culberson County in the fourth quarter. Drilling on these wells will be finished this month with completion scheduled to begin in April. First production is expected by the end of May. This fixed well, 7,500-foot lateral pilot will test 2 different spacing designs. One testing 8 wells per section, while the other will test 6 wells per section. Both will be drilled in a staggered pattern. The larger completion I just discussed will be used on this pilot. 
For the rest of 2016, the vast majority of the capital that we will spend in the Permian will be earmarked for acreage obligations across our Wolfcamp position in both Culberson and Reeves County. Part of this obligation drilling will include 6, 2-mile-long infill wells in Reeves County. These infill wells are located next to our Big Timber well, the best Wolfcamp well we drilled in Reeves County. 
Similar to our Anaconda pilot, these wells will be drilled using a stacked/staggered pattern, resulting in equivalent of 12 wells per section. We currently have 6 rigs running in the Permian, with one of them drilling a saltwater disposal well in Culberson County. By June, we will be down to 2 rigs for the remainder of the year. 
Now on to the Mid-Continent. You will recall that we began drilling on the Cana-Woodford Row 4 infill development program in the fourth quarter of 2014. Completion from the 7 sections are now finished and all 57 gross wells are producing. Cimarex operated 2 of these sections. Typical development in the Woodford calls for 8 new wells in addition to the parent well on a section. The Armacost section was infilled with 9 additional wells, while the Phillips section was infilled with 11 new wells. 
For the Armacost section, the average 30-day peak production was 9.1 million cubic feet equivalent per day, 61% gas, 8% oil, 31% NGL. And the Phillips wells produced an average 30-day peak rate of 9.3 million cubic feet equivalent per day, 54% gas, 13% oil, 33% NGL. As you can see on Slide 20 of our presentation, these increased density infill sections are performing very similar to previously infilled Woodford section with only 8 new wells. A very encouraging results for us. 
In the fourth quarter 2015, we commenced drilling another Woodford infill well in the East side of the core. This development covers 6 sections, of which Cimarex again operates 2 sections. The entire infill project consists of 50 gross, 23 net wells. Depending on the timing of completions, something that will be worked out with our partner, production from this East Cana development row is expected to come on line as early as October or perhaps as late as the first quarter of 2017. 
In our emerging Meramec play, we now have production data on 17 operated 5,000-foot laterals. In addition, our second 10,000-foot lateral in the Meramec has been on production since early October. This well, called the Vessels 1H-3526X has a 30-day peak IP rate of 14 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 791 barrels of oil per day. 
Page 22 of the presentation illustrates the average uplift we've seen from the 2 long laterals versus the 5,000-foot laterals drilled to date. They have outperformed the shorter laterals by 69% within 120 days. While we are very encouraged by the initial uplift in IP that we're seeing in these 10,000-foot laterals, we will be carefully monitoring the decline profile in order to determine the ultimate EURs for these long lateral wells. 
To better understand the multizone potential for this area, we have designed a downspacing pilot with commenced drilling in the fourth quarter 2015. See Slide 23 for an illustration of this design. Due to the commodity price environment, this pilot has been downsized. It will now consist of 8 new wells to be stacked and staggered in both the Meramec and Woodford formations. The spacing of the Meramec would be the equivalent of 10 wells per section made up of 5 upper and 5 lower staggered Meramec wells. The Woodford will be drilled with our standard 9 wells per section development plan. Drilling should be finished by mid-April with first production expected late in the second quarter. 
Once drilling is finished on the pilot and infill sections, we will be focused on holding our Meramec acreage. Since the late 2014, we've added 12,250 net acres in the Meramec at an average cost of $1,650 per acre. We'll need to drill approximately 40 to 45 wells over the next 3 years in order to HBP our position. In 2016, we will drill 12 operated wells to hold this acreage position, with 10 of the 12 wells being 10,000-foot laterals. We currently have 5 rigs operating in the Mid-Continent region, with plans to go down the 1 rig by July of this year. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi."

I'll touch on the usual items, our fourth quarter production, our Q1 and full year 2016 production outlook and then I'll finish with a few comments on LOE and service cost. Our f",1504,"Well, thank you, John, and thank you all for joining us on our call today. I'll touch on the usual items, our fourth quarter production, our Q1 and full year 2016 production outlook and then I'll finish with a few comments on LOE and service cost. 
Our fourth quarter total company net equivalent production came in at 985.7 million a day, up 4% from the 949.5 million a day that we posted in Q4 '14 and within our guidance of 0.98 to 1.01 Bcfe per day. Late in the quarter, as Tom mentioned, winter weather and facility disruptions negatively impacted our production by approximately 30 million cubic feet a day equivalent, with the majority of that occurring in the Permian. 
Late December winter storms caused significant downtime in not only the Delaware Basin, but also impacted our Cana production as well, albeit to a lesser degree. When we adjust for the estimated impact of the weather and the facility downtime, we would have exceeded the upper end of our guidance by more than 5 million a day. With Q4 now on the books, our full year 2015 equivalent production came in at 985 million a day, that's up 13% over 2014 average of 869 million a day. 
During Q4, our Permian equivalent production averaged 520 million a day, that's down 42 million a day from Q3 '15. But as I mentioned, a significant portion of the decrease was a result of not only the -- was a result of the weather and facility downtime, but we also completed fewer Permian wells during the latter half of the year than we did in the first half as we've talked about in our previous calls. As expected, with our Cana Row 4 wells coming online, we saw a very nice bump in our Q4 Mid-Continent production, with our Mid-Continent volumes coming in at 461 million a day, that's up 14% or 56 million a day from the 405 million a day that we reported just prior in Q3. 
For 2016, with a number of moving parts, the most sensitive of which is the timing of our 2016 completions, we've issued full year total company equivalent production guidance of 890 million to 930 million equivalents today. With our focus on preserving our assets and protecting our balance sheet in the low price environment we're in, we've opted to slow down and more consistently spread out or completion activity throughout the year. As John mentioned, we also find ourselves needing to coordinate the timing of our Cana-Woodford completion activity with the completion timing of our offset operator. 
As a result, there is considerable variability in the inventory of uncompleted wells that we will have on the books at the end of the year. As we best can project at this time, we anticipate and we've modeled that our Cana infill fracking operations will begin in late to third -- late third to fourth quarter and continue into 2017, with first production from the project not hitting our books until early 2017. This program represents a lion's share of our 2016 Mid-Continent activity consisting of 50 gross and 23 net wells. 
With our current modeling, we expect to see first production from approximately 50 gross or 16 net Mid-Continent wells during '16, and that's down from 134 gross or 39 net wells that we completed in 2015. With the anticipated Cana infill completion delay, we expect to exit the year the 57 gross or 24 net wells awaiting completion. Hence, moving associated production for those wells into early 2017. 
In the Permian, we also planned for a slower pace of completion activity, which will likely only require us to utilize just one completion crew for the majority of the year. We're forecasting approximately 31 net Permian wells to come online in 2016, that's down about half of the 60 net wells that we completed in 2015. As we progress through the year, we project the number of Permian drilled and uncompleted wells to increase to approximately 18 net wells by midyear and then drop off to just 6 net wells by the end of the year, primarily a result of us dropping to the 2 rigs that John mentioned in the Permian in the middle of the year. 
I want to take a moment to make a special point that a quick glance at our 2016 full year guidance could very easily imply a decline in our 2016 exit rate. What's not so easy to see is the forecast of production increase associated with the delayed Cana infill programs back-to-back completion activity in early 2017 which, along with a handful of Permian carryover completions, is forecasted to bring our total company production back up to Q4 '15 levels by as early as Q2 '17. It's all about the timing of our completions. 
As far as our Q1 total company production is concerned, incorporating anticipated Permian pipeline and facility curtailments of about 30 million a day for the first quarter, our projected guidance for Q1 comes in at 925 million to 955 million a day. 
Jumping over to CapEx. With our production groups continued focus on trimming operating costs, our Q4 lifting cost came in at $0.85 per Mcfe. That's in line with our guidance of $0.77 to $0.87 and was down 19% from the $1.05 that we posted in Q4 '14. For the year, our 2015 lifting cost came in at $0.83 per Mcfe. That's down a respectable 23% from our 2014 average of $1.08. As we look forward into 2016, our full year lifting cost guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per Mcfe takes into account our regional forecasted production mix as well as the variable nature of workover expenses. 
You may have also noted that our Q4 '15 transportation and processing expense came in at $0.58. So it's slightly above our guidance range of $0.45 to $0.55. As I mentioned, our current production modeling forecast a slowdown in our completion activity during the year, which resulted in a onetime accrual of approximately $8 million for anticipated minimum volume agreement shortfalls, which increased our reported cost on a nonrecurring basis by approximately $0.09 per Mcfe. 
We've made great strides cutting our LOE and we'll continue our efforts to reduce them further. As we mentioned last call, the important by-product of our LOE reductions is the additional funding we're providing our drilling program. Our Q4 '15 average monthly LOE came in at $25.7 million a month and that's $5 million below our Q4 '14 average of $30.7 million a month, which if we average that over a 12-month time period has freed up nearly $60 million that we can direct to our drilling program. 
A few comments on our drilling and completion cost. Although we continue to push hard for further cost relief, any cost reductions we've seen have been small, single-digit reductions and modest in nature. That said, we continue our focus on operating efficiencies. On the drilling side, we've high-graded our rigs, we're bidding out each and every service, we're consolidating our equipment and resources everywhere we can, all the while we're staying focused on reducing drilling days. 
On the completion side, we're focused on optimizing the cost of water sourcing by more efficiently fracking our wells, in particular, when we're completing multi-well pads. The bottom line is that while we continue to experience -- experiment with various frac designs, our generic well AFEs have remained relatively flat. Our current Cana core 1-mile lateral Woodford AFE continues to run in the range of $6.6 million to $7 million, that's unchanged from the last call. While in the Meramec, our current 1-mile lateral AFE is also -- is in the range of $7 million to $7.4 million, that's also unchanged from last quarter. 
In the Permian, as we've mentioned last call, we've made great progress with our drilling efficiencies, cutting our Wolfcamp 2-mile laterals, but the rig release time is down 20% from 35 days in 2014 to 28 days in 2015 with a record of 20.5 days. We're accomplishing similar drill time reductions in a 1-mile lateral Bone Spring and Avalon program as well, cutting average days from spud-to-rig release 35% from 23 days in '14 to just '15 in Q4 '15. We continue to get more done with fewer rigs. And with all that, our current 2-mile lateral Wolfcamp AFE is running $10.8 million to $11.6 million, that's flat again to the figures we quoted last call. 
So in closing, we had another great quarter. We fought a significant Q4 downstream weather -- downtime to stay within guidance and provide us with a strong springboard for production in 2016. We posted solid year-over-year production gains over 2014. We've made significant strides cutting our LOE. Our drilling group stays focused on cost reductions and efficiencies. And as an organization, we remain vigilant to keep our cost in check, protect our assets and optimize our investment program results. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to question-and-answer."

And so we're always looking to see what others are doing. And I think we have a lot of room for improvement. I would say in both our core areas, the Delaware Basin and Meramec. There's lots of things others are doing that we have opinions on. But at the end of the day, some of this is just trial and error and we need to try some things."

As we look ahead, I think the industry is having a sobering reset. And I love to sit here on the call, put lipstick on and say, ""You know what, it's one thing."" But as you look ahead in running a company, we have to look at the ins and outs of cash flow balance. And so we look into what -- I said in my opening remarks, we spent a lot of time last year looking at our assets and looking at the future drilling inventory and the value that adds. And we've made a tremendous amount of progress in our flexibility and our ability to do real-time modeling of future increases in price, future increases in activity and actually modeling the impact that has fully looking at our cash flow and our balance sheet. But when you do that, one of the reasons that we're doing that is because if prices don't pick up at any point, we want to make sure that Cimarex stays healthy and stays competitive. And we don't want to put ourselves in a situation where we've lost our flexibly. So inherently, that model is kind of a downside model. It's really easy to run an upside model, but you have to kind of plan on the downside. And so we're -- as we look ahead to the next few years, I will say that if things don't materially improve over the current strip, Cimarex will be just fine. We'll be healthy financially and we'll be in a position where we attempt to model into that future without increasing debt. But if things increase, if commodity prices pick up, we are ready to roll. I know I'm not giving you -- I'm not giving you detailed answer on what our 2017 and beyond model looks like, but we're making decisions to keep Cimarex competitive and to preserve our assets. Mark, do you want to add to that?"

And it is -- in this current strip environment, low-40s and 30s are very challenging for us to find the pace of -- our cash flow can support our pace development. So what iterations we're running all the time, looking at different sensitivities and different programs. And as Joe remarks in his comments, even for this year, there's an impact of those well completions, can have very big impacts on our timing of our production.

So right now, again, we do definitely look at the ROR.

If we weren't tasked with holding acreage and we can just go drill at will and there were no other considerations, when we look at these long laterals in the Wolfcamp, the long laterals in the Cana, Meramec play, we have lots of them that generate, what I would say, are acceptable returns at current strip.

We don't think prices will stay here forever and we have some outstanding acreage that we'd like to hold, not all of which can be developed with long laterals. We have partner considerations.

And it's given us some encouragement, especially as we look more to the Western side, it's looking much more attractive to us. And fortunately for us, we have a pretty nice position there. In fact, that's where a lot of the new leasing that we have picked up is in more of that area. So yes, throughout the rest of this year we'll be geographically spreading across that map quite a bit with the wells that we'd be drilling and that will just help us further delineate the full potential for this interval."

One of the things that we're seeing in the Meramec is a fair variability but also a fair availability of results with landing zone. A landing zone seems to have a fairly strong impact in the way that it has surprised us compared to the Woodford below it. And so I think as we go forward, you're probably going to hear us talking more and more about the Mississippian as opposed to the Meramec. Yet some of the lower section, you hear the Osage being talked about as a target. And that's looking more and more interesting to us. There are some really good wells out there that are hard to explain if you only have the Meramec to explain it with. And so as John said, there's a tremendous amount of upside for us not only in our acreage but also operational improvements since we've test landing zones and then also completions. We're pretty bullish on that play right now and our position.

We sincerely appreciate your interest and look forward to your questions during the question-and-answer portion of the call. On the call today, John will give a rundown of our recent results and update you on some of the delineation that we have underway in 2016. Joe will provide an operational overview. 
I would like to kick off the call with some overview remarks and our direction in 2016 and beyond. During 2015, we put a lot of energy into long-range planning and we developed capabilities for running detailed iterations on current and future years' CapEx, cash flow and balance sheet configuration. We scrubbed our assets and developed net asset value models that help us to fully understand our upside and plan accordingly. 
Today, we are making decisions for 2016 with a close eye on 2017, 2018 and beyond. Cimarex is better positioned for the future by slowing down a bit, preserving our cash and assets and living within our means. Our focus is on preservation of our assets and balance sheet. We don't have any special insight on when or how commodity prices will recover. We do know that we will probably be as surprised by the recovery as we were by the collapse. When prices recover, Cimarex will be ready and will be stronger and healthier as ever. 
We have never been more bullish on our assets, our inventory and our organizational capability. Our Delaware Basin and Meramec/Woodford assets are top tier. We continue to be pleased with our well results and associated returns on investment. On the call today, you'll hear updates on our Wolfcamp spacing pilots and the implications for future development. 
We continue to be extremely pleased with our Wolfcamp well performance and have room to run in achieving further performance improvements. You will hear an update on the Meramec/Woodford spacing pilot that is underway in Cana. We're testing a combined 19 wells per section in the Meramec and Woodford. The Meramec continues to surprise to the upside. We are currently flowing back Woodford spacing pilots that are testing 10 and 12 Woodford wells per section. Results are very encouraging. 
Furthermore, our improved Woodford results are showing remarkable consistency across the Cana core. In both the Delaware and Woodford/Meramec, long horizontal wells are an increasingly important part of our story and our assets are well configured to allow for them. We have a manageable lease exploration issue and we will preserve all of our prime acreage. 
In spite of the downturn of activity, we're emphasizing our core strengths and idea generation and innovation. Our teams are hard at work developing new plays and new concepts. During the downturn of 2009, our activity level dropped from 43 operated rigs to 3. At that time, we challenged the organization to be innovative, creative and to find ways to make a living in spite of the downturn. We were not victims. 
During 2009, we developed plays that were going to carry us on the ensuing years and are still among our core programs today. In 2016, our challenge to the organization is to do it again. We are built for these times, however difficult they may be. We will make the tough decisions around capital investments and activity level. We will remain disciplined and preserve our assets and the deep inventory that is our future. We will also seek to build new things and to take advantage of this downturn. No one is hanging their head at Cimarex. We are hard at work to control our own destiny. 
I recently heard a CEO describe some advice that one of his board members have given him. The board member was a retired military officer who told the CEO that he had always told his troops that, ""When the map doesn't match the terrain, go with the terrain."" Here at Cimarex, we're going with the terrain. During 2015, we increased our rig count to a high of 12 rigs, with an original plan to keep 12 operated rigs throughout 2016. As the year wore on and the commodity outlook continued to worsen, we determined that a 12-rig program was no longer prudent. 
Although we have the inventory to justify the higher activity level even at current prices, we have decided to slow down and preserve our cash on hand. Production growth will have to take a backseat to flexibility and balance sheet preservation. Our focus is on a multiyear outlook. We currently have 11 operated rigs running and we'll be decreasing our rig count to 4 rigs in the coming months. Our 2016 program is designed to preserve our assets on leasehold and finish up some delineation and spacing pilots that are underway. 
We plan to invest between $600 million and $650 million in exploration and development. The range of investment is driven by timing of completions in one of the projects currently underway, the Woodford infill well in the Eastern core of Cana. Whatever we do not spend in 2016 will be pushed into early 2017. We will also continue to delineate the Meramec drill spacing test in the Wolfcamp in the Delaware Basin and hold leasehold. 
In the fourth quarter of 2015, we were impacted by severe weather events and took direct hits at both the Western Delaware Basin and in our core Cana field. Furthermore, a plant outage in Delaware Basin added to our problems. I cannot overstate how pleased we were with the response to these events by our organization. Although they had a significant impact on our production volumes, our teams worked valiantly and safely in extremely hostile conditions in order to restore our production and find creative workarounds to market interruptions. These extraordinary actions don't always evidence themselves in top line reported production numbers, but they humble us and make us deeply proud to be part of an organization that is so dedicated and focused. 
With that, I will turn the call over to John to provide further details on our program."

I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our 2016 plans. Cimarex invested $191 million during the fourth quarter on exploration and",1040,"Thanks, Tom. I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our 2016 plans. Cimarex invested $191 million during the fourth quarter on exploration and development. This brought the total to $877 million for the full year. About 55% was invested in the Permian region with the rest going toward activities in the Mid-Continent region. Company-wide, we brought 65 gross, 28 net wells on production during the quarter, which brought the total for 2015 to 219 gross, 99 net wells. 
Cimarex continues to push the envelope on well completions. In the Permian, we completed 2 Upper Wolfcamp wells in the fourth quarter using a larger stimulation. As you can see on Slide 14 of our presentation, these wells have seen a 34% higher cumulative production in the first 120 days versus the previous Upper Wolfcamp wells. In fact, one of the wells, Mine That Bird 38 Unit #1-H had an average 30-day peak production rate of 2,020 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 51% was gas, 30% -- excuse me, 51% oil, 30% gas and 19% NGL, a record IP from a 7,500-foot Upper Wolfcamp lateral in Culberson County. 
As discussed previously, we spud a downspacing pilot in the Upper Wolfcamp and Culberson County in the fourth quarter. Drilling on these wells will be finished this month with completion scheduled to begin in April. First production is expected by the end of May. This fixed well, 7,500-foot lateral pilot will test 2 different spacing designs, one testing 8 wells per section, while the other will test 6 wells per section. Both will be drilled in a staggered pattern. The larger completion I just discussed will be used on this pilot. 
For the rest of 2016, the vast majority of the capital that we will spend in the Permian will be earmarked for acreage obligations across our Wolfcamp position in both Culberson and Reeves County. Part of this obligation drilling will include 6, 2-mile-long infill wells in Reeves County. These infill wells are located next to our Big Timber well, the best Wolfcamp well we've drilled in Reeves County. 
Similar to our Anaconda pilot, these wells will be drilled using a stacked/staggered pattern, resulting in equivalent of 12 wells per section. We currently have 6 rigs running in the Permian, with one of them drilling a saltwater disposal well in Culberson County. By June, we will be down to 2 rigs for the remainder of the year. 
Now on to the Mid-Continent. You will recall that we began drilling on the Cana-Woodford Row 4 infill development program in the fourth quarter of 2014. Completion from the 7 sections are now finished and all 57 gross wells are producing. Cimarex operated 2 of these sections. Typical development in the Woodford calls for 8 new wells in addition to the parent well on a section. The Armacost section was infilled with 9 additional wells, while the Phillips section was infilled with 11 new wells. 
For the Armacost section, the average 30-day peak production from was 9.1 million cubic feet equivalent per day, 61% gas, 8% oil, 31% NGL. And the Phillips wells produced an average 30-day peak rate of 9.3 million cubic feet equivalent per day, 54% gas, 13% oil, 33% NGL. As you can see on Slide 20 of our presentation, these increased density infill sections are performing very similar to previously infilled Woodford sections with only 8 new wells. A very encouraging results for us. 
In the fourth quarter 2015, we commenced drilling another Woodford infill well in the east side of the core. This development covers 6 sections, of which Cimarex again operates 2 sections. The entire infill project consists of 50 gross, 23 net wells. Depending on the timing of completions, something that will be worked out with our partner, production from this East Cana development row is expected to come on line beginning as early as October or perhaps as late as the first quarter of 2017. 
In our emerging Meramec play, we now have production data on 17 operated 5,000-foot laterals. In addition, our second 10,000-foot lateral in the Meramec has been on production since early October. This well, called the Vessels 1H-3526X, has a 30-day peak IP rate of 14 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 791 barrels of oil per day. 
Page 22 of the presentation illustrates the average uplift we've seen from the 2 long laterals versus the 5,000-foot laterals drilled to date. They have outperformed the shorter laterals by 69% within 120 days. While we are very encouraged by the initial uplift in IP that we're seeing in these 10,000-foot laterals, we will be carefully monitoring their decline profile in order to determine the ultimate EURs for these long lateral wells. 
To better understand the multizone potential for this area, we have designed a downspacing pilot with commenced drilling in the fourth quarter 2015. See Slide 23 for an illustration of this design. Due to the commodity price environment, this pilot has been downsized. It will now consist of 8 new wells to be stacked and staggered in both the Meramec and Woodford formations. The spacing of the Meramec would be the equivalent of 10 wells per section made up of 5 upper and 5 lower staggered Meramec wells. The Woodford will be drilled with our standard 9 wells per section development plan. Drilling should be finished by mid-April with first production expected late in the second quarter. 
Once drilling is finished on the pilot and infill sections, we will be focused on holding our Meramec acreage. Since late 2014, we've added 12,250 net acres in the Meramec at an average cost of $1,650 per acre. We'll need to drill approximately 40 to 45 wells over the next 3 years in order to HBP our position. In 2016, we will drill 12 operated wells to hold this acreage position, with 10 of the 12 wells being 10,000-foot laterals. We currently have 5 rigs operating in the Mid-Continent region, with plans to go down to 1 rig by July of this year. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi."
1683286,322182565,935076,"Cimarex Energy Co., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2016",2016-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Cimarex Energy Co.","Executives","Well, thank you, John, and thank you all for joining us on our call today. I'll touch on the usual items, our fourth quarter production, our Q1 and full year 2016 production outlook and then I'll finish with a few comments on LOE and service cost. Our f",1503,"Well, thank you, John, and thank you all for joining us on our call today. I'll touch on the usual items, our fourth quarter production, our Q1 and full year 2016 production outlook and then I'll finish with a few comments on LOE and service cost. 
Our fourth quarter total company net equivalent production came in at 985.7 million a day, up 4% from the 949.5 million a day that we posted in Q4 '14 and within our guidance of 0.98 to 1.01 Bcfe per day. Late in the quarter, as Tom mentioned, winter weather and facility disruptions negatively impacted our production by approximately 30 million cubic feet a day equivalent, with the majority of that occurring in the Permian. 
Late December winter storms caused significant downtime in not only the Delaware Basin, but also impacted our Cana production as well, albeit to a lesser degree. When we adjust for the estimated impact of the weather and the facility downtime, we would have exceeded the upper end of our guidance by more than 5 million a day. With Q4 now on the books, our full year 2015 equivalent production came in at 985 million a day, that's up 13% over our 2014 average of 869 million a day. 
During Q4, our Permian equivalent production averaged 520 million a day, that's down 42 million a day from Q3 '15. But as I mentioned, a significant portion of the decrease was a result of not only the -- was a result of the weather and facility downtime, but we also completed fewer Permian wells during the latter half of the year than we did in the first half as we've talked about in our previous calls. As expected, with our Cana Row 4 wells coming online, we saw a very nice bump in our Q4 Mid-Continent production, with our Mid-Continent volumes coming in at 461 million a day. That's up 14% or 56 million a day from the 405 million a day that we reported just prior in Q3. 
For 2016, with a number of moving parts, the most sensitive of which is the timing of our 2016 completions, we've issued full year total company equivalent production guidance of 890 million to 930 million equivalents per day. With our focus on preserving our assets and protecting our balance sheet in the low price environment we're in, we've opted to slow down and more consistently spread out our completion activity throughout the year. As John mentioned, we also find ourselves needing to coordinate the timing of our Cana-Woodford completion activity with the completion timing of our offset operator. 
As a result, there is considerable variability in the inventory of uncompleted wells that we will have on the books at the end of the year. As we best can project at this time, we anticipate and we've modeled that our Cana infill fracking operations will begin in late to third -- late third to fourth quarter and continue into 2017, with first production from the project not hitting our books until early 2017. This program represents the lion's share of our 2016 Mid-Continent activity consisting of 50 gross and 23 net wells. 
With our current modeling, we expect to see first production from approximately 50 gross or 16 net Mid-Continent wells during '16, and that's down from 134 gross or 39 net wells that we completed in 2015. With the anticipated Cana infill completion delay, we expect to exit the year with 57 gross or 24 net wells awaiting completion, hence moving associated production for those wells into early 2017. 
In the Permian, we also planned for a slower pace of completion activity, which will likely only require us to utilize just one completion crew for the majority of the year. We're forecasting approximately 31 net Permian wells to come online in 2016; that's down about half of the 60 net wells that we completed in 2015. As we progress through the year, we project the number of Permian drilled and uncompleted wells to increase to approximately 18 net wells by midyear and then drop off to just 6 net wells by the end of the year, primarily a result of us dropping to the 2 rigs that John mentioned in the Permian in the middle of the year. 
I want to take a moment to make a special point that a quick glance at our 2016 full year guidance could very easily imply a decline in our 2016 exit rate. What's not so easy to see is the forecast of production increase associated with the delayed Cana infill programs back-to-back completion activity in early 2017 which, along with a handful of Permian carryover completions, is forecasted to bring our total company production back up to Q4 '15 levels by as early as Q2 '17. It's all about the timing of our completions. 
As far as our Q1 total company production is concerned, incorporating anticipated Permian pipeline and facility curtailments of about 30 million a day for the first quarter, our projected guidance for Q1 comes in at 925 million to 955 million a day. 
Jumping over to CapEx. With our production groups' continued focus on trimming operating costs, our Q4 lifting cost came in at $0.85 per Mcfe. That's in line with our guidance of $0.77 to $0.87 and was down 19% from the $1.05 that we posted in Q4 '14. For the year, our 2015 lifting cost came in at $0.83 per Mcfe. That's down a respectable 23% from our 2014 average of $1.08. As we look forward into 2016, our full year lifting cost guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90 per Mcfe takes into account our regional forecasted production mix as well as the variable nature of workover expenses. 
You may have also noted that our Q4 '15 transportation and processing expense came in at $0.58. So it's slightly above our guidance range of $0.45 to $0.55. As I mentioned, our current production modeling forecasts a slowdown in our completion activity during the year, which resulted in a onetime accrual of approximately $8 million for anticipated minimum volume agreement shortfalls, which increased our reported cost on a nonrecurring basis by approximately $0.09 per Mcfe. 
We've made great strides cutting our LOE and we'll continue our efforts to reduce them further. As we mentioned last call, the important by-product of our LOE reductions is the additional funding we're providing our drilling program. Our Q4 '15 average monthly LOE came in at $25.7 million a month and that's $5 million below our Q4 '14 average of $30.7 million a month, which if we average that over a 12-month time period has freed up nearly $60 million that we can direct to our drilling program. 
A few comments on our drilling and completion cost. Although we continue to push hard for further cost relief, any cost reductions we've seen have been small, single-digit reductions and modest in nature. That said, we continue our focus on operating efficiencies. On the drilling side, we've high-graded our rigs, we're bidding out each and every service, we're consolidating our equipment and resources everywhere we can, all the while we're staying focused on reducing drilling days. 
On the completion side, we're focused on optimizing the cost of water sourcing by more efficiently fracking our wells, in particular, when we're completing multi-well pads. The bottom line is that while we continue to experience -- experiment with various frac designs, our generic well AFEs have remained relatively flat. Our current Cana core 1-mile lateral Woodford AFE continues to run in the range of $6.6 million to $7 million. That's unchanged from the last call. While in the Meramec, our current 1-mile lateral AFE is also -- is in the range of $7 million to $7.4 million; that's also unchanged from last quarter. 
In the Permian, as we've mentioned last call, we've made great progress with our drilling efficiencies, cutting our Wolfcamp 2-mile lateral spud-to-rig release times down 20%, from 35 days in 2014 to 28 days in 2015, with a record of 20.5 days. We're accomplishing similar drill time reductions in a 1-mile lateral Bone Spring and Avalon program as well, cutting average days from spud-to-rig release 35%, from 23 days in '14 to just 15 in Q4 '15. We continue to get more done with fewer rigs. And with all that, our current 2-mile lateral Wolfcamp AFE is running $10.8 million to $11.6 million; that's flat again to the figures we quoted last call. 
So in closing, we had another great quarter. We fought off significant Q4 downstream weather -- downtime to stay within guidance and provide us with a strong springboard for production in 2016. We posted solid year-over-year production gains over 2014. We've made significant strides cutting our LOE. Our drilling group stays focused on cost reductions and efficiencies. And as an organization, we remain vigilant to keep our costs in check, protect our assets and optimize our investment program results. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to question-and-answer."

And so we look into, what I said in my opening remarks, we spent a lot of time last year looking at our assets and looking at the future drilling inventory and the value that adds. And we've made a tremendous amount of progress in our flexibility and our ability to do real-time modeling of future increases in price, future increases in activity and actually modeling the impact that has fully looking at our cash flow and our balance sheet. But when you do that, one of the reasons that we're doing that is because if prices don't pick up at any point, we want to make sure that Cimarex stays healthy and stays competitive. And we don't want to put ourselves in a situation where we've lost our flexibility. So inherently, that model is kind of a downside model. It's really easy to run an upside model, but you have to kind of plan on the downside. And so we're -- as we look ahead to the next few years, I will say that if things don't materially improve over the current strip, Cimarex will be just fine. We'll be healthy financially and we'll be in a position where we attempt to model into that future without increasing debt. But if things increase, if commodity prices pick up, we are ready to roll. I know I'm not giving you -- I'm not giving you a detailed answer on what our 2017 and beyond model looks like, but we're making decisions to keep Cimarex competitive and to preserve our assets. Mark, do you want to add to that?"

And it is -- in this current strip environment, low-40s and 30s are very challenging for us to find the pace of best -- what our cash flow can support our pace development. So what iterations we're running all the time, looking at different sensitivities and different programs. And as Joe remarks in his comments, even for this year, there's an impact of the deferral of completions, can have very big impacts on our timing of our production. And so we're running a lot of iterations just looking at what the outlook could be for this year and for the years out."

We have wonderful acreage and we've gotten it at a very attractive price. And essentially for this year's program, as we go up to the end of the year, that's where our capital is going to be geared toward, is preserving that acreage position so that we are in a very good position whenever the time is right to then go back to that full scale development.

But when we look at that and look at the future potential of that section we're holding, we still feel like we're making a very good investment in drilling those wells. So right now, again, we do definitely look at the ROR. And quite frankly, that means some of the acreage that we have will not be held because no matter what scenario, whatever flat price I look at, it's hard to envision how holding a certain set of acreage is in the best interest of Cimarex.

And then we'll also look at the strip. And let me just answer your question this way. If we were forced to increase activity and we had an A-tax 25 hurdle rate, we have lots to do in our portfolio. If we weren't tasked with holding acreage and we can just go drill at will and there were no other considerations, when we look at these long laterals in the Wolfcamp, the long laterals in the Cana, Meramec play, we have lots of them that generate, what I would say, are acceptable returns at current strip. But as John said, we have a lot of considerations currently. We don't think prices will stay here forever and we have some outstanding acreage that we'd like to hold, not all of which can be developed with long laterals. We have partner considerations. And then we also have some science that we want to get done that will really set up the future. So it's a balancing act.

We're still constantly surprised, not just by our results, but as Tom alluded to, a lot of competitor results that are kind of changing the landscape of the map in the Meramec. And it's given us some encouragement, especially as we look more to the western side, it's looking much more attractive to us. And fortunately for us, we have a pretty nice position there. In fact, that's where a lot of the new leasing that we have picked up is in more of that area. So yes, throughout the rest of this year we'll be geographically spreading across that map quite a bit with the wells that we'll be drilling and that will just help us further delineate the full potential for this interval."

One of the things that we're seeing in the Meramec is a fair variability but also a fair variability of results with landing zone. Our landing zone seems to have a fairly strong impact in the way that it has surprised us compared to the Woodford below it. And so I think as we go forward, you're probably going to hear us talking more and more about the Mississippian as opposed to the Meramec. Yet some of the lower section, you hear the Osage being talked about as a target. And that's looking more and more interesting to us. There are some really good wells out there that are hard to explain if you only have the Meramec to explain it with. And so, as John said, there's a tremendous amount of upside for us not only in our acreage but also operational improvements since we test landing zones and then also completions. We're pretty bullish on that play right now and our position. And although we generally rue competition everywhere, there's some competition out there that's giving us a lot of good information and it's just shining a very good positive light on our position."

We sincerely appreciate your interest and look forward to your questions during the question-and-answer portion of the call. On the call today, John will walk us through our recent results to describe our progress and some of the projects we have underway. Joe will follow John with an operational overview, including some of the significant steps we have taken to improve sales and efficiencies.
As we described impasse calls, the timing of our delineation projects, many of the significant results from our 2016 delineation program will come and fit some starts this year. Rest assured, our organization is hard at work during this downturn, necessity is the mother of [indiscernible].
I'd like open the call with some brief overview remarks regarding our direction in 2016 and beyond. As always, our focus will be on results. We reported a strong production week this quarter driven by improved well performance. Our total company production came in at 973 million cubic feet equivalent per day for the first quarter, which exceeded the high end of our guidance. Expenses came in within guidance, resulting in a strong quarter overall. Gas production was up, our oil production was down slightly. As we had forecasted, this was due to fewer well completions in the Permian basin due to the timing of our delineation projects. We expect to pick up the pace in our Permian completions during the remainder of the year.
We also reported a modest increase in our 2016 capital budget. This is the result of the completions of our East Cana-Woodford program being pushed forward from 2017 into 2016. The application is bigger, more effective simulations across the board and greater-than-anticipated working interest in both our own walls and in partner operated wells. With the results that we're seeing, we're delighted to have an increased exposure.
Since our last call, we've seen a bit of reading room in commodity prices. As a result, were accelerating some of the Permian completion activity that was delayed due to the planned [indiscernible]. As you'll also hear during the call our focus on science and innovation continues to pace. We continue to experiment with more effective stimulations primarily to the use of more profit, more stages, Hydro cluster spacing and more clusters per space and the use of diverter technology. This down cycle and associated decrease in activity is providing an ideal environment to focus on science and technology. We're also taking advance of decreased service cost to experiment and improve our methodologies.
We've also made great strides in reducing our cost structure. The organizations undergoing a conservative effort to lower G&A through voluntary retirements that lead to headcount reductions, reducing contracting consultants services and optimizing work efficiencies, particularly in the field.
Finally, before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to comment on our thoughts as we look ahead. In 2015, we said that our challenge was to get our program to a point where sustainable our living within cash flow and have a capital program with a cost structure that was appropriate for the new normal. In our  last call, we told you that our challenge in 2016 was to preserve our assets, preserve our balance sheet and preserve organization. I am pleased to tell you that we are on track with those set goals. As we look ahead of the current strip and model of Cimarex and list of cash flow and is able to get back on a growth trajectory in years ahead. We have best-in-class assets, and we will be able to preserve our prime leasehold in our current program. Our organization is effective, focused and hard at work garnering new opportunities. Our balance sheet provides the flexibility and strength that will keep Cimarex at the forefront in a highly competitive landscape.
We don't know where commodity prices are headed but we don't expect to return to the price levels of 2014 anytime soon. Margins will be challenged, cost structures will be paramount and asset quality and organizational effectiveness will be the differentiator. It's always been a tough business and things won't be easier as we move ahead. Our focus is on performance and results. Although further price recovery will be warmly welcomed, we are in great shape and look ahead with conviction that our value creation proposition is alive and well.
With that, I like to turn the call over to John to provide further color on our program."

I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our 2016 plans. Cimarex invested $158 million on exploration development during the first quarter. About 55% was invested in the Permian region with the rest going toward activities in the region. Company-wide, we brought 22 gross 5 net wells on production during the first quarter. Despite the small number of wells completed during the quarter, Cimarex had an average of 10 operated rigs running during the quarter. These rigs were busy finishing the drilling of wells in the Woodford Shale as well as drilling spacing pallets in both the Delaware basin and in the [indiscernible]. That activity is winding down and the majority of our contracting drilling rates will be by July.
By August, we plan to be down to 3 operated rigs. In the Delaware basin, you may recall that we spotted downspacing pilot in the upper Wolfcamp in Culberson County in the fourth quarter 2015. We are finished with the drilling portion of these wells and completions are scheduled to begin in mid-May. First production is now expected by midyear. This 6-well 7,500 foot lateral [indiscernible] will test 2 different spacing designs. One in eight wells per section, while the others will test 6 wells per section, both will be drilled in a staggered pattern.
Cimarex continues to push the envelope on well completions. On Page 12 of our presentation, we've shown you the uplift using a 40% larger completion on these Upper Wolfcamp wells, which equates to 1,640 pounds of sand prefer. We are about to take that a step further on using even larger designed complete this 6-well pilot. Incorporating 2,500 pounds of sand per lateral foot, these wells will have 44% more sand pump than the largest completed wells we've had to date as shown on Page 12.
We are currently drilling also our lower Wolfcamp project, which we call [indiscernible]. This 10,000-foot spacing pilot is comprised of 5 wells which will be drilled in a stack staggered pattern testing 6 wells per section. We believe the success [indiscernible] larger completions in the Upper Wolfcamp should easily translate to that lower Wolfcamp.
By lay of example, Page 13 in our presentation illustrates the we've seen with a larger completion on a 10,000-foot Upper Wolfcamp. We have also just finished operations on our largest lower Wolfcamp completion today, a well we call the flying Ebony where we pumped 5,400 pounds of sand per foot. The production data from on this well along with the larger completions we are doing with the Upper Wolfcamp will provide us with equal data and design in future completions including the 10-pound wells, which are scheduled to be completed in the second half of 2016.
For the remainder of 2016, the vast majority of the capital that we will spend in the primarily will be earmarked for acreage obligations across our Wolfcamp position in both Culberson and Reeves County. The total capital ascribed to acreage holding in the Delaware basin is just over $200 million in 2016. Part of this obligation drilling will include 6 2 mile-long infill wells in Reeves County, which recently commenced drilling. Similar to our Anaconda pilot, these wells will be drilled using a stack staggered pattern resulting in equivalent of 12 wells per section. Once drilling is completed on this section, we will be down to 2 upper rigs in the Permian for the remainder of the year.
Now on to the Mid-Continent. You will recall that we began drilling the latest Woodford development project on the East side of the Cana core in the first quarter of 2015. This development covers 6 sections of which Cimarex operates 2 sections. Due to some last-minute changes in working interest, this in-field project now consist of 47 [indiscernible] 22 net wells. Drilling is nearly finished and completion of these wells have been moved up as now scheduled for early October versus the first quarter 2017. This change in scheduling was a contributing factor in our $15 million increase in capital expenditures for 2016.
In our emerging Meramec play, we now have production data on 18 operated 5,000-foot products. Also our third 2,000-foot wells in Meramec has been in production since early January. Located in Blaine County, this well called the [indiscernible] 1H-2722X had a 30-day peak IP rate of 10.8 [indiscernible] cubic feet [indiscernible] per day including 951 barrels of oil per day. That results in a [indiscernible] deal of around 270 barrels per [indiscernible] 
Page 21one of the presentation illustrates the average uplift we've seen from the 3 long laterals in the Meramec versus the 5,000-foot laterals drilled to date. They have outperformed the shorter laterals by 62%, more than up by 120 days. While we are very encouraged by the initial uplift in IP that we are seeing in these 10,000-foot laterals, we continue to carefully monitor the decline profile in order to determine the open EURs for these long laterals.
To better understand the multizone potential for this area, we have designed a downspacing pilot, which commenced drilling in the fourth quarter of 2015, and has just finished the drilling phase. See Slide 22 for an illustration of the design. The 8 new wells will be stacked and staggered in both the Meramec at Woodford formations. The spacing in the Meramec would be the equivalent on a 10 wells per section made up of 5 upper and 5 lower staggered Meramec wells. The Woodford will be drilled with our standard 9-well per section development plan. Another Meramec spacing pilot operated by our partner, Devon, was recently completed in the early stages of flowback. The results from this 5 wells per section pilot will strongly influence our completion plans for the stacked and staggered pilot. Once drilling is finished on [indiscernible] sections, we will be focused on holding our Meramec acreage.
As you know, in late 2014, we added 12,250 net acres in the Meramec at an average cost of $1,650 per acre. About $70 million of our capital is being invested in the Meramec acreage in 2016. We currently have 4 rigs operating in that region with plans to be down to 1 operated rig by July of this year.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi."

As Tom",1444,"Well, thank you, John, and thank you all for joining us on our call today. I'll head on the usual items. Our first quarter production, our Q2 and full year 2016 production outlook and then I'll follow-up with a few comments on LOE and service cost. As Tom mentioned, with the help of stronger-than-expected days property and new well performance, our first quarter volumes came in slightly better than anticipated. Our reported total company net equivalent production of $973 million a day beat our guidance projection at $925 million to $955 million a day, and was up 3% from the $947 million a day that we posted in Q1 '15. As expected, the facility and disruptions and processing constraints in the Permian did negatively impact our Q1 production to the tune of approximately $30 million a day.
Our first quarter equivalent Permian production came in at $477 million a day, down $43 million a day from Q4 '15. The decrease was expected and came as another result of the facility downtime I just mentioned, as well as completing 3 net Permian wells in Q1 as compared to 8 wells in the fourth quarter of '15.
With our Cana-Woodford wells coming online in late Q4. We did anticipate a nice lift [indiscernible] during Q1, and we saw just of that. With the wells exceeding our plan expectations, our mid-content volumes came in 493 million a day, that's up 7% from the $461 million a day we reported in the fourth quarter and 11% from the $444 million a day that we posted a year ago in Q1 '15.
As we look forward into the remainder of this year, we've made a few changes to our completion schedule, including the addition of the flag crew in the Permian to help catch up on deferred completions from the downstream disruptions in Q1. And by advancing, as John mentioned, the timing of our Cana to October this year.
With our stronger-than-expected Q1 results and these completion timing adjustments, we've increased our full year total company equivalent production guidance to 940 million to 970 million a day, up about in a midpoint basis of 45 million a day from our beginning-year guidance of 890 million to 930 million. As compared to the original guidance, the acceleration of our Cana-Woodford project resulted in significant decrease in the number of drilled and uncompleted wells on at the end of the year. Our current model now projects 32 wells and 9 net wells leading on completion at year-end, that compares to the 57 drills and 24 net wells that we anticipated with we have waiting completion early this year when we issued the beginning of the guidance. The total ratio not only burst our 2016 total company guidance. But it increases our projected 2016 exit rate as well with our new modeling, we now project our total company of fourth quarter exit rate this year to be right in line with that of the 986 million a day that we posted back in the fourth quarter of '15.
In the Permian, the Q1 facility downtime and processing constraints resulted in us differing absolutely 3 net completions in the latter part of this year with the processing constraints anticipated to now being behind us, our plans are at the second completion group to help catch up and that will be here in May and early June. And with the projected 2 rigs working, the latter part of the year as John mentioned, we're still forecasting approximately 50 drills and 30 Permian wells to come online in 2016, that's slightly the previous estimates that we just released. [indiscernible] pace clear into Q2 and Q3. So as a result, our protected number of Permian drilled and uncompleted wells were in essence, dropped really quickly here from 34 drills to -- and 21 net wells here in May to 10 drills and 9 net on books by year-end.
For Q2 '16, our projected guidance of 935 million to 965 million a day reflects a drop in production from Q1 '16 levels, primarily as we await the scheduled Permian and Cana completion activity which was planned for Q3 and Q4. And to help you -- provide you some clarity on our projected completion timing through the year, we completed 5 net wells in Q1 with forecasting approximately 13 net wells to be completed in Q2 with approximately 44 net wells projected to come online in Q3 and Q4. So you can see that this is in the latter quarters as far as our completion activity is concerned.
Shifting gears to OpEx. Our production group continued to make great strides during Q1 to further reduce our operating cost. Through their efforts, we realize additional and sizable cost reduction an items such a saltwater disposal, compression, rentals and contract labor. As a result, our Q1 '16 lifting cost came in at $0.80 per Mcfe, that's was at the low-end of our guidance which was $0.80 to $0.90 per Mcfe, down 6.3% for [indiscernible] of fourth quarter average of $0.85 and down 17% from the $0.96 we posted through the average in the first quarter of '15.
With our cost control efforts, we're projecting our 2016 lifting cost to continue to fall in the range of $0.80 to $0.90. I'd say, we're most likely to be on the lower end of that range as we finish off the year. We're extremely proud of the efforts that our [indiscernible] has put forward to reduce our cost structure, all the while, maintaining safe and efficient operations. Tom touched on this not only critical for us to be able to compete in this low product price environment. But our reduced OpEx is also freeing up capital for our drilling and making us more efficient operator. Since prices began falling back in 2014, on an absolute basis, we've seen our total company month rate net operating expense dropped about $5 million per month, which annualized equates to an additional $60 million that we can direct to our drilling program.
And finally, a few comments on drilling and completion cost. Although most drilling cost has remained somewhat in check during Q1, we were able to realize some modest reductions in service cost on the completion side, primarily in the Permian. On the drilling side, we're keeping our focus on efficiencies as seen with our Q1 average Wolfcamp spread to rig release drill time down to 28 days as compared to 25 days in 2014.
On the completion side, in addition to the modest service cost reductions I mentioned, mostly in the Permian, we placed a strong emphasis on reducing a lot of sourcing cost by challenging our team in the planning, engineering and operating efficiencies in every barn. The results of our efforts are just now beginning to make way into our total well cost.
As we continue to [indiscernible] on our frac design and size, our completion cost will continue to dominate our total well cost, while the experiment with larger frac designs beginning with our generic well AFE still have stayed to someone in check. An exception is the Wolfcamp where both our drilling and completion efficiencies have reduced our generic 2-mile lateral Culberson and lower Wolfcamp AFE to a range of $10.2 million to $11.2 million, that's down 5% from the $10.8 million to $11.6 million range that we quoted last fall, and down 22% from where we were in late 2014. With last quarter's frac designs, our Cana core 1-mile lateral wells continue to be in the range of $6.6 million to $7 million, unchanged from the last call and down 16% to 17% from 2014. But with a larger frac designs that we're contemplating to be utilized here in Q3 '16, this range is likely to increase in the range of $500,000 to $600,000 per well. And in the Meramec, our current 1-mile lateral AFEs [indiscernible] the range of $7 million to $7.4 million. Again, that is unchanged from last call and down 13% from late '14 and also here, if we employ larger fracs moving forward, we could see an additional $500,000 to $600,000 in [indiscernible] as well.
So in closing, we had another great quarter. We beat guidance despite a sizable downstream and weather disruptions. We've made significant strides, further reducing our LOE. Our drilling and completion group remains focused on cost efficiencies with these reductions and efficiencies and optimizing the results of our fracs. Our teams are tightly focused on maximizing the productivity and profitability of our wells, all the while, we're optimizing our investment program results.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Q&A."

These wells come on and they tend to have a very long frac period to them, and we have enough time with those now that we gain confidence in that tight curve, and that's led to a major change in our expectation for these wells going forward.

So having that footprint multiple play allows us to really bring innovations, and that's more quickly than we could if we were single basin player.

Landing zone is a real point of experimentation in the Meramec. In the early wells for Cimarex and for many of our competitors, it was quite frankly, a monkey see, monkey do approach. The Meramec wasn't the most obvious reservoir. And so early wells were kind of targeted based on mimicking what offset wells have done. And as we've continued to delineate the play, Cimarex and the industry has tested different landing zones. We're testing 2 different landing zones and that Meramec stack staggered pilot, and we continue to experiment with landing zones throughout the play. We're seeing landing zones to be a overprint on production, that's greater than we initially anticipated. There are scenarios at play that have underperformed that we're going back in now and testing new landing zones, the new completion techniques and we're quite encouraged by the potential there. But it's a real open part of experimentation as to where the landings laterals. John, you want to add to that?"

And I must tell you, I feel pretty good about how we've done this for this particular stack staggered pilot in regards to the data we received from the pilot would really helped us pinpoint exactly where we want to put these letters whereas before, Tom's absolutely right, we would have looked just say, 2 sections over and see what the company X, Y, Z do as far as what he landed it. I think we're recognizing that for the Meramec. I mean, every section might have just a slight different tweak to where you want to put that lateral to achieve maximum performance. And that some of the lessons we're learning as we go forward. So I'm very excited about the stack staggered pilot, I'm looking forward to when we finally get around and completing it. But as I mentioned, we do have our strong interest in the other operated pilot that is just flowing back now and there was a lot of signs associated with that pilot, and we're very anxious to kind of see the flowback, review the signs data.

It's about our confidence in the price file and that the markets are in balance and that we think that it's a fairly low volatile proposition. So I think our bias is going to be to invest, use our balance sheet and yes, we'd be willing to modestly outspend cash flow. Mark, you want to add to that?"

Whereas we're in year 2 at Meramec, and I just think we scratched the surface, there's just so much that we are learning with each well both us and our competitors. And in some way, yes, it is happening at a far more accelerated pace than Culberson ever did because we're the only game in town when we're doing Culberson. Here, as you well are all aware, we have at least 5 other operators drilling all around us and we're all looking to achieve trying to figure out what works best, where should I go, where do I land. And so clearly, it's at a much more accelerated pace. But sometimes I wonder, maybe too fast, honestly. You never really get a chance to really catch a breath and look at the data and look at the results, not just that 30-day rate, as I mentioned, but with this [indiscernible] doing 180 days later, and it is surprising.

In other cases, quite frankly, we've reached the point, we said we're just go ahead and drill and create that information by drilling a pilot hole. I would also tell you in some ways, we're putting even more renewed emphasis on our 3D seismic coverage, because at least with 3D seismic, you're sampling the geology, so to speak, in a much finer scale. So we're really trying to incorporate that as a tool to help us along with the subsurface control and the horizontal wells that's been drilled to date to build a more comprehensive model what's going on and what we should expect going forward. I would just tell you that again, right now, we have expectations for every Meramec well we drill on each one, in some ways, typically surprises us.

We sincerely appreciate your interest and look forward to your questions during the question-and-answer portion of the call. 
On the call today, John will walk us through our recent results and describe our progress on some of the delineation projects we have underway. Joe will follow John with an operational overview, including some of the significant steps we have taken to improve field efficiencies.
As we've described in past calls, owing to timing of our delineation projects, many of the significant results from our 2016 delineation program will come in fits and starts this year. Rest assured, our organization is hard at work during this downturn. Necessity is the mother of invention.
I'd like open the call with some brief overview remarks regarding our direction in 2016 and beyond. As always, our focus will be on results. We reported a strong production beat this quarter, driven by improved well performance. Our total company production came in at 973 million cubic feet equivalent per day for the first quarter, which exceeded the high end of our guidance. Expenses came in within guidance, resulting in a strong quarter overall. 
Gas production was up, while oil production was down slightly. As we had forecasted, this was due to fewer well completions in the Permian basin due to the timing of our delineation projects. We expect to pick up the pace in our Permian completions during the remainder of the year.
We also reported a modest increase in our 2016 capital budget. This is the result of the completions of our East Cana-Woodford infill program being pushed forward from 2017 into 2016; the application is bigger, more effective stimulations across the board; and greater-than-anticipated working interest in both our own wells and in partner-operated wells. With the results that we're seeing, we're delighted to have the increased exposure.
Since our last call, we've seen a bit of breathing room in commodity prices. As a result, were accelerating some of the Permian completion activity that was delayed due to the planned outages this winter. 
As you'll also hear during the call, our focus on science and innovation continues apace. We continue to experiment with more effective stimulations, primarily to the use of more proppant, more stages, tighter cluster spacing and more clusters per stage and the use of diverter technology. This down cycle and associated decrease in activity is providing an ideal environment to focus on science and technology. We're also taking advance of decreased service cost to experiment and improve our methodologies.
We've also made great strides in reducing our cost structure. The organization's undergoing a concerted effort to lower G&A through voluntary retirements that lead to headcount reductions, reducing contracted consultant services and optimizing work efficiencies, particularly in the field.
Finally, before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to comment on our thoughts as we look ahead. In 2015, we said that our challenge was to get our program to a point where it was sustainable, where we were living within cash flow and had a capital program and a cost structure that was appropriate for the new normal. In our last call, we told you that our challenge in 2016 was to preserve our assets, preserve our balance sheet and preserve organization. I am pleased to tell you that we are on track with both sets of goals. 
As we look ahead at the current strip, we model a Cimarex that lives within cash flow and is able to get back on a growth trajectory in the years ahead. We have best-in-class assets, and we will be able to preserve our prime leasehold in our current program. Our organization is effective, focused and hard at work generating new opportunities. Our balance sheet provides the flexibility and strength that will keep Cimarex at the forefront in a highly competitive landscape.
We don't know where commodity prices are headed, but we don't expect to return to the price levels of 2014 any time soon. Margins will be challenged, cost structures will be paramount and asset quality and organizational effectiveness will be the differentiator. It's always been a tough business, and things won't be any easier as we move ahead. Our focus is on performance and results. Although further price recovery would be warmly welcomed, we are in great shape and look ahead with conviction that our value creation proposition is alive and well.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John to provide further color on our program."

I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our 2016 plans. Cimarex invested $158 million on exploration and development during the",1077,"Thanks, Tom. I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our 2016 plans. 
Cimarex invested $158 million on exploration and development during the first quarter. About 55% was invested in the Permian region, with the rest going toward activities in Mid-Continent region. Company-wide, we brought 22 gross, 5 net, wells on production during the first quarter. 
Despite the small number of wells completed during the quarter, Cimarex had an average of 10 operated rigs running during the quarter. These rigs were busy finishing the drilling of infill wells in the Woodford Shale, as well as drilling spacing pilots in both the Delaware basin and the Mid-Continent. That activity is winding down and majority of our contracted drilling rates will be rolling off by July. By August, we plan to be down to 3 operated rigs. 
In the Delaware basin, you may recall that we spudded downspacing pilot in the upper Wolfcamp in Culberson County in the fourth quarter 2015. We are finished with the drilling portion of these wells and completions are scheduled to begin in mid-May. First production is now expected by midyear. This 6-well, 7,500 foot lateral pilot will test 2 different spacing designs, one at 8 wells per section, while the other will test 6 wells per section, both will be drilled in a staggered pattern.
Cimarex continues to push the envelope on well completions. On Page 12 of our presentation, we've shown you the uplift using a 40% larger completion on these upper Wolfcamp wells, which equates to 1,640 pounds of sand per foot. We're about to take that a step further on using even larger design to complete this 6-well pilot. Incorporating 2,500 pounds of sand per lateral foot, these pilot wells will have 44% more sand pumped than the largest completed wells we've had to date, as shown on Page 12.
We are currently drilling also our lower Wolfcamp infill project, which we call Tim Tam. This 10,000-foot spacing pilot is comprised of 5 wells, which will be drilled in a stacked/staggered pattern, testing 6 wells per section. We believe the success we've had with larger completions in the upper Wolfcamp should easily translate to that lower Wolfcamp. By way of example, Page 13 in our presentation illustrates the uplift we've seen with a larger completion on a 10,000-foot upper Wolfcamp well. 
We have also just finished operations on our largest lower Wolfcamp completion to date, a well we call the Flying Ebony, where we pumped 2,400 pounds of sand per foot. The production data from this well, along with the larger completions we are doing with the upper Wolfcamp, will provide us critical data for design of future completions, including the Tim Tam wells, which are scheduled to be completed in the second half of 2016.
For the remainder of 2016, the vast majority of the capital that we will spend in the Permian will be earmarked for acreage obligations across our Wolfcamp position in both Culberson and Reeves County. The total capital ascribed to acreage holding in the Delaware basin is just over $200 million in 2016. Part of this obligation drilling will include 6 2 mile-long infill wells in Reeves County, which recently commenced drilling. Similar to our Anaconda pilot, these wells will be drilled using a stacked/staggered pattern, resulting in equivalent of 12 wells per section. Once drilling is completed on this section, we will be down to 2 operating rigs in the Permian for the remainder of the year.
Now on to the Mid-Continent. You will recall that we began drilling the latest Woodford development project on the east side of the Cana core in the fourth quarter of 2015. This development covers 6 sections, of which Cimarex operates 2 sections. Due to some last-minute changes in working interest, this infill project now consists of 47 gross, 22 net, wells. Drilling is nearly finished, and completion of these wells have been moved up, and is now scheduled for early October versus the first quarter 2017. This change in scheduling was a contributing factor in our $50 million increase in capital expenditures for 2016.
In our emerging Meramec play, we now have production data on 18 operated 5,000-foot laterals. Also, our third 10,000-foot wells in the Meramec has been in production since early January. Located in Blaine County, this well called the Dakota Carol 1H-2722X, had a 30-day peak IP rate of 10.8 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 951 barrels of oil per day. That results in a condensate yield of around 278 barrels per million. 
Page 21 of the presentation illustrates the average uplift we've seen from the 3 long laterals in the Meramec versus the 5,000-foot laterals drilled to date. They have outperformed the shorter laterals by 62%, with an up by 120 days. While we are very encouraged by the initial uplift in IP that we are seeing in these 10,000-foot laterals, we continue to carefully monitor the decline profile in order to determine the ultimate EURs for these long laterals.
To better understand the multizone potential for this area, we have designed a downspacing pilot, which commenced drilling in the fourth quarter 2015, and has just finished the drilling phase. See Slide 22 for an illustration of the design. The 8 new wells will be stacked and staggered in both the Meramec at Woodford formations. The spacing in the Meramec would be the equivalent on a 10 wells per section, made up of 5 upper and 5 lower staggered Meramec wells. The Woodford will be drilled with our standard 9 wells per section development plan. 
Another Meramec spacing pilot operated by our partner, Devon, was recently completed and is in the early stages of flowback. The results from this 5 wells per section pilot will strongly influence our completion plans for the stacked/staggered pilot. 
Once drilling is finished on infill sections, we'll be focused on holding our Meramec acreage. As you know, in late 2014, we added 12,250 net acres in the Meramec at an average cost of $1,650 per acre. About $70 million of our capital is being invested in holding Meramec acreage in 2016. We currently have 4 rigs operating in the Cana [ph] region, with plans to be down to 1 operated rig by July of this year.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi."

I'll hit on the usual items: Our first quarter production, our Q2 and full year 2016 production outlook and then I'll follow-up with a few comments on LOE and service cost. As To",1462,"Well, thank you, John, and thank you all for joining us on our call today. I'll hit on the usual items: Our first quarter production, our Q2 and full year 2016 production outlook and then I'll follow-up with a few comments on LOE and service cost. 
As Tom mentioned, with the help of stronger-than-expected base property and new well performance, our first quarter volumes came in slightly better than anticipated. Our reported total company net equivalent production of 973 million a day beat our guidance projection at 925 million to 955 million a day, and was up 3% from the 947 million a day that we posted in Q1 '15. As expected, facility disruptions and processing constraints in the Permian did negatively impact our Q1 production to the tune of approximately 30 million a day.
Our first quarter equivalent Permian production came in at 477 million a day, down 43 million a day from Q4 '15. The decrease was expected and came as primarily a result of the facility downtime I just mentioned, as well as us completing 3 net Permian wells in Q1 as compared to 8 wells in the fourth quarter of '15.
With our Cana-Woodford wells coming online in late Q4, we did anticipate a nice Mid-Continent post gain during Q1, and we saw just that. With the wells exceeding our plan expectations, our Mid-Content volumes came in 493 million a day, that's up 7% from the 461 million a day we reported in the fourth quarter and 11% from the 444 million a day that we posted a year ago in Q1 '15.
As we look forward into the remainder of this year, we've made a few changes to our completion schedule, including the addition of a frac crew in the Permian to help catch up on deferred completions from the downstream disruptions in Q1, and by advancing, as John mentioned, the timing of our Cana to drilled completions to October this year.
With our stronger-than-expected Q1 results and these completion timing adjustments, we've increased our full year total company equivalent production guidance to 940 million to 970 million a day, up about, in midpoint basis, 45 million a day, from our beginning-year guidance of 890 million to 930 million. 
As compared to the original guidance, the acceleration of our Cana infill project resulted in a significant decrease in the number of drilled but uncompleted wells on our books at the end of the year. Our current model now projects 32 gross and 9 net Mid-Continent wells waiting on completion at year end. That compares to the 57 gross and 24 net wells that we anticipated we'd have awaiting completion earlier this year, when we issued our beginning-year guidance. 
The acceleration not only boosts our 2016 total company guidance, but it increases our projected 2016 exit rate as well. With our new modeling, we now project our total company fourth quarter exit rate this year to be right in line with that of the 986 million a day that we posted back in the fourth quarter of '15.
In the Permian, the Q1 facility downtime and processing constraints resulted in us deferring absolutely 3 net completions into the latter part of this year. With the processing constraints anticipated to now be behind us, our plans are to add a second completion crew to help catch up and. That will be here in May and end early June. And with the projected 2 rigs working the latter part of the year as John mentioned, we're still forecasting approximately 50 gross and 30 net Permian wells to come online in 2016. That's flat with our previous estimates, but we just really accelerated the pace here into Q2 and Q3. So as a result, our protected number of Permian drilled and uncompleted wells will, in essence, drop fairly quickly here: From 34 gross to -- and 21 net wells here in May to 10 gross and 9 net on the books by year-end.
For Q2 '16, our projected guidance of 935 million to 965 million a day reflects a drop in production from Q1 '16 levels, primarily as we await the scheduled Permian and Cana completion activity, which is planned for Q3 and Q4. And to help you -- provide you with some clarity on projected completion timing through the year, we completed 5 net wells in Q1. We're forecasting approximately 13 net wells to be completed in Q2, with approximately 44 net wells projected to come online in Q3 and Q4. So you can see that this is in the latter quarters as far as our completion activity is concerned.
Shifting gears to OpEx. Our production group continued to make great strides during Q1 to further reduce our operating cost. Through their efforts, we realized additional and sizable cost reductions in items, such as saltwater disposal, compression, rentals and contract labor. As a result, our Q1 '16 lifting cost came in at $0.80 per Mcfe, that was at the low end of our guidance, which was $0.80 to $0.90 per Mcfe, down 6.3% from our fourth quarter average of $0.85 and down 17% from the $0.96 we posted for the average in the first quarter of '15.
With our cost control efforts, we're projecting our 2016 lifting cost to continue to fall in the range of $0.80 to $0.90. I'd say we'll most likely be in the lower end of that range as we finish up the year. We're extremely proud of the efforts that our ops team has put forth to reduce our cost structure, all the while maintaining safe and efficient operations. 
Tom touched on this, not only is doing so, so critical for us to be able to compete in this low product price environment, but our reduced OpEx is also freeing up capital for our drilling program, making us a more efficient operator. 
Since prices began falling back in 2014, on an absolute basis, we've seen our total company monthly net operating expense drop about $5 million per month, which annualized, equates to an additional $60 million that we can direct to our drilling program.
And finally, a few comments on drilling and completion cost. Although most drilling cost components remained somewhat in check during Q1, we were able to realize some modest reductions in service cost on the completion side primarily in the Permian. On the drilling side, we're keeping our focus on efficiencies, as seen with our Q1 average Wolfcamp spread to rig release drill time now down to 28 days as compared to 35 days in 2014.
On the completion side, in addition to the modest service cost reductions I mentioned, mostly in the Permian, we placed a strong emphasis on reducing a lot of sourcing cost by challenging our team in their planning, engineering and operating efficiencies in that regard. The results of our efforts are just now beginning to make their way into our total well cost.
As we continue to push the limit on our frac design and size, our completion cost will continue to dominate our total well cost, while we experiment with larger frac designs many of our generic well AFEs still have stayed somewhat in check. An exception is the Wolfcamp, where both our drilling and completion efficiencies have reduced our generic 2-mile lateral Culberson and lower Wolfcamp AFE to a range of $10.2 million to $11.2 million, that's down 5% from the $10.8 million to $11.6 million range that we quoted last fall, and down 22% from where we were in late 2014. 
With last quarter's frac design, our Cana core 1-mile lateral wells continue to run in the range of $6.6 million to $7 million, unchanged from the last call and down 16% to 17% from 2014. But with the larger frac designs that we're contemplating to be utilized here in Q3 '16, this range is likely to increase anywhere in the range of $500,000 to $600,000 per well. 
And in the Meramec, our current 1-mile lateral AFE is still in the range of $7 million to $7.4 million. Again, that is unchanged from last call and down 13% from late '14. And also here, if we employ larger fracs moving forward, we could see an additional $500,000 to $600,000 in these AFEs as well.
So in closing, we had another great quarter. We beat guidance despite a sizable downstream and weather disruptions. We've made significant strides further reducing our LOE. Our drilling and completion group remains focused on cost efficiencies -- reductions and efficiencies and optimizing the results of our fracs. Our teams are tightly focused on maximizing the productivity and profitability of our wells. All the while, we're optimizing our investment program results.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Q&A."

We have 3 wells now with this current design, which I talked about earlier, at the 1,640 pounds per foot. And those wells have been on long enough now that what's really impressing us is the, quite frankly, lack of decline. These wells come on and they tend to have a very long, flat period to them. And we have enough time with those now that we gain confidence in that type curve, and that's led to a major change in our expectation for these wells going forward. I should also point out that as Joe mentioned, we actually have, also in addition to that, seen some cost reduction in those wells.

And so it's fair to say that some of the wells come in much better than expected and some come in less. We're still learning a lot in regards to these wells and there's still a lot that we think we can change or improve upon to make these wells even better. So yes, there's some variability there, especially, I would point out, yes, with our 10,000-foot lateral we just announced. It's also -- well, I want to point out that we anticipated having a much higher yield than our previous 2 10,000-foot laterals. And so in that case, we did not flow it back as aggressively from a choke management standpoint. We were interested -- and with this one particular, in seeing with choke management, how we can manage that yield. So for that well in particular, I don't know that the 30-day rate well -- 30-day rate is as important to us as, say, the 90- or 180-day rate in terms of the way we're flowing that well back."

And let me be also clear, we're not sure that we've really even reached even close to the end number in terms of these frac uplifts. So that's why, for the Upper Wolfcamp spacing pilot, even though we don't have a well under our belt, we're very comfortable stepping up in the total amount of sand that we're going to pump in those wells. Because the way we model it, with a modest increase in IP and EUR, it's a very economic thing to do. So we're very pleased with the progress we're seeing here.

But one of the things I want to follow up on is -- one of the things that makes Cimarex strong is our presence in multiple plays, and in particular, with our footprint in the Delaware Basin and our footprint in STACK, we're doing a lot of innovation, as are our competitors. And every time we see something that works, we look for opportunities to apply it elsewhere in our portfolio. So having that footprint in multiple plays allows us to really bring innovations in much more quickly than we could if we were a single-basin player. So there are -- as John said, we have a lot of running room in completion optimization in both the Wolfcamp A, the Wolfcamp D and I would add, in STACK, both in the Meramec and Woodford. All of those plays are trying some things in that laboratory, gives us ideas to apply across the board. I don't know that we're even scratching the surface yet in a lot of areas.

Landing zone is a real point of experimentation in the Meramec. In the early wells for Cimarex and for many of our competitors, it was quite frankly, a monkey see, monkey do approach. The Meramec wasn't the most obvious reservoir. And so early wells were kind of targeted based on mimicking what offset wells had done. And as we've continued to delineate the play, Cimarex and the industry has tested different landing zones. We're testing 2 different landing zones in that Meramec stacked/staggered pilot, and we continue to experiment with landing zones throughout the play. We're seeing landing zone to be a overprint on production that's greater than we initially anticipated. There are some areas of the play that have underperformed that we're going back in now and you're testing new landing zones, new completion techniques, and we're quite encouraged by the potential there. But it's a real open part of experimentation as to where to land these laterals. John, you want to add to that?"

And I must tell you, I feel pretty good about how we've done this for this particular stacked/staggered pilot in regards to the data we received from that pilot what really helped us pinpoint exactly where we want to put these letters. Whereas before, Tom's absolutely right, we would have looked just say, 2 sections over, and see what did company X, Y, Z do as far as where they landed it. I think we're recognizing that for the Meramec, I mean, every section might have just a slight different tweak to where you want to put that lateral to achieve maximum performance. And that's some of the lessons we're learning as we go forward. So I'm very excited about the stacked/staggered pilot, and I'm looking forward to when we finally get around to completing it. But as I mentioned, we do have a strong interest in the other operated pilot that is just flowing back now. And there was a lot of science associated with that pilot, and we're very anxious to kind of see the flowback, review the science data. And that's why we're not in any rush to go out and frac our current stacked/staggered till we see some of those results and see how we might then tailor our fracture design for the -- for our pilot."

If we get to a point to where we gain confidence about that future commodity pricing, if we think that the markets have kind of worked themselves out and they're in balance -- and we get asked about at what price file? It's not about the price file. We have the opportunities today at this price file to accelerate and add value. It's about our confidence in that price file and that the markets are in balance and that we think that it's a fairly low-volatile proposition. So I think our bias is going to be to invest, use our balance sheet. And yes, we'd be willing to modestly outspend cash flow. Mark, you want to add to that?"

We have a luxury of top tier assets and outstanding returns in this current price environment, so we're going to be ready to roll.

Whereas we're in year 2 at Meramec, and I just think we scratched the surface. There's just so much that we are learning with each well, both us and our competitors. And in some way, yes, it is happening at a far more accelerated pace than Culberson ever did because we were the only game in town when we were doing Culberson. Here, as you well are aware, we have at least 5 other operators drilling all around us, and we're all looking at each other trying to figure out what works best, where should I go? Where do I land? And so clearly, it's at a much more accelerated pace. But sometimes I wonder, maybe too fast, honestly, that you never really get a chance to really catch your breath and look at the data and look at the results. Not just that 30-day rate, as I mentioned, but what is the well doing 180 days later? And is it surprising you?

In other cases, quite frankly, we've reached the point we said we're just got to go ahead and drill and create that information by drilling a pilot hole. I would also tell you, in some ways, we're putting even more renewed emphasis on our 3D seismic coverage. Because at least with 3D seismic, you are sampling the geology, so to speak, in a much finer scale. So we're really, really trying to incorporate that as a tool to help us, along with the subsurface control and the horizontal wells that have been drilled to date, to build a more comprehensive model of what's going on and what we should expect going forward. I would just tell you that again, right now, we have expectations for every Meramec well we drill.

We ask ourselves at every turn, ""What's our competitive advantage?"" If we don't have a competitive advantage, and that's generally either information, science or ability to execute well above and beyond our competitors, then we're just bidding discount rate and commodity price forecast with a group of very well-funded competitors.

We sincerely appreciate your interest and look forward to your questions during the question-and-answer portion of the call. 
On the call today, John will walk us through our recent results and describe our progress on some of the delineation projects we have under way. Joe will follow John with an operational overview, including some of the significant steps we have taken to improve field efficiencies.
As we've described in past calls, owing to the timing of our delineation projects, many of the significant results from our 2016 delineation program will come in fits and starts this year. Rest assured, our organization is hard at work during this downturn. Necessity is the mother of invention.
I'd like open the call with some brief overview remarks regarding our direction in 2016 and beyond. As always, our focus will be on results. We reported a strong production beat this quarter, driven by improved well performance. Our total company production came in at 973 million cubic feet equivalent per day for the first quarter, which exceeded the high end of our guidance. Expenses came in within guidance, resulting in a strong quarter overall. 
Gas production was up, while oil production was down slightly. As we had forecasted, this was due to fewer well completions in the Permian basin due to the timing of our delineation projects. We expect to pick up the pace in our Permian completions during the remainder of the year.
We also reported a modest increase in our 2016 capital budget. This is the result of the completions of our East Cana-Woodford infill program being pushed forward from 2017 into 2016; the application of bigger, more effective stimulations across the board; and greater-than-anticipated working interest in both our own wells and in partner-operated wells. With the results that we're seeing, we're delighted to have the increased exposure.
Since our last call, we've seen a bit of breathing room in commodity prices. As a result, we’re accelerating some of the Permian completion activity that was delayed due to the planned outages this winter. 
As you'll also hear during the call, our focus on science and innovation continues apace. We continue to experiment with more effective stimulations, primarily through the use of more proppant, more stages, tighter cluster spacing and more clusters per stage and the use of diverter technology. This down cycle and associated decrease in activity is providing an ideal environment to focus on science and technology. We're also taking advantage of decreased service cost to experiment and improve our methodologies.
We've also made great strides in reducing our cost structure. The organization's undergoing a concerted effort to lower G&A through voluntary retirements that lead to headcount reductions, reducing contracted consultant services and optimizing work efficiencies, particularly in the field.
Finally, before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to comment on our thoughts as we look ahead. In 2015, we said that our challenge was to get our program to a point where it was sustainable, where we were living within cash flow and had a capital program and a cost structure that was appropriate for the new normal. In our last call, we told you that our challenge in 2016 was to preserve our assets, preserve our balance sheet and preserve our organization. I am pleased to tell you that we are on track with both sets of goals. 
As we look ahead at the current strip, we model a Cimarex that lives within cash flow and is able to get back on a growth trajectory in the years ahead. We have best-in-class assets, and we will be able to preserve our prime leasehold with our current program. Our organization is effective, focused and hard at work generating new opportunities. Our balance sheet provides the flexibility and strength that will keep Cimarex at the forefront in a highly competitive landscape.
We don't know where commodity prices are headed, but we don't expect a return to the price levels of 2014 any time soon. Margins will be challenged, cost structures will be paramount and asset quality and organizational effectiveness will be the differentiator. It's always been a tough business, and things won't be any easier as we move ahead. Our focus is on performance and results. Although further price recovery would be warmly welcomed, we are in great shape and look ahead with conviction that our value creation proposition is alive and well.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John to provide further color on our program."

I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our 2016 plans. Cimarex invested $158 million on exploration and development during the",1076,"Thanks, Tom. I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our 2016 plans. 
Cimarex invested $158 million on exploration and development during the first quarter. About 55% was invested in the Permian region, with the rest going toward activities in Mid-Continent region. Company-wide, we brought 22 gross, 5 net, wells on production during the first quarter. 
Despite the small number of wells completed during the quarter, Cimarex had an average of 10 operated rigs running during the quarter. These rigs were busy finishing the drilling of infill wells in the Woodford Shale, as well as drilling spacing pilots in both the Delaware basin and the Mid-Continent. That activity is winding down and majority of our contracted drilling rates will be rolling off by July. By August, we plan to be down to 3 operated rigs. 
In the Delaware basin, you may recall that we spudded downspacing pilot in the upper Wolfcamp in Culberson County in the fourth quarter 2015. We are finished with the drilling portion of these wells, and completions are scheduled to begin in mid-May. First production is now expected by midyear. This 6-well, 7,500-foot lateral pilot will test 2 different spacing designs, one at 8 wells per section, while the other will test 6 wells per section. Both will be drilled in a staggered pattern.
Cimarex continues to push the envelope on well completions. On Page 12 of our presentation, we've shown you the uplift using a 40% larger completion on these upper Wolfcamp wells, which equates to 1,640 pounds of sand per foot. We're about to take that a step further on using even larger design to complete this 6-well pilot. Incorporating 2,500 pounds of sand per lateral foot, these pilot wells will have 44% more sand pumped than the largest completed wells we've had to date, as shown on Page 12.
We are currently drilling also our lower Wolfcamp infill project, which we call Tim Tam. This 10,000-foot spacing pilot is comprised of 5 wells, which will be drilled in a stacked/staggered pattern, testing 6 wells per section. We believe the success we've had with larger completions in the upper Wolfcamp should easily translate to the lower Wolfcamp. By way of example, Page 13 in our presentation illustrates the uplift we've seen with a larger completion on a 10,000-foot upper Wolfcamp well. 
We have also just finished operations on our largest lower Wolfcamp completion to date, a well we call the Flying Ebony, where we pumped 2,400 pounds of sand per foot. The production data from this well, along with the larger completions we are doing with the upper Wolfcamp, will provide us critical data for design of future completions, including the Tim Tam wells, which are scheduled to be completed in the second half of 2016.
For the remainder of 2016, the vast majority of the capital that we will spend in the Permian will be earmarked for acreage obligations across our Wolfcamp position in both Culberson and Reeves County. The total capital ascribed to acreage holding in the Delaware basin is just over $200 million in 2016. Part of this obligation drilling will include 6 2 mile-long infill wells in Reeves County, which recently commenced drilling. Similar to our Anaconda pilot, these wells will be drilled using a stacked/staggered pattern, resulting in equivalent of 12 wells per section. Once drilling is completed on this section, we will be down to 2 operating rigs in the Permian for the remainder of the year.
Now on to the Mid-Continent. You will recall that we began drilling the latest Woodford development project on the east side of the Cana core in the fourth quarter of 2015. This development covers 6 sections, of which Cimarex operates 2 sections. Due to some last-minute changes in working interest, this infill project now consists of 47 gross, 22 net, wells. Drilling is nearly finished, and completion of these wells has been moved up, and is now scheduled for early October versus the first quarter 2017. This change in scheduling was a contributing factor in our $50 million increase in capital expenditures for 2016.
In our emerging Meramec play, we now have production data on 18 operated 5,000-foot laterals. Also, our third 10,000-foot lateral in the Meramec has been on production since early January. Located in Blaine County, this well called the Dakota Carol 1H-2722X had a 30-day peak IP rate of 10.8 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 951 barrels of oil per day. That results in a condensate yield of around 278 barrels per million. 
Page 21 of the presentation illustrates the average uplift we've seen from the 3 long laterals in the Meramec versus the 5,000-foot laterals drilled to date. They have outperformed the shorter laterals by 62%, with an up by 120 days. While we are very encouraged by the initial uplift in IP that we are seeing in these 10,000-foot laterals, we continue to carefully monitor the decline profile in order to determine the ultimate EURs for these long laterals.
To better understand the multizone potential for this area, we have designed a downspacing pilot, which commenced drilling in the fourth quarter 2015, and has just finished the drilling phase. See Slide 22 for an illustration of the design. The 8 new wells will be stacked and staggered in both the Meramec and Woodford formations. The spacing in the Meramec would be the equivalent on a 10 wells per section, made up of 5 upper and 5 lower staggered Meramec wells. The Woodford will be drilled with our standard 9 wells per section development plan. 
Another Meramec spacing pilot operated by our partner, Devon, was recently completed and is in the early stages of flowback. The results from this 5 wells per section pilot will strongly influence our completion plans for the stacked/staggered pilot. 
Once drilling is finished on infill sections, we'll be focused on holding our Meramec acreage. As you know, in late 2014, we added 12,250 net acres in the Meramec at an average cost of $1,650 per acre. About $70 million of our capital is being invested in holding Meramec acreage in 2016. We currently have 4 rigs operating in the Cana [ph] region, with plans to be down to 1 operated rig by July of this year.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi."

I'll hit on the usual items: Our first quarter production, our Q2 and full year 2016 production outlook and then I'll follow up with a few comments on LOE and service cost. As To",1463,"Well, thank you, John, and thank you all for joining us on our call today. I'll hit on the usual items: Our first quarter production, our Q2 and full year 2016 production outlook and then I'll follow up with a few comments on LOE and service cost. 
As Tom mentioned, with the help of stronger-than-expected base property and new well performance, our first quarter volumes came in slightly better than anticipated. Our reported total company net equivalent production of 973 million a day beat our guidance projection of 925 million to 955 million a day, and was up 3% from the 947 million a day that we posted in Q1 '15. As expected, facility disruptions and processing constraints in the Permian did negatively impact our Q1 production to the tune of approximately 30 million a day.
Our first quarter equivalent Permian production came in at 477 million a day, down 43 million a day from Q4 '15. The decrease was expected and came as primarily a result of the facility downtime I just mentioned, as well as us completing 3 net Permian wells in Q1 as compared to 8 wells in the fourth quarter of '15.
With our Cana-Woodford wells coming online in late Q4, we did anticipate a nice Mid-Continent posting during Q1, and we saw just that. With the wells exceeding our plan expectations, our Mid-Content volumes came in at 493 million a day, that's up 7% from the 461 million a day we reported in the fourth quarter and 11% from the 444 million a day that we posted a year ago in Q1 '15.
As we look forward into the remainder of this year, we've made a few changes to our completion schedule, including the addition of a frac crew in the Permian to help catch up on deferred completions from the downstream disruptions in Q1, and by advancing, as John mentioned, the timing of our Cana to drilled completions to October this year.
With our stronger-than-expected Q1 results and these completion timing adjustments, we've increased our full year total company equivalent production guidance to 940 million to 970 million a day, up about, in midpoint basis, 45 million a day, from our beginning-year guidance of 890 million to 930 million. 
As compared to the original guidance, the acceleration of our Cana infill project resulted in a significant decrease in the number of drilled but uncompleted wells on our books at the end of the year. Our current model now projects 32 gross and 9 net Mid-Continent wells waiting on completion at year end. That compares to the 57 gross and 24 net wells that we anticipated we'd have awaiting completion earlier this year, when we issued our beginning-year guidance. 
The acceleration not only boosts our 2016 total company guidance, but it increases our projected 2016 exit rate as well. With our new modeling, we now project our total company fourth quarter exit rate this year to be right in line with that of the 986 million a day that we posted back in the fourth quarter of '15.
In the Permian, the Q1 facility downtime and processing constraints resulted in us deferring approximately 3 net completions into the latter part of this year. With the processing constraints anticipated to now be behind us, our plans are to add a second completion crew to help catch up and. That will be here in May and into early June. And with the projected 2 rigs working the latter part of the year, as John mentioned, we're still forecasting approximately 50 gross and 30 net Permian wells to come online in 2016. That's flat with our previous estimates, but we just really accelerated the pace here into Q2 and Q3. So as a result, our protected number of Permian drilled and uncompleted wells will, in essence, drop fairly quickly here: From 34 gross to -- and 21 net wells here in May to 10 gross and 9 net on the books by year-end.
For Q2 '16, our projected guidance of 935 million to 965 million a day reflects a drop in production from Q1 '16 levels, primarily as we await the scheduled Permian and Cana completion activity, which is planned for Q3 and Q4. And to help you -- provide you with some clarity on projected completion timing through the year, we completed 5 net wells in Q1. We're forecasting approximately 13 net wells to be completed in Q2, with approximately 44 net wells projected to come online in Q3 and Q4. So you can see that this is in the latter quarters as far as our completion activity is concerned.
Shifting gears to OpEx. Our production group continued to make great strides during Q1 to further reduce our operating cost. Through their efforts, we realized additional and sizable cost reductions in items, such as saltwater disposal, compression, rentals and contract labor. As a result, our Q1 '16 lifting cost came in at $0.80 per Mcfe. That was at the low end of our guidance, which was $0.80 to $0.90 per Mcfe, down 6.3% from our fourth quarter average of $0.85 and down 17% from the $0.96 we posted for the average in the first quarter of '15.
With our cost control efforts, we're projecting our 2016 lifting cost to continue to fall in the range of $0.80 to $0.90. I'd say we'll most likely be in the lower end of that range as we finish off the year. We're extremely proud of the efforts that our ops team has put forth to reduce our cost structure, all the while maintaining safe and efficient operations. 
Tom touched on this, not only is doing so, so critical for us to be able to compete in this low product price environment, but our reduced OpEx is also freeing up capital for our drilling program, making us a more efficient operator. 
Since prices began falling back in 2014, on an absolute basis, we've seen our total company monthly net operating expense drop about $5 million per month, which annualized equates to an additional $60 million that we can direct to our drilling program.
And finally, a few comments on drilling and completion cost. Although most drilling cost components remained somewhat in check during Q1, we were able to realize some modest reductions in service cost on the completion side primarily in the Permian. On the drilling side, we're keeping our focus on efficiencies, as seen with our Q1 average Wolfcamp spread to rig release drill time now down to 28 days as compared to 35 days in 2014.
On the completion side, in addition to the modest service cost reductions I mentioned, mostly in the Permian, we placed a strong emphasis on reducing a lot of sourcing cost by challenging our team in their planning, engineering and operating efficiencies in that regard. The results of our efforts are just now beginning to make their way into our total well cost.
As we continue to push the limit on our frac design and size, our completion cost will continue to dominate our total well cost. While we experiment with larger frac designs many of our generic well AFEs still have stayed somewhat in check. An exception is the Wolfcamp, where both our drilling and completion efficiencies have reduced our generic 2-mile lateral Culberson and lower Wolfcamp AFE to a range of $10.2 million to $11.2 million, that's down 5% from the $10.8 million to $11.6 million range that we quoted last call, and down 22% from where we were in late 2014. 
With last quarter's frac designs, our Cana core 1-mile lateral wells continue to run in the range of $6.6 million to $7 million, unchanged from the last call and down 16% to 17% from 2014. But with the larger frac designs that we're contemplating to be utilized here in Q3 '16, this range is likely to increase anywhere in the range of $500,000 to $600,000 per well. 
And in the Meramec, our current 1-mile lateral AFE is still in the range of $7 million to $7.4 million. Again, that is unchanged from last call and down 13% from late '14. And also here, if we employ larger fracs moving forward, we could see an additional $500,000 to $600,000 in these AFEs as well.
So in closing, we had another great quarter. We beat guidance despite sizable downstream and weather disruptions. We've made significant strides further reducing our LOE. Our drilling and completion group remains focused on cost efficiencies -- reductions and efficiencies and optimizing the results of our fracs. And our teams are tightly focused on maximizing the productivity and profitability of our wells. All the while, we're optimizing our investment program results.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Q&A."

And those wells have been on long enough now that what's really impressing us is the, quite frankly, lack of decline. These wells come on and they tend to have a very long, flat period to them. And we have enough time with those now that we gain confidence in that type curve, and that's led to a major change in our expectation for these wells going forward. I should also point out, though, as Joe mentioned, we actually have, also in addition to that, seen some cost reduction in those wells.

We're still learning a lot in regards to these wells and there's still a lot that we think we can change or improve upon to make these wells even better. So yes, there's some variability there, especially, I would point out, yes, with our 10,000-foot lateral we just announced. It's also -- well, I want to point out that we anticipated having a much higher yield than our previous 2 10,000-foot laterals. And so in that case, we did not flow it back as aggressively from a choke management standpoint. We were interested -- and with this one particular, in seeing with choke management, how we can manage that yield.

And let me be also clear, we're not sure that we've really even reached even close to the end number in terms of these frac uplifts. So that's why, for the Upper Wolfcamp spacing pilot, even though we don't have a well under our belt, we're very comfortable stepping up in the total amount of sand that we're going to pump in those wells. Because the way we model it, with a modest increase in IP and EUR, it's a very economic thing to do. So we're very pleased with the progress we're seeing here.

But one of the things I wanted to follow up on is -- one of the things that makes Cimarex strong is our presence in multiple plays, and in particular, with our footprint in the Delaware Basin and our footprint with STACK, we're doing a lot of innovation, as are our competitors. And every time we see something that works, we look for opportunities to apply it elsewhere in our portfolio. So having that footprint in multiple plays allows us to really bring innovations in much more quickly than we could if we were a single-basin player. So there are -- as John said, we have a lot of running room in completion optimization in both the Wolfcamp A, the Wolfcamp D and I would add, in STACK, both in the Meramec and Woodford. All of those plays are trying some things in that laboratory, gives us ideas to apply across the board. I don't know that we're even scratching the surface yet in a lot of areas.

Landing zone is a real point of experimentation in the Meramec. In the early wells for Cimarex and for many of our competitors, it was quite frankly, a monkey see, monkey do approach. The Meramec wasn't the most obvious reservoir. And so early wells were kind of targeted based on mimicking what offset wells had done. And as we've continued to delineate the play, Cimarex and the industry has tested different landing zones. We're testing 2 different landing zones in that Meramec stacked/staggered pilot, and we continue to experiment with landing zones throughout the play. We're seeing landing zone to be a overprint on production that's greater than we initially anticipated. There are some areas of the play that have underperformed that we're going back in now and you're testing new landing zones, new completion techniques, and we're quite encouraged by the potential there. But it's a real open part of experimentation as to where to land these laterals. John, you want to add to that?"

And I must tell you, I feel pretty good about how we've done this for this particular stacked/staggered pilot in regards to the data we received from that pilot which really helped us pinpoint exactly where we want to put these laterals. Whereas before, Tom's absolutely right, we would have looked just say, 2 sections over, and see what did company X, Y, Z do as far as where they landed it. I think we're recognizing that for the Meramec, I mean, every section might have just a slight different tweak to where you want to put that lateral to achieve maximum performance. And that's some of the lessons we're learning as we go forward. So I'm very excited about the stacked/staggered pilot, and I'm looking forward to when we finally get around to completing it. But as I mentioned, we do have a strong interest in the other operated pilot that is just flowing back now. And there was a lot of science associated with that pilot, and we're very anxious to kind of see the flowback, review the science data. And that's why we're not in any rush to go out and frac our current stacked/staggered till we see some of those results and see how we might then tailor our fracture design for the -- for our pilot."

And we want to have an active program in both basins because what we learn is setting the stage for long-term capital allocation.

If we can borrow money at a low interest rate, invest it in a high interest rate, I think as long as we're confident in those returns, that's a value-creating proposition for our shareholder. And with our top tier assets, I think our bias as a management team is to bring that value forward for our shareholders. Now that said, when you drill a well, those returns are predicated on a discounted cash flow that's -- makes some significant assumptions about future commodity pricing. And the quality of that assumption is key. If we get to a point to where we gain confidence about that future commodity pricing, if we think that the markets have kind of worked themselves out and they're in balance -- and we get asked about at what price file? It's not about the price file. We have the opportunities today at this price file to accelerate and add value. It's about our confidence in that price file and that the markets are in balance and that we think that it's a fairly low-volatile proposition. So I think our bias is going to be to invest, use our balance sheet. And yes, we'd be willing to modestly outspend cash flow. Mark, you want to add to that?"

So we're at year 10 in Culberson. And I'm going to tell you right now, we still don't know everything about Wolfcamp and Culberson, they're obvious by our well results and what we continue to do. Whereas we're in year 2 of Meramec, and I just think we’ve scratched the surface. There's just so much that we are learning with each well, both us and our competitors. And in some way, yes, it is happening at a far more accelerated pace than Culberson ever did because we were the only game in town when we were doing Culberson. Here, as you well are aware, we have at least 5 other operators drilling all around us, and we're all looking at each other trying to figure out what works best, where should I go? Where do I land? And so clearly, it's at a much more accelerated pace. But sometimes I wonder, maybe too fast, honestly, that you never really get a chance to really catch your breath and look at the data and look at the results. Not just that 30-day rate, as I mentioned, but what is the well doing 180 days later? And is it surprising you? And so I -- there -- sometimes I wish we went a little bit slower, to be honest, in Meramec. But in some ways, we're being forced to, just with the competition.

In other cases, quite frankly, we've reached the point we said we've just got to go ahead and drill and create that information by drilling a pilot hole. I would also tell you, in some ways, we're putting even more renewed emphasis on our 3D seismic coverage. Because at least with 3D seismic, you are sampling the geology, so to speak, in a much finer scale. So we're really, really trying to incorporate that as a tool to help us, along with the subsurface control and the horizontal wells that have been drilled to date, to build a more comprehensive model of what's going on and what we should expect going forward. I would just tell you that again, right now, we have expectations for every Meramec well we drill.

We sincerely appreciate your interest and look forward to your questions during the question-and-answer portion of the call. 
On the call today, John will walk us through our recent results and describe our progress on some of the delineation projects we have under way. Joe will follow John with an operational overview, including some of the significant steps we have taken to improve field efficiencies.
As we've described in past calls, owing to the timing of our delineation projects, many of the significant results from our 2016 delineation program will come in fits and starts this year. Rest assured, our organization is hard at work during this downturn. Necessity is the mother of invention.
I'd like open the call with some brief overview remarks regarding our direction in 2016 and beyond. As always, our focus will be on results. We reported a strong production beat this quarter, driven by improved well performance. Our total company production came in at 973 million cubic feet equivalent per day for the first quarter, which exceeded the high end of our guidance. Expenses came in within guidance, resulting in a strong quarter overall. 
Gas production was up, while oil production was down slightly. As we had forecasted, this was due to fewer well completions in the Permian basin due to the timing of our delineation projects. We expect to pick up the pace in our Permian completions during the remainder of the year.
We also reported a modest increase in our 2016 capital budget. This is the result of the completions of our East Cana-Woodford infill program being pushed forward from 2017 into 2016; the application of bigger, more effective stimulations across the board; and greater-than-anticipated working interest in both our own wells and in partner-operated wells. With the results that we're seeing, we're delighted to have the increased exposure.
Since our last call, we've seen a bit of breathing room in commodity prices. As a result, we’re accelerating some of the Permian completion activity that was delayed due to the planned outages this winter. 
As you'll also hear during the call, our focus on science and innovation continues apace. We continue to experiment with more effective stimulations, primarily through the use of more proppant, more stages, tighter cluster spacing and more clusters per stage and the use of diverter technology. This down cycle and associated decrease in activity is providing an ideal environment to focus on science and technology. We're also taking advantage of decreased service cost to experiment and improve our methodologies.
We've also made great strides in reducing our cost structure. The organization's undergoing a concerted effort to lower G&A through voluntary retirements that lead to headcount reductions, reducing contracted consultant services and optimizing work efficiencies, particularly in the field.
Finally, before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to comment on our thoughts as we look ahead. In 2015, we said that our challenge was to get our program to a point where it was sustainable, where we were living within cash flow and had a capital program and a cost structure that was appropriate for the new normal. In our last call, we told you that our challenge in 2016 was to preserve our assets, preserve our balance sheet and preserve our organization. I am pleased to tell you that we are on track with both sets of goals. 
As we look ahead at the current strip, we model a Cimarex that lives within cash flow and is able to get back on a growth trajectory in the years ahead. We have best-in-class assets, and we will be able to preserve our prime leasehold with our current program. Our organization is effective, focused and hard at work generating new opportunities. Our balance sheet provides the flexibility and strength that will keep Cimarex at the forefront in a highly competitive landscape.
We don't know where commodity prices are headed, but we don't expect a return to the price levels of 2014 any time soon. Margins will be challenged, cost structures will be paramount and asset quality and organizational effectiveness will be the differentiator. It's always been a tough business, and things won't be any easier as we move ahead. Our focus is on performance and results. Although further price recovery would be warmly welcomed, we are in great shape and look ahead with conviction that our value creation proposition is alive and well.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John to provide further color on our program."

I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our 2016 plans.

I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our 2016 plans. 
Cimarex invested $158 million on exploration and development during the first quarter. About 55% was invested in the Permian region, with the rest going toward activities in Mid-Continent region. Company-wide, we brought 22 gross, 5 net, wells on production during the first quarter. 
Despite the small number of wells completed during the quarter, Cimarex had an average of 10 operated rigs running during the quarter. These rigs were busy finishing the drilling of infill wells in the Woodford Shale, as well as drilling spacing pilots in both the Delaware basin and the Mid-Continent. That activity is winding down and majority of our contracted drilling rates will be rolling off by July. By August, we plan to be down to 3 operated rigs. 
In the Delaware basin, you may recall that we spudded downspacing pilot in the upper Wolfcamp in Culberson County in the fourth quarter 2015. We are finished with the drilling portion of these wells, and completions are scheduled to begin in mid-May. First production is now expected by midyear. This 6-well, 7,500-foot lateral pilot will test 2 different spacing designs, one at 8 wells per section, while the other will test 6 wells per section. Both will be drilled in a staggered pattern.
Cimarex continues to push the envelope on well completions. On Page 12 of our presentation, we've shown you the uplift using a 40% larger completion on these upper Wolfcamp wells, which equates to 1,640 pounds of sand per foot. We're about to take that a step further on using even larger design to complete this 6-well pilot. Incorporating 2,500 pounds of sand per lateral foot, these pilot wells will have 44% more sand pumped than the largest completed wells we've had to date, as shown on Page 12.
We are currently drilling also our lower Wolfcamp infill project, which we call Tim Tam. This 10,000-foot spacing pilot is comprised of 5 wells, which will be drilled in a stacked/staggered pattern, testing 6 wells per section. We believe the success we've had with larger completions in the upper Wolfcamp should easily translate to the lower Wolfcamp. By way of example, Page 13 in our presentation illustrates the uplift we've seen with a larger completion on a 10,000-foot upper Wolfcamp well. 
We have also just finished operations on our largest lower Wolfcamp completion to date, a well we call the Flying Ebony, where we pumped 2,400 pounds of sand per foot. The production data from this well, along with the larger completions we are doing with the upper Wolfcamp, will provide us critical data for design of future completions, including the Tim Tam wells, which are scheduled to be completed in the second half of 2016.
For the remainder of 2016, the vast majority of the capital that we will spend in the Permian will be earmarked for acreage obligations across our Wolfcamp position in both Culberson and Reeves County. The total capital ascribed to acreage holding in the Delaware basin is just over $200 million in 2016. Part of this obligation drilling will include 6 2 mile-long infill wells in Reeves County, which recently commenced drilling. Similar to our Anaconda pilot, these wells will be drilled using a stacked/staggered pattern, resulting in equivalent of 12 wells per section. Once drilling is completed on this section, we will be down to 2 operating rigs in the Permian for the remainder of the year.
Now on to the Mid-Continent. You will recall that we began drilling the latest Woodford development project on the east side of the Cana core in the fourth quarter of 2015. This development covers 6 sections, of which Cimarex operates 2 sections. Due to some last-minute changes in working interest, this infill project now consists of 47 gross, 22 net, wells. Drilling is nearly finished, and completion of these wells has been moved up, and is now scheduled for early October versus the first quarter 2017. This change in scheduling was a contributing factor in our $50 million increase in capital expenditures for 2016.
In our emerging Meramec play, we now have production data on 18 operated 5,000-foot laterals. Also, our third 10,000-foot lateral in the Meramec has been on production since early January. Located in Blaine County, this well called the Dakota Carol 1H-2722X had a 30-day peak IP rate of 10.8 million cubic feet equivalent per day, including 951 barrels of oil per day. That results in a condensate yield of around 278 barrels per million. 
Page 21 of the presentation illustrates the average uplift we've seen from the 3 long laterals in the Meramec versus the 5,000-foot laterals drilled to date. They have outperformed the shorter laterals by 62%, with an up by 120 days. While we are very encouraged by the initial uplift in IP that we are seeing in these 10,000-foot laterals, we continue to carefully monitor the decline profile in order to determine the ultimate EURs for these long laterals.
To better understand the multizone potential for this area, we have designed a downspacing pilot, which commenced drilling in the fourth quarter 2015, and has just finished the drilling phase. See Slide 22 for an illustration of the design. The 8 new wells will be stacked and staggered in both the Meramec and Woodford formations. The spacing in the Meramec would be the equivalent on a 10 wells per section, made up of 5 upper and 5 lower staggered Meramec wells. The Woodford will be drilled with our standard 9 wells per section development plan. 
Another Meramec spacing pilot operated by our partner, Devon, was recently completed and is in the early stages of flowback. The results from this 5 wells per section pilot will strongly influence our completion plans for the stacked/staggered pilot. 
Once drilling is finished on infill sections, we'll be focused on holding our Meramec acreage. As you know, in late 2014, we added 12,250 net acres in the Meramec at an average cost of $1,650 per acre. About $70 million of our capital is being invested in holding Meramec acreage in 2016. We currently have 4 rigs operating in the Cana [ph] region, with plans to be down to 1 operated rig by July of this year.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi."

I'll hit on the usual items: Our first quarter production, our Q2 and full year 2016 production outlook and then I'll follow up with a few comments on LOE and service cost. As To",1463,"Well, thank you, John, and thank you all for joining us on our call today. I'll hit on the usual items: Our first quarter production, our Q2 and full year 2016 production outlook and then I'll follow up with a few comments on LOE and service cost. 
As Tom mentioned, with the help of stronger-than-expected base property and new well performance, our first quarter volumes came in slightly better than anticipated. Our reported total company net equivalent production of 973 million a day beat our guidance projection of 925 million to 955 million a day, and was up 3% from the 947 million a day that we posted in Q1 '15. As expected, facility disruptions and processing constraints in the Permian did negatively impact our Q1 production to the tune of approximately 30 million a day.
Our first quarter equivalent Permian production came in at 477 million a day, down 43 million a day from Q4 '15. The decrease was expected and came as primarily a result of the facility downtime I just mentioned, as well as us completing 3 net Permian wells in Q1 as compared to 8 wells in the fourth quarter of '15.
With our Cana-Woodford wells coming online in late Q4, we did anticipate a nice Mid-Continent posting during Q1, and we saw just that. With the wells exceeding our plan expectations, our Mid-Content volumes came in at 493 million a day, that's up 7% from the 461 million a day we reported in the fourth quarter and 11% from the 444 million a day that we posted a year ago in Q1 '15.
As we look forward into the remainder of this year, we've made a few changes to our completion schedule, including the addition of a frac crew in the Permian to help catch up on deferred completions from the downstream disruptions in Q1, and by advancing, as John mentioned, the timing of our Cana to drilled completions to October this year.
With our stronger-than-expected Q1 results and these completion timing adjustments, we've increased our full year total company equivalent production guidance to 940 million to 970 million a day, up about, in midpoint basis, 45 million a day, from our beginning-year guidance of 890 million to 930 million. 
As compared to the original guidance, the acceleration of our Cana infill project resulted in a significant decrease in the number of drilled but uncompleted wells on our books at the end of the year. Our current model now projects 32 gross and 9 net Mid-Continent wells waiting on completion at year end. That compares to the 57 gross and 24 net wells that we anticipated we'd have awaiting completion earlier this year, when we issued our beginning-year guidance. 
The acceleration not only boosts our 2016 total company guidance, but it increases our projected 2016 exit rate as well. With our new modeling, we now project our total company fourth quarter exit rate this year to be right in line with that of the 986 million a day that we posted back in the fourth quarter of '15.
In the Permian, the Q1 facility downtime and processing constraints resulted in us deferring approximately 3 net completions into the latter part of this year. With the processing constraints anticipated to now be behind us, our plans are to add a second completion crew to help catch up and. That will be here in May and into early June. And with the projected 2 rigs working the latter part of the year, as John mentioned, we're still forecasting approximately 50 gross and 30 net Permian wells to come online in 2016. That's flat with our previous estimates, but we just really accelerated the pace here into Q2 and Q3. So as a result, our protected number of Permian drilled and uncompleted wells will, in essence, drop fairly quickly here: From 34 gross to -- and 21 net wells here in May to 10 gross and 9 net on the books by year-end.
For Q2 '16, our projected guidance of 935 million to 965 million a day reflects a drop in production from Q1 '16 levels, primarily as we await the scheduled Permian and Cana completion activity, which is planned for Q3 and Q4. And to help you -- provide you with some clarity on projected completion timing through the year, we completed 5 net wells in Q1. We're forecasting approximately 13 net wells to be completed in Q2, with approximately 44 net wells projected to come online in Q3 and Q4. So you can see that this is in the latter quarters as far as our completion activity is concerned.
Shifting gears to OpEx. Our production group continued to make great strides during Q1 to further reduce our operating cost. Through their efforts, we realized additional and sizable cost reductions in items, such as saltwater disposal, compression, rentals and contract labor. As a result, our Q1 '16 lifting cost came in at $0.80 per Mcfe. That was at the low end of our guidance, which was $0.80 to $0.90 per Mcfe, down 6.3% from our fourth quarter average of $0.85 and down 17% from the $0.96 we posted for the average in the first quarter of '15.
With our cost control efforts, we're projecting our 2016 lifting cost to continue to fall in the range of $0.80 to $0.90. I'd say we'll most likely be in the lower end of that range as we finish off the year. We're extremely proud of the efforts that our ops team has put forth to reduce our cost structure, all the while maintaining safe and efficient operations. 
Tom touched on this, not only is doing so, so critical for us to be able to compete in this low product price environment, but our reduced OpEx is also freeing up capital for our drilling program, making us a more efficient operator. 
Since prices began falling back in 2014, on an absolute basis, we've seen our total company monthly net operating expense drop about $5 million per month, which annualized equates to an additional $60 million that we can direct to our drilling program.
And finally, a few comments on drilling and completion cost. Although most drilling cost components remained somewhat in check during Q1, we were able to realize some modest reductions in service cost on the completion side primarily in the Permian. On the drilling side, we're keeping our focus on efficiencies, as seen with our Q1 average Wolfcamp spread to rig release drill time now down to 28 days as compared to 35 days in 2014.
On the completion side, in addition to the modest service cost reductions I mentioned, mostly in the Permian, we placed a strong emphasis on reducing a lot of sourcing cost by challenging our team in their planning, engineering and operating efficiencies in that regard. The results of our efforts are just now beginning to make their way into our total well cost.
As we continue to push the limit on our frac design and size, our completion cost will continue to dominate our total well cost. While we experiment with larger frac designs many of our generic well AFEs still have stayed somewhat in check. An exception is the Wolfcamp, where both our drilling and completion efficiencies have reduced our generic 2-mile lateral Culberson and lower Wolfcamp AFE to a range of $10.2 million to $11.2 million, that's down 5% from the $10.8 million to $11.6 million range that we quoted last call, and down 22% from where we were in late 2014. 
With last quarter's frac designs, our Cana core 1-mile lateral wells continue to run in the range of $6.6 million to $7 million, unchanged from the last call and down 16% to 17% from 2014. But with the larger frac designs that we're contemplating to be utilized here in Q3 '16, this range is likely to increase anywhere in the range of $500,000 to $600,000 per well. 
And in the Meramec, our current 1-mile lateral AFE is still in the range of $7 million to $7.4 million. Again, that is unchanged from last call and down 13% from late '14. And also here, if we employ larger fracs moving forward, we could see an additional $500,000 to $600,000 in these AFEs as well.
So in closing, we had another great quarter. We beat guidance despite sizable downstream and weather disruptions. We've made significant strides further reducing our LOE. Our drilling and completion group remains focused on cost efficiencies -- reductions and efficiencies and optimizing the results of our fracs. And our teams are tightly focused on maximizing the productivity and profitability of our wells. All the while, we're optimizing our investment program results.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Q&A."

And those wells have been on long enough now that what's really impressing us is the, quite frankly, lack of decline. These wells come on and they tend to have a very long, flat period to them. And we have enough time with those now that we gain confidence in that type curve, and that's led to a major change in our expectation for these wells going forward. I should also point out, though, as Joe mentioned, we actually have, also in addition to that, seen some cost reduction in those wells.

And so it's fair to say that some of the wells come in much better than expected and some come in less. We're still learning a lot in regards to these wells and there's still a lot that we think we can change or improve upon to make these wells even better. So yes, there's some variability there, especially, I would point out, yes, with our 10,000-foot lateral we just announced. It's also -- well, I want to point out that we anticipated having a much higher yield than our previous 2 10,000-foot laterals. And so in that case, we did not flow it back as aggressively from a choke management standpoint. We were interested -- and with this one particular, in seeing with choke management, how we can manage that yield.

And let me be also clear, we're not sure that we've really even reached even close to the end number in terms of these frac uplifts. So that's why, for the Upper Wolfcamp spacing pilot, even though we don't have a well under our belt, we're very comfortable stepping up in the total amount of sand that we're going to pump in those wells. Because the way we model it, with a modest increase in IP and EUR, it's a very economic thing to do. So we're very pleased with the progress we're seeing here.

But one of the things I wanted to follow up on is -- one of the things that makes Cimarex strong is our presence in multiple plays, and in particular, with our footprint in the Delaware Basin and our footprint with STACK, we're doing a lot of innovation, as are our competitors. And every time we see something that works, we look for opportunities to apply it elsewhere in our portfolio. So having that footprint in multiple plays allows us to really bring innovations in much more quickly than we could if we were a single-basin player. So there are -- as John said, we have a lot of running room in completion optimization in both the Wolfcamp A, the Wolfcamp D and I would add, in STACK, both in the Meramec and Woodford. All of those plays are trying some things in that laboratory, gives us ideas to apply across the board. I don't know that we're even scratching the surface yet in a lot of areas.

And so going forward into this new row development, our base case, and I think Joe alluded to that, why we're anticipating the additional cost, is to go up to that size of a frac job in the Woodford shale at 3,200 pounds per foot. Whereas before, standard was more around 1,800 pounds per foot. Again, there is cost there associated with it, but based on the performance we're seeing on those wells, it's well worth the additional cost to do that. So that's our go-forward plan there for that next row of development."

Landing zone is a real point of experimentation in the Meramec. In the early wells for Cimarex and for many of our competitors, it was quite frankly, a monkey see, monkey do approach. The Meramec wasn't the most obvious reservoir. And so early wells were kind of targeted based on mimicking what offset wells had done. And as we've continued to delineate the play, Cimarex and the industry has tested different landing zones. We're testing 2 different landing zones in that Meramec stacked/staggered pilot, and we continue to experiment with landing zones throughout the play. We're seeing landing zone to be a overprint on production that's greater than we initially anticipated. There are some areas of the play that have underperformed that we're going back in now and you're testing new landing zones, new completion techniques, and we're quite encouraged by the potential there. But it's a real open part of experimentation as to where to land these laterals. John, you want to add to that?"

And I must tell you, I feel pretty good about how we've done this for this particular stacked/staggered pilot in regards to the data we received from that pilot which really helped us pinpoint exactly where we want to put these laterals. Whereas before, Tom's absolutely right, we would have looked just say, 2 sections over, and see what did company X, Y, Z do as far as where they landed it. I think we're recognizing that for the Meramec, I mean, every section might have just a slight different tweak to where you want to put that lateral to achieve maximum performance. And that's some of the lessons we're learning as we go forward. So I'm very excited about the stacked/staggered pilot, and I'm looking forward to when we finally get around to completing it. But as I mentioned, we do have a strong interest in the other operated pilot that is just flowing back now. And there was a lot of science associated with that pilot, and we're very anxious to kind of see the flowback, review the science data. And that's why we're not in any rush to go out and frac our current stacked/staggered till we see some of those results and see how we might then tailor our fracture design for the -- for our pilot."

And just thinking, through this -- where we are in the cycle, you've got productivity trending up and to the right, costs are at cyclical lows. How do you think about outspending cash flow? And as we move further forward in 2017, given the current environment, is that something you'd be more likely to do than at other points in the cycle?"

And the way I think about it is it's very simple, it's about creating value. If we can borrow money at a low interest rate, invest it in a high interest rate, I think as long as we're confident in those returns, that's a value-creating proposition for our shareholder. And with our top tier assets, I think our bias as a management team is to bring that value forward for our shareholders. Now that said, when you drill a well, those returns are predicated on a discounted cash flow that's -- makes some significant assumptions about future commodity pricing. And the quality of that assumption is key. If we get to a point to where we gain confidence about that future commodity pricing, if we think that the markets have kind of worked themselves out and they're in balance -- and we get asked about at what price file? It's not about the price file. We have the opportunities today at this price file to accelerate and add value. It's about our confidence in that price file and that the markets are in balance and that we think that it's a fairly low-volatile proposition. So I think our bias is going to be to invest, use our balance sheet. And yes, we'd be willing to modestly outspend cash flow. Mark, you want to add to that?"

So we're at year 10 in Culberson. And I'm going to tell you right now, we still don't know everything about Wolfcamp and Culberson, they're obvious by our well results and what we continue to do. Whereas we're in year 2 of Meramec, and I just think we’ve scratched the surface. There's just so much that we are learning with each well, both us and our competitors. And in some way, yes, it is happening at a far more accelerated pace than Culberson ever did because we were the only game in town when we were doing Culberson. Here, as you well are aware, we have at least 5 other operators drilling all around us, and we're all looking at each other trying to figure out what works best, where should I go? Where do I land? And so clearly, it's at a much more accelerated pace. But sometimes I wonder, maybe too fast, honestly, that you never really get a chance to really catch your breath and look at the data and look at the results. Not just that 30-day rate, as I mentioned, but what is the well doing 180 days later? And is it surprising you? And so I -- there -- sometimes I wish we went a little bit slower, to be honest, in Meramec. But in some ways, we're being forced to, just with the competition.

In other cases, quite frankly, we've reached the point we said we've just got to go ahead and drill and create that information by drilling a pilot hole. I would also tell you, in some ways, we're putting even more renewed emphasis on our 3D seismic coverage. Because at least with 3D seismic, you are sampling the geology, so to speak, in a much finer scale. So we're really, really trying to incorporate that as a tool to help us, along with the subsurface control and the horizontal wells that have been drilled to date, to build a more comprehensive model of what's going on and what we should expect going forward. I would just tell you that again, right now, we have expectations for every Meramec well we drill.

As always, we appreciate your interest and look for to questions during the question-and-answer portion of the call.
On the call today, John will walk us through our recent results and describe our progress on some of the delineation projects that we have under way. This will include results from delineation in the Merrimac, the completion modifications that have further improve our results in the lower Wolfcamp.
In the Meramec, John will discuss results from 2 recent 10,000-foot horizontal wells that are significant in our performance, that they're also encouraging in the manner in which there delineating our acreage. In the Wolfcamp, John will discuss some recent results from completion optimization, including an outstanding recent 10,000-foot well in lower Wolfcamp in Culberson County. We're making great strides to improving our well results across our portfolio.
Additionally, we are confirming our optimism regarding the uplift we see from 10,000-foot horizontal wells. Not only are these wells delivering outstanding 30-day and 180-day rates, they are exhibiting surprisingly low decline.
Joe will follow John with an operational overview, including some of the steps we have taken to improve field efficiencies. As Joe will describe, he and his team had made great progress in getting our lease operating expenses down. There many components in the progress Joe will report, including smart well-engineered water management, personnel and equipment deficiencies, liftoff to optimization, compressor optimization and others. The result in savings and current and future of these operating expenses are significant to Cimarex.
We report another production beat this quarter driven by continued improvement in well performance. Our total company production was 974 million cubic feet equivalent per day for the second quarter, which exceeded the high end of our guidance. Gas production was up while oil production was down slightly. As we had forecasted, this was due to fewer well completions in the Permian Basin due to the timing of our infill and filing completions. As we pick up the pace in our Permian completions during the second half of the year, we expect oil production to trend upwards. Combined with all production expected from the Woodford completions in East Cana, we expect all production to be up approximately 15% in the fourth quarter versus second quarter levels.
Operating expenses with the exception of G&A came in within guidance resulting in a strong quarter overall. G&A were slightly above guidance as we recorded the cost of an early retirement package offered to employees in the first quarter that was finalized in June. We also announced an increase in our 2016 capital budget. We have raised our guidance from a range of a $650 million to $700 million of exploration development capital to $750 million for 2016. This includes $600 million earmarked for drilling and completions, up $100 million from the high end of our previous guidance. The increased capital will be used to further delineate the Meramec formation in the Anadarko Basin, push the completion of Woodford infill wells forward and add a handful of new wells to our Delaware Basin program.
Our bigger, more effective stimulations are also adding to our capital. This is money well spent as shown by our well results. We now see our operating rig count holding at 5 for the remainder of 2016.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John to provide further color in our program."

I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our remaining 2016 plans. Cimarex invested $156 million on exploration and development during the second quarter. About 65% was invested in the Permian region with the rest going toward activities in the Mid-Continent region.
Company-wide, we brought 34 gross, 14 net wells on production during the quarter. We had an average of 9 operating rigs during the quarter. These rigs were busy working the whole day [indiscernible] Wolfcamp and Meramec place as well as drilling base and pilots in the Delaware Basin and Mid-Continent. That activity is winding down and we are currently running 5 rigs, 3 in the Permian and 2 in Anadarko, an activity level with sentiment in through the rest of 2016.
While a lot of focus in put on the number of rigs and wells running, completion of the wells the biggest impact on both well cost and well performance. We are continuing to push the envelope on well completions.
On Page 30 of our presentation, we illustrate the evolution of completion size as measured in pound per sand per lateral foot drilled.
As you can see, completions are evolving across the company. We have several other slides in our presentation that illustrates the uplift we've seen in several of these plays, including the upper Wolfcamp in Culberson County and now the lower Wolfcamp as shown on Slide 12. Our most recent lower Wolfcamp well, the [indiscernible] 19 state A #5 H was completed with 2,400 pounds of sand per lateral foot and had an average 30-day IP of 3,127 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 23% was oil, 46% gas and 29% was NGL. All on average, that IP is 36% higher than previous completions.
The success of the frac design used on the [indiscernible] is more than just a pound a sand per foot increase. It is a direct consequence Cimarex developing a strong understanding of the geology and rock mechanics of this interval, which in turn, leads to design changes, not just in the amount of sand pump but also in the type of sand, cluster design, cluster count, stage spacing along with that type of fluid. This type of detailed frac design is taking place internally for each of our perspective zones in both basins, which is leading to the strong well performances that we have been achieving across the board.
Regarding our New Mexico Avalon Shale program, Cimarex drilled and completed the 500,000-foot [indiscernible] 25 fed #7 H late last youth amending an upside stimulation design in order to determine that we could achieve improved performance for this interval as seen in other Permian Shale intervals.
As shown on Slide 17 on our presentation, the results for this well has been outstanding. The well achieved a 30-day peak IP rate of 1,811 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 59% was oil, 20% gas and 22% NGL. With a very impressive 180-day rate of 1,317 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 180-day cube of 230,000 oil equivalent. This kind of results racist the program to top tier for us going forward.
Capital to be invested in the Permian for the second half 2016 will be focused on completion activity in acreage obligations across our Wolfcamp position above Culberson and Reeves County. The total capital ascribed to acreage holding and Delaware Basin is just over $230 million in 2016. We currently have 3 rigs running in Delaware Basin and expect to keep them active through the remainder of 2016.
Now onto the Mid-Continent. You will recall that we began drilling the latest Woodford development project on the east side of the Cana core in the fourth quarter 2015. This development covers 6 sections of which Cimarex operates 2 sections. This infill project consists of 47 groves, 22 net wells. Drilling is finished and completion of the wells has again been moved up and is now scheduled for early September versus October that was discussed in our last fall. This change in scheduling was a contributing factor to our increasing capital expenditures for 2016.
As for the Meramec, we continue to drill wells to both hold our acreage and delineate our acreage position. Of note, our 2 of our most recent Meramec results, the Peterson and Sims long laterals, whose location can be seen on Slide 19 of the presentation.
The Peterson 1H-28 21X located in the Northwest part of our Meramec position achieved a 30-day peak average rate of 19 million cubic equivalent per day of which 54% was oil, 30% gas, 16% NGL. While the Sims 1H-20 17 X located in the southeastern part of our Meramec acreage, achieved a 30-day average rate of 12.8 million cubic feet equivalent per day, 29% oil, 46% gas, 25% NGL. These 2 books in wells in our acreage a good confirmation of our ability to adjust both the landing zone and frac designe to achieve very good rate of return that results across a breath of our Meramec acreage, and it's why we chose to keep to rigs running remainder of the year holding Meramec acreage.
Finally, to better understand the multizone potential for this area, we have recently finished drilling an 8-well stack [indiscernible] spectrum spacing pilot in the Meramec and Woodford formations. See Slide 21 for an illustration of this design. These wells are scheduled to begin completion operations later this month with first production anticipated in the fourth quarter. Results from another Meramec spacing pilot were recently announced by our partner, name. The pilot wells had an average IP of 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day of which 60% was oil. The completion of these wells was influential in the stimulation design for the Meramec in our stack stagger pilot to the final Meramec design using 2,600 pounds of sand per lateral foot. Cimarex hold a 46% working interest in this product.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albee"

I'll touch on the usual items. Our second quarter production, our Q3 and full year '16 production outlook and then finish up with a few comments on LOE and the service cost. As Tom mentioned",1381,"Thank you, John, and thank you, all, for joining our call today. I'll touch on the usual items. Our second quarter production, our Q3 and full year '16 production outlook and then finish up with a few comments on LOE and the service cost. As Tom mentioned, we have yet another great quarter for production with stronger-than-expected base property in new well performance. Really driving the quarter, our second quarter volumes came in better than anticipated. Our reported Q2 total company net equivalent production of $974 million a day, either guidance projection of $935 million to $965 million, and was up slightly lowered Q1 reported volume of $973 million a day rather than down as we anticipated in the last call.
As expected, with accelerated completion activity and increased processing capacity during the second quarter, we saw a nice boost in our Permian production with the addition of a second frac crew in May. We completed 9 Permian wells during the quarter as compared to just 3 in the first quarter. As a result, our second quarter Permian equivalent volume came in at $509 million a day, that's a $32 million a day or 7% from the first quarter.
In the Mid-Continent, continued well strong performance from our Cana-Woodford project, which came online in late fourth quarter last year, supported both our Q1 and our Q2 Mid-Continent volumes. And with that support, our second quarter Mid-Continent equivalent volume averaged $463 million a day, that's up $44 million a day or 11% from Q2 '15. But as expected, with only 5 new wells in the Mid-Continent coming online during the quarter, our second quarter Mid-Continent volumes decreased $30 million a day as compared to Q1.
So as we look forward into the last half of '16, we're projecting further acceleration of completion activity in both our Mid-Continent and Permian programs. And as a result, we're projecting a total of 72 net wells to come online during the year as compared to the 60 net wells we projected last call with 7 of those additional wells being located in the Permian and 5 in the Mid-Continent.
In the Mid-Continent, we moved up with the start date for Cana infill development project to September, as been previously stated. And that's again, versus our previous estimate of October. And in the Permian, with planed addition of third rig in August, we've also accelerated our completion activity for the most part in first quarter, for both of our Bone Spring and Reeves County programs. As a result, we now anticipate having 22 net wells waiting on completion at year-end with 11 in both the Mid-Continent and the Permian, and that's down from the 46 total wells that we have waiting on completion here at the end of Q2.
With our strong first half performance and our planted and completion activity, we've increased our total company full year production guidance to 0.98 to 1 Bcfe per day, that's up from our previous guidance of $940 million to $970 million a day. And would put us in essence, flat to 2% higher than our 2015 average of 985 -- $984.5 million a day. More importantly, our plan acceleration -- accelerated completion activity gives us very strong momentum going into 2017 with our forecasted Q4 exit rate in the range of 1.02 to 1.07 Bcfe per day, that's 3% to 9% higher than the $986 million a day we posted in Q4 '15. Our all production plays a big role in our projected Q4 exit rate. With our Q4 Permian and Mid-Continent net oil volumes forecasted to be up 12% to 17% from the volumes that we reported in Q2.
From Q3 '16, with 10 net Permian wells and 3 net Mid-Continent wells expected to come online during the quarter, we're guiding our total company net equivalent volumes to be in the range of $950 million to $980 million at it. That's in essence, flat with the second quarter. And as we move into Q4, completion activity really picks up steam with 15 net Permian wells and 26 net Mid-Continent wells, planned to come online in the fourth quarter.
Shifting gears to OpEx. We had a nice guidance feet for the second quarter LOE, and we owe it all to the production groups continue and dedicated efforts to optimally reduce our overall operating cost structure with their focus, we once again saw a sizable cost reductions during the quarter and similar components in quarters past. [indiscernible] disposal, compression, rentals, contract labor. And as such, our Q2 lifting cost came in at $0.65 per Mcfe, well below the low end of our guidance, which was $0.80 to $0.90, down 19% from our first quarter average of $0.80 per Mcfe and down 22% from the $0.83 we averaged in 2015.
So after incorporating our continued cost control efforts and also taking into account, the fluctuating nature of work over expenses, we projected our remaining year lifting cost to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.75 per Mcfe.
I want to take a moment to serial extremely proud of our entire production ops team for the success and safety and effectively reducing our LOE. The progress is sizable. Since prices began falling back in 2014, we've seen our absolute roughly that LOE approximately $9 million a month, which on annualized basis, it has in essence, freed up over $100 million a year that we can direct our drilling program.
And finally, on service cost. Some very similar comments to our last call with regard to drilling and completion cost, most all of our drilling cost components have remained relatively in check while we have seen some modest reductions in per-unit completion cost, primarily in the Permian. On the drilling side, we have kept our focus on efficiencies as illustrated with our average 2016 Bone Spring spread to rig release real time of 10 days, that's down from 12 days in '15 and 14 days in 2014. On the completion side, we've seen continued cost reductions in the Permian, both from a frac cost standpoint as well as in the cost of source our water, which has really helped to mitigate additional cost pumping larger jobs. As we continue to increase our frac size, completion dollars continue to dominate our total well cost, representing up to 2/3 of the individual total well cost reached well. As in quarters past, we've been able to offset the costs of the facts with lower per unit pumping costs. And as such, most of our generic AFEs have remained somewhat in check as compared to last quarter. An exception, however, is our Permian Bone Spring program where both our drilling and completion efficiencies have reduced our current 1 mile lateral AFE's to $4.7 million to $5.1 million, that's down 6% from the $5 million to $5.4 million that we quoted last quarter.
In the Wolfcamp, with larger completions, our generic 2-mile lateral Culberson AFEs continue to run in the 10.2 to 11.2 to range. That's flat the last call, but down 5% from where we were in Q4 and down 23% from that program's AFE back in late 2014.
With our larger frac design, our Cana core 1-mile lateral Woodford AFE is running in the range of $7.1 million to $7.5 million, up from the $6.6 million to $7 million range we previously quoted with the smaller frac, but right in line with the $500,000 to $600,000 anticipated increase that we quoted last call, should we adopt and implement the larger fracs, which we are. But even with a larger frac, our current Cana 1-mile Woodford well is down 10% on a total well cost as compared to late 2014.
As we drill more 2-mile lateral Meramec wells, our current AFEs are run in the range of $10.7 mi to $11.4 million, all the while, we continue to experiment with various frac design and land index and so on.
In closing, we had another great quarter. We gained tremendous strides reducing operating cost structure. We stayed -- we're staying focused on efficiencies to reduce and optimize our joint and completion cost and we continue to make good progress, maximizing the productivity and profitability of our wells.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Q&A."

We have 2 outstanding plays and we have an outstanding acreage business in both plays and acreage positions that offer 10,000 [indiscernible] on horizontal wells. You some all that together and it's your dilemma on how we allocate capital. Now I will say as I said in the past that some of our best well level returns are in the Bone Spring, in the Delaware Basin. Certainly, the 10,000-foot long Wolfcamp wells are fantastic and getting better. And as John said, the Avalon is really roaring to the compete heads up with everything I just mentioned. I would say the Delaware at the well level rate of return is at the top of the pack. But that Anadarko story is evolving and not very far behind. If some of these new landing zones in new stimulations, if the Sims, Peterson and some of the wells are now competitors, if these results are repeatable across large portions of our 115,000 Meramec acres, then it's going to give a j[indiscernible] on how we allocate capital because there's also science in delineation we want to view. So we're always balancing with that absolute high rate of return, our next investment, with looking 5, 10 years ahead, what information do we want and when do we want it? So in terms of capital allocation, we're going ahead with 3 rigs in the Delaware and 2 rigs in the STACK play, and we think both those rigs or both those programs are designed to give us a lot of information, both landing zone, completion optimization and geological delineation. And so we're fairly comfortable with that 3-rig Delaware to 2-rig Anadarko right now. If prices were to improve materially, I think it's a function of oil or gas improves. But right now, the Delaware is probably the strongest voice for incremental capital if we were to increase the on that."

And the reality is, I wish I could've made it to 10,000  but that particular case, we were landlocked to hold that acreage as a 5,000-foot lateral. And in that particular play, we clearly, in our own mind, have demonstrated uplift going to 10 so just imagine Cabinet state taking to attend it would be that much better. I think what you're seeing Cabinet state is again, Tom, does a nice job of talking about this just as leveraging frac design changes in the upper Wolfcamp in Culberson, over to Reeves and back and forth, and that's a good example. Along with -- we have our major development there and next to Big Timber where we're about to start fracking with the wood wells, we're clearly taking that frac design that we implemented overall in the upper Wolfcamp product there over the dose wells. So we're seeing really good results there, throughout that part of Reeves County, and we're very excited about it and we've got a lot of drilling to do there, the main on year and in next year. And finally, when I think about it, the thing also that's changing there and we talk a lot about is landing zone. We are definitely getting much more comfortable in Reeves as to where we want to land those wells, and I think it's leading to the kind of results you're seeing as well. So it's a combination is kind of sound like a broken record but both frac, uplift and landing zone."

And then probably the next step for us is then spacing. We've already announced before that we did spacing pilots in the past in the Avalon. We feel very good at 8 wells per section and again multiple intervals and in our the Avalon, we probably won't need to go out there and tests tighter spacing, but we're also blessed that we have a lot of competitors in and around our HBP acreage who doing just that.

We don't have a lot of experience in drilling long laterals and lower pressured -- close to normal pressure type rocks. And something else also happens. We talked about this. Once you move in that normal pressure part of the play, more earlier play, you are talking about a part of the plays were it's shallower. So your cost to get there, the vertical part of it is very inexpensive. You don't need that extra string of pipe. You drill bit very quickly and a lot of times, when you think of long laterals, we love them because it's pretty expensive for us to get there to, to get to the target, so once we're there, we want to stay there as long as we can. In fat, [indiscernible] the drilling department must know why we stopped at 10,000 feet. And in some ways, internally, we talk about that.

So then you want to ask yourself, operationally, does that extra 5,000 really gain you a lot or not. And we just don't have a lot of experience with that. I'll be honest with you. All are experience has been in the pressure but we're watching it very, very carefully, ourselves. As Tom says, we're looking across the fence and asking ourself, maybe, maybe in that shallow or lower normal pressure. Maybe 5,000 is a better way to go than 10,000.

Just yesterday, we were looking at our total well cost as measured by cents per pound of sand that we're pumping. And it's remarkable how far that's come in the last couple of years. But we've got the right wins, and I'm confident we have the right wins, and its after-tax rate of return. So yes, answer your question, some of the aggressiveness that we've had in adding to our profit certainly has been facilitated by how low our cost structure has been. And if we had a pressure either through commodity pricing or service cost, we're going to look at that on a regular underweight ever term basis and trying to find optimal solution. We don't look at production rates and say, the highest production rate is our best solution. We always, always at Cimarex, look at rate of return on the investment required. So I have a lot of confidence in free markets. If a market forces cause us to find a different path forward. I think our focus on rate of return is exactly the way to navigate that."

It's an interesting area and I'm really, really proud of our team because that's an area where early on in this play, we got out there and grabbed some really good acreage at a really good price.

The Woodford shale, we fairly early on and particularly, with our own stimulations, got a point where we think we understand the regional consistency. We can drill anywhere in our asset and fairly acrylate predict the yield and we're fairly console at a fairly high-level making decisions. When we go to the Meramec, I will tell you that John and I get the into the weeds on looking at that geography, looking at landing zones, talking about completion styles because it is very variable.

Well, it certainly keeps us busy, trying to juggle everything you just described. In regards to Cana, I'm just going to tell you, I'm extremely excited for our future drilling activity in Cana from the standpoint of current returns, especially now that we look at it as a long lateral development. And again, keep that in mind, everything up-to-date in Cana has been 5,000 feet, but given the continuity of our acreage that we, along with our partner, Devon have, we, together, are starting to have those discussions over long macro development and a need, I think you will hear from us in the coming quarters start talking more about where that next development will take place for us. This well we're about to bring on is pretty exciting. It's a more liquid, rich part of the Cana Woodford shale. I am also excited because our partner there, Devon, has build 4 2-mile lateral so we'll get a chance to see those in the development phase, how they look. And we had a wonderful position between the two of us, just north of that we call the 13 8 area that we definitely see as long lateral development, it's just a question of two of us coming together at some point and planning that out and then we'll see when that starts. So no, you're absolutely right. Cana looks very good but it's also a matter of how you get that funded versus everything else that were trying to answer in the Meramec and the Wolfcamp and into every other play we have. The other comment I want to make real quick is we'd really did a lot this year with our spacing pilots. And yes, we don't have a lot to talk on just yet but we put a lot of capital earlier in the year in these pilots in the Wolfcamp, and in the Meramec, and that's really going to set us up very well for the coming years when we start moving to full-scale development where we get the kind of confidence to deploy those large amounts of capital in the Wolfcamp or the Meramec likely we are today in the Woodford and that's going to put more pressure on Tom to open up the first ring, let's spend more money to get there."

It's a good question, but part of the way that we are honoring the quality of the Woodford is we need to understand that Meramec, so that when we develop out there, we really exploit the resource in the most prudent fashion. We have to understand how many landing zones we have. We have to understand the full potential of the Meramec. The thing we absolutely do not want to do is go into Cana Woodford development and then find out that the Meramec is left behind. And then if we come in and get it later, we have every production interference and disruption.

As always, we appreciate your interest and look forward to your questions during the question-and-answer portion of the call.
On the call today, John will walk us through our recent results and describe our progress on some of the delineation projects that we have underway. This will include results from delineation in the Meramec, the completion modifications that have further improved our results in the lower Wolfcamp.
In the Meramec, John will discuss results from 2 recent 10,000-foot horizontal wells that are significant in their performance, but they're also encouraging in the manner in which they're delineating our acreage. In the Wolfcamp, John will discuss some recent results from completion optimization, including an outstanding recent 10,000-foot well in lower Wolfcamp in Culberson County. We're making great strides in improving our well results across our portfolio.
Additionally, we are confirming our optimism regarding the uplift we see from 10,000-foot horizontal wells. Not only are these wells delivering outstanding 30-day and 180-day rates, they're exhibiting surprisingly low decline.
Joe will follow John with an operational overview, including some of the steps we have taken to improve field efficiencies. As Joe will describe, he and his team have made great progress in getting our lease operating expenses down. There are many components to the progress that Joe will report, including smart, well-engineered water management, personnel and equipment efficiencies, liftoff optimization, compressor optimization and others. The result in savings incurred and future lease operating expenses are significant to Cimarex.
We reported another production beat this quarter driven by continued improvement in well performance. Our total company production was 974 million cubic feet equivalent per day for the second quarter, which exceeded the high end of our guidance. Gas production was up, while oil production was down slightly. As we had forecasted, this was due to fewer well completions in the Permian Basin due to the timing of our infill and spacing -- pilot completions. As we pick up the pace on our Permian completions during the second half of the year, we expect oil production to trend upwards. Combined with oil production expected from the Woodford completions and East Cana, we expect all production to be up approximately 15% in the fourth quarter versus second quarter levels.
Operating expenses, with the exception of G&A, came in within guidance, resulting in a strong quarter overall. G&A were slightly above guidance as we recorded the cost of an early retirement package offered to employees in the first quarter that was finalized in June. We also announced an increase in our 2016 capital budget. We have raised our guidance from a range of $650 million to $700 million of exploration development capital to $750 million for 2016. This includes $600 million earmarked for drilling and completions, up $100 million from the high end of our previous guidance. The increased capital will be used to further delineate the Meramec formation in the Anadarko Basin, push the completion of Woodford infill wells forward and add a handful of new wells to our Delaware Basin program.
Our bigger, more effective stimulations are also adding to our capital. This is money well spent as shown by our well results. We now see our operated rig count holding at 5 for the remainder of 2016.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John to provide further color in our program."

I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our remaining 2016 plans.

I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our remaining 2016 plans. Cimarex invested $156 million on exploration and development during the second quarter. About 65% was invested in the Permian region, with the rest going toward activities in the Mid-Continent region.
Company-wide, we brought 34 gross, 14 net wells on production during the quarter. We had an average of 9 operated rigs running during the quarter. These rigs were busy working to hold acreage in both the Wolfcamp and Meramec plays as well as drilling spacing pilots in both the Delaware Basin and the Mid-Continent. That activity is winding down and we are currently running 5 rigs, 3 in the Permian and 2 in Anadarko, an activity level we intend to maintain through the rest of 2016.
While a lot of focus is put on the number of rigs Cimarex is running, completion of the wells has the biggest impact on both well cost and well performance. We are continuing to push the envelope on well completions.
On Page 30 of our presentation, we illustrate the evolution of completion size as measured in pound per sand per lateral foot drilled. As you can see, completions are evolving across the company. We have several other slides in our presentation that illustrate the uplift we've seen in several of these plays, including the upper Wolfcamp in Culberson County and now the lower Wolfcamp, as shown on Slide 12. Our most recent lower Wolfcamp well, the Flying Ebony 19 State A #5 H was completed with 2,400 pounds of sand per lateral foot and had an average 30-day IP of 3,127 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 23% was oil, 46% gas and 29% was NGL. On average, that IP is 36% higher than previous completions.
The success of the frac design used on the Flying Ebony is more than just a pound a sand per foot increase. It is a direct consequence of Cimarex developing a strong understanding of the geology and rock mechanics for this interval, which in turn leads to design changes, not just in the amount of sand pump but also in the type of sand, cluster design, cluster count, stage spacing along with the type of fluid. This type of detailed frac design is taking place internally for each of our perspective zones in both basins, which is leading to the strong well performances that we have been achieving across the board.
Regarding our New Mexico Avalon Shale program, Cimarex drilled and completed the 500,000-foot Triste Draw 25 Fed #7 H late last year, implementing an upsized stimulation design in order to determine if we could achieve improved performance for this interval, as seen in other Permian Shale intervals.
As shown on Slide 17 on our presentation, the results for this well have been outstanding. The well achieved a 30-day peak IP rate of 1,811 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 59% was oil, 20% gas and 22% NGL, with a very impressive 180-day rate of 1,317 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 180-day cume of 230,000 barrels oil equivalent. This kind of result certainly raises the Avalon program to top tier for us going forward.
Capital to be invested in the Permian in the second half 2016 will be focused on completion activity and acreage obligations across our Wolfcamp position in both Culberson and Reeves County. The total capital ascribed to acreage holding in Delaware Basin is just over $230 million in 2016. We currently have 3 rigs running in Delaware Basin and expect to keep them active through the remainder of 2016.
Now onto the Mid-Continent. You will recall that we began drilling the latest Woodford development project on the east side of the Cana core in the fourth quarter 2015. This development covers 6 sections, of which Cimarex operates 2 sections. This infill project consists of 47 gross, 22 net wells. Drilling is finished and completion of the wells has again been moved up and is now scheduled for early September versus October that was discussed in our last call. This change in scheduling was a contributing factor to our increasing capital expenditures for 2016.
As for the Meramec, we continue to drill wells to both hold our acreage and delineate our acreage position. Of note, our 2 of our most recent Meramec results, the Peterson and Sims long laterals, whose location can be seen on Slide 19 of the presentation. The Peterson 1H-2821X located on the Northwest part of our Meramec acreage position achieved a 30-day peak average rate of 19 million cubic equivalent per day, of which 54% was oil, 30% gas, 16% NGL. While the Sims 1H-2017X located in the southeastern part of our Meramec acreage achieved a 30-day average rate of 12.8 million cubic feet equivalent per day, 29% oil, 46% gas, 25% NGL. These 2 bookend wells on our acreage are good confirmation of our ability to adjust both the landing zone and frac design to achieve very good rate of return -- results across the breadth of our Meramec acreage, and it's why we have chosen to keep 2 rigs running throughout the remainder of the year holding Meramec acreage.
Finally, to better understand the multi-zone potential for this area, we have recently finished drilling an 8-well stacked/staggered spacing pilot in the Meramec and Woodford formations. See Slide 21 for an illustration of this design. These wells are scheduled to begin completion operations later this month with first production anticipated in the fourth quarter. Results from another Meramec spacing pilot were recently announced by our partner, Devon. The Alma pilot wells had an average IP of 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 60% was oil. The completion of these wells was influential in the stimulation design for the Meramec wells in our stacked/staggered pilot with the final Meramec design using 2,600 pounds of sand per lateral foot. Cimarex holds a 46% working interest in this pilot.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi."

I'll touch on the usual items, our second quarter production, our Q3 and full year '16 production outlook and then finish up with a few comments on LOE and service cost. As Tom mentioned,",1396,"Thank you, John, and thank you, all, for joining our call today. I'll touch on the usual items, our second quarter production, our Q3 and full year '16 production outlook and then finish up with a few comments on LOE and service cost. 
As Tom mentioned, we had yet another great quarter for production with stronger than expected base property and new well performance really driving the quarter. Our second quarter volumes came in better than anticipated. Our reported Q2 total company net equivalent production of 974 million a day beat our guidance projection of 935 million to 965 million, and was up slightly to our Q1 reported volume of 973 million a day rather than down, as we had anticipated last call.
As expected, with accelerated completion activity and increased processing capacity during the second quarter, we saw a nice boost in our Permian production with the addition of a second frac crew in May. We completed 9 Permian wells during the quarter as compared to just 3 in the first quarter. As a result, our second quarter Permian equivalent volume came in at 509 million a day, that's up 32 million a day or 7% from the first quarter.
In the Mid-Continent, continued strong well performance from our Cana-Woodford project, which came online in late fourth quarter last year, supported both our Q1 and our Q2 Mid-Continent volumes. And with that support, our second quarter Mid-Continent equivalent volume averaged 463 million a day, that's up 44 million a day or 11% from Q2 '15. But as expected, with only 5 new wells in the Mid-Continent coming online during the quarter, our second quarter Mid-Continent volumes decreased 30 million a day as compared to Q1.
So as we look forward into the last half of '16, we're projecting further acceleration of completion activity in both our Mid-Continent and Permian programs. And as a result, we're projecting a total of 72 net wells to come online during the year as compared to the 60 net wells we projected last call, with 7 of those additional wells being located in the Permian and 5 in the Mid-Continent.
In the Mid-Continent, we've moved up the start dates for Cana infill development project to September, as has been previously stated. And that's, again, versus our previous estimate of October. And in the Permian, with planned addition of the third rig in August, we've also accelerated our completion activity for the most part in fourth quarter, for both of our Bone Spring and Reeves County Wolfcamp programs. As a result, we now anticipate having 22 net wells waiting on completion at year-end, with 11 in both the Mid-Continent and the Permian, and that's down from the 46 total wells that we had waiting on completion here at the end of Q2.
With our strong first half performance and our planned acceleration and completion activity, we've increased our total company full year production guidance to 0.98 to 1 Bcfe per day, that's up from our previous guidance of 940 million to 970 million a day, and would put us, in essence, flat to 2% higher than our 2015 average of 985 -- 984.5 million a day. More importantly, our planned acceleration -- accelerated completion activity gives us very strong momentum going into 2017 with our forecasted Q4 exit rate in the range of 1.02 to 1.07 Bcfe per day, that's 3% to 9% higher than the 986 million a day we posted in Q4 '15. Our oil production plays a big role in our projected Q4 exit rate, with our Q4 Permian and Mid-Continent net oil volumes forecasted to be up 12% to 17% from the volumes that we reported in Q2.
For Q3 '16, with 10 net Permian wells and 3 net Mid-Continent wells expected to come online during the quarter, we're guiding our total company net equivalent volumes to be in the range of 950 million to 980 million a day. That's, in essence, flat with the second quarter. And as we move into Q4, our completion activity really picks up steam with 15 net Permian wells and 26 net Mid-Continent wells planned to come online in the fourth quarter.
Shifting gears to OpEx. We had a nice guidance beat for the second quarter LOE, and we owe it all to our production groups' continued and dedicated efforts to optimally reduce our overall operating cost structure. With their focus, we once again saw sizable cost reductions during the quarter and similar components in quarters past, saltwater disposal, compression, rentals, contract labor. And as such, our Q2 lifting cost came in at $0.65 per Mcfe, well below the low end of our guidance, which was $0.80 to $0.90, down 19% from our first quarter average of $0.80 per Mcfe, and down 22% from the $0.83 we averaged in 2015.
So after incorporating our continued cost control efforts and also taking into account the fluctuating nature of workover expenses, we've projected our remaining year lifting cost to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.75 per Mcfe.
I want to take a moment just to say we're extremely proud of our entire production ops team for their success, and safely and effectively reducing our LOE. The progress is sizable. Since prices began falling back in 2014, we've seen our absolute monthly net LOE drop approximately $9 million a month, which on an annualized basis, has, in essence, freed up over $100 million a year that we can direct to our drilling program.
And finally, on service cost. Some very similar comments to our last call with regard to drilling and completion cost, most all of our drilling cost components have remained relatively in check, while we have seen some modest reductions in per-unit completion cost, primarily in the Permian. On the drilling side, we've kept our focus on efficiencies, as illustrated with our average 2016 Bone Spring spud to rig release drill time of 10 days, that's down from 12 days in '15 and 14 days in 2014. 
On the completion side, we've seen continued cost reductions in the Permian, both from a frac cost standpoint as well as in the cost to source our water, which has really helped to negate the additional cost of us pumping larger jobs. 
As we continue to increase our frac size, completion dollars continue to dominate our total well cost, representing up to 2/3 of the individual total well cost for each well. As in quarters past, we've been able to offset the costs of the larger fracs with lower per unit pumping costs. And as such, most of our generic AFEs have remained somewhat in check as compared to last quarter. An exception, however, is our Permian Bone Spring program where both drilling and completion efficiencies have reduced our current 1 mile lateral AFEs to $4.7 million to $5.1 million, that's down 6% from the $5 million to $5.4 million that we quoted last quarter.
In the Wolfcamp, with larger completions, our current generic 2-mile lateral Culberson AFEs continue to run in the $10.2 million to $11.2 million range. That's flat to last call, but down 5% from where we were in Q4, and down 23% from that program's AFE back in late 2014.
With our larger frac design, our Cana core 1-mile lateral Woodford AFE is running in the range of $7.1 million to $7.5 million, up from the $6.6 million to $7 million range we previously quoted with the smaller frac, but right in line with the $500,000 to $600,000 anticipated increase that we quoted last call, should we adopt and implement the larger fracs, which we are. But even with a larger frac, our current Cana 1-mile Woodford well is down 10% on a total well cost as compared to late 2014.
As we drill more 2-mile lateral Meramec wells, our current AFEs are running in the range of $10.7 million to $11.4 million, all the while, we continue to experiment with various frac designs and landing depths and so on.
In closing, we had another great quarter. We made tremendous strides reducing our overall operating cost structure. We stayed -- we're staying focused on efficiencies to reduce and optimize our drilling and completion costs, and we continue to make good progress maximizing the productivity and profitability of our wells.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Q&A."

And again, I want to stress that, there is no one recipe here in the Meramec saying 1 area that works best across the whole play, we're definitely changing things up and adapting to results. And again, I'll just emphasize, that's why we really like that Sims result, that one really has given us a little bit more -- definite more encouragement toward that part of the Meramec play."

And it is a challenge and it's a pretty high-class problem to have. We have 2 outstanding plays and we have an outstanding acreage positions in both plays, and acreage positions that allows for 10,000-foot long horizontal wells. You sum all that together and it's real dilemma on how we allocate capital. Now I will say, as I said in the past, that some of our best well level returns are in the Bone Spring, in the Delaware Basin. Certainly, the 10,000-foot long Wolfcamp wells are fantastic and getting better. And as John said, the Avalon is really roaring to compete heads-up with everything I just mentioned. I would say the Delaware at the well level rate of return is at the top of the pack. But that Anadarko story is evolving and not very far behind. If some of these new landing zones and new stimulations, if the Sims, Peterson and some of the wells announced by our competitors, if these results are repeatable across large portion of our 115,000 Meramec acres, then it's going to really give a [indiscernible] on how we allocate capital because there's also science in delineation we want to do. So we're always balancing with the absolute high rate of return on our next investment, with looking 5, 10 years ahead, what information do we want and when do we want it? So in terms of capital allocation, we're going ahead with 3 rigs in the Delaware and 2 rigs in the STACK play, and we think both those rigs or both those programs are designed to give us a lot of information, both landing zone, completion optimization and geological delineation. And so we're fairly comfortable with that 3-rig Delaware, 2-rig Anadarko right now. If prices were to improve materially, I think, it's a function of if oil or gas improves. But right now, the Delaware is probably the strongest voice for incremental capital if we were to increase above and beyond that."

The Cabinet State is an outstanding well, and we're very, very pleased with that result. And the reality is, I wish I could've made it a 10,000-foot lateral, but that particular case, we were landlocked to hold that acreage as a 5,000-foot lateral. And in that particular play, we clearly, in our own minds, have demonstrated the uplift of going to 10,000. So just imagine taking the Cabinet State, taking to 10,000, it would be even that much better. I think, what you're also seeing at Cabinet State is, again, and Tom does a nice job of talking about this, just as leveraging frac design changes, say, in the upper Wolfcamp and Culberson over to Reeves and back and forth, and that's a good example, along with we have our major development there next to the Big Timber where we're about to start fracking with the Wood wells. We're clearly taking that frac design that we implemented overall in the upper Wolfcamp pilot there over to those wells. So we're seeing really good results there throughout that part of Reeves County, and we're very excited about it and we've got a lot of drilling to do there, remainder of this year and the next year. And then, finally, when I think about it, the thing also that's changing there, and we talked a lot about, is landing zone. We are definitely getting much more comfortable in Reeves as to where we want to land those wells, and I think it's leading to the kind of result you're seeing as well. So it's kind of a combination of those -- kind of sounds like a broken record, but both frac, uplift and landing zone."

But I will tell you, this well result has definitely caused us to ask what's next. And I would not be surprised if we go back up on that acreage and push the envelope again in terms of our stimulation design and with a long lateral, that's the one thing, I think, next step we'd like to take in the Avalon is get a long lateral under our belt with this type of stimulation and then really see what kind of rate of returns we can achieve. And then, probably, the next step for us is then spacing. We've already announced before that we did spacing pilots in the past in the Avalon. We feel very good at 8 wells per section for individual interval. And again, there are multiple intervals in the Avalon. We probably will need to go out there and test tighter spacing, but we're also blessed that we have a lot of competitors in and around our HBP acreage who are doing just that. So we're not in a vacuum there. So we'll learn a lot from looking across the fence.

But again, it's fair to say, the majority of our portfolio is in pressured rock, and that's where most of our experience. We do not have a lot of experience in drilling long laterals and lower pressured -- close to normal pressure type rocks. And something else also happens. We've talked a lot about this. Once you move up in that normal pressured part of the play, more oilier play, you're talking about a part of a play were it's shallower, so your cost to get there, the vertical part of it, is very inexpensive. You don't need that extra string of pipe, you drill it very quickly. And a lot of times, when we think about long laterals, we love them because it's pretty expensive for us to get there to, to get to the target, so once we're there, we want to stay there as long as we can. In fact, I would argue, our drilling department wants to know why we stopped at 10,000 feet. And in some ways, internally, we talk about that. But the big difference is when you go updip, it's pretty cheap to get down there to get to the zone. So then, you got to ask yourself, operationally, does that extra 5,000 really gain you a lot or not. And we just don't have a lot of experience with that. I'll be honest with you. All our experience have been in the pressure but we're watching it very, very carefully ourselves. As Tom said, we're always looking across the fence and asking ourself, maybe, maybe in that shallower or normal pressure, maybe 5,000 is a better way to go than 10,000.

It all comes down to what John just said earlier. It's going to be a matter of economics. So if these prices do creep up, or the cost do creep up, we're always going to be looking at, for that job, what will it cost? What are the results we expect to achieve pumping that job? And does it merit going at the larger job or should we deviate somewhere plus or minus from there in design? So it's kind of a tough question to answer other than to tell you that we're constantly looking at current costs.

But we've got the right wins, and I'm very confident we have the right wins, and its after-tax rate of return. And so yes, in answer to your question, some of the aggressiveness that we've had in adding to our proppant certainly has been facilitated by how low our cost structure has been. And if we have a pressure, either through commodity pricing or service cost, we're going to look at that on a rate of return basis and to find the optimal solution. We don't look at production rates and say, the highest production rate is our best solution. We always, always at Cimarex, look at rate of return on the investment it required.

We can drill a well anywhere in our asset and fairly accurately predict the yield. And we're fairly comfortable at a fairly high-level making decisions.

And again, keep that in mind, everything up-to-date in Cana has been 5,000 feet, but given the continuity of our acreage that we, along with our AMI partner, Devon, have, we, together, are starting to have those discussions over long lateral development. And indeed, I think, you will hear from us in the coming quarters start talking more about where that next development will take place for us. This well we're about to bring on is pretty exciting. It's more liquid rich part of the Cana-Woodford shale. I'm also excited because our partner there, Devon, has drilled 4 2-mile lateral, so we'll get a chance to see those in the development phase, how they look. And we have a wonderful position between the two of us just north of that, that we call the 13 8 area that we definitely see a long lateral development, it's just a question of the two of us coming together at some point and planning that out and then we'll see when that starts. So you're absolutely right. Cana looks very good, but it's also a matter of how do you get that funded versus everything else that we're trying to answer in the Meramec and in the Wolfcamp and every other play we have. The other comment I want to make real quick is we really did a lot early in this year with our spacing pilots. And yes, we don't have a lot to talk on just yet, but we put a lot of capital early in the year in these pilots in the Wolfcamp and in the Meramec, and that's really going to set us up very well for the coming years when we start moving to full-scale development where we get the kind of confidence to deploy those large amount of capital, say, in the Wolfcamp or the Meramec like we are already today for the Woodford, and that's just going to put even more pressure on Tom to open up the first ring and let us spend more money as we get there."

We have to understand how many landing zones we have. We have to understand the full potential of the Meramec. The thing we absolutely do not want to do is go into Cana-Woodford development and then find out that the Meramec was left behind, and that if we come in and get it later, we have a real production interference and disruption.

Although, I think, theirs extends into next year, I'm not -- I don't recall. Does it, Mark?"

In fact, I asked the team the other day, when we hit peak production, the net production we expect off that row at peak will be about 49% gas, 34% NGL and 17% oil. So kind of on a gas liquid basis, it's almost a 50-50 split. And so again, that's why we're very encouraged. We think we can get very good returns out of this row. And as far as the completion itself, I think, Devon himself will speak to their wells. But for our wells, we are moving forward with the design that we deployed on the Armacost section. I think, if you refer to Page 30, we talked about that where we were up to 3,500 lbs per foot. We really, really like the results from the Armacost. In fact, we didn't even talk much about that, but we have a really nice slide showing how Armacost wells are doing just as well as our other sections. And yet, we put an additional well within that section, new well. So we're able to get an extra well, and yet, still get similar results, meaning we're getting more reserves per section, out of that section. So we feel really good about that frac design. And that's what we intend on using going forward on our 2 operated sections."

As always, we appreciate your interest and look forward to your questions during the question-and-answer portion of the call.
On the call today, John will walk us through our recent results and describe our progress on some of the delineation projects that we have underway. This will include results from delineation in the Meramec and completion modifications that have further improved our results in the lower Wolfcamp.
In the Meramec, John will discuss results from 2 recent 10,000-foot horizontal wells that are significant in their performance, but they're also encouraging in the manner in which they're delineating our acreage. In the Wolfcamp, John will discuss some recent results from completion optimization, including an outstanding recent 10,000-foot well in lower Wolfcamp in Culberson County. We're making great strides in improving our well results across our portfolio.
Additionally, we are confirming our optimism regarding the uplift we see from 10,000-foot horizontal wells. Not only are these wells delivering outstanding 30-day and 180-day rates, they're exhibiting surprisingly low decline.
Joe will follow John with an operational overview, including some of the steps we have taken to improve field efficiencies. As Joe will describe, he and his team have made great progress in getting our lease operating expenses down. There are many components to the progress that Joe will report, including smart, well-engineered water management, personnel and equipment efficiencies, liftoff to optimization, compressor optimization and others. The result in savings incurred and future lease operating expenses are significant to Cimarex.
We reported another production beat this quarter driven by continued improvement in well performance. Our total company production was 974 million cubic feet equivalent per day for the second quarter, which exceeded the high end of our guidance. Gas production was up, while oil production was down slightly. As we had forecasted, this was due to fewer well completions in the Permian Basin due to the timing of our infill and spacing -- pilot completions. As we pick up the pace on our Permian completions during the second half of the year, we expect our oil production to trend upwards. Combined with oil production expected from the Woodford completions in East Cana, we expect oil production to be up approximately 15% in the fourth quarter versus second quarter levels.
Operating expenses, with the exception of G&A, came in within guidance, resulting in a strong quarter overall. G&A was slightly above guidance as we recorded the cost of an early retirement package offered to employees in the first quarter that was finalized in June. We also announced an increase in our 2016 capital budget. We have raised our guidance from a range of $650 million to $700 million of exploration and development capital to $750 million for 2016. This includes $600 million earmarked for drilling and completions, up $100 million from the high end of our previous guidance. The increased capital will be used to further delineate the Meramec formation in the Anadarko Basin, push the completion of Woodford infill wells forward and add a handful of new wells to our Delaware Basin program.
Our bigger, more effective stimulations are also adding to our capital. This is money well spent as shown by our well results. We now see our operated rig count holding at 5 for the remainder of 2016.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John to provide further color in our program."

I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our remaining 2016 plans.

I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our remaining 2016 plans. Cimarex invested $156 million on exploration and development during the second quarter. About 65% was invested in the Permian region, with the rest going toward activities in the Mid-Continent region.
Company-wide, we brought 34 gross, 14 net wells on production during the quarter. We had an average of 9 operated rigs running during the quarter. These rigs were busy working to hold acreage in both the Wolfcamp and Meramec plays as well as drilling spacing pilots in both the Delaware Basin and the Mid-Continent. That activity is winding down and we are currently running 5 rigs, 3 in the Permian and 2 in Anadarko, an activity level we intend to maintain through the rest of 2016.
While a lot of focus is put on the number of rigs Cimarex is running, completion of the wells has the biggest impact on both well cost and well performance. We are continuing to push the envelope on well completions.
On Page 30 of our presentation, we illustrate the evolution of completion size as measured in pounds of sand per lateral foot drilled. As you can see, completions are evolving across the company. We have several other slides in our presentation that illustrate the uplift we've seen in several of these plays, including the upper Wolfcamp in Culberson County and now the lower Wolfcamp, as shown on Slide 12. Our most recent lower Wolfcamp well, the Flying Ebony 19 State A #5 H was completed with 2,400 pounds of sand per lateral foot and had an average 30-day IP of 3,127 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 23% was oil, 46% gas and 29% was NGL. On average, that IP is 36% higher than previous completions.
The success of the frac design used on the Flying Ebony is more than just a pound of sand per foot increase. It is a direct consequence of Cimarex developing a strong understanding of the geology and rock mechanics for this interval, which in turn leads to design changes, not just in the amount of sand pumped but also in the type of sand, cluster design, cluster count, stage spacing along with the type of fluid. This type of detailed frac design is taking place internally for each of our prospective zones in both basins, which is leading to the strong well performances that we have been achieving across the board.
Regarding our New Mexico Avalon Shale program, Cimarex drilled and completed the 5,000-foot Triste Draw 25 Fed #7 H late last year, implementing an upsized stimulation design in order to determine if we could achieve improved performance for this interval, as seen in other Permian Shale intervals.
As shown on Slide 17 on our presentation, the results for this well have been outstanding. The well achieved a 30-day peak IP rate of 1,811 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 59% was oil, 20% gas and 22% NGL, with a very impressive 180-day rate of 1,317 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 180-day cume of 230,000 barrels of oil equivalent. This kind of result certainly raises the Avalon program to top tier for us going forward.
Capital to be invested in the Permian in the second half 2016 will be focused on completion activity and acreage obligations across our Wolfcamp position in both Culberson and Reeves County. The total capital ascribed to acreage holding in Delaware Basin is just over $230 million in 2016. We currently have 3 rigs running in Delaware Basin and expect to keep them active through the remainder of 2016.
Now onto the Mid-Continent. You will recall that we began drilling the latest Woodford development project on the east side of the Cana core in the fourth quarter 2015. This development covers 6 sections, of which Cimarex operates 2 sections. This infill project consists of 47 gross, 22 net wells. Drilling is finished and completion of the wells has again been moved up and is now scheduled for early September versus October as was discussed in our last call. This change in scheduling was a contributing factor to our increase in capital expenditures for 2016.
As for the Meramec, we continue to drill wells to both hold our acreage and delineate our acreage position. Of note are 2 of our most recent Meramec results, the Peterson and Sims long laterals, whose location can be seen on Slide 19 of the presentation. The Peterson 1H-2821X located in the Northwest part of our Meramec acreage position achieved a 30-day peak average rate of 19 million cubic feet equivalent per day, of which 54% was oil, 30% gas, 16% NGL. While the Sims 1H-2017X located in the southeastern part of our Meramec acreage achieved a 30-day average rate of 12.8 million cubic feet equivalent per day, 29% oil, 46% gas, 25% NGL. These 2 bookend wells on our acreage are good confirmation of our ability to adjust both the landing zone and frac design to achieve very good rate of return -- results across the breadth of our Meramec acreage, and it's why we have chosen to keep 2 rigs running throughout the remainder of the year holding the Meramec acreage.
Finally, to better understand the multi-zone potential for this area, we have recently finished drilling an 8-well stacked/staggered spacing pilot in the Meramec and Woodford formations. See Slide 21 for an illustration of this design. These wells are scheduled to begin completion operations later this month with first production anticipated in the fourth quarter. Results from another Meramec spacing pilot were recently announced by our partner, Devon. The Alma pilot wells had an average IP of 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 60% was oil. The completion of these wells was influential in the stimulation design for the Meramec wells in our stacked/staggered pilot with the final Meramec design using 2,600 pounds of sand per lateral foot. Cimarex holds a 46% working interest in this pilot.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi."

I'll touch on the usual items, our second quarter production, our Q3 and full year '16 production outlook and then finish up with a few comments on LOE and service cost. As Tom mentioned,",1400,"Thank you, John, and thank you, all, for joining our call today. I'll touch on the usual items, our second quarter production, our Q3 and full year '16 production outlook and then finish up with a few comments on LOE and service cost. 
As Tom mentioned, we had yet another great quarter for production with stronger than expected base property and new well performance really driving the quarter. Our second quarter volumes came in better than anticipated. Our reported Q2 total company net equivalent production of 974 million a day beat our guidance projection of 935 million to 965 million, and was up slightly to our Q1 reported volume of 973 million a day rather than down, as we had anticipated last call.
As expected, with accelerated completion activity and increased processing capacity during the second quarter, we saw a nice boost in our Permian production with the addition of a second frac crew in May. We completed 9 Permian wells during the quarter as compared to just 3 in the first quarter. As a result, our second quarter Permian equivalent volume came in at 509 million a day, that's up 32 million a day or 7% from the first quarter.
In the Mid-Continent, continued strong well performance from our Cana Row 4 project, which came online in late fourth quarter last year, supported both our Q1 and our Q2 Mid-Continent volumes. And with that support, our second quarter Mid-Continent equivalent volume averaged 463 million a day, that's up 44 million a day or 11% from Q2 '15. But as expected, with only 5 new wells in the Mid-Continent coming online during the quarter, our second quarter Mid-Continent volumes decreased 30 million a day as compared to Q1.
So as we look forward into the last half of '16, we're projecting further acceleration of completion activity in both our Mid-Continent and Permian programs. And as a result, we're projecting a total of 72 net wells to come online during the year as compared to the 60 net wells we projected last call, with 7 of those additional wells being located in the Permian and 5 in the Mid-Continent.
In the Mid-Continent, we've moved up the start dates for our Cana infill development project to September, as has been previously stated. And that's, again, versus our previous estimate of October. And in the Permian, with the planned addition of a third rig in August, we've also accelerated our completion activity for the most part in fourth quarter, for both of our Bone Spring and Reeves County Wolfcamp programs. As a result, we now anticipate having 22 net wells waiting on completion at year-end, with 11 in both the Mid-Continent and the Permian, and that's down from the 46 total wells that we had waiting on completion here at the end of Q2.
With our strong first half performance and our planned acceleration in completion activity, we've increased our total company full year production guidance to 0.98 to 1 Bcfe per day, that's up from our previous guidance of 940 million to 970 million a day, and would put us, in essence, flat to 2% higher than our 2015 average of 985 -- 984.5 million a day. More importantly, our planned acceleration -- accelerated completion activity gives us very strong momentum going into 2017 with our forecasted Q4 exit rate in the range of 1.02 to 1.07 Bcfe per day, that's 3% to 9% higher than the 986 million a day we posted in Q4 '15. Our oil production plays a big role in our projected Q4 exit rate, with our Q4 Permian and Mid-Continent net oil volumes forecasted to be up 12% to 17% from the volumes that we reported in Q2.
For Q3 '16, with 10 net Permian wells and 3 net Mid-Continent wells expected to come online during the quarter, we're guiding our total company net equivalent volumes to be in the range of 950 million to 980 million a day. That's, in essence, flat with the second quarter. And as we move into Q4, our completion activity really picks up steam with 15 net Permian wells and 26 net Mid-Continent wells planned to come online in the fourth quarter.
Shifting gears to OpEx. We had a nice guidance beat with our second quarter LOE, and we owe it all to our production group's continued and dedicated efforts to optimally reduce our overall operating cost structure. With their focus, we once again saw sizable cost reductions during the quarter in similar components as in quarters past: saltwater disposal, compression, rentals, contract labor. And as such, our Q2 lifting cost came in at $0.65 per Mcfe, well below the low end of our guidance, which was $0.80 to $0.90, down 19% from our first quarter average of $0.80 per Mcfe, and down 22% from the $0.83 we averaged in 2015.
So after incorporating our continued cost control efforts and also taking into account the fluctuating nature of workover expenses, we've projected our remaining year lifting cost to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.75 per Mcfe.
I want to take a moment just to say we're extremely proud of our entire production ops team for their success in safely and effectively reducing our LOE. The progress is sizable. Since prices began falling back in 2014, we've seen our absolute monthly net LOE drop approximately $9 million a month, which on an annualized basis, has, in essence, freed up over $100 million a year that we can direct to our drilling program.
And finally, on service cost. Some very similar comments to our last call with regard to drilling and completion cost, most all of our drilling cost components have remained relatively in check, while we have seen some modest reductions in per-unit completion cost, primarily in the Permian. On the drilling side, we've kept our focus on efficiencies, as illustrated with our average 2016 Bone Spring spud to rig release drill time of 10 days, that's down from 12 days in '15 and 14 days in 2014. 
On the completions side, we've seen continued cost reductions in the Permian, both from a frac cost standpoint as well as in the cost to source our water, which has really helped to negate the additional cost of us pumping larger jobs. 
As we continue to increase our frac size, completion dollars continue to dominate our total well cost, representing up to 2/3 of the individual total well cost for each well. As in quarters past, we've been able to offset the costs of the larger fracs with lower per unit pumping costs. And as such, most of our generic AFEs have remained somewhat in check as compared to last quarter. An exception, however, is our Permian Bone Spring program where both drilling and completion efficiencies have reduced our current 1 mile lateral AFEs to $4.7 million to $5.1 million, that's down 6% from the $5 million to $5.4 million that we quoted last quarter.
In the Wolfcamp, with larger completions, our current generic 2-mile lateral Culberson AFEs continue to run in the $10.2 million to $11.2 million range. That's flat to last call, but down 5% from where we were in Q4, and down 23% from that program's AFE back in late 2014.
With our larger frac design, our Cana core 1-mile lateral Woodford AFE is running in the range of $7.1 million to $7.5 million, up from the $6.6 million to $7 million range we previously quoted with the smaller frac, but right in line with the $500,000 to $600,000 anticipated increase that we quoted last call, should we adopt and implement the larger fracs, which we are. But even with the larger frac, our current Cana 1-mile Woodford well's down 10% on a total well cost as compared to late 2014.
As we drill more 2-mile lateral Meramec wells, our current AFEs are running in the range of $10.7 million to $11.4 million, all the while, we continue to experiment with various frac designs and landing depths and so on.
In closing, we had another great quarter. We made tremendous strides reducing our overall operating cost structure. We stayed -- we're staying focused on efficiencies to reduce and optimize our drilling and completion costs, and we continue to make good progress maximizing the productivity and profitability of our wells.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Q&A."

And it is a challenge and it's a pretty high-class problem to have. We have 2 outstanding plays and we have outstanding acreage positions in both plays, and acreage positions that allow for 10,000-foot-long horizontal wells. You sum all that together and it's a real dilemma on how we allocate capital. Now I will say, as I said in the past, that some of our best well level returns are in the Bone Spring, in the Delaware Basin. Certainly, the 10,000-foot-long Wolfcamp wells are fantastic and getting better. And as John said, the Avalon is really roaring to compete heads-up with everything I just mentioned. I would say the Delaware at the well level rate of return is at the top of the pack. But that Anadarko story is evolving and not very far behind. If some of these new landing zones and new stimulations, if the Sims, Peterson and some of the wells announced by our competitors, if these results are repeatable across large portion of our 115,000 Meramec acres, then it's going to really give us angst on how we allocate capital because there's also science and delineation we want to do. So we're always balancing what's the absolute high rate of return on our next investment, with looking 5, 10 years ahead, what information do we want and when do we want it? So in terms of capital allocation, we're going ahead with 3 rigs in the Delaware and 2 rigs in the STACK play, and we think both those rigs or both those programs are designed to give us a lot of information, both landing zone, completion optimization and geological delineation. And so we're fairly comfortable with that 3-rig Delaware, 2-rig Anadarko right now. If prices were to improve materially, I think, it's a function of if oil or gas improves. But right now, the Delaware is probably the strongest voice for incremental capital if we were to increase above and beyond that."

And in that particular play, we clearly, in our own minds, have demonstrated the uplift of going to 10,000. So just imagine taking a Cabinet State and taking it 10,000, it would be even that much better. I think, what you're also seeing at Cabinet State is, again, and Tom does a nice job of talking about this, just us -- leveraging frac design changes, say, in the upper Wolfcamp and Culberson over to Reeves and back and forth, and that's a good example, along with we have our major development there next to the Big Timber where we're about to start fracking with the Wood wells. We're clearly taking that frac design that we implemented overall in the upper Wolfcamp pilot there over to those wells. So we're seeing really good results there throughout that part of Reeves County, and we're very excited about it and we got a lot of drilling to do there, remainder of this year and the next year. And then, finally, when I think about it, the thing also that's changing there, and we talk a lot about, is landing zone. We are definitely getting much more comfortable in Reeves as to where we want to land those wells, and I think it's leading to the kind of results you're seeing as well. So it's kind of a combination of those -- kind of sounds like a broken record, but both frac, uplift and landing zone."

But I will tell you, this well result has definitely caused us to ask what's next. And I would not be surprised if we go back up on that acreage and push the envelope again in terms of our stimulation design and with a long lateral, that's the one thing, I think, next step we'd like to take in the Avalon is get a long lateral under our belt with this type of stimulation and then really see what kind of rate of returns we can achieve. And then, probably, the next step for us is then spacing. We've already announced before that we did spacing pilots in the past in the Avalon. We feel very good at 8 wells per section for the individual interval. And again, there are multiple intervals in the Avalon. We probably need to go out there and test tighter spacing, but we're also blessed that we have a lot of competitors in and around our HBP acreage who are doing just that. So we're not in a vacuum there. So we'll learn a lot from looking across the fence.

And we think that if prices were to stable at $45 and the $2.50 to $3 gas range, we've got a great landscape ahead of us. And I've said in the past, we're not waiting for the rescue boat to save us. Our challenge to the organization was to figure out how to make a living in this environment. And I will say that our organizations has respond to that call in every way, both in increased well performance and decreased costs and lease operating. So we're in pretty good shape if we see stability."

In general, we do believe that incremental capital you spend on a longer lateral is well worth it relative to the rate of return we achieve, and we've demonstrated that throughout our portfolio. But again, it's fair to say, the majority of our portfolio is in pressured rock, and that's where most of our experience. We do not have a lot of experience in drilling long laterals in lower pressured -- close to normal pressure type rocks. And something else also that happens. We've talked a lot about this. Once you move up in that normal pressured part of the play, more oilier play, you're also talking about a part of the play were it's shallower, so your cost to get there, the vertical part of it, is very inexpensive. You don't need that extra string of pipe, you drill it very quickly. And a lot of times, when we think about long laterals, we love them because it's pretty expensive for us to get there, to get to the target, so once we're there, we want to stay there as long as we can. In fact, I would argue, our drilling department wants to know why we stop at 10,000 feet. And in some ways, internally, we talk about that. But the big difference is when you go updip, it's pretty cheap to get down there to get to the zone. So then, you got to ask yourself, operationally, does that extra 5,000 feet really gain you a lot or not. And we just don't have a lot of experience with that. I'll be honest with you. All our experience has been in the pressure but we're watching it very, very carefully ourselves. As Tom said, we're always looking across the fence and asking ourself, maybe, maybe in that shallow or normal pressure, maybe 5,000 is a better way to go than 10,000. I don't know that answer right now. We'll see over time."

It all comes down to what John just said earlier. It's going to be a matter of economics. So if these prices do creep up, or the costs do creep up, we're always going to be looking at, for that job, what will it cost? What are the results we expect to achieve pumping that job? And does it merit going with the larger job or should we deviate somewhere plus or minus from there in design?

We're constantly working hard to keep them low and we're constantly focused on rate of return."

But we've got the right lens, and I'm very confident we have the right lens, and its after-tax rate of return. And so yes, in answer to your question, some of the aggressiveness that we've had in adding to our proppant loads certainly has been facilitated by how low our cost structure has been. And if we have a pressure, either through commodity pricing or service cost, we're going to look at that on a rate of return basis and try to find the optimal solution. We don't look at production rates and say, the highest production rate is our best solution. We always, always at Cimarex, look at rate of return on the investment it required.

Well, it certainly keeps us busy trying to juggle everything you just described. In regards to Cana, I'm just going to tell you, I'm extremely excited for our future drilling activity in Cana from the standpoint of the kind of returns, especially now that we look at it as a long lateral development. And again, keep that in mind, everything up-to-date in Cana has been 5,000 feet, but given the continuity of our acreage that we, along with our AMI partner, Devon, have, we, together, are starting to have those discussions over long lateral development. And indeed, I think, you will hear from us in the coming quarters start talking more about where that next development will take place for us. This row about to bring on is pretty exciting. It's a more liquid rich part of the Cana-Woodford shale. I'm also excited because our partner there, Devon, has drilled 4 2-mile laterals, so we'll get a chance to see those in the development phase, how they look. And we have a wonderful position between the two of us just north of that, that we call the 13 8 area that we definitely see a long lateral development, it's just a question of the two of us coming together at some point and planning that out and then we'll see when that starts. So you're absolutely right. Cana looks very good, but it's also a matter of how do you get that funded versus everything else that we're trying to answer in the Meramec and in the Wolfcamp and every other play we have. The other comment I want to make real quick is we really did a lot earlier this year with our spacing pilots. And yes, we don't have a lot to talk about them just yet, but we put a lot of capital early in the year in these pilots in the Wolfcamp and in the Meramec, and that's really going to set us up very well for the coming years when we start moving to full-scale development where we get the kind of confidence to deploy those large amount of capital, say, in the Wolfcamp or the Meramec like we are already today for the Woodford, and that's just going to put even more pressure on Tom to open up the purse string and let us spend more money as we get there."

And you're right in your observation that, wait a minute, what about the Woodford. It's a good question. But part of the way that we are honoring the quality of the Woodford is we need to understand that Meramec, so that when we develop out here, we really exploit this resource in the most prudent fashion. We have to understand how many landing zones we have. We have to understand the full potential of the Meramec. The thing we absolutely do not want to do is go into Cana-Woodford development and then find out that the Meramec was left behind, and that if we come in and get it later, we have a real production interference and disruption. So part of our aggressiveness in testing the Meramec is to set ourselves up for codevelopment between the Woodford and the Meramec, and we still have a lot of things to learn. So we're high on the Woodford, probably higher today than we've ever been."

So kind of on a gas liquid basis, it's almost a 50-50 split. And so again, that's why we're very encouraged. We think we're going to get very good returns out of this row. And as far as the completion itself, I think, Devon himself will speak to their wells. But for our wells, we are moving forward with the design that we deployed on the Armacost section. I think, if you refer to Page 30, we talked about that where we were up to 3,500 pounds per foot. We really, really like the results from the Armacost. In fact, we didn't even talk much about that, but we have a really nice slide showing how Armacost wells are behaving just as well as our other sections. And yet, we put an additional well within that section, new well. So we're able to get an extra well, and yet, still get similar results, meaning we're getting more reserves per section, out of that section. So we feel really good about that frac design.

On the call today, John will walk us through our recent results and describe our progress  
on some of the delineation projects that we have underway. This will include results from  
delineation in the Meramec and completion modifications that have further improved our  
results in the lower Wolfcamp.
In the Meramec, John will discuss results from 2 recent 10,000-foot horizontal wells that  
are significant in their performance, but they're also encouraging in the manner in which  
they're delineating our acreage. In the Wolfcamp, John will discuss some recent results  
from completion optimization, including an outstanding recent 10,000-foot well in lower  
Wolfcamp in Culberson County. We're making great strides in improving our well results  
across our portfolio.
Additionally, we are confirming our optimism regarding the uplift we see from 10,000-foot  
horizontal wells. Not only are these wells delivering outstanding 30-day and 180-day  
rates, they're exhibiting surprisingly low decline.
Joe will follow John with an operational overview, including some of the steps we have  
taken to improve field efficiencies. As Joe will describe, he and his team have made great  
progress in getting our lease operating expenses down. There are many components to the  
progress that Joe will report, including smart, well-engineered water management,  
personnel and equipment efficiencies, liftoff to optimization, compressor optimization and  
others. The result in savings incurred and future lease operating expenses are significant  
to Cimarex.
We reported another production beat this quarter driven by continued improvement in well  
performance. Our total company production was 974 million cubic feet equivalent per day  
for the second quarter, which exceeded the high end of our guidance. Gas production was  
up, while oil production was down slightly. As we had forecasted, this was due to fewer  
well completions in the Permian Basin due to the timing of our infill and spacing -- pilot  
completions. As we pick up the pace on our Permian completions during the second half of  
the year, we expect our oil production to trend upwards. Combined with oil production  
expected from the Woodford completions in East Cana, we expect oil production to be up  
approximately 15% in the fourth quarter versus second quarter levels.
Operating expenses, with the exception of G&A, came in within guidance, resulting in a  
strong quarter overall. G&A was slightly above guidance as we recorded the cost of an  
early retirement package offered to employees in the first quarter that was finalized in  
June. We also announced an increase in our 2016 capital budget. We have raised our  
guidance from a range of $650 million to $700 million of exploration and development  
capital to $750 million for 2016. This includes $600 million earmarked for drilling and  
completions, up $100 million from the high end of our previous guidance. The increased  
capital will be used to further delineate the Meramec formation in the Anadarko Basin,  
push the completion of Woodford infill wells forward and add a handful of new wells to our  
Delaware Basin program.
Our bigger, more effective stimulations are also adding to our capital. This is money well  
spent as shown by our well results. We now see our operated rig count holding at 5 for the  
remainder of 2016.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John to provide further color in our program."

I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before  getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our remaining  2016 plans. Cimarex invested $156 million on exploration and developme",1033,"Thanks, Tom. I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before  
getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our remaining  
2016 plans. Cimarex invested $156 million on exploration and development during the second  
quarter. About 65% was invested in the Permian region, with the rest going toward  
activities in the Mid-Continent region.
Company-wide, we brought 34 gross, 14 net wells on production during the quarter. We had  
an average of 9 operated rigs running during the quarter. These rigs were busy working to  
hold acreage in both the Wolfcamp and Meramec plays as well as drilling spacing pilots in  
both the Delaware Basin and the Mid-Continent. That activity is winding down and we are  
currently running 5 rigs, 3 in the Permian and 2 in Anadarko, an activity level we intend  
to maintain through the rest of 2016.
While a lot of focus is put on the number of rigs Cimarex is running, completion of the  
wells has the biggest impact on both well cost and well performance. We are continuing to  
push the envelope on well completions.
On Page 30 of our presentation, we illustrate the evolution of completion size as measured  
in pounds of sand per lateral foot drilled. As you can see, completions are evolving  
across the company. We have several other slides in our presentation that illustrate the  
uplift we've seen in several of these plays, including the upper Wolfcamp in Culberson  
County and now the lower Wolfcamp, as shown on Slide 12. Our most recent lower Wolfcamp  
well, the Flying Ebony 19 State A #5 H was completed with 2,400 pounds of sand per lateral  
foot and had an average 30-day IP of 3,127 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 23%  
was oil, 46% gas and 29% was NGL. On average, that IP is 36% higher than previous  
completions.
The success of the frac design used on the Flying Ebony is more than just a pound of sand  
per foot increase. It is a direct consequence of Cimarex developing a strong understanding  
of the geology and rock mechanics for this interval, which in turn leads to design  
changes, not just in the amount of sand pumped but also in the type of sand, cluster  
design, cluster count, stage spacing along with the type of fluid. This type of detailed  
frac design is taking place internally for each of our prospective zones in both basins,  
which is leading to the strong well performances that we have been achieving across the  
board.
Regarding our New Mexico Avalon Shale program, Cimarex drilled and completed the 5,000- 
foot Triste Draw 25 Fed #7 H late last year, implementing an upsized stimulation design in  
order to determine if we could achieve improved performance for this interval, as seen in  
other Permian Shale intervals.
As shown on Slide 17 on our presentation, the results for this well have been outstanding.  
The well achieved a 30-day peak IP rate of 1,811 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of  
which 59% was oil, 20% gas and 22% NGL, with a very impressive 180-day rate of 1,317  
barrels of oil equivalent per day and 180-day cume of 230,000 barrels of oil equivalent.  
This kind of result certainly raises the Avalon program to top tier for us going forward.
Capital to be invested in the Permian in the second half 2016 will be focused on  
completion activity and acreage obligations across our Wolfcamp position in both Culberson  
and Reeves County. The total capital ascribed to acreage holding in Delaware Basin is just  
over $230 million in 2016. We currently have 3 rigs running in Delaware Basin and expect  
to keep them active through the remainder of 2016.
Now onto the Mid-Continent. You will recall that we began drilling the latest Woodford  
development project on the east side of the Cana core in the fourth quarter 2015. This  
development covers 6 sections, of which Cimarex operates 2 sections. This infill project  
consists of 47 gross, 22 net wells. Drilling is finished and completion of the wells has  
again been moved up and is now scheduled for early September versus October as was  
discussed in our last call. This change in scheduling was a contributing factor to our  
increase in capital expenditures for 2016.
As for the Meramec, we continue to drill wells to both hold our acreage and delineate our  
acreage position. Of note are 2 of our most recent Meramec results, the Peterson and Sims  
long laterals, whose location can be seen on Slide 19 of the presentation. The Peterson  
1H-2821X located in the Northwest part of our Meramec acreage position achieved a 30-day  
peak average rate of 19 million cubic feet equivalent per day, of which 54% was oil, 30%  
gas, 16% NGL. While the Sims 1H-2017X located in the southeastern part of our Meramec  
acreage achieved a 30-day average rate of 12.8 million cubic feet equivalent per day, 29%  
oil, 46% gas, 25% NGL. These 2 bookend wells on our acreage are good confirmation of our  
ability to adjust both the landing zone and frac design to achieve very good rate of  
return -- results across the breadth of our Meramec acreage, and it's why we have chosen  
to keep 2 rigs running throughout the remainder of the year holding the Meramec acreage.
Finally, to better understand the multi-zone potential for this area, we have recently  
finished drilling an 8-well stacked/staggered spacing pilot in the Meramec and Woodford  
formations. See Slide 21 for an illustration of this design. These wells are scheduled to  
begin completion operations later this month with first production anticipated in the  
fourth quarter. Results from another Meramec spacing pilot were recently announced by our  
partner, Devon. The Alma pilot wells had an average IP of 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent  
per day, of which 60% was oil. The completion of these wells was influential in the  
stimulation design for the Meramec wells in our stacked/staggered pilot with the final  
Meramec design using 2,600 pounds of sand per lateral foot. Cimarex holds a 46% working  
interest in this pilot.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi."

the second quarter, we saw a nice boost in our Permian production with the addition of a  
second frac crew in May. We completed 9 Permian wells during the quarter as compared to  
just 3 in the first quarter. As a result, our second quarter Permian equivalent volume  
came in at 509 million a day, that's up 32 million a day or 7% from the first quarter.
In the Mid-Continent, continued strong well performance from our Cana Row 4 project, which  
came online in late fourth quarter last year, supported both our Q1 and our Q2 Mid- 
Continent volumes. And with that support, our second quarter Mid-Continent equivalent  
volume averaged 463 million a day, that's up 44 million a day or 11% from Q2 '15. But as  
expected, with only 5 new wells in the Mid-Continent coming online during the quarter, our  
second quarter Mid-Continent volumes decreased 30 million a day as compared to Q1.
So as we look forward into the last half of '16, we're projecting further acceleration of  
completion activity in both our Mid-Continent and Permian programs. And as a result, we're  
projecting a total of 72 net wells to come online during the year as compared to the 60  
net wells we projected last call, with 7 of those additional wells being located in the  
Permian and 5 in the Mid-Continent.
In the Mid-Continent, we've moved up the start dates for our Cana infill development  
project to September, as has been previously stated. And that's, again, versus our  
previous estimate of October. And in the Permian, with the planned addition of a third rig  
in August, we've also accelerated our completion activity for the most part in fourth  
quarter, for both of our Bone Spring and Reeves County Wolfcamp programs. As a result, we  
now anticipate having 22 net wells waiting on completion at year-end, with 11 in both the  
Mid-Continent and the Permian, and that's down from the 46 total wells that we had waiting  
on completion here at the end of Q2.
With our strong first half performance and our planned acceleration in completion  
activity, we've increased our total company full year production guidance to 0.98 to 1  
Bcfe per day, that's up from our previous guidance of 940 million to 970 million a day,  
and would put us, in essence, flat to 2% higher than our 2015 average of 985 -- 984.5  
million a day. More importantly, our planned acceleration -- accelerated completion  
activity gives us very strong momentum going into 2017 with our forecasted Q4 exit rate in  
the range of 1.02 to 1.07 Bcfe per day, that's 3% to 9% higher than the 986 million a day  
we posted in Q4 '15. Our oil production plays a big role in our projected Q4 exit rate,  
with our Q4 Permian and Mid-Continent net oil volumes forecasted to be up 12% to 17% from  
the volumes that we reported in Q2.
For Q3 '16, with 10 net Permian wells and 3 net Mid-Continent wells expected to come  
online during the quarter, we're guiding our total company net equivalent volumes to be in  
the range of 950 million to 980 million a day. That's, in essence, flat with the second  
quarter. And as we move into Q4, our completion activity really picks up steam with 15 net  
Permian wells and 26 net Mid-Continent wells planned to come online in the fourth quarter.
Shifting gears to OpEx. We had a nice guidance beat with our second quarter LOE, and we  
owe it all to our production group's continued and dedicated efforts to optimally reduce  
our overall operating cost structure. With their focus, we once again saw sizable cost  
reductions during the quarter in similar components as in quarters past: saltwater  
disposal, compression, rentals, contract labor. And as such, our Q2 lifting cost came in  
at $0.65 per Mcfe, well below the low end of our guidance, which was $0.80 to $0.90, down  
19% from our first quarter average of $0.80 per Mcfe, and down 22% from the $0.83 we  
averaged in 2015.
So after incorporating our continued cost control efforts and also taking into account the  
fluctuating nature of workover expenses, we've projected our remaining year lifting cost  
to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.75 per Mcfe.
I want to take a moment just to say we're extremely proud of our entire production ops  
team for their success in safely and effectively reducing our LOE. The progress is  
sizable. Since prices began falling back in 2014, we've seen our absolute monthly net LOE  
drop approximately $9 million a month, which on an annualized basis, has, in essence,  
freed up over $100 million a year that we can direct to our drilling program.
And finally, on service cost. Some very similar comments to our last call with regard to  
drilling and completion cost, most all of our drilling cost components have remained  
relatively in check, while we have seen some modest reductions in per-unit completion  
cost, primarily in the Permian. On the drilling side, we've kept our focus on  
efficiencies, as illustrated with our average 2016 Bone Spring spud to rig release drill  
time of 10 days, that's down from 12 days in '15 and 14 days in 2014. 
On the completions side, we've seen continued cost reductions in the Permian, both from a  
frac cost standpoint as well as in the cost to source our water, which has really helped  
to negate the additional cost of us pumping larger jobs. 
As we continue to increase our frac size, completion dollars continue to dominate our  
total well cost, representing up to 2/3 of the individual total well cost for each well.  
As in quarters past, we've been able to offset the costs of the larger fracs with lower  
per unit pumping costs. And as such, most of our generic AFEs have remained somewhat in  
check as compared to last quarter. An exception, however, is our Permian Bone Spring  
program where both drilling and completion efficiencies have reduced our current 1 mile  
lateral AFEs to $4.7 million to $5.1 million, that's down 6% from the $5 million to $5.4  
million that we quoted last quarter.
In the Wolfcamp, with larger completions, our current generic 2-mile lateral Culberson  
AFEs continue to run in the $10.2 million to $11.2 million range. That's flat to last  
call, but down 5% from where we were in Q4, and down 23% from that program's AFE back in  
late 2014.
With our larger frac design, our Cana core 1-mile lateral Woodford AFE is running in the  
range of $7.1 million to $7.5 million, up from the $6.6 million to $7 million range we  
previously quoted with the smaller frac, but right in line with the $500,000 to $600,000  
anticipated increase that we quoted last call, should we adopt and implement the larger  
fracs, which we are. But even with the larger frac, our current Cana 1-mile Woodford  
well's down 10% on a total well cost as compared to late 2014.
As we drill more 2-mile lateral Meramec wells, our current AFEs are running in the range  
of $10.7 million to $11.4 million, all the while, we continue to experiment with various  
frac designs and landing depths and so on.
In closing, we had another great quarter. We made tremendous strides reducing our overall  
operating cost structure. We stayed -- we're staying focused on efficiencies to reduce and  
optimize our drilling and completion costs, and we continue to make good progress  
maximizing the productivity and profitability of our wells.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Q&A."

And it is a challenge and it's a pretty high-class problem  
to have. We have 2 outstanding plays and we have outstanding acreage positions in both  
plays, and acreage positions that allow for 10,000-foot-long horizontal wells. You sum all  
that together and it's a real dilemma on how we allocate capital. Now I will say, as I  
said in the past, that some of our best well level returns are in the Bone Spring, in the  
Delaware Basin. Certainly, the 10,000-foot-long Wolfcamp wells are fantastic and getting  
better. And as John said, the Avalon is really roaring to compete heads-up with everything  
I just mentioned. I would say the Delaware at the well level rate of return is at the top  
of the pack. But that Anadarko story is evolving and not very far behind. If some of these  
new landing zones and new stimulations, if the Sims, Peterson and some of the wells  
announced by our competitors, if these results are repeatable across large portion of our  
115,000 Meramec acres, then it's going to really give us angst on how we allocate capital  
because there's also science and delineation we want to do. So we're always balancing  
what's the absolute high rate of return on our next investment, with looking 5, 10 years  
ahead, what information do we want and when do we want it? So in terms of capital  
allocation, we're going ahead with 3 rigs in the Delaware and 2 rigs in the STACK play,  
and we think both those rigs or both those programs are designed to give us a lot of  
information, both landing zone, completion optimization and geological delineation. And so  
we're fairly comfortable with that 3-rig Delaware, 2-rig Anadarko right now. If prices  
were to improve materially, I think, it's a function of if oil or gas improves. But right  
now, the Delaware is probably the strongest voice for incremental capital if we were to  
increase above and beyond that."

was a 5,000-foot lateral. And in that particular play, we clearly, in our own minds, have  
demonstrated the uplift of going to 10,000. So just imagine taking a Cabinet State and  
taking it 10,000, it would be even that much better. I think, what you're also seeing at  
Cabinet State is, again, and Tom does a nice job of talking about this, just us --  
leveraging frac design changes, say, in the upper Wolfcamp and Culberson over to Reeves  
and back and forth, and that's a good example, along with we have our major development  
there next to the Big Timber where we're about to start fracking with the Wood wells.  
We're clearly taking that frac design that we implemented overall in the upper Wolfcamp  
pilot there over to those wells. So we're seeing really good results there throughout that  
part of Reeves County, and we're very excited about it and we got a lot of drilling to do  
there, remainder of this year and the next year. And then, finally, when I think about it,  
the thing also that's changing there, and we talk a lot about, is landing zone. We are  
definitely getting much more comfortable in Reeves as to where we want to land those  
wells, and I think it's leading to the kind of results you're seeing as well. So it's kind

next. And I would not be surprised if we go back up on that acreage and push the envelope  
again in terms of our stimulation design and with a long lateral, that's the one thing, I  
think, next step we'd like to take in the Avalon is get a long lateral under our belt with  
this type of stimulation and then really see what kind of rate of returns we can achieve.  
And then, probably, the next step for us is then spacing. We've already announced before  
that we did spacing pilots in the past in the Avalon. We feel very good at 8 wells per  
section for the individual interval. And again, there are multiple intervals in the  
Avalon. We probably need to go out there and test tighter spacing, but we're also blessed  
that we have a lot of competitors in and around our HBP acreage who are doing just that.  
So we're not in a vacuum there. So we'll learn a lot from looking across the fence. But

fair to say, the majority of our portfolio is in pressured rock, and that's where most of  
our experience. We do not have a lot of experience in drilling long laterals in lower  
pressured -- close to normal pressure type rocks. And something else also that happens.  
We've talked a lot about this. Once you move up in that normal pressured part of the play,  
more oilier play, you're also talking about a part of the play were it's shallower, so  
your cost to get there, the vertical part of it, is very inexpensive. You don't need that  
extra string of pipe, you drill it very quickly. And a lot of times, when we think about  
long laterals, we love them because it's pretty expensive for us to get there, to get to  
the target, so once we're there, we want to stay there as long as we can. In fact, I would  
argue, our drilling department wants to know why we stop at 10,000 feet. And in some ways,  
internally, we talk about that. But the big difference is when you go updip, it's pretty  
cheap to get down there to get to the zone. So then, you got to ask yourself,  
operationally, does that extra 5,000 feet really gain you a lot or not. And we just don't  
have a lot of experience with that. I'll be honest with you. All our experience has been  
in the pressure but we're watching it very, very carefully ourselves. As Tom said, we're  
always looking across the fence and asking ourself, maybe, maybe in that shallow or normal  
pressure, maybe 5,000 is a better way to go than 10,000. I don't know that answer right  
now. We'll see over time."

after-tax rate of return. And so yes, in answer to your question, some of the  
aggressiveness that we've had in adding to our proppant loads certainly has been  
facilitated by how low our cost structure has been. And if we have a pressure, either  
through commodity pricing or service cost, we're going to look at that on a rate of return  
basis and try to find the optimal solution. We don't look at production rates and say, the  
highest production rate is our best solution. We always, always at Cimarex, look at rate  
of return on the investment it required. So I have a lot of confidence in free markets. If  
market forces cause us to find a different path forward, I think, our focus on rate of  
return is exactly the way to navigate that."

we're finding is the Meramec, because it is a series of prograding wedges, if you put  
yourself in a different wedge and find the right landing zone, you can find that you can  
overcome that variability. So we still see it as a highly variable play. I think, there

the Woodford shale. The Woodford shale, we fairly early on and particularly with our new  
stimulations, got to a point where we think we understand the regional consistency. We can  
drill a well anywhere in our asset and fairly accurately predict the yield. And we're  
fairly comfortable at a fairly high level making decisions. When we go to the Meramec, I  
will tell you that John and I get pretty into the weeds on looking at that stratigraphy,

described. In regards to Cana, I'm just going to tell you, I'm extremely excited for our  
future drilling activity in Cana from the standpoint of the kind of returns, especially  
now that we look at it as a long lateral development. And again, keep that in mind,  
everything up-to-date in Cana has been 5,000 feet, but given the continuity of our acreage  
that we, along with our AMI partner, Devon, have, we, together, are starting to have those  
discussions over long lateral development. And indeed, I think, you will hear from us in  
the coming quarters start talking more about where that next development will take place  
for us. This row about to bring on is pretty exciting. It's a more liquid rich part of the  
Cana-Woodford shale. I'm also excited because our partner there, Devon, has drilled 4 2- 
mile laterals, so we'll get a chance to see those in the development phase, how they look.  
And we have a wonderful position between the two of us just north of that, that we call  
the 13 8 area that we definitely see a long lateral development, it's just a question of  
the two of us coming together at some point and planning that out and then we'll see when  
that starts. So you're absolutely right. Cana looks very good, but it's also a matter of  
how do you get that funded versus everything else that we're trying to answer in the  
Meramec and in the Wolfcamp and every other play we have. The other comment I want to make  
real quick is we really did a lot earlier this year with our spacing pilots. And yes, we  
don't have a lot to talk about them just yet, but we put a lot of capital early in the  
year in these pilots in the Wolfcamp and in the Meramec, and that's really going to set us  
up very well for the coming years when we start moving to full-scale development where we  
get the kind of confidence to deploy those large amount of capital, say, in the Wolfcamp  
or the Meramec like we are already today for the Woodford, and that's just going to put  
even more pressure on Tom to open up the purse string and let us spend more money as we  
get there."

right in your observation that, wait a minute, what about the Woodford. It's a good

resource in the most prudent fashion. We have to understand how many landing zones we  
have. We have to understand the full potential of the Meramec. The thing we absolutely do  
not want to do is go into Cana-Woodford development and then find out that the Meramec was  
left behind, and that if we come in and get it later, we have a real production  
interference and disruption. So part of our aggressiveness in testing the Meramec is to  
set ourselves up for codevelopment between the Woodford and the Meramec, and we still have  
a lot of things to learn. So we're high on the Woodford, probably higher today than we've

As always, we appreciate your interest and look forward to your questions during the question-and-answer portion of the call. 
On the call today, John will walk us through our recent results and describe our progress on the delineation projects that we have under way, and then Joe will follow John with a detailed operational overview. For the first time in a long time, our production came in below guidance. We average 947 million cubic feet equivalent per day in the third quarter, slightly below our guidance of 950 million to 980 million cubic feet per day. We expected third quarter to represent the low point in our production for the year. However, we faced delays in our completions, owing in large part, to the timing effect of our upsized simulations. We did not properly plan for significant impact or shedding on offset wells during completion operations, nor did we fully account for the 7 million cubic feet equivalent loss to higher ethane rejection. The combined effect of these factors caused us not only to miss on the third quarter, but to bring down the fourth quarter outlook as well. We don't like to miss our forecasts on any of these items and quite frankly, we need to do better. 
I think it's worthwhile to put the delay in our production trajectory into context. Cimarex responded swiftly and deliberately to the downdraft in commodity prices that reached its in February of this year. In the fall of 2014, we had 26 operated rigs range. We reached the low in summer of 2016 with 4 operated rigs. As we ramp our activity in the second half of 2016, a disproportionate amount of our operated and nonoperated drilling was on large multi-pud pilot development projects. This concentration of effort on a handful of large projects, put our production ramp at particular risk to timing delays. That said, we offer no excuses. We need to do a better job of risking these potential delays and building them into our forecasts. We've learned the hard way the wisdom of Yogi Berra, who said, ""It's tough to make predictions especially about the future."" 
Our 2016 exploration capital budget is now $785 million, that's up $35 million from previous estimates. The increase is tied primarily to the activity associated with rig additions this year, and approximately $15 million in seismic and acreage acquisitions we made in the third quarter. Even though our production ramp has been delayed into Q1 2017, much of the completion costs associated with this ramp will be incurred in 2016. 
In yesterday's release, we gave preliminary guidance for 2017. And I want to be clear that this is preliminary. We want to give some clarity on what 2017 looks for us, but these numbers for capital, for production, these are the baseline numbers. We certainly have tremendous wherewithal to accelerate. We'll enter 2017 with great momentum as the aforementioned deferred completions come roaring back. We currently model total production growth in 2017 to be 9% to 14% year-over-year with an overweight in oil production embedded in this growth. We also gave guidance on drilling and completion portion of our capital. Based on our current plans, we plan to invest $600 million in those activities next year. $600 million is within our cash flow for 2017 as we currently model it. So again, we think of this as a baseline. We have the ability to add activity as the year unfolds and in fact, we're currently looking hard at several projects we have in the drawing board. As always, we will give you an updated look at our capital plans in our next call, that will be in February, and that will include our total EMD expenditures as well as our first quarter 2017 production. By then, I expect to have tremendous clarity on additional projects and what it looks like as we move ahead on that baseline. 
Enough about production. I want to spend a few minutes talking about what we're really excited about. We continue to foresee the envelope in completion optimization and innovation. We are seeing outstanding results that have implications for well spacing and landing zones. In both the Delaware and Anadarko basins, we're planning pilots for 2017 that will test even tighter well spacing. These tests have tremendous implications for the depth and richness of our inventory. We built Cimarex on exploration, and we are hard at work, developing new ideas. We have challenged our organization to develop new play concepts and opportunities, where the cost of entry is low and real value is created for our shareholders. 
Our organization has responded accordingly, and we are working on a number of ideas that hopefully, will be subjects for future quarterly calls. Idea generation, execution and innovation have always been the heartbeat of Cimarex and it's what distinguishes us from an outstanding field of competitors. We are playing to our strength as we seek that proprietary edge that lets us slip in ahead of the crowd. We are some of the finest assets and one of the finest organizations in the business. Stay tuned. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to John to provide further color on our program."

I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our remaining 2016 plans. 
Cimarex invested $175 million on exploration and development during the third quarter. About 61% was invested in the Permian region, with the rest going toward activities in the Mid-Continent region. Company-wide, we brought 42 gross, 17 net wells on production during the quarter. We had an average of 5 operated rigs running during the quarter. These rigs were busy working the whole acreage, in both the Wolfcamp and Meramec plays. 
We have recently added to 3 rigs, 1 in the Anadarko and 2 in the Delaware Basin, and we have plans to add another rig in Anadarko by year end. While we work through our completion backlog, we will pick up the pace on our drilling activity as we head into 2017. 
As planned, during the third quarter, we brought the 67,500-foot [ph] long lateral Upper Wolfcamp wells online that comprise our spacing pilot in the Upper Wolfcamp in Culberson County. These completions used about 2,400 pounds of sand per foot, while also incorporating design parameters, such as stage phasing, cluster count and cluster spacing from some of our more recent current well frac designs. These wells have been flowing back now for just over 90 days and yet, we still have not achieved a peak 30-day average rate. This result is not unexpected since it usually takes our Upper Wolfcamp wells much longer to clean up and reach their peak production rates relative to the lower Wolfcamp Culberson wells.  The result of the phasing pilot are especially meaningful, in light of a recent results to further delineate the Upper Wolfcamp interval and Culberson County. 
Earlier this year, we completed the King Ben [ph] 2045 [ph] state unit 2H which is located in the western half of our Culberson acreage. On our presentation, Slide 10 identifies location of the Kingben [ph] well. Before this well, most of our Upper Wolfcamp drilling had been in the southeastern part of our acreage. This 10,000-foot lateral had a 30-day peak average rate of 2,057 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 1,192 barrels or 58% was oil. The Kingben was completed with 1,700 pounds of sand per lateral foot, and came online in late April. In its first 180 days, the well has cumulative production of 308,000 barrels of oil equivalent, including 169,000 barrels of oil. This excellent delineation result opens up our acreage on the western half of Culberson County, where we plan to do further testing in 2017. 
We also just finished drilling in Upper Wolfcamp well, north of the Kingben well and Eddy County, which depending on results, could open up even more acreage for development in the Upper Wolfcamp. Completion of that well is planned to begin in mid-January. 
We completed 17 gross, 10 net wells in the Permian during the third quarter. Fourth quarter capital and pacing will be focused on completion activities and acreage obligations across our Wolfcamp position in both Culberson and Reeves County. We currently have 5 rigs running at the Delaware Basin. 
Now on to the Mid-Continent. You all recall we began drilling the latest development project on the east side of the Cannacord in the fourth quarter of 2015, of which Cimarex operates 2 sections. Completion of was began in mid-September with all of the Cimarex operated wells now completed and beginning early stages of flowback. These wells, along with partner operated wells, should be coming on production over the next 2 quarters. 
We also completed the Leon Gundy wells, our stacked/staggered Meramec Woodford pacing pilot. These wells were brought on production in mid-October, thus, it is too early to discuss any results. We look forward to discussing these wells in more detail on our next call. We also continue to book delineate and hold our Meramec acreage. With our most recent well results in this play performing as expected relative to our expectations. Of the 4 rigs we plan to operate in our Anadarko Basin next year, 3 of them will be dedicated to holding our Meramec acreage. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi."

I'll start first, with our third quarter production results, then go into some detail on our revised Q4 '16 forecast and the result in 2016 production outlook, and then with an underneath of it look at our forecasted late Q4 ramp-up of production, I'll give you a glimpse of our preliminary 2017 production outlook. I'll then finish up with just a few comments on LOE and service costs. 
As Tom mentioned with the reported net equivalent daily volume of 947 million a day, our third quarter production came in just shy of our guidance range of 950 to 980. 2 main factors came into play when comparing our actual results to our guidance: First, we saw an an anticipated net volume reduction of approximately 7 million a day, as a result of ethane reduction associated with the processing of our share of outside operated Mid-Continent gas during the quarter. And secondly, we experienced approximately 13 [ph] million a day of production downtime completion times and the shut in of the wells associated with those completions. These 2 factors alone a way to the midpoint of our guidance. 
If we look at Q3 by region, with the pickup of our Permian completion activity in mid-Q2, our third quarter Permian volume of 517 million a day was up 2% from Q2 '16, while our third quarter Mid-Continent volume of 427 million a day was down 2% from the second quarter, a result of our beginning of the year's slowdown of Mid-Continent completion activity which we just recently picked up, as John mentioned, appear in late Q3.
Looking forward, before touching on our fourth quarter guidance, I want to provide a little color on our frac fleet utilization strategy. To provide consistency in our frac fleet utilization and operational results and maintain full control of timing and scheduling of our frac operations, we've opted to retain a consistent number of fleets to complete our wells. With the fluctuating rig schedule and a good mix of multiple and good projects, we carefully planned our inventory so as to minimize adding and dropping in crudes. If we didn't add in drop crudes, we'd risk the ability to pick up the crudes and iron, of which we worked so hard to develop our operational efficiencies. Which means that when any completion operation takes longer than expected, either due to an operation or weather issue, or as a result of changing completion design on the to pump a larger, more time-consuming job, there's a domino effect on the timing of all completion operations following in queue. Our wood stay completion is a great example. When we provided Q3 guidance, the then planned drop size required an 18-day time period to complete each 3 well pad. Subsequent to providing guidance, we changed the job design which required a 30-day time period to pump, and pushed back other wells from projects in queue. We saw this in the Mid-Continent as well. And as a result, we pushed out first production for some significant wells and projects that were previously forecasted in that production in early Q4, now to come on later in Q4, and pushed others out into 2017.
So in a nutshell, at the total company level, we've moved a number of our significant completions into late Q4 and a total net wells previously slated for late Q4 into early 2017. With large anticipated production increases from our pilot and infill projects, simply sliding first production 2 to 4 weeks, has a big impact when projecting volumes for 12-week quarterly time period and as a result, our Q4 production forecast dropped from our last quarter estimate. 
We have a number of significant infill projects forecasted for Q4 in both the Permian and Mid-Continent. In the Permian, we've revised our first production timing for our Woodstate project in Reeves County, with first production now forecasted for late November, December, early December, versus our last quarter estimate of October. With the revised completion timing, we've also moved first production for 5 net Permian wells, including  production from our Timtim project into early 2017. 
Similarly, in the Mid-Continent, revised timing for frac operations has pushed out the timing for first production from our East Cana infill project, with our operated [indiscernible] sections now scheduled to come online in November and December, and our nonoperated projects sections now forecasted to come on in the December to early 2017 time frame. As a result, 5 [ph] projected net Mid-Continent wells have also moved into 2017. So when the dust settles, our updated Q4 production guidance now sits at 945 million to 985 million a day, with a vast production ramp forecasted for the latter half of the quarter. With the increase, we're projecting December total company net equivalent volumes to be in excess of 1 Bcf a day. 
As Tom mentioned, we have put together a 9-rig plan for 2017, funded comfortably with projected 2017 cash flow projections using our current strip. But the carryover of our Q4 '16 completion activity and the anticipated ramp-up in associated production into 2017, we're projected a preliminary estimate of 1.05 to 1.1 Bcfe a day for our full year 2017 production. As compared to the midpoint of our current 2016 full year production guidance, this represents a 9% to 14% increase in production during 2017. 
As Tom did, I want to again emphasize as well, this is a very preliminary plan. The plan can change as a result of many factors, including changes in commodity prices and/or changes in any of our activity levels, our project selection and the timing of our capital deployment. 
Shifting gears to OpEx. We posted another nice guidance with our third quarter LOE, and we owe it all again to our production group's continued efforts to reduce operating cost structure. We commend our efforts and with our focus, we continue to realize significant cost reductions during the quarter, seeing some nice reductions in equipment and maintenance, contract labor and rentals in particular. As a result, Q3 lifting costs came in at $0.61 per Mcfe at the low end of our guidance range of $0.60 to $0.75, down 6% from Q2, and down 27% from the $0.83 we've posted in, for an average, in 2015. 
After incorporating our continued cost control efforts and the fluctuating nature of workover expenses, we're projecting our remaining lifting costs to be in the $0.60 to $0.70 range. 
And finally, some comments on drilling and completion costs. We continue to see our drilling costs coming [ph] remain relatively in check, and have seen completion costs components, for the most part, level off. That said, we're beginning to feel upward pressure on completion costs with any increase most likely to occur after the beginning of the year. With that, we continue to focus on efficiencies on the drilling side by cutting down drilling days, and on the completion side, by optimizing our completion design, optimizing our water sourcing and optimizing our pumping operations. 
With our costs in check, our generic well AFEs are flat to last quarter in the Permian. Our current Bone Spring 1 mile lateral AFEs are ranging $4.7 million to $5.1 million. That's flat last quarter but down 6% from earlier in the year. In the Wolfcamp, with larger completions and current -- our current generic 2-mile lateral coal Wolfcamp AFE continues to run in the $10.2 million to $11.2 million range, that again is flat to last call, but down 5% from Q4 '15, and down 23% from late 2014.
With our larger frac designs, our Cana core 1 mile lateral Woodford AFE continues to run in the range of $7.1 million to $7.5 million. That's up from the $6.6 million to the $7 million range we quoted with smaller frac survey in the year but were down 10% from late 2014. 
And finally, as we continued to experiment with frac design, our current 2-mile Meramec AFEs are running in the range of $10.5 million to $12 million, with the frac design really being largest cost variable in the total well costs for our Meramec wells. 
So in closing, we had another good quarter. We continue to make strides, reduce our operating cost structure, we've stayed focus on efficiencies to reduce and optimize total well costs, and we continue to make good progress, maximizing the productivity and profitability of our wells. Although we've seen our completion timing push out first production for a number of our bigger projects, due primarily to pumping bigger and bigger jobs, we're very pleased about our well results and for that matter, we're very pleased with our entire program. 
So with that, I now turn the call over to Q&A."

We certainly also look at -- we debate a lot internally of, yes, how much of this is your component of acceleration versus how much of this is new reserves. And honestly, there's still a lot of that to be determined as these wells continue to perform, and we'll watch that very carefully. As far as innovation, yes, I do not believe for either the upper or lower Wolfcamp, that we still have achieved the ultimate frac from an individual well, and we talk about it all the time internally. And we have a lot of experimentation, in fact, a well in particular, are coming up. And we're going to test a lot of concepts and ideas, where we still think there is possibilities to achieve or recover more reserves out of that rock.

We anticipate it's entirely possible, we may see somewhere 5% to 7% similar increase in our completion service costs as we move forward. But overall, when you put it in the blender and turn it on, there's so many variables. How efficient can we be at sourcing our water, and we're spending a heck of a lot of time on that.

We had a number of other Wolfcamp operators who are kind of stranded with their sections with only 5,000-foot laterals. And now we're starting to see more and more companies willing to talk about trading acreages, section per section, such that they, as well as us, can leverage long laterals. And we're getting a few more of those deals done with a couple of different other companies out there. And I would not be surprised you will see more of that happening, where each company tries to kind of block up their own acreage. So then you get those capital efficiencies with the long laterals as well as the midstream assets and disposal. So we'll see more of that. Would I love to get more bolt-on acreage? Absolutely. And as Tom said, we look at every deal possible, especially adjoining to our position. And we just can't seem to come to the same valuations that others are able to in this current market."

Again, the 3 rigs will be both holding acreage but also delineating in a sense, because we stil have areas in the Meramec that we'd like to get results in and get a good idea of how well they'll perform. I will also say that a lot of our acreage holding in the Meramec will be in more of the northwest part of the map, that's where we got out ahead a couple of years ago. That's where a lot of our term acreage is. And so that area where I think previously we announced the Peterson well, as well as the People's well. We have a lot of acreage to hold up in that area so we have a lot of rigs had a -- a lot of drilling to do next year in that area. And so far, both ourselves, as well as some of the competitors, have announced very compressive wells in that area.

We're constantly feeding each other exactly our plans, and so we're able to easily put that into our budget forecasting. The area where it gets a little more cloudy, especially in the Meramec is yes, all of a sudden, we're getting hit with a lot of outside operated wells scattered throughout that play, a lot of activity that has caused probably a little bit more capital than we originally planned, but it's not a huge component but we'll certainly -- we'll be accounting for that going into next year as well. I'll point out again, just what I said in the Permian, what you'll see shakeout in Anadarko is once everybody kind of gets to the position of holding their acreage, then you get into where people start doing acreage swaps or trying to do block up. And then that gives you greater control again over your capital plans. In short, we do account for it. We recognize it, but I don't see it as being a major component or something that's going to completely lead to a large outspend for us."

But the simple answer is if acreage allows us and fortunately, the majority, the vast majority of our acreage allows us, then it is our preference to go long. The only time you're going to see us consciously choose not to drill a long lateral is like some of this spacing pilot tests where we're try to get vital information on how to tie, to put the wells next to each other. And quite frankly, the length of the lateral doesn't really dictate that result. And so in that regard, we kind of see that as an efficient way to spend our capital, or just to do it to 5,000, get the result and then leverage that quickly to 10,000-foot laterals in development.

On the call today, John will walk us through our recent result and describe our progress on some of the delineation projects that we have underway, and then Joe will follow John with a detailed operational overview.
For the first time in a long time, our production came in below guidance. We averaged 947 million cubic feet equivalent per day in the third quarter, slightly below our guidance of 950 million to 980 million cubic feet equivalent per day. We expected the third quarter to represent the low point in our production for the year. However, we faced delays in our completions, owing in large part to the timing effect of our upsized simulations. We did not properly plan for a significant impact of shedding in offset wells during completion operations, nor did we fully account for the 7 million cubic feet equivalent loss to higher ethane rejection. The combined effect of these factors caused us not only to miss on the third quarter but to bring down the fourth quarter outlook as well. We don't like to miss our forecasts on any of these items, and quite frankly, we need to do better.
I think it's worthwhile to put the delay in our production trajectory into context. Cimarex responded swiftly and deliberately to the downdraft in commodity prices that reached its [indiscernible] in February of this year. In the fall of 2014, we had 26 operated rig train. We reached the low in summer of 2016 with 4 operated rigs. As we ramp our activity in the second half of 2016, a disproportionate amount of our operated and nonoperated drilling was on large multi-pud pilot development projects. This concentration of effort on a handful of large projects put our production ramp at particular risk to timing delays. That said, we offer no excuses. We need to do a better job of risking these potential delays and building them into our forecasts. We've learned the hard way the wisdom of Yogi Berra, who said, ""It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future."" 
Our 2016 exploration and development capital budget is now $785 million. That's up $35 million from previous estimates. The increase is tied primarily to the activity associated with rig additions this year and approximately $15 million in seismic and acreage acquisitions we made in the third quarter. Even though our production ramp has been delayed into Q1 2017, much of the completion costs associated with this ramp will be incurred in 2016.
In yesterday's release, we gave preliminary guidance for 2017. And I want to be clear that this is preliminary. We want to give some clarity on what 2017 looks for us, but these numbers for capital, for production, these are the baseline numbers. We certainly have tremendous wherewithal to accelerate. We'll enter 2017 with great momentum as the aforementioned deferred completions come roaring back. We currently model total production growth in 2017 to be 9% to 14% year-over-year with an overweight in oil production embedded in this growth. We also gave guidance on drilling and completion portion of our capital. Based on our current plans, we plan to invest $600 million in those activities next year. $600 million is within our cash flow for 2017 as we currently model it. So again, we think of this as a baseline. We have the ability to add activity as the year unfolds, and in fact, we're currently looking hard at several projects we have on the drawing board. As always, we will give you an updated look at our capital plans in our next call, that will be in February, and that will include our total E&D expenditures as well as our first quarter 2017 production. By then, I expect to have tremendous clarity on additional projects and what it looks like as we move ahead on that baseline.
Enough about production. I want to spend a few minutes talking about what we're really excited about. We continue to push the envelope in completion optimization and innovation. We are seeing outstanding results that have implications for well spacing and landing zones. In both the Delaware and Anadarko basins, we're planning pilots for 2017 that will test even tighter well spacing. These tests have tremendous implications for the depth and richness of our inventory. We built Cimarex on exploration, and we are hard at work developing new ideas. We have challenged our organization to develop new play concepts and opportunities, where the cost of entry is low and real value is created for our shareholders. Our organization has responded accordingly, and we are working on a number of ideas that, hopefully, will be subjects for future quarterly calls. Idea generation, execution and innovation have always been the heartbeat of Cimarex, and it's what distinguishes us from an outstanding field of competitors. We are playing to our strength as we seek that proprietary edge that lets us slip in ahead of the crowd. We have some of the finest assets and one of the finest organizations in the business. Stay tuned.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John to provide further color on our program."

I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our remaining 2016 plans.
Cimarex invested $175 million on exploration and development during the third quarter. About 61% was invested in the Permian region, with the rest going toward activities in the Mid-Continent region. Company-wide, we brought 42 gross, 17 net wells on production during the quarter. We had an average of 5 operated rigs running during the quarter. These rigs were busy working the whole acreage in both the Wolfcamp and Meramec plays. We have recently added 3 rigs, 1 in the Anadarko and 2 in the Delaware Basin, and we have plans to add another rig in Anadarko by year-end. While we work through our completion backlog, we will pick up the pace on our drilling activity as we head into 2017.
As planned, during the third quarter, we brought the 6 7,500-foot long lateral Upper Wolfcamp wells online that comprise our spacing pilot in the Upper Wolfcamp in Culberson County. These completions used about 2,400 pounds of sand per foot while also incorporating design parameters such as stage phasing, cluster count and cluster spacing from some of our more recent current well frac designs. These wells have been flowing back now for just over 90 days, and yet, we still have not achieved a peak 30-day average rate. This result is not unexpected since it usually takes our Upper Wolfcamp wells much longer to clean up and reach their peak production rate relative to the Lower Wolfcamp Culberson wells.  The results of this phasing pilot are especially meaningful in light of a recent result to further delineate the Upper Wolfcamp interval in Culberson County.
Earlier this year, we completed the Kingman 2045 state unit 2H, which is located in the western half of our Culberson acreage. On our presentation, Slide 10 identifies location of the Kingman well. Before this well, most of our Upper Wolfcamp drilling had been in the southeastern part of our acreage. This 10,000-foot lateral had a 30-day peak average rate of 2,057 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 1,192 barrels or 58% was oil. The Kingman was completed with 1,700 pounds of sand per lateral foot and came online in late April. In its first 180 days, the well has cumulative production of 308,000 barrels of oil equivalent, including 169,000 barrels of oil. This excellent delineation result opens up our acreage on the western half of Culberson County, where we plan to do further testing in 2017.
We also just finished drilling in Upper Wolfcamp well, the north of the Kingman well in Eddy County, which, depending on results, could open up even more acreage for development in the Upper Wolfcamp. Completion of that well is planned to begin in mid-January.
We completed 17 gross, 10 net wells in the Permian during the third quarter. Fourth quarter capital of the Basin will be focused on completion activities and acreage obligations across our Wolfcamp position in both Culberson and Reeves County. We currently have 5 rigs running in the Delaware Basin.
Now on to the Mid-Continent. You will recall that we began drilling the latest Woodford development project on the east side of the Cana core in the fourth quarter of 2015. This development covers 6 sections, of which Cimarex operates 2 sections. Completion of the wells began in mid-September, with all of the Cimarex-operated wells now completed and beginning the early stages of flowback. These wells, along with partner-operated wells, should be coming on production over the next 2 quarters.
We also completed the Leon-Gundy wells, our stacked/staggered Meramec Woodford spacing pilot. These wells were brought on production in mid-October, thus it is too early to discuss any results. We look forward to discussing these wells in more detail on our next call.
We also continue to book delineate and hold our Meramec acreage, with our most recent well results in this play performing as expected relative to our pre-dual expectations. Of the 4 rigs we plan to operate in the Anadarko Basin next year, 3 of them will be dedicated to holding our Meramec acreage.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi."

I'll start first with our third quarter production results then go into some detail on our revised Q4 '16 forecast and the result in 2016 production outlook and then with an underneath-the-hood look at our forecasted late Q4 ramp-up in production, I'll give you a glimpse of our preliminary 2017 production outlook. I'll then finish up with just a few comments on LOE and service costs.
As Tom mentioned, with the reported net equivalent daily volume of 947 million a day, our third quarter production came in just shy of our guidance range of 950 million to 980 million. Two main factors came into play when comparing our actual results to our guidance. First, we saw an unanticipated net volume reduction of approximately 7 million a day as a result of ethane rejection associated with the processing of our share of outside-operated Mid-Continent gas during the quarter. And secondly, we experienced approximately 13 million a day of production downtime due to slightly longer-than-anticipated completion times and the shut-in of the wells associated with those completions. These 2 factors alone pulled us away from the midpoint of our guidance.
If we look at Q3 by region, with the pickup of our Permian completion activity in mid-Q2, our third quarter Permian volume of 517 million a day was up 2% from Q2 '16, while our third quarter Mid-Continent volume of 427 million a day was down 2% from the second quarter, a result of our beginning of the year's slowdown in Mid-Continent completion activity, which we just recently picked up, as John mentioned, appear in late Q3.
Looking forward, before touching on our fourth quarter guidance, I want to provide a little color on our frac fleet utilization strategy. To provide consistency in our frac fleet utilization and operational results and maintain full control of the timing and scheduling of our frac operations, we've opted to retain a consistent number of fleets to complete our wells. With a fluctuating rig schedule and a good mix of multiple and individual well completion projects, we carefully planned our inventory so as to minimize adding and dropping crudes. If we did add and drop crudes, we'd risk the ability to pick up the crudes and iron, from which we worked so hard to develop our operational efficiencies, which means that when any completion operation takes longer than expected, either due to an operation or weather issue, or as a result of changing completion design on the ply to pump a larger, more time-consuming job, there's a domino effect on the timing of all completion operations following in queue. Our Wood State completion is a great example. When we provided Q3 guidance, the then-planned job size required an 18-day time period to complete each 3-well pad. Subsequent to providing guidance, we changed the job design, which required a 30-day time period to pump, and pushed back other wells from projects in queue. We saw this in the Mid-Continent as well. And as a result, we pushed out first production for some significant wells and projects that were previously forecasted that production in early Q4 now to come on later in Q4 and pushed others out into 2017.
So in a nutshell, at the total company level, we've moved a number of our significant completions into late Q4 and a total 10 net wells previously slated for late Q4 into early 2017. With large anticipated production increases from our pilot and infill projects, simply sliding first production 2 to 4 weeks has a big impact when projecting volumes for a 12-week quarterly time period. And as a result, our Q4 production forecast dropped from our last quarter estimate.
We have a number of significant infill projects forecasted for Q4 in both the Permian and in the Mid-Continent. In the Permian, we've revised our first production timing for our Wood State project in Reeves County, with first production now forecasted for late November, December -- early December versus our last quarter estimate of October. With the revised completion timing, we've also moved first production for 5 net Permian wells, including production from our Tim Tam project, into early 2017.
Similarly, in the Mid-Continent, revised timing for frac operations has pushed out the timing for first production from our East Cana infill project, with our operated Nancy Condrey [ph] sections now scheduled to come online in November and December and our nonoperated project sections now forecasted to come on in the December to early 2017 time frame. As a result, 5 projected net Mid-Continent wells have also moved into 2017.
So when the dusts settle, our updated Q4 production guidance now sits at 945 million to 985 million a day, with a vast production ramp forecasted for the latter half of the quarter. With the increase, we're projecting December total company net equivalent volumes to be in excess of 1 Bcf a day.
As Tom mentioned, we have put together a preliminary 9-rig plan for 2017, funded comfortably with projected 2017 cash flow projections using our current strip. But the carryover of our Q4 '16 completion activity and the anticipated ramp-up in associated production into 2017, we projected a preliminary estimate of 1.05 to 1.1 Bcfe a day for our full year 2017 production. As compared to the midpoint of our current 2016 full year production guidance, this represents a 9% to 14% increase in production during 2017.
As Tom did, I want to again emphasize as well, this is a very preliminary plan. The plan can change as a result of many factors, including changes in commodity prices and/or changes in any of our activity levels, our project selection and the timing of our capital deployment.
Shifting gears to OpEx. We posted another nice guidance beat with our third quarter LOE, and we owe it all again to our production group's continued efforts to reduce our operating cost structure. We commend their efforts, and with their focus, we continue to realize significant cost reductions during the quarter, seeing some nice reductions in equipment and maintenance, contract labor and rentals, in particular. As a result, our Q3 lifting costs came in at $0.61 per Mcfe, at the low end of our guidance range of $0.60 to $0.75, down 6% from Q2 and down 27% from the $0.83 we've posted in -- for an average, in 2015. After incorporating our continued cost control efforts and the fluctuating nature of workover expenses, we're projecting our remaining year lifting costs to be in the $0.60 to $0.70 range.
And finally, some comments on drilling and completion costs. We continue to see our drilling cost components remain relatively in check and have seen completion cost components, for the most part, level off. That said, we're beginning to feel upward pressure on completion costs, with any increase most likely to occur after the beginning of the year. With that, we continue to focus on efficiencies on the drilling side by cutting down drilling days and on the completion side by optimizing our completion design, optimizing our water sourcing and optimizing our pumping operations.
With our costs in check, our generic well AFEs are flat to last quarter in the Permian. Our current Bone Spring 1-mile lateral AFEs are ranging $4.7 million to $5.1 million. That's flat to last quarter but down 6% from earlier in the year. In the Wolfcamp, with larger completions and current -- our current generic 2-mile lateral Culberson and Wolfcamp AFE continues to run in the $10.2 million to $11.2 million range. That, again, is flat to last call but down 5% from Q4 '15 and down 23% from late 2014.
With our larger frac design, our Cana core 1-mile lateral Woodford AFE continues to run in the range of $7.1 million to $7.5 million. That's up from the $6 million to $7 million -- $6.6 million to the $7 million range we quoted with smaller frac survey in the year but were still down 10% from late 2014.
And finally, as we continue to experiment with frac design, our current 2-mile lateral Meramec AFEs are running in the range of $10.5 million to $12 million, with frac design really being the largest cost variable in the total well costs for our Meramec wells.
So in closing, we had another good quarter. We continue to make strides, reduce our operating cost structure. We stay focused on efficiencies to reduce and optimize total well costs, and we continue to make progress maximizing the productivity and profitability of our wells. Although we've seen our completion timing push out first production for a number of our bigger projects, due primarily to pumping bigger and bigger jobs, we're very pleased about our well results, and for that matter, we're very pleased about our entire program.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Q&A."

In fact, a well in particular coming up, where we're going to test a lot of concepts and ideas, where we still think there is possibilities to achieve or recover more reserves out of that rock. So I guess, I can tell you is we watch it carefully, we moderate carefully as far as incremental cost to make sure it's a good decision. And we're going to keep try and innovate on it."

I'd say the general answer to that is yes, but it's like we've been talking about here too, the types of design of your frac, the pounds of sand, the amount of fluid, your cluster spacing, your science projects, what have you. I tend to look at it more on the basis of cost components, because they're the variables we can measure. And what we're seeing on the drilling side are relatively flat cost components. On the completion side, it's no secret, you've heard the likes of Halliburton talking about increasing their service costs. We anticipate that it's entirely possible, we may see somewhere of 5% to 7% somewhat increase in our completion service cost as we move forward. But overall, when you put it in the blender and turn it on, there's so many variables, how efficient can we be at sourcing our water, and we're spending a heck of a lot of time on that, and again, optimizing the cost benefits of the different frac design so that whatever the cost is, we see the optimal side of it on the production side. These are all things that we're constantly scrutinizing and studying. And the end result is what Tom and John have both alluded to, what's our best rate of return.

It's an exciting project, because as, yes, our partner elaborated, I saw there right upon it, it is a long lateral development project. It's 10,000-foot laterals in an area where we get very good condensate yield with very good rate of returns. I will tell you, the biggest questions we have regarding that, quite frankly, is how many wells per section do we want to put. Based on our previous results and what we call Row 4 home across Phillips, where we pushed the spacing even tighter, we've been very pleased with those results. Likewise, the current developed section, the eastern core infill, our partner has a number of sections where they, again, are testing tighter spacing. Those results as well as perhaps even some other things we want to test might lead to even more wells per section within that development, which even makes it more appealing to us. So there's a lot of discussions with our partner about that, and we fully anticipate certainly in the second half of next year, we will be deploying rigs on that development project in the Cana area."

We're basically 100% operators on those acreage, besides the Culberson JDA with Chevron. But in Culberson, we are the operator since we dictate the budget there.

And so we're able to easily put that into our budget forecasting. The area where it gets a little more cloudy, especially in the Meramec, is, yes, all of a sudden, we're getting hit with a lot of outside operated wells scattered throughout that play, a lot of activity that has caused probably a little bit more capital than we originally planned, but it's not a huge component. But we'll certainly -- we will be accounting for that going into next year as well. I'll point out, again, just like what I said early in the Permian, what you'll see shake out in Anadarko is once everybody kind of gets to the position of holding their acreage, then you get into where people start doing acreage swaps or trying to block up.

As always, we appreciate your interest and look forward to your questions during the question-and-answer portion of the call.
On the call today, John will walk us through our recent result and describe our progress on some of the delineation projects that we have underway, and then Joe will follow John with a detailed operational overview.
For the first time in a long time, our production came in below guidance. We averaged 947 million cubic feet equivalent per day in the third quarter, slightly below our guidance of 950 million to 980 million cubic feet equivalent per day. We expected the third quarter to represent the low point in our production for the year. However, we faced delays in our completions, owing in large part to the timing effect of our upsized stimulations. We did not properly plan for a significant impact of shedding in offset wells during completion operations, nor did we fully account for the 7 million cubic feet equivalent loss to higher ethane rejection. The combined effect of these factors caused us not only to miss on the third quarter but to bring down the fourth quarter outlook as well. We don't like to miss our forecasts on any of these items, and quite frankly, we need to do better.
I think it's worthwhile to put the delay in our production trajectory into context. Cimarex responded swiftly and deliberately to the downdraft in commodity prices that reached its nadir in February of this year. In the fall of 2014, we had 26 operated rigs running. We reached the low in summer of 2016 with 4 operated rigs. As we ramped our activity in the second half of 2016, a disproportionate amount of our operated and non-operated drilling was on large multi-pad pilot development projects. This concentration of effort on a handful of large projects put our production ramp at particular risk to timing delays. That said, we offer no excuses. We need to do a better job of risking these potential delays and building them into our forecasts. We've learned the hard way the wisdom of Yogi Berra, who said, ""It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future."" 
Our 2016 exploration and development capital budget is now $785 million. That's up $35 million from previous estimates. The increase is tied primarily to the activity associated with rig additions this year and approximately $15 million in seismic and acreage acquisitions we made in the third quarter. Even though our production ramp has been delayed into Q1 2017, much of the completion costs associated with this ramp will be incurred in 2016.
In yesterday's release, we gave preliminary guidance for 2017. And I want to be clear that this is preliminary. We wanted to give some clarity on what 2017 looks for us, but these numbers for capital, for production, these are baseline numbers. We certainly have tremendous wherewithal to accelerate. We'll enter 2017 with great momentum as the aforementioned deferred completions come roaring back. We currently model total production growth in 2017 to be 9% to 14% year-over-year with an overweight in oil production embedded in this growth. We also gave guidance on drilling and completion portion of our capital. Based on our current plans, we plan to invest $600 million in those activities next year. $600 million is within our cash flow for 2017 as we currently model it. So again, we think of this as a baseline. We have the ability to add activity as the year unfolds, and in fact, we're currently looking hard at several projects we have on the drawing board. As always, we will give you an updated look at our capital plans in our next call, that will be in February, and that will include our total E&D expenditures as well as our first quarter 2017 production. By then, I expect to have tremendous clarity on additional projects and what it looks like as we move ahead on that baseline.
Enough about production. I want to spend a few minutes talking about what we're really excited about. We continue to push the envelope in completion optimization and innovation. We are seeing outstanding results that have implications for well spacing and landing zones. In both the Delaware and Anadarko basins, we're planning pilots for 2017 that will test even tighter well spacing. These tests have tremendous implications for the depth and richness of our inventory. We built Cimarex on exploration, and we are hard at work developing new ideas. We have challenged our organization to develop new play concepts and opportunities, where the cost of entry is low and real value is created for our shareholders. Our organization has responded accordingly, and we are working on a number of ideas that, hopefully, will be subjects for future quarterly calls. Idea generation, execution and innovation have always been the heartbeat of Cimarex, and it's what distinguishes us from an outstanding field of competitors. We are playing to our strength as we seek that proprietary edge that lets us slip in ahead of the crowd. We have some of the finest assets and one of the finest organizations in the business. Stay tuned.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John to provide further color on our program."

I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our remaining 2016 plans.Cimarex invested $175 million on exploration and development du",715,"Thanks, Tom. I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our remaining 2016 plans.
Cimarex invested $175 million on exploration and development during the third quarter. About 61% was invested in the Permian region, with the rest going toward activities in the Mid-Continent region. Company-wide, we brought 42 gross, 17 net wells on production during the quarter. We had an average of 5 operated rigs running during the quarter. These rigs were busy working the whole acreage in both the Wolfcamp and Meramec plays. We have recently added 3 rigs, 1 in the Anadarko and 2 in the Delaware Basin, and we have plans to add another rig in Anadarko by year-end. While we work through our completion backlog, we will pick up the pace on our drilling activity as we head into 2017.
As planned, during the third quarter, we brought the 6 7,500-foot long lateral Upper Wolfcamp wells online that comprise our spacing pilot in the Upper Wolfcamp in Culberson County. These completions used about 2,400 pounds of sand per foot while also incorporating design parameters such as stage phasing, cluster count and cluster spacing from some of our more recent current well frac designs. These wells have been flowing back now for just over 90 days, and yet, we still have not achieved a peak 30-day average rate. This result is not unexpected since it usually takes our Upper Wolfcamp wells much longer to clean up and reach their peak production rate relative to the Lower Wolfcamp Culberson wells.  The results of this phasing pilot are especially meaningful in light of a recent result to further delineate the Upper Wolfcamp interval in Culberson County.
Earlier this year, we completed the Kingman 2045 state unit 2H, which is located in the western half of our Culberson acreage. On our presentation, Slide 10 identifies location of the Kingman well. Before this well, most of our Upper Wolfcamp drilling had been in the southeastern part of our acreage. This 10,000-foot lateral had a 30-day peak average rate of 2,057 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 1,192 barrels or 58% was oil. The Kingman was completed with 1,700 pounds of sand per lateral foot and came online in late April. In its first 180 days, the well has cumulative production of 308,000 barrels of oil equivalent, including 169,000 barrels of oil. This excellent delineation result opens up our acreage on the western half of Culberson County, where we plan to do further testing in 2017.
We also just finished drilling an Upper Wolfcamp well, the north of the Kingman well in Eddy County, which, depending on results, could open up even more acreage for development in the Upper Wolfcamp. Completion of that well is planned to begin in mid-January.
We completed 17 gross, 10 net wells in the Permian during the third quarter. Fourth quarter capital of the Basin will be focused on completion activities and acreage obligations across our Wolfcamp position in both Culberson and Reeves County. We currently have 5 rigs running in the Delaware Basin.
Now on to the Mid-Continent. You will recall that we began drilling the latest Woodford development project on the east side of the Cana core in the fourth quarter of 2015. This development covers 6 sections, of which Cimarex operates 2 sections. Completion of the wells began in mid-September, with all of the Cimarex-operated wells now completed and beginning the early stages of flowback. These wells, along with partner-operated wells, should be coming on production over the next 2 quarters.
We also completed the Leon-Gundy wells, our stacked/staggered Meramec Woodford spacing pilot. These wells were brought on production in mid-October, thus it is too early to discuss any results. We look forward to discussing these wells in more detail on our next call.
We also continue to book delineate and hold our Meramec acreage, with our most recent well results in this play performing as expected relative to our pre-dual expectations. Of the 4 rigs we plan to operate in the Anadarko Basin next year, 3 of them will be dedicated to holding our Meramec acreage.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi."

I'll start first with our third quarter production results then go into some detail on our revised Q4 '16 forecast and the resulting 2016 production outlook and then with an underneath-t",1487,"Thank you, John, and thank you all for joining us on our call today. I'll start first with our third quarter production results then go into some detail on our revised Q4 '16 forecast and the resulting 2016 production outlook and then with an underneath-the-hood look at our forecasted late Q4 ramp-up in production, I'll give you a glimpse of our preliminary 2017 production outlook. I'll then finish up with just a few comments on LOE and service costs.
As Tom mentioned, with the reported net equivalent daily volume of 947 million a day, our third quarter production came in just shy of our guidance range of 950 million to 980 million. Two main factors came into play when comparing our actual results to our guidance. First, we saw an unanticipated net volume reduction of approximately 7 million a day as a result of ethane rejection associated with the processing of our share of outside-operated Mid-Continent gas during the quarter. And secondly, we experienced approximately 13 million a day of production downtime due to slightly longer-than-anticipated completion times and the shut-in of the wells associated with those completions. These 2 factors alone pulled us away from the midpoint of our guidance.
If we look at Q3 by region, with the pickup of our Permian completion activity in mid-Q2, our third quarter Permian volume of 517 million a day was up 2% from Q2 '16, while our third quarter Mid-Continent volume of 427 million a day was down 2% from the second quarter, a result of our beginning of the year's slowdown in Mid-Continent completion activity, which we just recently picked up, as John mentioned, appear in late Q3.
Looking forward, before touching on our fourth quarter guidance, I want to provide a little color on our frac fleet utilization strategy. To provide consistency in our frac fleet utilization and operational results and to maintain full control of the timing and scheduling of our frac operations, we've opted to retain a consistent number of fleets to complete our wells. With a fluctuating rig schedule and a good mix of multiple and individual well completion projects, we carefully plan our inventory so as to minimize adding and dropping crews. If we did add and drop crews, we'd risk the ability to pick up the crews and iron, from which we worked so hard to develop our operational efficiencies, which means that when any completion operation takes longer than expected, either due to an operation or weather issue, or as a result of changing completion design on the fly to pump a larger, more time-consuming job, there's a domino effect on the timing of all completion operations following in queue. Our Wood State completion is a great example. When we provided Q3 guidance, the then-planned job size required an 18-day time period to complete each 3-well pad. Subsequent to providing guidance, we changed the job design, which required a 30-day time period to pump, and pushed back other wells from projects in queue. We saw this in the Mid-Continent as well. And as a result, we pushed out first production for some significant wells and projects that were previously forecasted to add production in early Q4 now to come on later in Q4 and pushed others out into 2017.
So in a nutshell, at the total company level, we've moved a number of our significant completions into late Q4 and a total 10 net wells previously slated for late Q4 into early 2017. With large anticipated production increases from our pilot and infill projects, simply sliding first production 2 to 4 weeks has a big impact when projecting volumes for a 12-week quarterly time period. And as a result, our Q4 production forecast dropped from our last quarter estimate.
We have a number of significant infill projects forecasted for Q4 in both the Permian and in the Mid-Continent. In the Permian, we've revised our first production timing for our Wood State project in Reeves County, with first production now forecasted for late November, December -- early December versus our last quarter estimate of October. With the revised completion timing, we've also moved first production for 5 net Permian wells, including production from our Tim Tam project, into early 2017.
Similarly, in the Mid-Continent, revised timing for frac operations has pushed out the timing for first production from our East Cana infill project, with our operated Nancy Condrey [ph] sections now scheduled to come online in November and December and our nonoperated project sections now forecasted to come on in the December to early 2017 time frame. As a result, 5 projected net Mid-Continent wells have also moved into 2017.
So when the dusts settle, our updated Q4 production guidance now sits at 945 million to 985 million a day, with a vast production ramp forecasted for the latter half of the quarter. With the increase, we're projecting December total company net equivalent volumes to be in excess of 1 Bcf a day.
As Tom mentioned, we have put together a preliminary 9-rig plan for 2017, funded comfortably with projected 2017 cash flow projections using our current strip. But the carryover of our Q4 '16 completion activity and the anticipated ramp-up in associated production into 2017, we're projecting a preliminary estimate of 1.05 to 1.1 Bcfe a day for our full year 2017 production. As compared to the midpoint of our current 2016 full year production guidance, this represents a 9% to 14% increase in production during 2017.
As Tom did, I want to again emphasize as well, this is a very preliminary plan. The plan can change as a result of many factors, including changes in commodity prices and/or changes in any of our activity levels, our project selection and the timing of our capital deployment.
Shifting gears to OpEx. We posted another nice guidance beat with our third quarter LOE, and we owe it all again to our production group's continued efforts to reduce our operating cost structure. We commend their efforts, and with their focus, we continue to realize significant cost reductions during the quarter, seeing some nice reductions in equipment and maintenance, contract labor and rentals, in particular. As a result, our Q3 lifting costs came in at $0.61 per Mcfe, at the low end of our guidance range of $0.60 to $0.75, down 6% from Q2 and down 27% from the $0.83 we've posted in -- for an average, in 2015. After incorporating our continued cost control efforts and the fluctuating nature of work over expenses, we're projecting our remaining year lifting costs to be in the $0.60 to $0.70 range.
And finally, some comments on drilling and completion costs. We continue to see our drilling cost components remain relatively in check and have seen completion cost components, for the most part, level off. That said, we're beginning to feel upward pressure on completion costs, with any increase most likely to occur after the beginning of the year. With that, we continue to focus on efficiencies on the drilling side by cutting down drilling days and on the completion side by optimizing our completion design, optimizing our water sourcing and optimizing our pumping operations.
With our costs in check, our generic well AFEs are flat to last quarter in the Permian. Our current Bone Spring 1-mile lateral AFEs are ranging $4.7 million to $5.1 million. That's flat to last quarter but down 6% from earlier in the year. In the Wolfcamp, with larger completions and current -- our current generic 2-mile lateral Culberson and Wolfcamp AFE continues to run in the $10.2 million to $11.2 million range. That, again, is flat to last call but down 5% from Q4 '15 and down 23% from late 2014.
With our larger frac design, our Cana core 1-mile lateral Woodford AFE continues to run in the range of $7.1 million to $7.5 million. That's up from the $6 million to $7 million -- $6.6 million to the $7 million range we quoted with smaller fracs earlier in the year but we're still down 10% from late 2014.
And finally, as we continue to experiment with frac design, our current 2-mile lateral Meramec AFEs are running in the range of $10.5 million to $12 million, with frac design really being the largest cost variable in the total well costs for our Meramec wells.
So in closing, we had another good quarter. We continue to make strides, reduce our operating cost structure. We stay focused on efficiencies to reduce and optimize total well costs, and we continue to make progress maximizing the productivity and profitability of our wells. Although we've seen our completion timing push out first production for a number of our bigger projects, due primarily to pumping bigger and bigger jobs, we're very pleased about our well results, and for that matter, we're very pleased about our entire program.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Q&A."

And there's a raging debate as to -- at what point we end up accelerating and at what point we're having new reserves.

When we look at these additional costs going on our frac uplifts or optimization, we are always looking at it from a standpoint of the incremental costs relative to the rate of return that, that well achieves.

We certainly also look at -- we debate a lot internally over, yes, how much of this is there a component of acceleration versus how much of this is new reserves. And honestly, there's still a lot of that to be determined, as these wells continue to perform. And we'll watch that very carefully. As far as innovation, yes, I do not believe, for either the upper or lower Wolfcamp, that we still have achieved the optimal frac from an individual well. And we talk about it all the time internally. And we have a lot of experimentation. In fact, a well in particular coming up, where we're going to test a lot of concepts and ideas, where we still think there is possibilities to achieve or recover more reserves out of that rock.

On the completion side, it's no secret, you've heard the likes of Halliburton talking about increasing their service costs. We anticipate that it's entirely possible, we may see somewhere of 5% to 7% somewhat increase in our completion service cost as we move forward. But overall, when you put it in the blender and turn it on, there's so many variables, how efficient can we be at sourcing our water, and we're spending a heck of a lot of time on that, and again, optimizing the cost benefits of the different frac design so that whatever the cost is, we see the optimal side of it on the production side.

And we're getting a few more of those deals done with a couple of different companies out there. And I would not be surprised you'll see more of that happening, where each company tries to kind of block up their own acreage. So then you get those capital efficiencies with the long laterals as well as the midstream assets and disposal. So we'll see more of that. Would I love to get more bolt-on acreage? Absolutely. And as Tom said, we look at every deal possible, especially adjoining to our position. And we just can't seem to come to the same valuations that others are able to in this current market."

Again, the 3 rigs will be both holding acreage but also delineating in a sense, because we still have areas in the Meramec that we'd like to get results in and get a good idea of how well they'll perform. I will say that a lot of our acreage holding in the Meramec will be in more of that northwest part of the map. That's where we got out ahead a couple of years ago. That's where a lot of our term acreage is. And so that area where I think previously we announced the Peterson well as well as the Peeples well. We have a lot of acreage to hold up in that area. So we have a lot of rigs headed -- a lot of drilling to do next year in that area. And so far, both ourselves as well as some of the competitors have announced very impressive wells in that area.

Likewise, the current developed section, the eastern core infill, our partner has a number of sections where they, again, are testing tighter spacing. Those results as well as perhaps even some other things we want to test might lead to even more wells per section within that development, which even makes it more appealing to us.

We're basically 100% operators on those acreage, besides the Culberson JDA with Chevron. But in Culberson, we are the operator since we dictate the budget there. The bigger issue clearly is in Anadarko. First off, of course, we have an AMI partnership with Devon, and we work hand-in-hand. We're constantly feeding each other exactly our plans. And so we're able to easily put that into our budget forecasting. The area where it gets a little more cloudy, especially in the Meramec, is, yes, all of a sudden, we're getting hit with a lot of outside operated wells scattered throughout that play, a lot of activity that has caused probably a little bit more capital than we originally planned, but it's not a huge component. But we'll certainly -- we will be accounting for that going into next year as well. I'll point out, again, just like what I said early in the Permian, what you'll see shake out in Anadarko is once everybody kind of gets to the position of holding their acreage, then you get into where people start doing acreage swaps or trying to block up. And then that gives you greater control again over your capital plans. So in the short, we do account for it. We recognize it, but I don't see it as being a major component or something that's going to completely lead to a large outspend for us."

But the simple answer is if the acreage allows us -- and fortunately, the majority -- the vast majority of our acreage allows us, then it is our preference to go long. The only time you're going to see us consciously choose not to drill a long lateral is like some of these spacing pilot tests, where we're trying to get vital information on how tight to put the wells next to each other. And quite frankly, the length of the lateral doesn't really dictate that result. And so in that regard, we kind of see it as an efficient way to spend our capital is just to do it as 5,000 and get the result and then leverage that quickly to 10,000-foot laterals in development.

On the call today, John will walk us through our recent result and describe our progress on some of the delineation projects that we have underway, and then Joe will follow John with a detailed operational overview.
For the first time in a long time, our production came in below guidance. We averaged 947 million cubic feet equivalent per day in the third quarter, slightly below our guidance of 950 million to 980 million cubic feet equivalent per day. We expected the third quarter to represent the low point in our production for the year. However, we faced delays in our completions, owing in large part to the timing effect of our upsized stimulations. We did not properly plan for a significant impact of shedding in offset wells during completion operations, nor did we fully account for the 7 million cubic feet equivalent loss to higher ethane rejection. The combined effect of these factors caused us not only to miss on the third quarter but to bring down the fourth quarter outlook as well. We don't like to miss our forecasts on any of these items, and quite frankly, we need to do better.
I think it's worthwhile to put the delay in our production trajectory into context. Cimarex responded swiftly and deliberately to the downdraft in commodity prices that reached its nadir in February of this year. In the fall of 2014, we had 26 operated rigs running. We reached the low in summer of 2016 with 4 operated rigs. As we ramped our activity in the second half of 2016, a disproportionate amount of our operated and non-operated drilling was on large multi-pad pilot development projects. This concentration of effort on a handful of large projects put our production ramp at particular risk to timing delays. That said, we offer no excuses. We need to do a better job of risking these potential delays and building them into our forecasts. We've learned the hard way the wisdom of Yogi Berra, who said, ""It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future."" 
Our 2016 exploration and development capital budget is now $785 million. That's up $35 million from previous estimates. The increase is tied primarily to the activity associated with rig additions this year and approximately $15 million in seismic and acreage acquisitions we made in the third quarter. Even though our production ramp has been delayed into Q1 2017, much of the completion costs associated with this ramp will be incurred in 2016.
In yesterday's release, we gave preliminary guidance for 2017. And I want to be clear that this is preliminary. We wanted to give some clarity on what 2017 looks for us, but these numbers for capital, for production, these are baseline numbers. We certainly have tremendous wherewithal to accelerate. We'll enter 2017 with great momentum as the aforementioned deferred completions come roaring back. We currently model total production growth in 2017 to be 9% to 14% year-over-year with an overweight in oil production embedded in this growth. We also gave guidance on drilling and completion portion of our capital. Based on our current plans, we plan to invest $600 million in those activities next year. $600 million is within our cash flow for 2017 as we currently model it. So again, we think of this as a baseline. We have the ability to add activity as the year unfolds, and in fact, we're currently looking hard at several projects we have on the drawing board. As always, we will give you an updated look at our capital plans in our next call, that will be in February, and that will include our total E&D expenditures as well as our first quarter 2017 production. By then, I expect to have tremendous clarity on additional projects and what it looks like as we move ahead on that baseline.
Enough about production. I want to spend a few minutes talking about what we're really excited about. We continue to push the envelope in completion optimization and innovation. We are seeing outstanding results that have implications for well spacing and landing zones. In both the Delaware and Anadarko basins, we're planning pilots for 2017 that will test even tighter well spacing. These tests have tremendous implications for the depth and richness of our inventory. We built Cimarex on exploration, and we are hard at work developing new ideas. We have challenged our organization to develop new play concepts and opportunities, where the cost of entry is low and real value is created for our shareholders. Our organization has responded accordingly, and we are working on a number of ideas that, hopefully, will be subjects for future quarterly calls. Idea generation, execution and innovation have always been the heartbeat of Cimarex, and it's what distinguishes us from an outstanding field of competitors. We are playing to our strength as we seek that proprietary edge that lets us slip in ahead of the crowd. We have some of the finest assets and one of the finest organizations in the business. Stay tuned.
With that, I'll turn the call over to John to provide further color on our program."

I'll start with a quick recap of our drilling activity in the quarter before getting into some of the specifics of our latest results and more color on our remaining 2016 plans.
Cimarex invested $175 million on exploration and development during the third quarter. About 61% was invested in the Permian region, with the rest going toward activities in the Mid-Continent region. Company-wide, we brought 42 gross, 17 net wells on production during the quarter. We had an average of 5 operated rigs running during the quarter. These rigs were busy working the whole acreage in both the Wolfcamp and Meramec plays. We have recently added 3 rigs, 1 in the Anadarko and 2 in the Delaware Basin, and we have plans to add another rig in Anadarko by year-end. While we work through our completion backlog, we will pick up the pace on our drilling activity as we head into 2017.
As planned, during the third quarter, we brought the 6 7,500-foot long lateral Upper Wolfcamp wells online that comprise our spacing pilot in the Upper Wolfcamp in Culberson County. These completions used about 2,400 pounds of sand per foot while also incorporating design parameters such as stage phasing, cluster count and cluster spacing from some of our more recent current well frac designs. These wells have been flowing back now for just over 90 days, and yet, we still have not achieved a peak 30-day average rate. This result is not unexpected since it usually takes our Upper Wolfcamp wells much longer to clean up and reach their peak production rate relative to the Lower Wolfcamp Culberson wells. The results of this phasing pilot are especially meaningful in light of a recent result to further delineate the Upper Wolfcamp interval in Culberson County.
Earlier this year, we completed the Kingman 2045 state unit 2H, which is located in the western half of our Culberson acreage. On our presentation, Slide 10 identifies location of the Kingman well. Before this well, most of our Upper Wolfcamp drilling had been in the southeastern part of our acreage. This 10,000-foot lateral had a 30-day peak average rate of 2,057 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which 1,192 barrels or 58% was oil. The Kingman was completed with 1,700 pounds of sand per lateral foot and came online in late April. In its first 180 days, the well has cumulative production of 308,000 barrels of oil equivalent, including 169,000 barrels of oil. This excellent delineation result opens up our acreage on the western half of Culberson County, where we plan to do further testing in 2017.
We also just finished drilling an Upper Wolfcamp well, the north of the Kingman well in Eddy County, which, depending on results, could open up even more acreage for development in the Upper Wolfcamp. Completion of that well is planned to begin in mid-January.
We completed 17 gross, 10 net wells in the Permian during the third quarter. Fourth quarter capital of the Basin will be focused on completion activities and acreage obligations across our Wolfcamp position in both Culberson and Reeves County. We currently have 5 rigs running in the Delaware Basin.
Now on to the Mid-Continent. You will recall that we began drilling the latest Woodford development project on the east side of the Cana core in the fourth quarter of 2015. This development covers 6 sections, of which Cimarex operates 2 sections. Completion of the wells began in mid-September, with all of the Cimarex-operated wells now completed and beginning the early stages of flowback. These wells, along with partner-operated wells, should be coming on production over the next 2 quarters.
We also completed the Leon-Gundy wells, our stacked/staggered Meramec Woodford spacing pilot. These wells were brought on production in mid-October, thus it is too early to discuss any results. We look forward to discussing these wells in more detail on our next call.
We also continue to book delineate and hold our Meramec acreage, with our most recent well results in this play performing as expected relative to our pre-dual expectations. Of the 4 rigs we plan to operate in the Anadarko Basin next year, 3 of them will be dedicated to holding our Meramec acreage.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe Albi."

I'll start first with our third quarter production results then go into some detail on our revised Q4 '16 forecast and the resulting 2016 production outlook and then with an underneath-t",1487,"Thank you, John, and thank you all for joining us on our call today. I'll start first with our third quarter production results then go into some detail on our revised Q4 '16 forecast and the resulting 2016 production outlook and then with an underneath-the-hood look at our forecasted late Q4 ramp-up in production, I'll give you a glimpse of our preliminary 2017 production outlook. I'll then finish up with just a few comments on LOE and service costs.
As Tom mentioned, with the reported net equivalent daily volume of 947 million a day, our third quarter production came in just shy of our guidance range of 950 million to 980 million. Two main factors came into play when comparing our actual results to our guidance. First, we saw an unanticipated net volume reduction of approximately 7 million a day as a result of ethane rejection associated with the processing of our share of outside-operated Mid-Continent gas during the quarter. And secondly, we experienced approximately 13 million a day of production downtime due to slightly longer-than-anticipated completion times and the shut-in of the wells associated with those completions. These 2 factors alone pulled us away from the midpoint of our guidance.
If we look at Q3 by region, with the pickup of our Permian completion activity in mid-Q2, our third quarter Permian volume of 517 million a day was up 2% from Q2 '16, while our third quarter Mid-Continent volume of 427 million a day was down 2% from the second quarter, a result of our beginning of the year's slowdown in Mid-Continent completion activity, which we just recently picked up, as John mentioned, appear in late Q3.
Looking forward, before touching on our fourth quarter guidance, I want to provide a little color on our frac fleet utilization strategy. To provide consistency in our frac fleet utilization and operational results and to maintain full control of the timing and scheduling of our frac operations, we've opted to retain a consistent number of fleets to complete our wells. With a fluctuating rig schedule and a good mix of multiple and individual well completion projects, we carefully plan our inventory so as to minimize adding and dropping crews. If we did add and drop crews, we'd risk the ability to pick up the crews and iron, from which we worked so hard to develop our operational efficiencies, which means that when any completion operation takes longer than expected, either due to an operation or weather issue, or as a result of changing completion design on the fly to pump a larger, more time-consuming job, there's a domino effect on the timing of all completion operations following in queue. Our Wood State completion is a great example. When we provided Q3 guidance, the then-planned job size required an 18-day time period to complete each 3-well pad. Subsequent to providing guidance, we changed the job design, which required a 30-day time period to pump, and pushed back other wells from projects in queue. We saw this in the Mid-Continent as well. And as a result, we pushed out first production for some significant wells and projects that were previously forecasted to add production in early Q4 now to come on later in Q4 and pushed others out into 2017.
So in a nutshell, at the total company level, we've moved a number of our significant completions into late Q4 and a total 10 net wells previously slated for late Q4 into early 2017. With large anticipated production increases from our pilot and infill projects, simply sliding first production 2 to 4 weeks has a big impact when projecting volumes for a 12-week quarterly time period. And as a result, our Q4 production forecast dropped from our last quarter estimate.
We have a number of significant infill projects forecasted for Q4 in both the Permian and in the Mid-Continent. In the Permian, we've revised our first production timing for our Wood State project in Reeves County, with first production now forecasted for late November, December -- early December versus our last quarter estimate of October. With the revised completion timing, we've also moved first production for 5 net Permian wells, including production from our Tim Tam project, into early 2017.
Similarly, in the Mid-Continent, revised timing for frac operations has pushed out the timing for first production from our East Cana infill project, with our operated Nancy Condrey [ph] sections now scheduled to come online in November and December and our nonoperated project sections now forecasted to come on in the December to early 2017 time frame. As a result, 5 projected net Mid-Continent wells have also moved into 2017.
So when the dusts settle, our updated Q4 production guidance now sits at 945 million to 985 million a day, with a vast production ramp forecasted for the latter half of the quarter. With the increase, we're projecting December total company net equivalent volumes to be in excess of 1 Bcf a day.
As Tom mentioned, we have put together a preliminary 9-rig plan for 2017, funded comfortably with projected 2017 cash flow projections using our current strip. But the carryover of our Q4 '16 completion activity and the anticipated ramp-up in associated production into 2017, we're projecting a preliminary estimate of 1.05 to 1.1 Bcfe a day for our full year 2017 production. As compared to the midpoint of our current 2016 full year production guidance, this represents a 9% to 14% increase in production during 2017.
As Tom did, I want to again emphasize as well, this is a very preliminary plan. The plan can change as a result of many factors, including changes in commodity prices and/or changes in any of our activity levels, our project selection and the timing of our capital deployment.
Shifting gears to OpEx. We posted another nice guidance beat with our third quarter LOE, and we owe it all again to our production group's continued efforts to reduce our operating cost structure. We commend their efforts, and with their focus, we continue to realize significant cost reductions during the quarter, seeing some nice reductions in equipment and maintenance, contract labor and rentals, in particular. As a result, our Q3 lifting costs came in at $0.61 per Mcfe, at the low end of our guidance range of $0.60 to $0.75, down 6% from Q2 and down 27% from the $0.83 we've posted in -- for an average, in 2015. After incorporating our continued cost control efforts and the fluctuating nature of work over expenses, we're projecting our remaining year lifting costs to be in the $0.60 to $0.70 range.
And finally, some comments on drilling and completion costs. We continue to see our drilling cost components remain relatively in check and have seen completion cost components, for the most part, level off. That said, we're beginning to feel upward pressure on completion costs, with any increase most likely to occur after the beginning of the year. With that, we continue to focus on efficiencies on the drilling side by cutting down drilling days and on the completion side by optimizing our completion design, optimizing our water sourcing and optimizing our pumping operations.
With our costs in check, our generic well AFEs are flat to last quarter in the Permian. Our current Bone Spring 1-mile lateral AFEs are ranging $4.7 million to $5.1 million. That's flat to last quarter but down 6% from earlier in the year. In the Wolfcamp, with larger completions and current -- our current generic 2-mile lateral Culberson and Wolfcamp AFE continues to run in the $10.2 million to $11.2 million range. That, again, is flat to last call but down 5% from Q4 '15 and down 23% from late 2014.
With our larger frac design, our Cana core 1-mile lateral Woodford AFE continues to run in the range of $7.1 million to $7.5 million. That's up from the $6 million to $7 million -- $6.6 million to the $7 million range we quoted with smaller fracs earlier in the year but we're still down 10% from late 2014.
And finally, as we continue to experiment with frac design, our current 2-mile lateral Meramec AFEs are running in the range of $10.5 million to $12 million, with frac design really being the largest cost variable in the total well costs for our Meramec wells.
So in closing, we had another good quarter. We continue to make strides, reduce our operating cost structure. We stay focused on efficiencies to reduce and optimize total well costs, and we continue to make progress maximizing the productivity and profitability of our wells. Although we've seen our completion timing push out first production for a number of our bigger projects, due primarily to pumping bigger and bigger jobs, we're very pleased about our well results, and for that matter, we're very pleased about our entire program.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Q&A."

I'd say the general answer to that is yes, but it's like we've been talking about here too, the types of design of your frac, the pounds of sand, the amount of fluid, your cluster spacing, your science projects, what have you. I tend to look at it more on the basis of cost components, because they're the variables we can measure. And what we're seeing on the drilling side are relatively flat cost components. On the completion side, it's no secret, you've heard the likes of Halliburton talking about increasing their service costs. We anticipate that it's entirely possible, we may see somewhere of 5% to 7% somewhat increase in our completion service cost as we move forward. But overall, when you put it in the blender and turn it on, there's so many variables, how efficient can we be at sourcing our water, and we're spending a heck of a lot of time on that, and again, optimizing the cost benefits of the different frac design so that whatever the cost is, we see the optimal side of it on the production side. These are all things that we're constantly scrutinizing and studying. And the end result is what Tom and John have both alluded to, what's our best rate of return.

It's an exciting project, because as, yes, our partner elaborated, I saw their write up on it, it is a long lateral development project. It's 10,000-foot laterals in an area where we get very good condensate yield with very good rate of returns. I will tell you, the biggest questions we have regarding that, quite frankly, is how many wells per section do we want to put. Based on our previous results and what we call Row 4 home across [ph] Phillips, where we pushed the spacing even tighter, we've been very pleased with those results. Likewise, the current developed section, the eastern core infill, our partner has a number of sections where they, again, are testing tighter spacing. Those results as well as perhaps even some other things we want to test might lead to even more wells per section within that development, which even makes it more appealing to us. So there's a lot of discussions with our partner about that, and we fully anticipate certainly in the second half of next year, we will be deploying rigs on that development project in the Cana area."

We're basically 100% operators on those acreage, besides the Culberson JDA with Chevron. But in Culberson, we are the operator since we dictate the budget there.

And so we're able to easily put that into our budget forecasting. The area where it gets a little more cloudy, especially in the Meramec, is, yes, all of a sudden, we're getting hit with a lot of outside operated wells scattered throughout that play, a lot of activity that has caused probably a little bit more capital than we originally planned, but it's not a huge component. But we'll certainly -- we will be accounting for that going into next year as well. I'll point out, again, just like what I said early in the Permian, what you'll see shake out in Anadarko is once everybody kind of gets to the position of holding their acreage, then you get into where people start doing acreage swaps or trying to block up.
