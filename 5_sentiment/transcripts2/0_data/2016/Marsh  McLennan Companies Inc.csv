It's difficult to accurately predict where the world is headed. I returned from , where ongoing global market volatility was a major point of discussion. Our clients need advice now more than ever to navigate these uncertain times. For Marsh & McLennan, opportunities are abundant to help our client face the challenges for the day, many of which evolve around risks, strategy and people. These challenges are highlighted in the animal global risks report, produced by the world economic forum with the help of Marsh & McLennan Companies. This report explores the mounting and interconnected risks faced by corporations of all sizes as well as government entities and individuals. 
Over the last several years, the dialogue has evolved from mainly economic risks to include geopolitical, societal and environmental concerns. We certainly live in an age of risk. According to the U.N., 2015 was characterized by social and political instability, as some 60 million people were forcibly displaced, the largest number in history. Geopolitical tensions are also escalating between global and regional powers in places like Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Ukraine, Korea and the South China Sea. Market dislocations in China and drastic reductions and commodity prices have raised concerns about global growth and dented business confidence. And financial markets are skeptical about the effectiveness of central banks given the limited tools at their disposal in a near 0 interest rate environment. Amidst this global uncertainty, it is easy for companies to embrace self-fulfilling pessimism. While we remain cautious on the global front, we see several factors that are positive for Marsh & McLennan Companies. The developed world continues to pose modest but steady GDP growth and improving employment rates. And the emerging markets, while volatile, are a long-term driver of growth. The demand for our services remained strong. We are optimistic about our prospects for continued organic growth, and our acquisition pipeline is in good shape. Our fundamentals are rock solid. We were stronger strategically, operationally and financially than at any time in the past decade. We have a deep understanding of our clients and the markets in which we operate. We set challenging yet realistic objectives for our performance, and we delivered on our commitments. 
So let's review our performance in 2015. We capped off the year with an outstanding fourth quarter, posting our highest underlying revenue growth of 2015 at 5%. This was our 11th consecutive quarter of at least 3% underlying revenue growth. We also delivered 8% adjusted EPS growth, driven by higher operating income with margin expansion in both the RIS and Consulting segments. In terms of our full year performance, MMC produced underlying revenue growth, margin expansion in both segments and meaningful EPS growth. Underlying revenue grew 4%, representing our sixth consecutive year in the 3% to 5% growth range. This was also our fifth consecutive year of margin expansion in both the RIS and Consulting segments. This expansion was balanced across the segment with Risks and Insurance Services rising 90 basis points to 23.3%; and Consulting, up 80 basis points to 17.3%. 
On a consolidated basis, the margin rose 100 basis points to 19.1%, our highest level in 12 years. Adjusted EPS increased 8% to a record $3.05 while absorbing $0.18 of negative FX impact. 
Since 2009, our adjusted EPS has grown at a CAGR of 13.5%, consistent with a long -- the 13% long-term target we set at Investor Day in 2010, and reaffirmed at Investor Day in March 2014. This was accomplished despite approximately $200 million of FX headwinds during this 6-year period, a yearly average of $0.04 per share. 
Before I discuss our view regarding 2016, I would like to spend a few moments on recent developments in the insurance industry. There is a noticeable amount of change occurring that many insurance companies. We have seen large-scale M&A, senior management changes, a reduction in the underwriting advertise at several companies as well as the willingness of some firms to reconsider reinsurance as a way to reduce volatility. These developments are not overly concerning to us or our clients. Since the changes do not relate to issues of financial strength or solvency. In fact, there are potential positive outcomes for MMC such as volatile markets can result in a to quality as client seeks brokers who has depth of experience and capability. Clients may lean even more towards their broker to assess and recommend markets. More underwriting discipline may come to the market. This is really hard to call. It is just as likely to create more competition in this short-term. And high-quality underwriting talent is becoming more dispersed. This could lead to a prolonged healthy competitive market with higher levels of innovation, new product offerings and improved service.
Now turning to 2016. For the year, we expect to grow underlying revenue, expand margins, deliver strong growth in adjusted EPS and return meaningful capital to shareholders. Starting with organic revenue growth. One of the key strengths of MMC is the diversity of our geographic footprint. It is an important driver of our long-term growth. The developing world should grow faster over the longer-term owing to generally higher levels of GDP growth, under penetration of insurance and the ability to sell more of our consulting services globally. However, these countries have been experiencing more volatility recently, with many impacted by declines in commodity prices. While there is concern about the emerging world and the overall strength of the global economy, the U.S. and U.K. continued to perform relatively well. These 2 countries represent our largest geographies, providing stability to our revenue.
On a consolidated basis, over the last 6 years, we have grown underlying revenue in a range of 3% to 5%, and we view this range as the likely outcome for 2016. Underpinning our revenue has been low single-digit GDP growth and benign inflation in the developed world, with modestly better growth in the emerging markets. In addition, we anticipate low single-digit global P&C premium growth as increases in insured values and other exposures should offset the FX of rate reductions.
Turning to margins. We have just concluded our eighth consecutive year of margin expansion. Over this period, our adjusted operating margin has improved more than 1,000 basis points to 19.1%. As we have said many times, we do not have a margin target. We view margin expansion as a natural outcome of managing a business properly to grow revenue and earnings. We are disciplined around managing our annual expense growth, in line with revenue growth and maintain flexibility to adjust accordingly. While it is conceivable, expense growth may exceed revenue growth in a given quarter. We would not expect this to occur for a full year. So as we look at 2016, we expect to deliver margin expansion in both segments for the seventh consecutive year.
Moving to EPS growth. 2015 was an unprecedented year for FX. We posted 8% adjusted EPS growth or 14.5% on a constant currency basis. These foreign exchange rates remain at their current levels. We anticipate about $0.07 per share of adverse currency impact in 2016, less than half of what we saw last year. Given our current view of FX and global macroeconomic conditions, we expect strong EPS growth in 2016 at a level approaching our long-term target. 
Turning to capital management. We are a cash business. As we produce high levels of earnings growth, our cash flows should grow at a similar rate. We will continue to deploy capital in excess of our free cash flow. We expect to increase debt balances each year as earnings growth increases our debt capacity. As mentioned on our last earnings call, we anticipate capital deployed in 2016 for dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases to approximate $2.3 billion. We reiterate our annual commitments to reduce our share count and grow our dividend per share by double digits, and we will continue to grow the firm through acquisitions that build our market position, client services and geographic footprint. I also want to spend a few moments in our investment philosophy. We believe in balance. And in this context, it's the balance between delivering strong financial performance today while investing for our future. MMC has a solid foundation, and we have the flexibility to deliver strong financial performance in a variety of market conditions. We have balance sheet flexibility to take advantage of opportunities while preserving our ability to manage through periods of stress. 
Since 2009, we have invested nearly $7 billion for growth and efficiency. This includes CapEx of $2.2 billion, 115 acquisitions and investments, totaling approximately $4.6 billion and an increasing our headcount of over 10,000 colleagues. We have also invested in and rewarded our colleagues. In each of the last 8 years, our overall global incentive compensation pools have increased while we have driven significant margin expansion. Acquisitions are our core competency of Marsh & McLennan Companies. We don't just buy companies. We develop relationships over time. We see chemistry and a cultural fit, and we invest in growth not just geographically but by segment, by line of business and by capability. We were active in 2015, completing 27 acquisitions and investments for approximately $1.2 billion. 
Lastly, I want to thank our 60,000 colleagues for their contribution, and in particular, my leadership team. I am privileged to work with a strong leadership team that is defined by high standards, diversity of thought, cohesiveness and collegiality. We are a team that takes its commitment seriously, and we have delivered year-after-year. 
In summary, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results as we continue to execute our long-term strategy for growth. As we look to 2016, we are well-positioned to deliver underlying revenue growth, margin expansion in both operating segments and strong EPS growth. With that, let me turn it over to Mark to give you more details on our performance."

I'm very pleased to be joining the call today as the CFO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. 
MMC capped off the year with an outstanding fourth quarter. We delivered underlying revenue growth across each of our operating companies, and both segments generated adjusted operating income growth with margin expansion. GAAP EPS rose 31%, including a $37 million pretax gain from Mercer sale of the U.S. defined contribution recordkeeping business. This gain is being excluded from our adjusted results. We believe this presentation is more indicative of the underlying performance of the company. 
On an adjusted basis for the quarter, EPS increased 8% to $0.71. Our full year 2015 results represent another year of strong performance. Underlying revenue growth was 4%, with solid growth at all 4 operating companies. Adjusted operating income increased 5% to $2.5 billion despite a significant foreign exchange headwind. Our overall adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 19.1% with both segments contributing. GAAP EPS grew 12% and adjusted EPS rose 8%, in line with the high single-digit guidance we provided throughout the year. The Insurance Services, revenue into fourth quarter was $1.7 billion, with underlying growth of 4%. Adjusted operating income grew 3% and the margin increased to 21.1%. 
For the year, underlying revenue growth was 3%, adjusted operating income rose 3% to $1.6 billion. And the margin increased 90 basis points to 23.3%, the highest annual margin in over a decade. Adjusted operating margins and RIS have improved every year since 2007. 
Marsh's fourth quarter performance was strong across the board. Revenue was $1.5 billion with underlying growth of 4%, driven by strong new business. Growth in the quarter was notable as it came on top of 4% growth in the fourth quarter of 2014. The U.S./Canada division grew 3%, led by Marsh & McLennan agencies. 
In the International division, underlying revenue grew 5%, with 3% growth in EMEA, reflecting strong performance in the U.K.; 4% growth in Asia Pacific; and 13% in Latin America. In December, Marsh completed its acquisition of U.K.-based group. This acquisition supports Marsh's strategy to expand globally in the middle market. For the year, Marsh's underlying revenue growth revenue rose 3%, reflecting growth of 3% in both the U.S./Canada and International divisions. This was Marsh's fifth consecutive year with underlying revenue growth of at least 3%. 
Guy Carpenter's revenue was $217 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 5% on an underlying basis. EMEA and Latin America were areas of strength. For the full year, underlying revenue growth was 2%, a good result considering the ongoing challenges facing the reinsurance industry.
Moving to consulting. Revenue was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong underlying growth of 5%. Adjusted operating income increased 5% to $265 million. The adjusted operating margin expanded 60 basis points to 16.7%, the 16th consecutive quarterly increase. 
For the year, underlying revenue growth was 5% and adjusted operating income increased 4%, exceeding $1 billion for the first time. 
Consulting track record of achieving higher adjusted operating margins in recent years. 
In 2015, the margin expanded 80 basis points to 17.3%, its highest level in over 30 years. Since 2010, Consulting's margins have improved by 600 basis points. Marsh's revenue was $1.1 million in the quarter, an underlying increase of 5%, which follows 5% growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Solid performance was achieved across all 3 of Mercer's major geographies: North America, Europe ; and growth market. The revenue increase was driven by health, up 8%; and talent up 7%. Investments rose 2% and retirement grew 1%. Health continues to benefit from growth in both the core business and Mercer Marketplace, and talent once again performed well. 
In the quarter, Mercer completed several acquisitions, including partners, a provider of workday implementation services. In addition, Mercer's successfully completed the sale of U.S.-defined contribution recordkeeping business in the quarter. This activity highlights the strategy Mercer has been executing over the last several years. Investing in growth opportunities while deemphasizing areas that do not need our return requirements or not for the business. 
For the year, Mercer's underlying revenue growth was 4%, with investments increasing 7%; health, up 6%; and talent, up 5%. Retirement was flat. Mercer's underlying revenue growth has been 3% or better for the last 5 years. 
Oliver Wyman delivered another strong quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $476 million, reflecting underlying growth of 7%. Growth was driven by financial services, Lippincott and the business. For the year, Oliver Wyman's revenue growth was also 7%, which builds on a strong growth of 15% in 2014.
As we typically do at this time of year, let me update you regarding our global retirement plan. As you may recall, in the first quarter of 2015, we recognized a nonrecurring credits of $125 million as a result of changes to our U.S. post-65 retiree medical plan. This action represented a substantial portion of the mitigation we undertook to offset the increase in the annual retirement spend we based last year due to declines in global interest rates. 
Late in 2015, we made additional retirement plan changes that essentially replaced this credit not only through 2016 but beyond. As discussed on our last earnings call, the most impactful change was in the structure of our U.S.-defined benefit plan and what was divided into 2 separate plans. This structure better positioned the company to take advantage of derisking opportunities. It also resulted in extending the amortization period for actuarial gains and losses in the inactive plan. This lowers annual pension expenses. As a result of these changes, coupled with the many other factors that go into determining the year-end measurement of our pension expense, we expect a year-over-year decline in retirement expense of approximately $30 million for 2016 or $0.04 per share.
Turning to investment income. In the third quarter of 2015, we recognized investment income of $29 million from the final settlement of our Trident III investment. At year-end, our private equity portfolio amounted to $76 million, and we expect to generate only modest investment income going forward versus the $38 million we recognized in 2015. The anticipated reduction in our investment income for 2016 should eventually offset the $0.04 benefit from the lower retirement expense.
As we anticipated on our earnings call in October, the FX headwind in the fourth quarter was $0.05 per share and $0.18 for the year. This was by far the highest annual level of FX impact in MMC's history. These foreign exchange rates remain at their current levels, we expect FX to adversely affect EPS by approximately $0.07 in 2016. The majority of the impacts will be felt in the first half of the year.
Our tax rate fluctuates quarter-to-quarter, reflecting geographic mix of earnings, half settlement, completion of open tax years and changes in international and local tax rates. Our adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter was 29.7%, and the rate for the year was 28.7%, reflecting discrete items. 
Based on the current landscape, for modeling purposes, it would be reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29% in 2016.
Total balance sheet debt at year-end was $4.4 billion, slightly below the third quarter level, reflecting the recent repayment of a $50 million term loan. In 2015, balance sheet debt increased by approximately $1 billion. The term structure of our debt portfolio provides us significant flexibility, with few near-term payment obligation. Our net debt maturity -- net debt maturity is a $250 million senior note due in April 2017. 
Due to the substantial work we have done to restructure our debt over the last 3 years, our average cost of debt has fallen to 3.7%. 
In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our stock for $75 million. For the year, we bought back 24.8 million shares for $1.4 billion, the highest level in our history. As we mentioned on our third quarter call, we pushed forward a portion of the share repurchases we plan for both the fourth quarter and 2016. As a result, our buyback activity is expected to be less than 2015. As Dan mentioned this year, we expected to deploy roughly $2.3 billion of capital across share repurchases, acquisition and dividend. 
In 2015, we returned over $2 billion of capital to shareholders in a form of dividends and share repurchases. Overall, we deployed $3.2 billion of capital across share buybacks, acquisitions and dividends; a record year of capital deployment for MMC. Sources of this capital include our operating cash flows, the addition of $1 billion of balance sheet debt and a reduction of $600 million in balance sheet cash. Since 2013, we have added $1.5 billion of balance sheet debt and reduced our cash balance by over $900 million. 
For the year, uses of cash included $632 million for dividend, $1.2 billion for acquisitions and investments and $1.4 billion for share repurchases. 
For the fourth quarter, we deployed $800 million -- $811 million of cash that included $164 million for dividends, $572 million for acquisition and $75 million for share repurchases. 
Cash on our balance sheet at year-end stood at $1.4 billion, which was down from $2 billion at the end of 2014. Cash in the U.S. was $580 million. 
Once again, in 2015, we delivered on our capital return commitment. We reduced our share count by more than 3% and increased our dividend per share by over 11%. With that, I'm happy to turn the call back over to Dan."

It has, basically, obviously, top line growth is a significant factor. And the more we grow the top line, the easier it is to spend margins. Although we have proven our ability to spend margins even in times of pretty low organic growth. We feel very comfortable that when you look over the last number of years, how we have grown in the 3% to 5% organic growth area that for '15, the way it feels for us is that we'll be in that range. And we will have margin expansion in both segments. And therefore, our operating earnings will be quite strong. And fundamentally, that is the backbone into how we will deliver EPS growth. So there's nothing in our current thinking of it that involves issues like tax, et cetera. The one thing we don't control is FX. We don't control the macroeconomic conditions in the world either, but we're less concerned about that. Because that sort of has a lag factor. But FX, hits you between the eyes in any 1 quarter or in any 1 year. But if you look at our results even in 2015 on a constant currency basis, it was very strong. And we would expect that to continue in 2016."

First, whatever percentage we give you on commissions versus fee, that would -- bear in mind that it's not a direct insulation. If there's a long, long-term soft market that puts downward pressure on fees as well on the competitive environment. So it's not that fee business is completely insulated from the vagaries of the market. But having said that, when you look at how we run the company over long stretches of time because of the amount of capital and competition amongst insurance companies on a global basis, we expect it to generally be a downward trend rating levels. Now insurance rates are the most important thing in a lot of respects to insurance companies. Insurance premiums are more important to intermediaries. And so when we look at exposure units and other factors around the world, we expect to see some slight growth in insurance premiums. Notwithstanding some of the downward pressure that is existing on rating levels. So Peter, do you want to add to that?"

First of all, we do have a good pipeline both in RIS and in Consulting. It is a global pipeline. When we evaluate our pipeline though, we generally look at a lot of different things. With these cast a glance over a lot of different things but do very few, for a variety of reasons. So even last year which was a very active year for us, where we had 27 acquisitions and investments. We actually reviewed more than 10x the amount of what we actually did. So that gives you an idea of the labyrinth that needs to go through for us to say we want to do this acquisition and conclude it. And multiples are a factor. I mean, last year, I can tell you that even though we did $1.2 billion out transactions in terms of transaction value, we walked away from well more than $1.2 billion of transaction value. And generally, we walked away because of either concerns about growth. The difference between our view and what the potential growth could be in the future rather than the sellers view of what the potential growth could be for price expectations. So we believe we're disciplined. Clearly over a course of a number of years, we've seen some multiple expansion, particularly for larger type of acquisitions because that attracts PE and other parties to it. But actually for midsize, smaller folding talking and type of acquisition for multiples, while they were be a bit more than 5 years ago, was still think that they are quite reasonable. And if you look at our real strategy, I think that you would see was a bit of an outlier size wise. Not much of an outlier. But a bit. you look at the acquisitions that we've done over the last 5 years. The average acquisition transaction value has been about $40 million per transaction. And so it's more of a strength of pearls than chunkier than that. There'll be the odd larger company, but it's not a change in strategy in any way."

It is difficult to accurately predict where the world is headed. I recently returned from Davos, where ongoing global market volatility was a major point of discussion. Our clients need advice now more than ever to navigate these uncertain times. For Marsh & McLennan, opportunities are abundant to help our clients face the challenges for the day, many of which evolve around risk, strategy and people. These challenges are highlighted in the annual global risks report produced by the world economic forum with the help of Marsh & McLennan Companies. This report explores the mounting and interconnected risks faced by corporations of all sizes, as well as government entities and individuals. 
Over the last several years, the dialogue has evolved from mainly economic risk to include geopolitical, societal and environmental concerns. We certainly live in an age of risk. According to the U.N., 2015 was characterized by social and political instability, as some 60 million people were forcibly displaced, the largest number in history. 
Geopolitical tensions are also escalating between global and regional powers in places like Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Ukraine, Korea and the South China Sea. 
Market dislocations in China and drastic reductions in commodity prices have raised concerns about global growth and dented business confidence. And financial markets are skeptical about the effectiveness of central banks, given the limited tools at their disposal in a near-0 interest rate environment. Amidst this global uncertainty, it is easy for companies to embrace self-fulfilling pessimism. 
While we remain cautious on the global front, we see several factors that are positive for Marsh & McLennan Companies. The developed world continues to post modest but steady GDP growth and improving employment rates, and the emerging markets, while volatile, are a long-term driver of growth. The demand for our services remain strong. We are optimistic about our prospects for continued organic growth, and our acquisition pipeline is in good shape. 
Our fundamentals are rock solid. We are stronger strategically, operationally and financially than at any time in the past decade. We have a deep understanding of our clients and the markets in which we operate. We set challenging yet realistic objectives for our performance and we deliver on our commitments. 
So let's review our performance in 2015. We capped off the year with an outstanding fourth quarter, posting our highest underlying revenue growth of 2015 at 5%. This was our 11th consecutive quarter of at least 3% underlying revenue growth. We also delivered 8% adjusted EPS growth, driven by higher operating income with margin expansion in both the RIS and Consulting segments. 
In terms of our full year performance, MMC produced underlying revenue growth, margin expansion in both segments and meaningful EPS growth. Underlying revenue grew 4%, representing our sixth consecutive year in the 3% to 5% growth range. This was also our sixth consecutive year of margin expansion in both the RIS and Consulting segments. 
This expansion was balanced across the segments, with Risks and Insurance Services rising 90 basis points to 23.3% and Consulting up 80 basis points to 17.3%. On a consolidated basis, the margin rose 100 basis points to 19.1%, our highest level in 12 years. Adjusted EPS increased 8% to a record $3.05 while absorbing $0.18 of negative FX impact. 
Since 2009, our adjusted EPS has grown at a CAGR of 13.5%, consistent with a long -- the 13% long-term target we set at Investor Day in 2010 and reaffirmed at Investor Day in March 2014. This was accomplished despite approximately $200 million of FX headwinds during this 6-year period, a yearly average of $0.04 per share. 
Before I discuss our view regarding 2016, I would like to spend a few moments on recent developments in the insurance industry. There is a noticeable amount of change occurring at many insurance companies. We have seen large-scale M&A, senior management changes, a reduction in the underwriting appetite at several companies as well as the willingness of some firms to reconsider reinsurance as a way to reduce volatility. 
These developments are not overly concerning to us or our clients since the changes do not relate to issues of financial strength or solvency. In fact, there are potential positive outcomes for MMC, such as volatile markets can result in a flight to quality as clients seek brokers who have a depth of experience and capability. Clients may lean even more toward their broker to assess and recommend markets. More underwriting discipline may come to the market. This is really hard to call. It is just as likely to create more competition in this short term. And high-quality underwriting talent is becoming more dispersed. This could lead to a prolonged, healthy, competitive market, with higher levels of innovation, new product offerings and improved service.
Now turning to 2016. For the year, we expect to grow underlying revenue, expand margins, deliver strong growth in adjusted EPS and return meaningful capital to shareholders, starting with organic revenue growth. One of the key strengths of MMC is the diversity of our geographic footprint. It is an important driver of our long-term growth. The developing world should grow faster over the longer term, owing to generally higher levels of GDP growth, underpenetration of insurance and the ability to sell more of our consulting services globally. However, these countries have been experiencing more volatility recently, with many impacted by declines in commodity prices. 
While there is concern about the emerging world and the overall strength of the global economy, the U.S. and U.K. continued to perform relatively well. These 2 countries represent our largest geographies, providing stability to our revenue.
On a consolidated basis, over the last 6 years, we have grown underlying revenue in a range of 3% to 5%, and we view this range as the likely outcome for 2016. Underpinning our revenue has been low single-digit GDP growth and benign inflation in the developed world with modestly better growth in the emerging markets. In addition, we anticipate low single-digit global P&C premium growth as increases in insured values and other exposures should offset the effects of rate reductions.
Turning to margins. We have just concluded our eighth consecutive year of margin expansion. Over this period, our adjusted operating margin has improved more than 1,000 basis points to 19.1%. As we have said many times, we do not have a margin target. We view margin expansion as a natural outcome of managing a business properly to grow revenue and earnings. We are disciplined around managing our annual expense growth in line with revenue growth and maintain flexibility to adjust accordingly. While it is conceivable expense growth may exceed revenue growth in a given quarter, we would not expect this to occur for a full year. So as we look at 2016, we expect to deliver margin expansion in both segments for the seventh consecutive year.
Moving to EPS growth. 2015 was an unprecedented year for FX. We posted 8% adjusted EPS growth or 14.5% on a constant-currency basis. If foreign exchange rates remain at their current levels, we anticipate about $0.07 per share of adverse currency impact in 2016, less than half of what we saw last year. Given our current view of FX and global macroeconomic conditions, we expect strong EPS growth in 2016 at a level approaching our long-term target. 
Turning to capital management. We are a cash business. As we produce high levels of earnings growth, our cash flows should grow at a similar rate. We will continue to deploy capital in excess of our free cash flow. We expect to increase debt balances each year as earnings growth increases our debt capacity. 
As mentioned on our last earnings call, we anticipate capital deployed in 2016 for dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases to approximate $2.3 billion. We reiterate our annual commitment to reduce our share count and grow our dividend per share by double digits. And we will continue to grow the firm through acquisitions that build our market position, client services and geographic footprint. 
I also want to spend a few moments on our investment philosophy. We believe in balance, and in this context, it's the balance between delivering strong financial performance today while investing for our future. MMC has a solid foundation, and we have the flexibility to deliver strong financial performance in a variety of market conditions. We have balance sheet flexibility to take advantage of opportunities while preserving our ability to manage through periods of stress. 
Since 2009, we have invested nearly $7 billion for growth and efficiencies. This includes CapEx of $2.2 billion, 115 acquisitions and investments totaling approximately $4.6 billion and an increase our headcount of over 10,000 colleagues. We have also invested in and rewarded our colleagues. In each of the last 8 years, our overall global incentive compensation pools have increased while we have driven significant margin expansion. 
Acquisitions are a core competency of Marsh & McLennan Companies. We don't just buy companies, we develop relationships over time. We seek chemistry and a cultural fit. And we invest in growth not just geographically, but by segment, by line of business and by capability. We were active in 2015, completing 27 acquisitions and investments for approximately $1.2 billion. 
Lastly, I want to thank our 60,000 colleagues for their contributions, and in particular, my leadership team. I am privileged to work with a strong leadership team that is defined by high standards, diversity of thought, cohesiveness and collegiality. We are a team that takes its commitments seriously and we have delivered year after year. 
In summary, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results as we continue to execute our long-term strategy for growth. As we look to 2016, we are well-positioned to deliver underlying revenue growth, margin expansion in both operating segments and strong EPS growth. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mark to give you more details on our performance."

I'm very pleased to be joining the call today as the CFO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. 
MMC capped off the year with an outstanding fourth quarter. We delivered underlying revenue growth across each of our operating companies, and both segments generated adjusted operating income growth with margin expansion. GAAP EPS rose 31%, including a $37 million pretax gain from Mercer sale of the U.S.-defined contribution recordkeeping business. This gain has been excluded from our adjusted results. We believe this presentation is more indicative of the underlying performance of the company. 
On an adjusted basis for the quarter, EPS increased 8% to $0.71. Our full year 2015 results represent another year of strong performance. Underlying revenue growth was 4%, with solid growth at all 4 operating companies. Adjusted operating income increased 5% to $2.5 billion despite a significant foreign exchange headwind. Our overall adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 19.1%, with both segments contributing. GAAP EPS grew 12% and adjusted EPS rose 8%, in line with the high single-digit guidance we provided throughout the year. 
For Risk and Insurance Services, revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.7 billion, with underlying growth of 4%. Adjusted operating income grew 3%, and the margin increased to 21.1%. For the year, underlying revenue growth was 3%, adjusted operating income rose 3% to $1.6 billion. And the margin increased 90 basis points to 23.3%, the highest annual margin in over a decade. Adjusted operating margins in RIS have improved every year since 2007. 
Marsh's fourth quarter performance was strong across the board. Revenue was $1.5 billion, with underlying growth of 4% driven by strong new business. Growth in the quarter was notable as it came on top of 4% growth in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
The U.S./Canada division grew 3%, led by Marsh & McLennan agency. In the International division, underlying revenue grew 5%, with 3% growth in EMEA, reflecting strong performance in the U.K.; 4% growth in Asia Pacific; and 13% in Latin America. 
In December, Marsh completed its acquisition of U.K.-based Jelf Group. This acquisition supports Marsh's strategy to expand globally in the middle market. For the year, Marsh's underlying revenue growth -- revenue rose 3%, reflecting growth of 3% in both the U.S./Canada and International divisions. This was Marsh's fifth consecutive year with underlying revenue growth of at least 3%. 
Guy Carpenter's revenue was $217 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 5% on an underlying basis. EMEA and Latin America were areas of strength. For the full year, underlying revenue growth was 2%, a good result considering the ongoing challenges facing the reinsurance industry.
Moving to Consulting. Revenue was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong underlying growth of 5%. Adjusted operating income increased 5% to $265 million. The adjusted operating margin expanded 60 basis points to 16.7%, the 16th consecutive quarterly increase. For the year, underlying revenue growth was 5% and adjusted operating income increased 4%, exceeding $1 billion for the first time. 
Consulting has built a track record of achieving higher adjusted operating margins in recent years. In 2015, the margin expanded 80 basis points to 17.3%, its highest level in over 30 years. Since 2010, Consulting's margins have improved by 600 basis points. 
Mercer's revenue was $1.1 million in the fourth quarter, an underlying increase of 5%, which follows 5% growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Solid performance was achieved across all 3 of Mercer's major geographies: North America, Euro-Pac and growth markets. The revenue increase was driven by health, up 8%; and talent, up 7%. Investments rose 2% and retirement grew 1%. Health continues to benefit from the -- from growth in both the core business and Mercer Marketplace, and talent once again performed well. 
In the quarter, Mercer completed several acquisitions, including CPSG Partners, a provider of workday implementation services. In addition, Mercer successfully completed the sale of its U.S.-defined contribution recordkeeping business in the quarter. This activity highlights the strategy Mercer has been executing over the last several years: Investing in growth opportunities while deemphasizing areas that do not meet our return requirement or are not core to its business. 
For the year, Mercer's underlying revenue growth was 4%, with investments increasing 7%, health up 6% and talent up 5%. Retirement was flat. Mercer's underlying revenue growth has been 3% or better for the last 5 years. 
Oliver Wyman delivered another strong quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $476 million, reflecting underlying growth of 7%. Growth was driven by financial services, Lippincott and the actuarial business. For the year, Oliver Wyman's underlying revenue growth was also 7%, which builds on a strong growth of 15% in 2014.
As we typically do at this time of the year, let me update you regarding our global retirement plan. As you may recall, in the first quarter of 2015, we recognized a nonrecurring credit of $125 million as a result of changes to our U.S. post-65 retiree medical plan. This action represented a substantial portion of the mitigation we undertook to offset the increase in the annual retirement spend we based last year due to declines in global interest rates. 
Late in 2015, we made additional retirement plan changes that essentially replaced this credit not only through 2016 but beyond. As discussed on our last earnings call, the most impactful change was in the structure of our U.S.-defined benefit plan, where it was divided into 2 separate plans. This structure better positions the company to take advantage of derisking opportunity. It also resulted in extending the amortization period for actuarial gains and losses in the inactive plans. This lowers annual pension expenses. 
As a result of these changes, coupled with the many other factors that go into determining the year-end measurement of our pension expense, we expect a year-over-year decline in retirement expense of approximately $30 million for 2016 or $0.04 per share.
Turning to investment income. In the third quarter of 2015, we recognized investment income of $29 million from the final settlement of our Trident III investment. At year-end, our private equity portfolio amounted to $76 million, and we expect to generate only modest investment income going forward versus the $38 million we recognized in 2015. The anticipated reduction in our investment income for 2016 should essentially offset the $0.04 benefit from lower retirement expense.
As we anticipated on our earnings call in October, the FX headwind in the fourth quarter was $0.05 per share and $0.18 for the year. This was by far the highest annual level of FX impact in MMC's history. If foreign exchange rates remain at their current levels, we expect FX to adversely affect EPS by approximately $0.07 in 2016. The majority of the impact will be felt in the first half of the year.
Our tax rate fluctuates quarter-to-quarter, reflecting the geographic mix of earnings, tax settlements, completion of open tax years and changes in international and local tax rates. Our adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter was 29.7%, and the rate for the year was 28.7%, reflecting discrete items. 
Based on the current landscape, for modeling purposes, it would be reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29% in 2016.
Total balance sheet debt at year-end was $4.4 billion, slightly below the third quarter level, reflecting the recent repayment of a $50 million term loan. In 2015, balance sheet debt increased by approximately $1 billion. The term structure of our debt portfolio provides us significant flexibility, with few near-term repayment obligations. Our net debt maturity -- next debt maturity is a $250 million senior note due in April 2017. Due to the substantial work we have done to restructure our debt over the last 3 years, our average cost of debt has fallen to 3.7%. 
In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our stock for $75 million. For the year, we bought back 24.8 million shares for $1.4 billion, the highest level in our history. As we mentioned on our third quarter call, we pulled forward a portion of the share repurchases we had planned for both the fourth quarter and 2016. As a result, our buyback activity is expected to be less than 2015. As Dan mentioned this year, we expect to deploy roughly $2.3 billion of capital across share repurchases, acquisitions and dividends. 
In 2015, we returned over $2 billion of capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Overall, we deployed $3.2 billion of capital across share buybacks, acquisitions and dividends, a record year of capital deployment for MMC. Sources of this capital included our operating cash flows, the addition of $1 billion of balance sheet debt and a reduction of $600 million in balance sheet cash. Since 2013, we have added $1.5 billion of balance sheet debt and reduced our cash balance by over $900 million. 
For the year, uses of cash included $632 million for dividends, $1.2 billion for acquisitions and investments and $1.4 billion for share repurchases. For the fourth quarter, we deployed $800 million -- $811 million of cash that included $164 million for dividends, $572 million for acquisitions and $75 million for share repurchases. 
Cash on our balance sheet at year end stood at $1.4 billion, which was down from $2 billion at the end of 2014. Cash in the U.S. was $580 million. 
Once again, in 2015, we delivered on our capital return commitments. We reduced our share count by more than 3% and increased our dividend per share by over 11%. 
With that, I'm happy to turn the call back over to Dan."

It has -- basically, obviously, top line growth is a significant factor. And the more we grow top line, the easier it is to expand margins, although we have proven our ability to expand margins even in times of pretty low organic growth. We feel very comfortable that when you look over the last number of years, how we have grown in the 3% to 5% organic growth area that for '16, the way it feels like to us is that we'll be in that range of -- and we will have margin expansion in both segments. And therefore, our operating earnings will be quite strong. And fundamentally, that is the backbone to how we will deliver EPS growth. So there's nothing in our current thinking of it that involves issues like tax, et cetera. The one thing we don't control is FX. We don't control the macroeconomic conditions in the world either, but we're less concerned about that because that sort of has a lag factor. But FX hits you between the eyes in any one quarter and in any one year. But if you look at our results, even in 2015 on a constant currency basis, it was very strong. And we would expect that to continue in 2016."

Then we have shared best practices across those high-quality agencies, and so that quality has led to more quality. A big part of the organic growth though is not only have we acquired high-quality agencies, we've invested a lot in our sales capacity. And so we're trying to grow net sales capacity each and every year. We now have over 700 full-time producers within MMA, and that makes a very big difference. And then lastly is that Dave Eslick and his leadership team have executed very well. So not only are we growing the segment strategically where we want it to be in, attracting the high quality -- the highest-quality agencies, we're also investing and executing on sales capacity.

First, whatever percentage we give you on commissions versus fees, I would bear in mind that it's not a direct insulation. If there's a prolonged, long-term soft market, it puts downward pressure on fees as well in a competitive environment, so it's not that fee business is completely insulated from the vagaries of the market. But having said that, when you look at how we run the company over long stretches of time, because of the amount of capital and competition amongst insurance companies on a global basis, we expect there to generally be a downward trend on rating levels. Now insurance rates are the most important thing in a lot of respects to an insurance company. Insurance premiums are more important to intermediaries. And so when we look at exposure units and other factors around the world, we expect to see some slight growth in insurance premiums notwithstanding some of the downward pressure that is existing on rating levels.

But obviously, we're very pleased with the 5%. And that came from good client retention. We had strong new facultative business in Latin America and the U.K. And Marine specialty, Continental Europe and U.S. facultative all outperformed. In addition, we got a maximum performance bonus from a major global client. So there was nothing one-off about it. But bear in mind that it is our smallest quarter. No, we remained innovative and we'll remain relevant to our different segments. We've added new resources to our existing highly talented pool. We made investments in leading-edge client-facing technologies, and these are being recognized by our clients. And we're harnessing alternative capital. We were top of the leagues in the cat bond space last year and we got a good pipeline coming on. Now the good news, I think, is that some of our major clients have signaled their interest in returning to the reinsurance markets to meet their capital needs. So we continue to seek and expect revenue growth for this year. I'm not sure how much it's going to be. It may be bumpy. But we're a growth company and that's the way we lean forward."

First of all, we do have a good pipeline both in RIS and in Consulting. It is a global pipeline. When we evaluate our pipeline though, we generally look at a lot of different things or at least cast a glance over a lot of different things but do very few for a variety of reasons. So even last year, which was a very active year for us, where we had 27 acquisitions and investments, we actually reviewed more than 10x the amount of what we actually did. And so that gives you an idea of the labyrinth that needs to go through for us to say we want to do this acquisition and conclude it. And multiples are a factor. I mean, last year, I can tell you even though we did $1.2 billion of transaction in terms of transaction value, we walked away from well more than $1.2 billion of transaction value. And generally, we walked away because of either concerns about growth, the difference between our view and what the potential growth could be in the future of -- rather than the seller's view of what the potential growth could be, or price expectations. And so we believe we're disciplined. Clearly over a course of a number of years, we've seen some multiple expansion, particularly for larger type of acquisitions because that attracts PE and other parties to it. But actually for midsize, smaller fold-in, tuck-in type of acquisitions, the multiples, while they may be a bit more than they were 5 years ago, we still think are quite reasonable. And if you look at our real strategy, I think that you would see Jelf was a bit of an outlier size-wise. Not much of an outlier, but a bit. You look at the acquisitions that we've done over the last 5 years, the average acquisition transaction value has been about $40 million per transaction. And so it's more of a string of pearls than chunkier than that. There'll be the odd larger company, but it's not a change in strategy in any way. Now in terms of capital plan, Mark, do you have some comments on that?"

It is difficult to accurately predict where the world is headed. I recently returned from Davos, where ongoing global market volatility was a major point of discussion. Our clients need advice now more than ever to navigate these uncertain times. For Marsh & McLennan, opportunities are abundant to help our clients face the challenges of the day, many of which revolve around risk, strategy and people. These challenges are highlighted in the annual global risk report produced by the World Economic Forum with the help of Marsh & McLennan Companies. This report explores the mounting and interconnected risks faced by corporations of all sizes, as well as government entities and individuals. 
Over the last several years, the dialogue has evolved from mainly economic risk to include geopolitical, societal and environmental concerns. We certainly live in an age of risk. According to the UN, 2015 was characterized by social and political instability, as some 60 million people were forcibly displaced, the largest number in history. 
Geopolitical tensions are also escalating between global and regional powers in places like Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Ukraine, Korea and the South China Sea. 
Market dislocations in China and drastic reductions in commodity prices have raised concerns about global growth and dented business confidence. And financial markets are skeptical about the effectiveness of central banks, given the limited tools at their disposal in a near-0 interest rate environment. Amidst this global uncertainty, it is easy for companies to embrace self-fulfilling pessimism. 
While we remain cautious on the global front, we see several factors that are positive for Marsh & McLennan Companies. The developed world continues to post modest but steady GDP growth and improving employment rates, and the emerging markets, while volatile, are a long-term driver of growth. The demand for our services remains strong. We are optimistic about our prospects for continued organic growth, and our acquisition pipeline is in good shape. 
Our fundamentals are rock solid. We are stronger strategically, operationally and financially than at any time in the past decade. We have a deep understanding of our clients and the markets in which we operate. We set challenging yet realistic objectives for our performance, and we deliver on our commitments. 
So let's review our performance in 2015. We capped off the year with an outstanding fourth quarter, posting our highest underlying revenue growth of 2015 at 5%. This was our 11th consecutive quarter of at least 3% underlying revenue growth. We also delivered 8% adjusted EPS growth, driven by higher operating income with margin expansion in both the RIS and Consulting segments. 
In terms of our full year performance, MMC produced underlying revenue growth, margin expansion in both segments and meaningful EPS growth. Underlying revenue grew 4%, representing our sixth consecutive year in the 3% to 5% growth range. This was also our sixth consecutive year of margin expansion in both the RIS and Consulting segments. 
This expansion was balanced across the segments, with Risk and Insurance Services rising 90 basis points to 23.3% and Consulting up 80 basis points to 17.3%. On a consolidated basis, the margin rose 100 basis points to 19.1%, our highest level in 12 years. Adjusted EPS increased 8% to a record $3.05 while absorbing $0.18 of negative FX impact. 
Since 2009, our adjusted EPS has grown at a CAGR of 13.5%, consistent with the long -- the 13% long-term target we set at Investor Day in 2010 and reaffirmed at Investor Day in March 2014. This was accomplished despite approximately $200 million of FX headwinds during this 6-year period, a yearly average of $0.04 per share. 
Before I discuss our view regarding 2016, I would like to spend a few moments on recent developments in the insurance industry. There is a noticeable amount of change occurring at many insurance companies. We have seen large-scale M&A, senior management changes, a reduction in the underwriting appetite at several companies as well as a willingness at some firms to reconsider reinsurance as a way to reduce volatility. 
These developments are not overly concerning to us or our clients since the changes do not relate to issues of financial strength or solvency. In fact, there are potential positive outcomes for MMC, such as volatile markets could result in a flight to quality as clients seek brokers who have a depth of experience and capability. Clients may lean even more toward their broker to assess and recommend markets. More underwriting discipline may come to the market. This is really hard to call. It is just as likely to create more competition in the short term. And high-quality underwriting talent is becoming more dispersed. This could lead to a prolonged, healthy, competitive market, with higher levels of innovation, new product offerings and improved service.
Now turning to 2016. For the year, we expect to grow underlying revenue, expand margins, deliver strong growth in adjusted EPS and return meaningful capital to shareholders. Starting with organic revenue growth. One of the key strengths of MMC is the diversity of our geographic footprint. It is an important driver of our long-term growth. The developing world should grow faster over the longer term, owing to generally higher levels of GDP growth, underpenetration of insurance and the ability to sell more of our consulting services globally. However, these countries have been experiencing more volatility recently, with many impacted by declines in commodity prices. 
While there is concern about the emerging world and the overall strength of the global economy, the U.S. and U.K. continued to perform relatively well. These 2 countries represent our largest geographies, providing stability to our revenue.
On a consolidated basis, over the last 6 years, we have grown underlying revenue in a range of 3% to 5%, and we view this range as the likely outcome for 2016. Underpinning our revenue has been low single-digit GDP growth and benign inflation in the developed world with modestly better growth in the emerging markets. In addition, we anticipate low single-digit global P&C premium growth as increases in insured values and other exposures should offset the effects of rate reductions.
Turning to margins. We have just concluded our eighth consecutive year of margin expansion. Over this period, our adjusted operating margin has improved more than 1,000 basis points to 19.1%. As we have said many times, we do not have a margin target. We view margin expansion as a natural outcome of managing a business properly to grow revenue and earnings. We are disciplined around managing our annual expense growth in line with revenue growth and maintain flexibility to adjust accordingly. While it is conceivable expense growth may exceed revenue growth in a given quarter, we would not expect this to occur for a full year. So as we look at 2016, we expect to deliver margin expansion in both segments for the seventh consecutive year.
Moving to EPS growth. 2015 was an unprecedented year for FX. We posted 8% adjusted EPS growth or 14.5% on a constant-currency basis. If foreign exchange rates remain at their current levels, we anticipate about $0.07 per share of adverse currency impact in 2016, less than half of what we saw last year. Given our current view of FX and global macroeconomic conditions, we expect strong EPS growth in 2016 at a level approaching our long-term target. 
Turning to capital management. We are a cash business. As we produce high levels of earnings growth, our cash flows should grow at a similar rate. We will continue to deploy capital in excess of our free cash flow. We expect to increase debt balances each year as earnings growth increases our debt capacity. 
As mentioned on our last earnings call, we anticipate capital deployed in 2016 for dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases to approximate $2.3 billion. We reiterate our annual commitment to reduce our share count and grow our dividend per share by double digits. And we will continue to grow the firm through acquisitions that build our market position, client services and geographic footprint. 
I also want to spend a few moments on our investment philosophy. We believe in balance, and in this context, it's the balance between delivering strong financial performance today while investing for our future. MMC has a solid foundation, and we have the flexibility to deliver strong financial performance in a variety of market conditions. We have balance sheet flexibility to take advantage of opportunities while preserving our ability to manage through periods of stress. 
Since 2009, we have invested nearly $7 billion for growth and efficiencies. This includes CapEx of $2.2 billion, 115 acquisitions and investments totaling approximately $4.6 billion and an increase in our headcount of over 10,000 colleagues. We have also invested in and rewarded our colleagues. In each of the last 8 years, our overall global incentive compensation pools have increased while we have driven significant margin expansion. 
Acquisitions are a core competency of Marsh & McLennan Companies. We don't just buy companies; we develop relationships over time. We seek chemistry and a cultural fit. And we invest in growth, not just geographically, but by segment, by line of business and by capability. We were active in 2015, completing 27 acquisitions and investments for approximately $1.2 billion. 
Lastly, I want to thank our 60,000 colleagues for their contributions, and in particular, my leadership team. I am privileged to work with a strong leadership team that is defined by high standards, diversity of thought, cohesiveness and collegiality. We are a team that takes its commitments seriously, and we have delivered year after year. 
In summary, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results as we continue to execute our long-term strategy for growth. As we look to 2016, we are well positioned to deliver underlying revenue growth, margin expansion in both operating segments and strong EPS growth. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mark to give you more details on our performance."

I'm very pleased to be joining the call today as the CFO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. 
MMC capped off the year with an outstanding fourth quarter. We delivered underlying revenue growth across each of our operating companies, and both segments generated adjusted operating income growth with margin expansion. GAAP EPS rose 31%, including a $37 million pretax gain from Mercer's sale of a U.S. defined contribution recordkeeping business. This gain has been excluded from our adjusted results. We believe this presentation is more indicative of the underlying performance of the company. 
On an adjusted basis for the quarter, EPS increased 8% to $0.71. Our full year 2015 results represent another year of strong performance. Underlying revenue growth was 4%, with solid growth at all 4 operating companies. Adjusted operating income increased 5% to $2.5 billion despite a significant foreign exchange headwind. Our overall adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 19.1%, with both segments contributing. GAAP EPS grew 12% and adjusted EPS rose 8%, in line with the high single-digit guidance we provided throughout the year. 
For Risk and Insurance Services, revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.7 billion, with underlying growth of 4%. Adjusted operating income grew 3%, and the margin increased to 21.1%. For the year, underlying revenue growth was 3%, adjusted operating income rose 3% to $1.6 billion, and the margin increased 90 basis points to 23.3%, the highest annual margin in over a decade. Adjusted operating margins in RIS have improved every year since 2007. 
Marsh's fourth quarter performance was strong across the board. Revenue was $1.5 billion, with underlying growth of 4% driven by strong new business. Growth in the quarter was notable as it came on top of 4% growth in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
The U.S./Canada division grew 3%, led by Marsh & McLennan agency. In the International division, underlying revenue grew 5%, with 3% growth in EMEA, reflecting strong performance in the U.K.; 4% growth in Asia Pacific; and 13% in Latin America. 
In December, Marsh completed its acquisition of U.K.-based Jelf Group. This acquisition supports Marsh's strategy to expand globally in the middle market. For the year, Marsh's underlying revenue growth -- revenue rose 3%, reflecting growth of 3% in both the U.S./Canada and International divisions. This was Marsh's fifth consecutive year with underlying revenue growth of at least 3%. 
Guy Carpenter's revenue was $217 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 5% on an underlying basis. EMEA and Latin America were areas of strength. For the full year, underlying revenue growth was 2%, a good result considering the ongoing challenges facing the reinsurance industry.
Moving to Consulting. Revenue was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong underlying growth of 5%. Adjusted operating income increased 5% to $265 million. The adjusted operating margin expanded 60 basis points to 16.7%, the 16th consecutive quarterly increase. For the year, underlying revenue growth was 5%, and adjusted operating income increased 4%, exceeding $1 billion for the first time. 
Consulting has built a track record of achieving higher adjusted operating margins in recent years. In 2015, the margin expanded 80 basis points to 17.3%, its highest level in over 30 years. Since 2010, Consulting's margins have improved by 600 basis points. 
Mercer's revenue was $1.1 million in the fourth quarter, an underlying increase of 5%, which follows 5% growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Solid performance was achieved across all 3 of Mercer's major geographies: North America, Euro-Pac and growth markets. The revenue increase was driven by health, up 8%; and talent, up 7%. Investments rose 2%, and retirement grew 1%. Health continues to benefit from the -- from growth in both the core business and Mercer Marketplace, and talent once again performed well. 
In the quarter, Mercer completed several acquisitions, including CPSG Partners, a provider of workday implementation services. In addition, Mercer successfully completed the sale of its U.S. defined contribution recordkeeping business in the quarter. This activity highlights the strategy Mercer has been executing over the last several years: investing in growth opportunities while deemphasizing areas that do not meet our return requirement or are not core to its business. 
For the year, Mercer's underlying revenue growth was 4%, with investments increasing 7%, health up 6% and talent up 5%. Retirement was flat. Mercer's underlying revenue growth has been 3% or better for the last 5 years. 
Oliver Wyman delivered another strong quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $476 million, reflecting underlying growth of 7%. Growth was driven by financial services, Lippincott and the actuarial business. For the year, Oliver Wyman's underlying revenue growth was also 7%, which builds on a strong growth of 15% in 2014.
As we typically do at this time of year, let me update you regarding our global retirement plan. As you may recall, in the first quarter of 2015, we recognized a nonrecurring credit of $125 million as a result of changes to our U.S. post-65 retiree medical plan. This action represented a substantial portion of the mitigation we undertook to offset the increase in the annual retirement expense we faced last year due to declines in global interest rates. 
Late in 2015, we made additional retirement plan changes that essentially replaced this credit, not only through 2016 but beyond. As discussed on our last earnings call, the most impactful change was in the structure of our U.S. defined benefit plan, where it was divided into 2 separate plans. This structure better positions the company to take advantage of derisking opportunity. It also resulted in extending the amortization period for actuarial gains and losses in the inactive plans. This lowers annual pension expenses. 
As a result of these changes, coupled with the many other factors that go into determining the year-end measurement of our pension expense, we expect a year-over-year decline in retirement expense of approximately $30 million for 2016, or $0.04 per share.
Turning to investment income. In the third quarter of 2015, we recognized investment income of $29 million from the final settlement of our Trident III investment. At year-end, our private equity portfolio amounted to $76 million, and we expect to generate only modest investment income going forward versus the $38 million we recognized in 2015. The anticipated reduction in our investment income for 2016 should essentially offset the $0.04 benefit from lower retirement expense.
As we anticipated on our earnings call in October, the FX headwind in the fourth quarter was $0.05 per share and $0.18 for the year. This was by far the highest annual level of FX impact in MMC's history. If foreign exchange rates remain at their current levels, we expect FX to adversely affect EPS by approximately $0.07 in 2016. The majority of the impact will be felt in the first half of the year.
Our tax rate fluctuates quarter-to-quarter, reflecting the geographic mix of earnings, tax settlements, completion of open tax years and changes in international and local tax rates. Our adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter was 29.7%, and the rate for the year was 28.7%, reflecting discrete items. 
Based on the current landscape, for modeling purposes, it would be reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29% in 2016.
Total balance sheet debt at year-end was $4.4 billion, slightly below the third quarter level, reflecting the recent repayment of a $50 million term loan. In 2015, balance sheet debt increased by approximately $1 billion. The term structure of our debt portfolio provides us significant flexibility, with few near-term repayment obligations. Our net debt maturity -- next debt maturity is a $250 million senior note due in April 2017. Due to the substantial work we have done to restructure our debt over the last 3 years, our average cost of debt has fallen to 3.7%. 
In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our stock for $75 million. For the year, we bought back 24.8 million shares for $1.4 billion, the highest level in our history. As we mentioned on our third quarter call, we pulled forward a portion of the share repurchases we had planned for both the fourth quarter and 2016. As a result, our buyback activity is expected to be less than 2015. As Dan mentioned, this year we expect to deploy roughly $2.3 billion of capital across share repurchases, acquisitions and dividends. 
In 2015, we returned over $2 billion of capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Overall, we deployed $3.2 billion of capital across share buybacks, acquisitions and dividends, a record year of capital deployment for MMC. Sources of this capital included our operating cash flows, the addition of $1 billion of balance sheet debt and a reduction of $600 million in balance sheet cash. Since 2013, we have added $1.5 billion of balance sheet debt and reduced our cash balance by over $900 million. 
For the year, uses of cash included $632 million for dividends, $1.2 billion for acquisitions and investments, and $1.4 billion for share repurchases. For the fourth quarter, we deployed $800 million -- $811 million of cash that included $164 million for dividends, $572 million for acquisitions and $75 million for share repurchases. 
Cash on our balance sheet at year-end stood at $1.4 billion, which was down from $2 billion at the end of 2014. Cash in the U.S. was $580 million. 
Once again, in 2015, we delivered on our capital return commitments. We reduced our share count by more than 3% and increased our dividend per share by over 11%. 
With that, I'm happy to turn the call back over to Dan."

It has -- basically, obviously, top line growth is a significant factor. And the more we grow top line, the easier it is to expand margins, although we have proven our ability to expand margins even in times of pretty low organic growth. We feel very comfortable that when you look over the last number of years, how we have grown in the 3% to 5% organic growth area that for '16, the way it feels like to us is that we'll be in that range of -- and we will have margin expansion in both segments. And therefore, our operating earnings will be quite strong. And fundamentally, that is the backbone to how we will deliver EPS growth. So there's nothing in our current thinking of it that involves issues like tax, et cetera. The one thing we don't control is FX. We don't control the macroeconomic conditions in the world either, but we're less concerned about that because that sort of has a lag factor. But FX hits you between the eyes in any one quarter and in any one year. But if you look at our results, even in 2015 on a constant currency basis, it was very strong. And we would expect that to continue in 2016."

Then we have shared best practices across those high-quality agencies, and so that quality has led to more quality. A big part of the organic growth, though, is not only have we acquired high-quality agencies, we've invested a lot in our sales capacity. And so we're trying to grow net sales capacity each and every year. We now have over 700 full-time producers within MMA, and that makes a very big difference. And then lastly is that Dave Eslick and his leadership team have executed very well. So not only are we growing the segment that strategically we wanted to be in, attracting the high quality -- the highest-quality agencies, we're also investing and executing on sales capacity.

First, whatever percentage we give you on commissions versus fees, I would bear in mind that it's not a direct insulation. If there's a prolonged, long-term soft market, it puts downward pressure on fees as well in a competitive environment, so it's not that fee business is completely insulated from the vagaries of the market. But having said that, when you look at how we run the company over long stretches of time, because of the amount of capital and competition amongst insurance companies on a global basis, we expect there to generally be a downward trend on rating levels. Now insurance rates are the most important thing in a lot of respects to an insurance company. Insurance premiums are more important to intermediaries. And so when we look at exposure units and other factors around the world, we expect to see some slight growth in insurance premiums notwithstanding some of the downward pressure that is existing on rating levels.

First of all, we do have a good pipeline both in RIS and in Consulting. It is a global pipeline. When we evaluate our pipeline, though, we generally look at a lot of different things or at least cast a glance over a lot of different things but do very few, for a variety of reasons. So even last year, which was a very active year for us, where we had 27 acquisitions and investments, we actually reviewed more than 10x the amount of what we actually did. And so that gives you an idea of the labyrinth that needs to go through for us to say we want to do this acquisition and conclude it. And multiples are a factor. I mean, last year, I can tell you even though we did $1.2 billion of transaction in terms of transaction value, we walked away from well more than $1.2 billion of transaction value. And generally, we walked away because of either concerns about growth, the difference between our view of what the potential growth could be in the future, rather than the seller's view of what the potential growth could be, or price expectations. And so we believe we're disciplined. Clearly over a course of a number of years, we've seen some multiple expansion, particularly for larger type of acquisitions because that attracts PE and other parties to it. But actually for midsize, smaller fold-in, tuck-in type of acquisitions, the multiples, while they may be a bit more than they were 5 years ago, we still think are quite reasonable. And if you look at our real strategy, I think that you would see Jelf was a bit of an outlier size-wise. Not much of an outlier, but a bit. You look at the acquisitions that we've done over the last 5 years, the average acquisition transaction value has been about $40 million per transaction. And so it's more of a string of pearls than chunkier than that. There'll be the odd larger company, but it's not a change in strategy in any way. Now in terms of capital plan, Mark, do you have some comments on that?"

I'm very pleased to welcome our new CFO, Mark McGivney. In addition to having a very strong operational background, Mark becomes the first MMC Chief Financial Officer to have served both Marsh and Mercer as CFO. Welcome, Mark. 
Joining me on the call today are the operating companies' CEOs: Peter Zaffino of Marsh; Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Keith Walsh of Investor Relations. 
It is difficult to accurately predict where the world is headed. I recently returned from Davos, where ongoing global market volatility was a major point of discussion. Our clients need advice now more than ever to navigate these uncertain times. For Marsh & McLennan, opportunities are abundant to help our clients face the challenges of the day, many of which revolve around risk, strategy and people. These challenges are highlighted in the annual global risk report produced by the World Economic Forum with the help of Marsh & McLennan Companies. This report explores the mounting and interconnected risks faced by corporations of all sizes as well as government entities and individuals. 
Over the last several years, the dialogue has evolved from mainly economic risk to include geopolitical, societal and environmental concerns. We certainly live in an age of risk. According to the UN, 2015 was characterized by social and political instability, as some 60 million people were forcibly displaced, the largest number in history. 
Geopolitical tensions are also escalating between global and regional powers in places like Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Ukraine, Korea and the South China Sea. 
Market dislocations in China and drastic reductions in commodity prices have raised concerns about global growth and dented business confidence. And financial markets are skeptical about the effectiveness of central banks, given the limited tools at their disposal in a near-0 interest rate environment. Amidst this global uncertainty, it is easy for companies to embrace self-fulfilling pessimism. 
While we remain cautious on the global front, we see several factors that are positive for Marsh & McLennan Companies. The developed world continues to post modest but steady GDP growth and improving employment rates, and the emerging markets, while volatile, are a long-term driver of growth. The demand for our services remains strong. We are optimistic about our prospects for continued organic growth, and our acquisition pipeline is in good shape. 
Our fundamentals are rock solid. We are stronger strategically, operationally and financially than at any time in the past decade. We have a deep understanding of our clients and the markets in which we operate. We set challenging yet realistic objectives for our performance, and we deliver on our commitments. 
So let's review our performance in 2015. We capped off the year with an outstanding fourth quarter, posting our highest underlying revenue growth of 2015 at 5%. This was our 11th consecutive quarter of at least 3% underlying revenue growth. We also delivered 8% adjusted EPS growth, driven by higher operating income with margin expansion in both the RIS and Consulting segments. 
In terms of our full year performance, MMC produced underlying revenue growth, margin expansion in both segments and meaningful EPS growth. Underlying revenue grew 4%, representing our sixth consecutive year in the 3% to 5% growth range. This was also our sixth consecutive year of margin expansion in both the RIS and Consulting segments. 
This expansion was balanced across the segments, with Risk and Insurance Services rising 90 basis points to 23.3% and Consulting up 80 basis points to 17.3%. On a consolidated basis, the margin rose 100 basis points to 19.1%, our highest level in 12 years. Adjusted EPS increased 8% to a record $3.05 while absorbing $0.18 of negative FX impact. 
Since 2009, our adjusted EPS has grown at a CAGR of 13.5%, consistent with the long -- the 13% long-term target we set at Investor Day in 2010 and reaffirmed at Investor Day in March 2014. This was accomplished despite approximately $200 million of FX headwinds during this 6-year period, a yearly average of $0.04 per share. 
Before I discuss our view regarding 2016, I would like to spend a few moments on recent developments in the insurance industry. There is a noticeable amount of change occurring at many insurance companies. We have seen large-scale M&A, senior management changes, a reduction in the underwriting appetite at several companies as well as a willingness at some firms to reconsider reinsurance as a way to reduce volatility. 
These developments are not overly concerning to us or our clients since the changes do not relate to issues of financial strength or solvency. In fact, there are potential positive outcomes for MMC, such as volatile markets could result in a flight to quality as clients seek brokers who have a depth of experience and capability. Clients may lean even more toward their broker to assess and recommend markets. More underwriting discipline may come to the market. This is really hard to call. It is just as likely to create more competition in the short term. And high-quality underwriting talent is becoming more dispersed. This could lead to a prolonged, healthy, competitive market, with higher levels of innovation, new product offerings and improved service.
Now turning to 2016. For the year, we expect to grow underlying revenue, expand margins, deliver strong growth in adjusted EPS and return meaningful capital to shareholders. Starting with organic revenue growth. One of the key strengths of MMC is the diversity of our geographic footprint. It is an important driver of our long-term growth. The developing world should grow faster over the longer term, owing to generally higher levels of GDP growth, underpenetration of insurance and the ability to sell more of our consulting services globally. However, these countries have been experiencing more volatility recently, with many impacted by declines in commodity prices. 
While there is concern about the emerging world and the overall strength of the global economy, the U.S. and U.K. continued to perform relatively well. These 2 countries represent our largest geographies, providing stability to our revenue.
On a consolidated basis, over the last 6 years, we have grown underlying revenue in a range of 3% to 5%, and we view this range as the likely outcome for 2016. Underpinning our revenue has been low single-digit GDP growth and benign inflation in the developed world with modestly better growth in the emerging markets. In addition, we anticipate low single-digit global P&C premium growth as increases in insured values and other exposures should offset the effects of rate reductions.
Turning to margins. We have just concluded our eighth consecutive year of margin expansion. Over this period, our adjusted operating margin has improved more than 1,000 basis points to 19.1%. As we have said many times, we do not have a margin target. We view margin expansion as a natural outcome of managing a business properly to grow revenue and earnings. We are disciplined around managing our annual expense growth in line with revenue growth and maintain flexibility to adjust accordingly. While it is conceivable expense growth may exceed revenue growth in a given quarter, we would not expect this to occur for a full year. So as we look at 2016, we expect to deliver margin expansion in both segments for the seventh consecutive year.
Moving to EPS growth. 2015 was an unprecedented year for FX. We posted 8% adjusted EPS growth or 14.5% on a constant-currency basis. If foreign exchange rates remain at their current levels, we anticipate about $0.07 per share of adverse currency impact in 2016, less than half of what we saw last year. Given our current view of FX and global macroeconomic conditions, we expect strong EPS growth in 2016 at a level approaching our long-term target. 
Turning to capital management. We are a cash business. As we produce high levels of earnings growth, our cash flows should grow at a similar rate. We will continue to deploy capital in excess of our free cash flow. We expect to increase debt balances each year as earnings growth increases our debt capacity. 
As mentioned on our last earnings call, we anticipate capital deployed in 2016 for dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases to approximate $2.3 billion. We reiterate our annual commitment to reduce our share count and grow our dividend per share by double digits. And we will continue to grow the firm through acquisitions that build our market position, client services and geographic footprint. 
I also want to spend a few moments on our investment philosophy. We believe in balance, and in this context, it's the balance between delivering strong financial performance today while investing for our future. MMC has a solid foundation, and we have the flexibility to deliver strong financial performance in a variety of market conditions. We have balance sheet flexibility to take advantage of opportunities while preserving our ability to manage through periods of stress. 
Since 2009, we have invested nearly $7 billion for growth and efficiencies. This includes CapEx of $2.2 billion, 115 acquisitions and investments totaling approximately $4.6 billion and an increase in our headcount of over 10,000 colleagues. We have also invested in and rewarded our colleagues. In each of the last 8 years, our overall global incentive compensation pools have increased while we have driven significant margin expansion. 
Acquisitions are a core competency of Marsh & McLennan Companies. We don't just buy companies; we develop relationships over time. We seek chemistry and a cultural fit. And we invest in growth, not just geographically, but by segment, by line of business and by capability. We were active in 2015, completing 27 acquisitions and investments for approximately $1.2 billion. 
Lastly, I want to thank our 60,000 colleagues for their contributions, and in particular, my leadership team. I am privileged to work with a strong leadership team that is defined by high standards, diversity of thought, cohesiveness and collegiality. We are a team that takes its commitments seriously, and we have delivered year after year. 
In summary, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results as we continue to execute our long-term strategy for growth. As we look to 2016, we are well positioned to deliver underlying revenue growth, margin expansion in both operating segments and strong EPS growth. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mark to give you more details on our performance."

I'm very pleased to be joining the call today as the CFO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. 
MMC capped off the year with an outstanding fourth quarter. We delivered underlying revenue growth across each of our operating companies, and both segments generated adjusted operating income growth with margin expansion. GAAP EPS rose 31%, including a $37 million pretax gain from Mercer's sale of a U.S. defined contribution recordkeeping business. This gain has been excluded from our adjusted results. We believe this presentation is more indicative of the underlying performance of the company. 
On an adjusted basis for the quarter, EPS increased 8% to $0.71. Our full year 2015 results represent another year of strong performance. Underlying revenue growth was 4%, with solid growth at all 4 operating companies. Adjusted operating income increased 5% to $2.5 billion despite a significant foreign exchange headwind. Our overall adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 19.1%, with both segments contributing. GAAP EPS grew 12% and adjusted EPS rose 8%, in line with the high single-digit guidance we provided throughout the year. 
For Risk and Insurance Services, revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.7 billion, with underlying growth of 4%. Adjusted operating income grew 3%, and the margin increased to 21.1%. For the year, underlying revenue growth was 3%, adjusted operating income rose 3% to $1.6 billion, and the margin increased 90 basis points to 23.3%, the highest annual margin in over a decade. Adjusted operating margins in RIS have improved every year since 2007. 
Marsh's fourth quarter performance was strong across the board. Revenue was $1.5 billion, with underlying growth of 4% driven by strong new business. Growth in the quarter was notable as it came on top of 4% growth in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
The U.S./Canada division grew 3%, led by Marsh & McLennan agency. In the International division, underlying revenue grew 5%, with 3% growth in EMEA, reflecting strong performance in the U.K.; 4% growth in Asia Pacific; and 13% in Latin America. 
In December, Marsh completed its acquisition of U.K.-based Jelf Group. This acquisition supports Marsh's strategy to expand globally in the middle market. For the year, Marsh's underlying revenue growth -- revenue rose 3%, reflecting growth of 3% in both the U.S./Canada and International divisions. This was Marsh's fifth consecutive year with underlying revenue growth of at least 3%. 
Guy Carpenter's revenue was $217 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 5% on an underlying basis. EMEA and Latin America were areas of strength. For the full year, underlying revenue growth was 2%, a good result considering the ongoing challenges facing the reinsurance industry.
Moving to Consulting. Revenue was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong underlying growth of 5%. Adjusted operating income increased 5% to $265 million. The adjusted operating margin expanded 60 basis points to 16.7%, the 16th consecutive quarterly increase. For the year, underlying revenue growth was 5%, and adjusted operating income increased 4%, exceeding $1 billion for the first time. 
Consulting has built a track record of achieving higher adjusted operating margins in recent years. In 2015, the margin expanded 80 basis points to 17.3%, its highest level in over 30 years. Since 2010, Consulting's margins have improved by 600 basis points. 
Mercer's revenue was $1.1 million in the fourth quarter, an underlying increase of 5%, which follows 5% growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Solid performance was achieved across all 3 of Mercer's major geographies: North America, Euro-Pac and growth markets. The revenue increase was driven by health, up 8%; and talent, up 7%. Investments rose 2%, and retirement grew 1%. Health continues to benefit from the -- from growth in both the core business and Mercer Marketplace, and talent once again performed well. 
In the quarter, Mercer completed several acquisitions, including CPSG Partners, a provider of workday implementation services. In addition, Mercer successfully completed the sale of its U.S. defined contribution recordkeeping business in the quarter. This activity highlights the strategy Mercer has been executing over the last several years: investing in growth opportunities while deemphasizing areas that do not meet our return requirement or are not core to its business. 
For the year, Mercer's underlying revenue growth was 4%, with investments increasing 7%, health up 6% and talent up 5%. Retirement was flat. Mercer's underlying revenue growth has been 3% or better for the last 5 years. 
Oliver Wyman delivered another strong quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $476 million, reflecting underlying growth of 7%. Growth was driven by financial services, Lippincott and the actuarial business. For the year, Oliver Wyman's underlying revenue growth was also 7%, which builds on a strong growth of 15% in 2014.
As we typically do at this time of year, let me update you regarding our global retirement plan. As you may recall, in the first quarter of 2015, we recognized a nonrecurring credit of $125 million as a result of changes to our U.S. post-65 retiree medical plan. This action represented a substantial portion of the mitigation we undertook to offset the increase in the annual retirement expense we faced last year due to declines in global interest rates. 
Late in 2015, we made additional retirement plan changes that essentially replaced this credit, not only through 2016 but beyond. As discussed on our last earnings call, the most impactful change was in the structure of our U.S. defined benefit plan, where it was divided into 2 separate plans. This structure better positions the company to take advantage of derisking opportunity. It also resulted in extending the amortization period for actuarial gains and losses in the inactive plans. This lowers annual pension expenses. 
As a result of these changes, coupled with the many other factors that go into determining the year-end measurement of our pension expense, we expect a year-over-year decline in retirement expense of approximately $30 million for 2016, or $0.04 per share.
Turning to investment income. In the third quarter of 2015, we recognized investment income of $29 million from the final settlement of our Trident III investment. At year-end, our private equity portfolio amounted to $76 million, and we expect to generate only modest investment income going forward versus the $38 million we recognized in 2015. The anticipated reduction in our investment income for 2016 should essentially offset the $0.04 benefit from lower retirement expense.
As we anticipated on our earnings call in October, the FX headwind in the fourth quarter was $0.05 per share and $0.18 for the year. This was by far the highest annual level of FX impact in MMC's history. If foreign exchange rates remain at their current levels, we expect FX to adversely affect EPS by approximately $0.07 in 2016. The majority of the impact will be felt in the first half of the year.
Our tax rate fluctuates quarter-to-quarter, reflecting the geographic mix of earnings, tax settlements, completion of open tax years and changes in international and local tax rates. Our adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter was 29.7%, and the rate for the year was 28.7%, reflecting discrete items. 
Based on the current landscape, for modeling purposes, it would be reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29% in 2016.
Total balance sheet debt at year-end was $4.4 billion, slightly below the third quarter level, reflecting the recent repayment of a $50 million term loan. In 2015, balance sheet debt increased by approximately $1 billion. The term structure of our debt portfolio provides us significant flexibility, with few near-term repayment obligations. Our net debt maturity -- next debt maturity is a $250 million senior note due in April 2017. Due to the substantial work we have done to restructure our debt over the last 3 years, our average cost of debt has fallen to 3.7%. 
In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our stock for $75 million. For the year, we bought back 24.8 million shares for $1.4 billion, the highest level in our history. As we mentioned on our third quarter call, we pulled forward a portion of the share repurchases we had planned for both the fourth quarter and 2016. As a result, our buyback activity is expected to be less than 2015. As Dan mentioned, this year we expect to deploy roughly $2.3 billion of capital across share repurchases, acquisitions and dividends. 
In 2015, we returned over $2 billion of capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Overall, we deployed $3.2 billion of capital across share buybacks, acquisitions and dividends, a record year of capital deployment for MMC. Sources of this capital included our operating cash flows, the addition of $1 billion of balance sheet debt and a reduction of $600 million in balance sheet cash. Since 2013, we have added $1.5 billion of balance sheet debt and reduced our cash balance by over $900 million. 
For the year, uses of cash included $632 million for dividends, $1.2 billion for acquisitions and investments, and $1.4 billion for share repurchases. For the fourth quarter, we deployed $800 million -- $811 million of cash that included $164 million for dividends, $572 million for acquisitions and $75 million for share repurchases. 
Cash on our balance sheet at year-end stood at $1.4 billion, which was down from $2 billion at the end of 2014. Cash in the U.S. was $580 million. 
Once again, in 2015, we delivered on our capital return commitments. We reduced our share count by more than 3% and increased our dividend per share by over 11%.

No, that -- actually, in terms of how we get close to our long-term target and in fact achieve it over the long term, there's no magic formula. It has -- basically, obviously, top line growth is a significant factor. And the more we grow top line, the easier it is to expand margins, although we have proven our ability to expand margins even in times of pretty low organic growth. We feel very comfortable that when you look over the last number of years, how we have grown in the 3% to 5% organic growth area that for '16, the way it feels like to us is that we'll be in that range of -- and we will have margin expansion in both segments. And therefore, our operating earnings will be quite strong. And fundamentally, that is the backbone to how we will deliver EPS growth. So there's nothing in our current thinking of it that involves issues like tax, et cetera. The one thing we don't control is FX. We don't control the macroeconomic conditions in the world either, but we're less concerned about that because that sort of has a lag factor. But FX hits you between the eyes in any one quarter and in any one year. But if you look at our results, even in 2015 on a constant currency basis, it was very strong.

As Dan said, that this has always been a well-thought-out strategy. We like the segment in the middle market, and it has been one that we wanted to grow in through acquisition and through organic growth. We've been able to attract the highest-quality agencies in building MMA, and attributes of high-quality agencies are terrific people, track records of strong organic growth, and they've been able to do that once we've acquired them. Then we have shared best practices across those high-quality agencies, and so that quality has led to more quality. A big part of the organic growth, though, is not only have we acquired high-quality agencies, we've invested a lot in our sales capacity. And so we're trying to grow net sales capacity each and every year. We now have over 700 full-time producers within MMA, and that makes a very big difference. And then lastly is that Dave Eslick and his leadership team have executed very well. So not only are we growing the segment that strategically we wanted to be in, attracting the high quality -- the highest-quality agencies, we're also investing and executing on sales capacity. And so the growth has been balanced across the U.S. and balanced between EH&B and Property & Casualty."

First, whatever percentage we give you on commissions versus fees, I would bear in mind that it's not a direct insulation. If there's a prolonged, long-term soft market, it puts downward pressure on fees as well in a competitive environment, so it's not that fee business is completely insulated from the vagaries of the market. But having said that, when you look at how we run the company over long stretches of time, because of the amount of capital and competition amongst insurance companies on a global basis, we expect there to generally be a downward trend on rating levels. Now insurance rates are the most important thing in a lot of respects to an insurance company. Insurance premiums are more important to intermediaries. And so when we look at exposure units and other factors around the world, we expect to see some slight growth in insurance premiums notwithstanding some of the downward pressure that is existing on rating levels. But Peter, you want to add to that?"

In terms of how you should think about commission versus fee, we've mentioned that we're growing a lot in MMA.

No, we remain innovative, and we remain relevant to our different segments. We've added new resources to our existing highly talented pool.

First of all, we do have a good pipeline both in RIS and in Consulting. It is a global pipeline. When we evaluate our pipeline, though, we generally look at a lot of different things or at least cast a glance over a lot of different things but do very few, for a variety of reasons. So even last year, which was a very active year for us, where we had 27 acquisitions and investments, we actually reviewed more than 10x the amount of what we actually did. And so that gives you an idea of the labyrinth that needs to go through for us to say we want to do this acquisition and conclude it. And multiples are a factor. I mean, last year, I can tell you even though we did $1.2 billion of transaction in terms of transaction value, we walked away from well more than $1.2 billion of transaction value. And generally, we walked away because of either concerns about growth, the difference between our view of what the potential growth could be in the future, rather than the seller's view of what the potential growth could be, or price expectations. And so we believe we're disciplined. Clearly over a course of a number of years, we've seen some multiple expansion, particularly for larger type of acquisitions because that attracts PE and other parties to it. But actually for midsize, smaller fold-in, tuck-in type of acquisitions, the multiples, while they may be a bit more than they were 5 years ago, we still think are quite reasonable. And if you look at our real strategy, I think that you would see Jelf was a bit of an outlier size-wise. Not much of an outlier, but a bit. You look at the acquisitions that we've done over the last 5 years, the average acquisition transaction value has been about $40 million per transaction. And so it's more of a string of pearls than chunkier than that. There'll be the odd larger company, but it's not a change in strategy in any way. Now in terms of capital plan, Mark, do you have some comments on that?"

And if PE is involved, we almost always take a pass. Because we want the owners to have made up their mind as to whether they want to be part of Marsh & McLennan Companies, part of a strategic, long-term, viable operation, or whether they're looking to optimize compensation in the short term and they're willing to roll the dice as to what the ultimate outcome and the ultimate owner someday down the road would be. And so we don't bump up against PE as much as you would think."

Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and our opera",1141,"Thank you, Matt. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and our operating company CEOs, Peter Zaffino with Marsh; Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Keith Walsh of Investor Relations. Before we begin, I would like to highlight our recent addition to our management team. Earlier this month, John Doyle joined Marsh as President, reporting to Peter Zaffino. John is also a member of the executive committee of MMC. Many of you know John, a highly regarded insurance industry leader, most recently, he was CEO of AIG's Commercial Insurance business worldwide. John's appointment illustrates our continuing commitment to retain and attract talented professionals to Marsh & McLennan. Before moving onto our results, I thought I would spend a few moments talking about It is a timely issue with the upcoming June load. We have a significant presence in the U.K. and in Europe. And London is important as a major global insurance center. As you would expect, we have considered a potential ramifications for MMC. As I have said previously, we are supportive of the EU and believe Britain's inclusion make both Britain and the EU stronger, economically, politically and strategically. On a macro level, while difficult to predict what the ultimate effects might be, would like to create an environment of uncertainty and volatility for the U.K. and the entire EU. This could last for several years with potentially significant economic and political outcomes. The EU would be a weaker institution without the U.K., which is its second-largest economy and third-largest population. And Britain's exit from the EU could jeopardize the London's position as a major financial sector. From a business perspective, we think Brexit will provide an opportunity as well as challenges for MMC. Frankly, there are too many variables to predict the revenue impact, positive or negative, at this time.
The immediate impact to MMC will be increased FX volatility as our exposure to the pound is relatively high. That said, we think the impact of a significant weakening of the pound on MMC would be negligible. The RIS segment would have a positive impact, owing to its natural hedge of some U.S. dollar revenue on international placements in London while the foreign exchange effects effect on consulting would be negative. Brexit is just one of many issues the global economy has faced during the last 6 years. Our clients rely on us even more during uncertain times, and we have done well for many years in a variety of challenging market environments. We have seen volatility around oil prices and FX, declining interest rates, political instability and lower P&C insurance pricing. Over that time, the MMC team has consistently delivered strong performance. Despite headwinds, we have grown underlying revenue in the range of 3% to 5% annually for 6 years in a row, and we expect to do so in 2016. Our vast geographic footprint allows us to weather regional growth pressures and provides us balance. While there is growth somewhere in the world, we will be on the ground to find it and capture it. 
We are also in growth businesses as a trusted adviser helping our clients address the issues of the day relating to risk, strategy and people. Our greatest resource is our people. We generate ideas and solutions and can pivot through opportunities for growth anywhere across our businesses. Periods of stress also present opportunities. An important part of our strategy is to preserve flexibility and capitalize on market dislocations when they occur. We will continue to invest regardless of any near-term volatility. We believe in the long-term and have built the firm to achieve sustained growth and earnings. We believe in balance between delivering strong financial performance today while investing for our future. 
Now let me turn to our results. I am pleased with MMC's operating performance in the first quarter. We had a strong start to the year, and results were consistent with our plan to generate strong EPS growth for 2016 with underlying revenue growth and margin expansion in both segments. MMC generated underlying revenue growth of 4% in the first quarter with growth across all 4 of our operating companies. This marks the 12 consecutive quarter that we have increased underlying revenue by at least 3%. We are pleased with our profitability in the quarter. You will remember that last year's first quarter results included a significant credit resulting from changes to our retiree medical benefits in the United States. If you normalize the impact from retirement expense, we produced double-digit EPS growth with margin expansion in both segments. Mark will walk you through the details. Looking at our risk and insurance services, revenue was $1.9 billion with underlying growth of 2%. Adjusted operating income was $543 million. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $1.5 billion, underlying growth was 2% with all major geographic regions contributing. In the U.S./Canada division, underlying revenue growth was 2%, led by continuing strong performance of Marsh & McLennan agency, partially offset by weakness in Canada. The international division also expanded 2%. EMEA rose 1%, Asia Pacific grew 3% and Latin America increased 6%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $374 million, an increase of 3% on an underlying basis. Strong new business growth in Global Specialties, primarily in Marine and EMEA led the way. 
In the Consulting segment, revenue was $1.5 billion, up 6% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income was $238 million. Mercer's revenue was $1 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 3%. On a geographic basis, the revenue increase was led by growth markets and North America. 
By line of business, health was the biggest driver of growth, contributing 6%. Investments was up 1%, which follows 13% growth in the first quarter of last year. Talent was up 1% and retirement was flat. 
Oliver Wyman had an excellent first quarter. Revenue was $439 million, reflecting exceptional underlying growth of 15% with all regions contributing. The increase is led by strong performance in the financial services practice. We expect Oliver Wyman's rate of growth to moderate over the balance of the year as comparisons to the prior year get more difficult. In summary, we are pleased with our first quarter results, which provided good start to the year. For the full year 2016, we expect underlying revenue growth within the 3 to 5% range, meaningful margin expansion in both operating segments and strong EPS growth at a level approaching our long-term target of 13%. All this, while continuing to return capital to shareholders through dividends and meaningful share repurchases. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mark."
473342,328891315,965753,"Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we delivered solid underlying revenue growth in each of our operating companies while maintaining control of operating expenses.

In the first quarter, we delivered solid underlying revenue growth in each of our operating companies while maintaining control of operating expenses. GAAP EPS rose 3% to $0.91, and adjusted EPS increased slightly to $0.92. As Dan mentioned, I will walk you through the retirement-related item that makes our earnings comparisons for last year's first quarter challenging and give you more clarity around our underlying results. You will recall in the first quarter of 2015, we recognized the nonrecurring credit of $125 million as a result of changes to our U.S. retiree medical plan. 
Late in 2015, we made additional retirement plan changes and essentially replaced this credit. Not only for 2015 but beyond. As discussed on our last 2 earnings calls, the most impactful of these changes was to divide our U.S.-defined benefit plan into 2 separate plans. As a result of these changes, coupled with the many other factors that go into the measurement of our annual pension expense, we expect the year-over-year decline in retirement expenses for 2016 to be approximately $30 million or $0.04 per share. Although retirement expense will decline for the full year, it increased in the first quarter of 2016 compared with a year ago because of the significant credit we recorded in last year's first quarter. The increase in retirement expense in the first quarter of 2016 compared with the first quarter of 2015 was roughly $0.10 per share. Eliminating this impact, in the first quarter of 2016, MMC produced double-digit growth in adjusted EPS, high single-digit growth in adjusted operating income and meaningful margin expansion in both segment. For the year, we expect to generate underlying revenue growth; increased operating margins in both segments; and strong growth in earnings per share, with improving growth in the second half of the year. 
Moving to investment income. We had a loss of $3 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $5 million from a year ago. As was said in our last call, going forward, we expect to generate only a modest investment income compared with the $38 million we recorded in 2015. This anticipated reduction for 2016 will likely offset the $0.04 benefit from lower retirement expense I mentioned earlier. It is worth reiterating that the full year benefit from lower retirement expense is essentially offset by investment income -- by reduced investment income. This means that despite the financial performance we are expecting for 2016 will continue to come from strong underlying performance. 
We reported last year that we expected foreign exchange to adversely affect EPS by approximately $0.07 in 2016, with the majority is occurring in the first half of the year. As anticipated, the impacts in the first quarter was $0.03. However, the dollar has weakened over the past several weeks against many of our key currencies. Assuming exchange rates remain at their current level, which is a big assumption given FX volatility in recent periods, we now expect the impact from FX to be de minimis for the remainder of the year. 
Our tax rate fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter, reflecting the geographic mix of earnings, tax settlements, completion of open tax years, changes in international and local tax rates and other discrete items. Our adjusted tax rate in the first quarter was 28.5% compared with 29.4% in last year's first quarter. Our rate in the quarter was slightly below that 29% we guided to for 2016 due to discrete items recorded in the period. Based on the current landscape, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29% for the remainder of 2016. Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $5 billion compared with $4.4 billion at year-end. In addition to the $350 million of senior notes we issued in March, total debt includes $250 million of commercial paper outstanding. As we've discussed in the past, we utilized the commercial paper market throughout the year with short-term liquidity and greater cash management flexibility. The term structure of our debt portfolio provides us flexibility with modest near-term repayment obligation. Our next scheduled debt maturity is a $250 million senior notes due in April 2017. 
In the first quarter, we repurchased 3.5 million shares of our stock for $200 million. Our cash position at the end of the first quarter was $918 million, with approximately $190 million in the U.S. Uses of cash in the first quarter included outlays for our annual bonus awards, which have increased in each of the past 7 years. $200 million for share repurchases, $161 million for dividends and $121 million for acquisitions and investments. For the full year of 2016, we plan to deploy roughly $2.3 billion of capital through dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions. We expect to deliver on our annual capital return commitments to reduce our share count and increase our dividends per share by double digits. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan."

Or why is it they're willing to provide higher levels of retail commissions when rates are reducing versus when rates are rising. I'll leave that over to them to talk through. But we're operating with our strategy. We don't think about our relationships with our carrier partners are very close. Perhaps closer than in any time in my career. We worked on a lot of strategic projects together, showing how we can build our business and grow the pie to mutual benefit of our clients. Do you have any other questions?"

And then that would grow faster organically than overall Marsh at a similar or higher level of EBITDA margin. And that strategy is holding. So we're not going to break out the subset, Mike."

I think it's important for us to have an overall view of the Consulting segment. When you have to just start with looking at the size of Mercer relative to the size of Oliver Wyman and recognize that if Mercer isn't generating margin improvement, it would be very hard for the segment to show margin improvement regardless of where the top line is for Oliver Wyman at any point in time. I mean, clearly, we are pleased with Oliver Wyman's revenue performance over the past 2 years. But I would just caution everybody that the vast majority of Oliver Wyman's revenue is nonrecurring project work. And so new projects have to be added continuously for us to even maintain levels of revenue, let alone grow it. So we know as the leadership team that Oliver Wyman will have a more level and a higher level of volatility on the top line than any of the other 3 op cos. And that's one of the reasons why we have built a model where Oliver Wyman's compensation model is very performance-sensitive. So the expense-based naturally -- their expense base, which is largely compensation and benefits, naturally flexes with their revenue line. And so up or down, it's much -- Oliver Wyman has much more of the revenue impact on MMC than an earnings impact."

As you said, the 2% underlying growth if you compare it to the fourth quarter, I would encourage us to take a look at the full year. The first quarter 2016 does represent the 24 conservative quarter of underlying revenue growth. So I'm very proud of Marsh that we've been able to build an organization that can generate organic growth in the short, medium and long-term. As Dan mentioned, and I reiterated that we have a very strong performance in MMA. But we also had solid growth across our emerging markets and very good growth in employee Health & Benefits. Having said that, there are a few things that tempered growth in the quarter. The first quarter is highly dependent on the mature markets within Marsh, particularly Continental Europe, which renews about half of its book in the first quarter. And we were terrific business in Continental Europe. But just based on the macros and insurance conditions, it had historically grown in that low single digits. And that's what happened in this quarter as well. We are facing some headwinds in the insurance market. We know there's an abundant capacity. We've had a little bit of pricing pressure in the quarter. It did tamper, but it is for the better part of the last few years. And we continue to weather the slowdown in some of the commodity-based economies like Australia, Canada, Brazil. Great businesses but just a little bit of temper on the growth. So if I step back and take a broader view, I'm really pleased with the key fundamentals, meaning, the clients that we're retaining, strong new business, continue to expand into new products, had a terrific progress we've made on cyber. We're about up 80% year-over-year on brokerage and in premium and expect to see a very strong trend continue. And our investments are highly driven by delivering superior value to clients, and I feel really good where we are."

I mean, generally, when we look at it, I think we said it in a couple of calls ago. It was all a consolidation. It was actually more insurance companies in our space in the United States than there were 10 or 15 years ago. And so it's still a very fragmented competitive marketplace. And we see very little -- there used to be -- when I looked earlier in my career, say, 25 years ago or so, there was this huge qualitative difference between the larger carriers and midsize carriers. Because the midsize carriers, in large part, are staff and leadership teams and people who came from the larger carriers, that qualitative distance between the 2 doesn't play out quite as readily. So there's an ample companies for us to talk to an have meaningful relationships and discussions with our clients within a way. We have really core relationships. If anything, this level of refocus from some of the larger carriers has created a deeper closeness between the working teams at Marsh and their counterparts in the underwriting companies to make sure that we want our clients to be with people who want to write that account. And so we want to make sure we know clearly what the underwriting appetite is and what the commitment to the future is.

Both segments increase their margin. So RIS increase their margins in the first quarter despite the level of growth. And so I'm pretty comfortable we can manage the business. We have said several times in the past. As a company, we believe we driver margin when the company grows to 3% or better.

I can tell you -- I don't really give about food margins in any one quarter. We run our business and away on how do we do over the course of year -- 1 year and multiyear basis. Our margins have been on a track. We've been talking about margins within investment community for a lot of years now.

As you heard me speak in the -- and before, we're very disciplined and investing in areas where we cannot achieve that profitable growth and investing in areas that we can on a consistent basis.

One, you'll know that I don't actually like creating target numbers on things like margin. Because I think targets have a way of people trying to get there and touch it as being okay, target achieved. And then you see it shrank back again. I mean, at the end of the day, I did want to creep boundaries on how either of our segments could perform in the future. We have all kinds of advantages in terms of efficiency, technology, expense synergies, revenue synergies that we are capturing within the company. So comparisons to how the company operated a decade or 15 years ago are not really that relevant for us. So I keep it very open in terms of what I do say and what I know Peter and Julio and Alex and Scott say when we're talking to our teams is do not drive for margin at the expense of investing for the business or for organic growth. And so from that perspective, I just think it's important for you to note that the way to look at it. Having said all that, we've been talking about margins essentially for the last 8 years. And the story for us has been pretty consistent. We expect to be able to grow margins because we run our business in a way that expenses almost always grow at a slower pace than revenue. We expect to continue to do that. Clearly, that level of difference varies-based upon whenever margins get up to, let's say, very high level sometime into the future. Then we will be very happy to grow expenses at the same pace as revenue because we would have such a fantastic business. We already have market-leading margins relative to the mega- brokers. And so we feel pretty good about where they are. And that just remind everybody that when we look at margins and talk about it, we'll look on a multiyear basis. If I look over the last 4 or 5 years, both segments have grown margins between 400 and 500 basis points. And so I could have easily set a target or some sort of threshold number 4 or 5 years ago because I remember conversations were people would say, well, you think a good role you're margins 200 to 250 basis points from where they are today? And boy, I'm glad that we didn't say yes to that and create some sort of hurdle to where we now we felt they achieve it so now we won't grow them anymore. But let the business is run and see where that takes us. But we're quite confident that 2016 will be the seventh conservative year that you see expansion in both segments."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and our opera",1143,"Thank you, Matt. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and our operating company CEOs, Peter Zaffino of Marsh; Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Keith Walsh of Investor Relations.
Before we begin, I would like to highlight a recent addition to our management team. Earlier this month, John Doyle joined Marsh as President, reporting to Peter Zaffino. John is also a member of the Executive Committee of MMC. Many of you know John, a highly regarded insurance industry leader. Most recently, he was CEO of AIG's Commercial Insurance business worldwide. John's appointment illustrates our continuing commitment to retain and attract talented professionals to Marsh & McLennan.
Before moving on to our results, I thought I would spend a few moments talking about Brexit. It is a timely issue with the upcoming June vote. We have a significant presence in the U.K. and in Europe. And London is important as a major global insurance center. As you would expect, we have considered the potential ramifications for MMC. As I have said previously, we are supportive of the EU and believe Britain's inclusion makes both Britain and the EU stronger, economically, politically and strategically.
On a macro level, while difficult to predict what the ultimate effects might be, Brexit would likely create an environment of uncertainty and volatility for the U.K. and the entire EU. This could last for several years with potentially significant economic and political outcomes. The EU would be a weaker institution without the U.K., which is its second-largest economy and third-largest population. And Britain's exit from the EU could jeopardize London's position as a major financial sector. From a business perspective, we think Brexit would provide opportunities as well as challenges for MMC. Frankly, there are too many variables to predict the revenue impact, positive or negative, at this time.
The immediate impact to MMC would be increased FX volatility as our exposure to the pound is relatively high. That said, we think the impact of a significant weakening of the pound on MMC would be negligible. The RIS segment would have a positive impact, owing to its natural hedge of having some U.S. dollar revenue on international placements in London, while the foreign exchange effect on consulting would be negative.
Brexit is just one of many issues the global economy has faced during the last 6 years. Our clients rely on us even more during uncertain times, and we have done well for many years in a variety of challenging market environments. We have seen volatility around oil prices and FX, declining interest rates, political instability and lower P&C insurance pricing. Over that time, the MMC team has consistently delivered strong performance. Despite headwinds, we have grown underlying revenue in a range of 3% to 5% annually for 6 years in a row, and we expect to do so in 2016. Our vast geographic footprint allows us to weather regional growth pressures and provides us balance. While there is growth somewhere in the world, we will be on the ground to find it and capture it.
We are also in growth businesses as a trusted adviser helping our clients address the issues of the day relating to risk, strategy and people. Our greatest resource is our people. We generate ideas and solutions and can pivot toward opportunities for growth anywhere across our businesses. Periods of stress also present opportunities. An important part of our strategy is to preserve flexibility and capitalize on market dislocations when they occur. We will continue to invest regardless of any near-term volatility. We believe in the long term and have built the firm to achieve sustained growth in earnings. We believe in balance between delivering strong financial performance today while investing for our future.
Now let me turn to our results. I am pleased with MMC's operating performance in the first quarter. We had a strong start to the year, and results were consistent with our plan to generate strong EPS growth for 2016 with underlying revenue growth and margin expansion in both segments. MMC generated underlying revenue growth of 4% in the first quarter, with growth across all 4 of our operating companies. This marks the 12th consecutive quarter that we have increased underlying revenue by at least 3%.
We are pleased with our profitability in the quarter. You will remember that last year's first quarter results included a significant credit resulting from changes to our retiree medical benefits in the United States. If you normalize the impact from retirement expense, we produced double-digit EPS growth with margin expansion in both segments. Mark will walk you through the details.
Looking at our Risk and Insurance Services segment, revenue was $1.9 billion with underlying growth of 2%. Adjusted operating income was $543 million. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $1.5 billion, underlying growth was 2% with all major geographic regions contributing. In the U.S./Canada division, underlying revenue growth was 2%, led by continuing strong performance of Marsh & McLennan Agency, partially offset by weakness in Canada. The International division also expanded 2%. EMEA rose 1%, Asia Pacific grew 3% and Latin America increased 6%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $374 million, an increase of 3% on an underlying basis. Strong new business growth in Global Specialties, primarily in marine and EMEA, led the way.
In the Consulting segment, revenue was $1.5 billion, up 6% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income was $238 million. Mercer's revenue was $1 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 3%. On a geographic basis, the revenue increase was led by growth markets and North America.
By line of business, health was the biggest driver of growth, contributing 6%. Investments was up 1%, which follows 13% growth in the first quarter of last year. Talent was up 1% and retirement was flat.
Oliver Wyman had an excellent first quarter. Revenue was $439 million, reflecting exceptional underlying growth of 15% with all regions contributing. The increase was led by strong performance in the Financial Services practice. We expect Oliver Wyman's rate of growth to moderate over the balance of the year as comparisons to the prior year get more difficult.
In summary, we are pleased with our first quarter results, which provided good start to the year. For the full year 2016, we expect underlying revenue growth within the 3% to 5% range, meaningful margin expansion in both operating segments and strong EPS growth at a level approaching our long-term target of 13%. All this while continuing to return capital to shareholders through dividends and meaningful share repurchases.
With that, let me turn it over to Mark."
473342,328891315,966303,"Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we delivered solid underlying revenue growth in each of our operating companies while maintaining control of operating expenses. GAAP EPS rose 3% to $0.91, and adjusted EPS increased slight",824,"Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we delivered solid underlying revenue growth in each of our operating companies while maintaining control of operating expenses. GAAP EPS rose 3% to $0.91, and adjusted EPS increased slightly to $0.92. As Dan mentioned, I will walk you through the retirement-related items that makes our earnings comparison to last year's first quarter challenging and give you more clarity around our underlying results.
You will recall in the first quarter of 2015, we recognized a nonrecurring credit of $125 million as a result of changes to our U.S. retiree medical plan. Late in 2015, we made additional retirement plan changes that essentially replaced this credit, not only for 2015, but beyond. As discussed on our last 2 earnings call, the most impactful of these changes was to divide our U.S.-defined benefit plan into 2 separate plan. As a result of these changes, coupled with the many other factors that go into the measurement of our annual pension expense, we expect the year-over-year decline in retirement expense for 2016 of approximately $30 million or $0.04 per share. Although retirement expense will decline for the full year, it increased in the first quarter of 2016 compared with a year ago because of the significant credit we recorded in last year's first quarter. The increase in retirement expense in the first quarter of 2016 compared with the first quarter of 2015 was roughly $0.10 per share. Eliminating this impact, in the first quarter of 2016, MMC produced double-digit growth in adjusted EPS, high single-digit growth in adjusted operating income and meaningful margin expansion in both segment. For the year, we expect to generate underlying revenue growth, increased operating margins in both segments and strong growth in earnings per share, with improving growth in the second half of the year.
Moving to investment income. We had a loss of $3 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $5 million from a year ago. As we said on our last call, going forward, we expect to generate only modest investment income compared with the $38 million we recorded in 2015. This anticipated reduction for 2016 will likely offset the $0.04 benefit from lower retirement expense I mentioned earlier. It is worth reiterating that the full year benefit from lower retirement expense is essentially offset by investment income -- by reduced investment income. This means that the financial performance we are expecting for 2016 will continue to come from strong underlying operating performance.
We reported last year that we expected foreign exchange to adversely affect EPS by approximately $0.07 in 2016, with the majority occurring in the first half of the year. As anticipated, the impact in the first quarter was $0.03. However, the dollar has weakened over the past several weeks against many of our key currency. Assuming exchange rates remain at their current level, which is a big assumption given FX volatility in recent periods, we now expect the impact from FX to be de minimis for the remainder of the year.
Our tax rate fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter, reflecting the geographic mix of earnings, tax settlements, completion of open tax years, changes in international and local tax rates and other discrete items. Our adjusted tax rate in the first quarter was 28.5% compared with 29.4% in last year's first quarter. Our rate in the quarter was slightly below the 29% we guided to for 2016 due to discrete items recorded in the period. Based on the current landscape, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29% for the remainder of 2016.
Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $5 billion compared with $4.4 billion at year-end. In addition to the $350 million of senior notes we issued in March, total debt includes $250 million of commercial paper outstanding. As we've discussed in the past, we utilize the commercial paper market throughout the year for short-term liquidity and greater cash management flexibility. The term structure of our debt portfolio provides us flexibility with modest near-term repayment obligation. Our next scheduled debt maturity is a $250 million senior note due in April 2017.
In the first quarter, we repurchased 3.5 million shares of our stock for $200 million. Our cash position at the end of the first quarter was $918 million, with approximately $190 million in the U.S. Uses of cash in the first quarter included outlays for our annual bonus awards, which have increased in each of the past 7 years. $200 million for share repurchases, $161 million for dividends and $121 million for acquisitions and investments. For the full year of 2016, we plan to deploy roughly $2.3 billion of capital through dividends, share repurchases and acquisition. We expect to deliver on our annual capital return commitments to reduce our share count and increase our dividends per share by double digit.
And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan."

I mean, the people around this table have been on both sides of that aisle and have been involved in the market for a long time. So we've seen many cycles. And so I would say right off the bat, this to me doesn't strike us as unusual in any way. The market itself over the last 30 years has almost always been highly competitive with bouts of reactionary, episodic tightening, but in general terms is usually always very competitive. And so we have built our business around the capability of operating in highly competitive insurance market cycles, not around operating when the market is tightening. And when I -- I can't really explain to you in-depth. I'll leave it up to them as to why underwriters write more new business when rates are declining than when rates are rising. Or why they're willing to provide higher levels of retail commissions when rates are reducing versus when rates are rising. I'll leave that over to them to talk through. But we're operating in our strategy. We don't think anything untoward -- our relationships with our carrier partners are very close, perhaps closer than in any time in my career. We work on a lot of strategic projects together, showing how we can build our business and grow the pie to the mutual benefit of our clients. Do you have any other question?"

I think it's important for us to have an overall view of the Consulting segment. One, you have to just start with looking at the size of Mercer relative to the size of Oliver Wyman and recognize that if Mercer isn't generating margin improvement, it would be very hard for the segment to show margin improvement regardless of where the top line is for Oliver Wyman at any point in time. I mean, clearly, we are pleased with Oliver Wyman's revenue performance over the past 2 years, but I would just caution everybody that the vast majority of Oliver Wyman's revenue is nonrecurring project work. And so new projects have to be added continuously for us to even maintain levels of revenue, let alone grow it. So we know as the leadership team that Oliver Wyman will have a more level and a higher level of volatility on the top line than any of the other 3 OpCos. And that is one of the reasons why we have built a model where Oliver Wyman's compensation model is very performance-sensitive. So their expense base -- naturally, their expense base, which is largely compensation and benefit, naturally flexes with their revenue line. And so up or down, it's much -- Oliver Wyman has much more of a revenue impact on MMC than an earnings impact."

There's -- in a business the size of Marsh, there's always a lot going on. As you said, the 2% underlying growth if you compare it to the fourth quarter, I would encourage us to take a look at the full year. The first quarter 2016 does represent the 24th consecutive quarter of underlying revenue growth. So I'm very proud of Marsh that we've been able to build an organization that can generate organic growth in the short, medium and long term. As Dan mentioned and I reiterated, we had very strong performance in MMA, but we also had solid growth across our emerging markets and very good growth in employee health and benefits. Having said that, there were a few things that tempered growth in the quarter. The first quarter is highly dependent on the mature markets within Marsh, particularly Continental Europe, which renews about half of its book in the first quarter. And we have a terrific business in Continental Europe. But just based on the macros and insurance conditions, it has historically grown in the low single digits. And that's what happened in this quarter as well. We are facing some headwinds in the insurance market. We know there's an abundance of capacity. We've had a little bit of pricing pressure in the quarter. It did temper, but it is -- it's been happening for the better part of the last few years. And we continue to weather the slowdown in some of the commodity-based economies like Australia, Canada, Brazil. Great businesses, but just a little bit tempered on the growth. So if I step back and take a broader view, I'm really pleased with the key fundamentals, meaning, the clients that we're retaining, strong new business, continue to expand into new products, had a terrific progress we've made on cyber, about up 80% year-over-year on brokerage and in premium and expect to see a very strong trend continue. And our investments are highly driven by delivering superior value to clients, and I feel really good where we are."

I mean, generally, when we look at it, I think we said it in a couple of calls ago. It was all consolidation. There's actually more insurance companies in our space in the United States than there were 10 or 15 years ago. And so it's still a very fragmented competitive marketplace. And we see very little -- there used to be -- when I look earlier in my career, say, 25 years ago or so, there was this huge qualitative difference between the larger carriers and midsized carriers. Because the midsized carriers, in large part, are staffed and leadership teams with people who came from the larger carriers, that qualitative distance between the 2 doesn't play out quite as readily. And so there's ample companies for us to talk to and have meaningful relationships with and discussions with our clients within a tripartite way. We have really core relationships. If anything, this level of refocus from some of the larger carriers has created a deeper closeness between the working teams at Marsh and their counterparts in the underwriting companies to make sure that we want our clients to be with people who want to write that account. And so we want to make sure we know clearly what the underwriting appetite is and what the commitment to the future is.

We look at operating income and earnings growth. And we look about the air between our revenue growth and our expense growth. And so margins are a natural outcome of us managing the business properly, right? So that is the fundamental strategic view. I can tell you, I really don't give a hoot about margins in any one quarter. We run our business in a way of how do we do over the course of year -- 1 year and multiyear basis. Our margins have been on track. We've been talking about margins with the investment community for a lot of years now, and I just have to say that 2016 is going to be the ninth consecutive year of margin expansion and the seventh consecutive year of margin expansion in both segments. And so our margins are going to go up as an outcome of the way we run the business.

And as you can imagine, there can be puts and takes across the portfolio in any 1 quarter, but we have consistently now delivered growth for several quarters in a row. More importantly, we are well positioned to continue to produce short, medium and long-term profitable growth. As you have heard me speak about in the -- and before, we're very disciplined in disinvesting in areas where we cannot achieve that profitable growth and investing in areas that we can on a consistent basis. A good example of that is the way we've repositioned the portfolio around growth strategies, investments being one of them health exchanges, Workday implementation. You've seen us invest there, Alexander Forbes, improving our geographic footprint. While disinvesting, for example, in the recent decision we made on DC admin recordkeeping business. So we continue to do that as the dynamic and discipline in the organization is now built into our culture. As it relates to the investment business, I think you already mentioned that we had a tough comparison in the quarter, in the first quarter of 2015, which we had exceptional growth of 13%. But I must tell you though that overall though, investment pipeline is strong, is looking good. There'll be some, again, gyrations because of external environment on occasion.

I mean, there's a couple of things. One, you'll know that I don't actually like creating target numbers on things like margin because I think targets have a way of people trying to get there and touch it as being okay, target achieved and then you see it shrink back again. I mean, at the end of the day, I do not want to create boundaries on how either of our segments could perform in the future. We have all kinds of advantages in terms of efficiency, technology, expense synergies, revenue synergies that we're capturing within the company so comparisons to how the company operated a decade or 15 years ago are not really that relevant for us. So I keep it very open in terms of -- what I do say and what I know Peter and Julio and Alex and Scott say when we're talking to our teams is do not drive for margin at the expense of investing for the business or for organic growth. And so from that perspective, I just think it's important for you to know the way we look at it. Having said all that, we've been talking about margins essentially for the last 8 years. And the story for us has been pretty consistent. We expect to be able to grow margins because we run our business in a way that expenses almost always grow at a slower pace than revenue. We expect to continue to do that. Clearly, that level of difference varies based upon when our margins get up to, let's say, very high level sometime into the future, then we'll be very happy to grow expenses at the same pace as revenue because we would have such a fantastic business. We already have market-leading margins relative to the mega-brokers. And so we feel pretty good about where they are. And I'd just remind everybody that when we look at margins and talk about it, we look on a multiyear basis. And if I look over the last 4 or 5 years, both segments have grown margins between 400 and 500 basis points. And so I could have easily set a target or some sort of threshold number 4 or 5 years ago because I remember conversations where people would say, well, do you think you can grow your margins 200 to 250 basis points from where they are today? And boy, am I glad that we didn't say yes to that and create some sort of hurdle to where we've now felt we've achieved it so now we won't grow them anymore. We're just going to let the businesses run and see where that takes us, but we're quite confident that 2016 will be the seventh consecutive year that you see expansion in both segments."

We've also introduced also lots of different ways to be able to attract the demands that are necessary to be served for our clients. For example, Mercer Match is a new innovation that we've put together that's based on collecting neural science data and also matching it with gamification. So that assessment of potential pools of candidates could be made much more easily with higher outcomes, positive outcomes for clients. In addition to that, another example would be Harmonise, which we have launched in the U.K., which is database-driven analytics that allows us to in one fell swoop tool deliver -- push information for individual employees to make decisions about -- informed decisions about their benefit, for instance, and that's now been launched in the U.K. and also in Ireland. So the data is a very strong foundational base that is driving our innovations and our future solutions matching to our clients' needs."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.

I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and our operating company CEOs, Peter Zaffino of Marsh; Alex Moczarski of Guy Carpenter; Julio Portalatin of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us is Keith Walsh of Investor Relations.
Before we begin, I would like to highlight a recent addition to our management team. Earlier this month, John Doyle joined Marsh as President, reporting to Peter Zaffino. John is also a member of the Executive Committee of MMC. Many of you know John, a highly regarded insurance industry leader. Most recently, he was CEO of AIG's Commercial Insurance business worldwide. John's appointment illustrates our continuing commitment to retain and attract talented professionals to Marsh & McLennan.
Before moving on to our results, I thought I would spend a few moments talking about Brexit. It is a timely issue with the upcoming June vote. We have a significant presence in the U.K. and in Europe. And London is important as a major global insurance center. As you would expect, we have considered the potential ramifications for MMC. As I have said previously, we are supportive of the EU and believe Britain's inclusion makes both Britain and the EU stronger, economically, politically and strategically.
On a macro level, while difficult to predict what the ultimate effects might be, Brexit would likely create an environment of uncertainty and volatility for the U.K. and the entire EU. This could last for several years with potentially significant economic and political outcomes. The EU would be a weaker institution without the U.K., which is its second-largest economy and third-largest population. And Britain's exit from the EU could jeopardize London's position as a major financial sector. From a business perspective, we think Brexit would provide opportunities as well as challenges for MMC. Frankly, there are too many variables to predict the revenue impact, positive or negative, at this time.
The immediate impact to MMC would be increased FX volatility as our exposure to the pound is relatively high. That said, we think the impact of a significant weakening of the pound on MMC would be negligible. The RIS segment would have a positive impact, owing to its natural hedge of having some U.S. dollar revenue on international placements in London, while the foreign exchange effect on consulting would be negative.
Brexit is just one of many issues the global economy has faced during the last 6 years. Our clients rely on us even more during uncertain times, and we have done well for many years in a variety of challenging market environments. We have seen volatility around oil prices and FX, declining interest rates, political instability and lower P&C insurance pricing. Over that time, the MMC team has consistently delivered strong performance. Despite headwinds, we have grown underlying revenue in a range of 3% to 5% annually for 6 years in a row, and we expect to do so in 2016. Our vast geographic footprint allows us to weather regional growth pressures and provides us balance. While there is growth somewhere in the world, we will be on the ground to find it and capture it.
We are also in growth businesses as a trusted adviser helping our clients address the issues of the day relating to risk, strategy and people. Our greatest resource is our people. We generate ideas and solutions and can pivot toward opportunities for growth anywhere across our businesses. Periods of stress also present opportunities. An important part of our strategy is to preserve flexibility and capitalize on market dislocations when they occur. We will continue to invest regardless of any near-term volatility. We believe in the long term and have built the firm to achieve sustained growth in earnings. We believe in balance between delivering strong financial performance today while investing for our future.
Now let me turn to our results. I am pleased with MMC's operating performance in the first quarter. We had a strong start to the year, and results were consistent with our plan to generate strong EPS growth for 2016 with underlying revenue growth and margin expansion in both segments. MMC generated underlying revenue growth of 4% in the first quarter, with growth across all 4 of our operating companies. This marks the 12th consecutive quarter that we have increased underlying revenue by at least 3%.
We are pleased with our profitability in the quarter. You will remember that last year's first quarter results included a significant credit resulting from changes to our retiree medical benefits in the United States. If you normalize the impact from retirement expense, we produced double-digit EPS growth with margin expansion in both segments. Mark will walk you through the details.
Looking at our Risk and Insurance Services segment, revenue was $1.9 billion with underlying growth of 2%. Adjusted operating income was $543 million. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $1.5 billion, underlying growth was 2% with all major geographic regions contributing. In the U.S./Canada division, underlying revenue growth was 2%, led by continuing strong performance of Marsh & McLennan Agency, partially offset by weakness in Canada. The International division also expanded 2%. EMEA rose 1%, Asia Pacific grew 3% and Latin America increased 6%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $374 million, an increase of 3% on an underlying basis. Strong new business growth in Global Specialties, primarily in marine and EMEA, led the way.
In the Consulting segment, revenue was $1.5 billion, up 6% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income was $238 million. Mercer's revenue was $1 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 3%. On a geographic basis, the revenue increase was led by growth markets and North America.
By line of business, health was the biggest driver of growth, contributing 6%. Investments was up 1%, which follows 13% growth in the first quarter of last year. Talent was up 1% and retirement was flat.
Oliver Wyman had an excellent first quarter. Revenue was $439 million, reflecting exceptional underlying growth of 15% with all regions contributing. The increase was led by strong performance in the Financial Services practice. We expect Oliver Wyman's rate of growth to moderate over the balance of the year as comparisons to the prior year get more difficult.
In summary, we are pleased with our first quarter results, which provide a good start to the year. For the full year 2016, we expect underlying revenue growth within the 3% to 5% range, meaningful margin expansion in both operating segments and strong EPS growth at a level approaching our long-term target of 13%. All this while continuing to return capital to shareholders through dividends and meaningful share repurchases.
With that, let me turn it over to Mark."
473342,328891315,966557,"Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we delivered solid underlying revenue growth in each of our operating companies while maintaining control of operating expenses. GAAP EPS rose 3% to $0.91, and adjusted EPS increased slight",824,"Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we delivered solid underlying revenue growth in each of our operating companies while maintaining control of operating expenses. GAAP EPS rose 3% to $0.91, and adjusted EPS increased slightly to $0.92. As Dan mentioned, I will walk you through the retirement-related items that make our earnings comparison to last year's first quarter challenging and give you more clarity around our underlying results.
You will recall in the first quarter of 2015, we recognized a nonrecurring credit of $125 million as a result of changes to our U.S. retiree medical plan. Late in 2015, we made additional retirement plan changes that essentially replaced this credit, not only for 2016, but beyond. As discussed on our last 2 earnings call, the most impactful of these changes was to divide our U.S.-defined benefit plan into 2 separate plans. As a result of these changes, coupled with the many other factors that go into the measurement of our annual pension expense, we expect a year-over-year decline in retirement expense for 2016 of approximately $30 million or $0.04 per share. Although retirement expense will decline for the full year, it increased in the first quarter of 2016 compared with a year ago because of the significant credit we recorded in last year's first quarter. The increase in retirement expense in the first quarter of 2016 compared with the first quarter of 2015 was roughly $0.10 per share. Eliminating this impact, in the first quarter of 2016, MMC produced double-digit growth in adjusted EPS, high single-digit growth in adjusted operating income and meaningful margin expansion in both segments. For the year, we expect to generate underlying revenue growth, increased operating margins in both segments and strong growth in earnings per share, with improving growth in the second half of the year.
Moving to investment income. We had a loss of $3 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $5 million from a year ago. As we said on our last call, going forward, we expect to generate only modest investment income compared with the $38 million we recorded in 2015. This anticipated reduction for 2016 will likely offset the $0.04 benefit from lower retirement expense I mentioned earlier. It is worth reiterating that the full year benefit from lower retirement expense is essentially offset by investment income -- by reduced investment income. This means that the financial performance we are expecting for 2016 will continue to come from strong underlying operating performance.
We reported last year that we expected foreign exchange to adversely affect EPS by approximately $0.07 in 2016, with the majority occurring in the first half of the year. As anticipated, the impact in the first quarter was $0.03. However, the dollar has weakened over the past several weeks against many of our key currencies. Assuming exchange rates remain at their current level, which is a big assumption given FX volatility in recent periods, we now expect the impact from FX to be de minimis for the remainder of the year.
Our tax rate fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter, reflecting the geographic mix of earnings, tax settlements, completion of open tax years, changes in international and local tax rates and other discrete items. Our adjusted tax rate in the first quarter was 28.5% compared with 29.4% in last year's first quarter. Our rate in the quarter was slightly below the 29% we guided to for 2016 due to discrete items recorded in the period. Based on the current landscape, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29% for the remainder of 2016.
Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $5 billion compared with $4.4 billion at year-end. In addition to the $350 million of senior notes we issued in March, total debt includes $250 million of commercial paper outstanding. As we've discussed in the past, we utilize the commercial paper market throughout the year for short-term liquidity and greater cash management flexibility. The term structure of our debt portfolio provides us flexibility with modest near-term repayment obligation. Our next scheduled debt maturity is a $250 million senior note due in April 2017.
In the first quarter, we repurchased 3.5 million shares of our stock for $200 million. Our cash position at the end of the first quarter was $918 million, with approximately $190 million in the U.S. Uses of cash in the first quarter included outlays for our annual bonus awards, which have increased in each of the past 7 years. $200 million for share repurchases, $161 million for dividends and $121 million for acquisitions and investments. For the full year of 2016, we plan to deploy roughly $2.3 billion of capital through dividends, share repurchases and acquisition. We expect to deliver on our annual capital return commitments to reduce our share count and increase our dividends per share by double digit.
And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan."

The answer is going to be very similar to some of my commentary in some of the prior quarters. And the premise behind MMA has been that the middle market in the United States provides an opportunity for higher growth in the large account space, and that has largely proven to be true. We think it's a very good segment. We've acquired the highest-quality agencies, just adding Celedinas in the first quarter, which is a high net worth personal lines agency, best-in-class, out of Palm Beach. We've shared best practices. We've been heavily investing in sales capacity. And we have a very balanced business between employee health and benefits and property and casualty. So we're very pleased with the acquisitions that we've made, the strong organic growth. And I think the last part of your question was just roughly what the size is. And we think by year-end, with no more acquisitions, if we wanted to do any, we do have a very strong pipeline, but as of today, the annualized revenue is approximately $950 million."

I mean, the people around this table have been on both sides of that aisle and have been involved in the market for a long time. So we've seen many cycles. And so I would say right off the bat, this to me doesn't strike us as unusual in any way. The market itself over the last 30 years has almost always been highly competitive with bouts of reactionary, episodic tightening, but in general terms is usually always very competitive. And so we have built our business around the capability of operating in highly competitive insurance market cycles, not around operating when the market is tightening. And when I -- I can't really explain to you in-depth. I'll leave it up to them as to why underwriters write more new business when rates are declining than when rates are rising. Or why they're willing to provide higher levels of retail commissions when rates are reducing versus when rates are rising. I'll leave that over to them to talk through. But we're operating in our strategy. We don't think anything untoward -- our relationships with our carrier partners are very close, perhaps closer than at any time in my career.

I think it's important for us to have an overall view of the Consulting segment. One, you have to just start with looking at the size of Mercer relative to the size of Oliver Wyman and recognize that if Mercer isn't generating margin improvement, it would be very hard for the segment to show margin improvement regardless of where the top line is for Oliver Wyman at any point in time. I mean, clearly, we are pleased with Oliver Wyman's revenue performance over the past 2 years, but I would just caution everybody that the vast majority of Oliver Wyman's revenue is nonrecurring project work. And so new projects have to be added continuously for us to even maintain levels of revenue, let alone grow it. So we know as the leadership team that Oliver Wyman will have a more level and a higher level of volatility on the top line than any of the other 3 OpCos. And that is one of the reasons why we have built a model where Oliver Wyman's compensation model is very performance-sensitive. So their expense base -- naturally, their expense base, which is largely compensation and benefit, naturally flexes with their revenue line. And so up or down, it's much -- Oliver Wyman has much more of a revenue impact on MMC than an earnings impact."

As you said, the 2% underlying growth if you compare it to the fourth quarter, I would encourage us to take a look at the full year. The first quarter 2016 does represent the 24th consecutive quarter of underlying revenue growth. So I'm very proud of Marsh that we've been able to build an organization that can generate organic growth in the short, medium and long term. As Dan mentioned and I reiterated, we had very strong performance in MMA, but we also had solid growth across our emerging markets and very good growth in employee health and benefits. Having said that, there were a few things that tempered growth in the quarter. The first quarter is highly dependent on the mature markets within Marsh, particularly Continental Europe, which renews about half of its book in the first quarter. And we have a terrific business in Continental Europe. But just based on the macros and insurance conditions, it has historically grown in the low single digits. And that's what happened in this quarter as well. We are facing some headwinds in the insurance market. We know there's an abundance of capacity. We've had a little bit of pricing pressure in the quarter. It did temper, but it is -- it's been happening for the better part of the last few years. And we continue to weather the slowdown in some of the commodity-based economies like Australia, Canada, Brazil. Great businesses, but just a little bit tempered on the growth. So if I step back and take a broader view, I'm really pleased with the key fundamentals, meaning, the clients that we're retaining, strong new business, continue to expand into new products, had a terrific progress we've made on cyber, about up 80% year-over-year on brokerage and in premium and expect to see a very strong trend continue. And our investments are highly driven by delivering superior value to clients, and I feel really good where we are."

I'll take that broadly and then I'll hand over to Peter to talk a little bit more about the impact of re-underwriting and acquisitions and consolidations. I mean, generally, when we look at it, I think we said it in a couple of calls ago. It was all consolidation. There's actually more insurance companies in our space in the United States than there were 10 or 15 years ago. And so it's still a very fragmented competitive marketplace. And we see very little -- there used to be -- when I look earlier in my career, say, 25 years ago or so, there was this huge qualitative difference between the larger carriers and midsized carriers. Because the midsized carriers, in large part, are staffed and leadership teams with people who came from the larger carriers, that qualitative distance between the 2 doesn't play out quite as readily. And so there's ample companies for us to talk to and have meaningful relationships with and discussions with our clients within a tripartite way. We have really core relationships. If anything, this level of refocus from some of the larger carriers has created a deeper closeness between the working teams at Marsh and their counterparts in the underwriting companies to make sure that we want our clients to be with people who want to write that account. And so we want to make sure we know clearly what the underwriting appetite is and what the commitment to the future is. And so therefore, there's been a lot of dialogue and a lot of interaction at a strategic level. So we feel pretty good about where we are. Although, Peter, you want to add to that?"

We are trying to find ways in which we can create more product, whether it's in cyber or in terrorism or making sure that we simplify the insurance product. And so I would add, as Dan said, we have such a close relationship with so many of the insurance companies and trading partners that we're always trying to improve the experience for our clients and making sure that we are anticipating the changes that are happening around the corner and not just being stagnant in today's market. But by and large, we don't see anything that is a major dislocation for clients, and I think we will continue to trade as we have in the past."

We look at operating income and earnings growth. And we look about the air between our revenue growth and our expense growth. And so margins are a natural outcome of us managing the business properly, right? So that is the fundamental strategic view. I can tell you, I really don't give a hoot about margins in any one quarter. We run our business in a way of how do we do over the course of year -- 1 year and multiyear basis. Our margins have been on a track. We've been talking about margins with the investment community for a lot of years now, and I just have to say that 2016 is going to be the ninth consecutive year of margin expansion and the seventh consecutive year of margin expansion in both segments. And so our margins are going to go up as an outcome of the way we run the business.

More importantly, we are well positioned to continue to produce short, medium and long-term profitable growth. As you have heard me speak about in the -- and before, we're very disciplined in disinvesting in areas where we cannot achieve that profitable growth and investing in areas that we can on a consistent basis. A good example of that is the way we've repositioned the portfolio around growth strategies, investments being one of them, health exchanges, Workday implementation. You've seen us invest there, Alexander Forbes, improving our geographic footprint. While disinvesting, for example, in the recent decision we made on DC admin recordkeeping business.

I mean, there's a couple of things. One, you'll know that I don't actually like creating target numbers on things like margin because I think targets have a way of people trying to get there and touch it as being okay, target achieved and then you see it shrink back again. I mean, at the end of the day, I do not want to create boundaries on how either of our segments could perform in the future. We have all kinds of advantages in terms of efficiency, technology, expense synergies, revenue synergies that we're capturing within the company so comparisons to how the company operated a decade or 15 years ago are not really that relevant for us. So I keep it very open in terms of -- what I do say and what I know Peter and Julio and Alex and Scott say when we're talking to our teams is do not drive for margin at the expense of investing for the business or for organic growth. And so from that perspective, I just think it's important for you to know the way we look at it. Having said all that, we've been talking about margins essentially for the last 8 years. And the story for us has been pretty consistent. We expect to be able to grow margins because we run our business in a way that expenses almost always grow at a slower pace than revenue. We expect to continue to do that. Clearly, that level of difference varies based upon when our margins get up to, let's say, very high level sometime into the future, then we'll be very happy to grow expenses at the same pace as revenue because we would have such a fantastic business. We already have market-leading margins relative to the mega-brokers. And so we feel pretty good about where they are. And I'd just remind everybody that when we look at margins and talk about it, we look on a multiyear basis. And if I look over the last 4 or 5 years, both segments have grown margins between 400 and 500 basis points. And so I could have easily set a target or some sort of threshold number 4 or 5 years ago because I remember conversations where people would say, well, do you think you can grow your margins 200 to 250 basis points from where they are today? And boy, am I glad that we didn't say yes to that and create some sort of hurdle to where we've now felt we've achieved it so now we won't grow them anymore. We're just going to let the businesses run and see where that takes us, but we're quite confident that 2016 will be the seventh consecutive year that you see expansion in both segments."

We have expand our analytic platform to be able to give our clients much more insight in terms of volatility, any catastrophe exposure, predictive modeling and really tying it all together. One great example of that is as we rolled out an iMAP technology. And we think it's the industry's only mobile real-time analytics platform that allows our clients to have interactive discussions with us based on market conditions, based on overlaying a rich database to show them benchmarking and peer reviews. And we do measure RFP statistics, where we have a full comprehensive analytics approach versus a more traditional and our win ratio is significantly higher.

Before moving onto our results, I thought I would spend a few minutes on Brexit, adding to my comments from our last earnings call. The U.K. vote to exit the EU created and meted uncertainty and volatility in capital markets throughout the world. However, over the last month, we have seen a recovery from the initial surprise of the event. Although it is too soon to predict the ultimate effects of the U.K.'s  decision, it will have implications for some of our clients. In any circumstance, Brexit will likely lead to a multiyear period of uncertainty. MMC's top priority remains supporting our clients and colleagues in the U.K. and throughout Europe. Our clients will need advise around key issues such as changes in regulatory perspectives on capital requirements, cross-border implications for employee benefit programs, work visa arrangements and the need to restructure U.K. operations in light of negotiations on passport-ing and the free movement of people. We are uniquely positioned to guide our clients through these challenges. At the same time, we are also addressing how Brexit could affect our own operations. One key question is the potential impact on the London insurance market. London is the global sector of insurance. And in our view, will likely remain so in a post-Brexit world. While underwriters will adapt over time, our geographic footprint in every EU country offers us the ability to serve clients regardless of where they are located or do business. Beyond the U.K., we have 110 offices spread throughout the remaining 27 EU member countries. Fundamentally, we operate through subsidiaries rather than branches across the EU. We capitalist tangible and we are able to place risk anywhere in the world, helping our clients avoid Brexit-related disruption around pricing terms and condition and asset-to-capacity in the market. 
In the short-term, the uncertainty in the U.K. will likely cause some clients to do projects and investments, which can impact our revenue growth in the U.K. and continental Europe. However, we believe as time passes and the political way forward becomes clearer, clients will need our help determining the best way for them to proceed strategically and structurally. Marsh and Guy Carpenter will help clients reassess their risk and insurance need as they try to protect against stress on capital and credit positions. We will also help clients monitor economic and political risks and the associated business consequences. Clients with seek Mercer's assistance with mobility and workforce planning as they consider their future organizational structures and locations. Mercer will also help with employee rewards and executive compensation design, and there may be a need for investment in asset allocation strategic advice. Oliver Wyman will play a key role hoping clients with corporate strategy, as they consider their competitive positions throughout Europe and potential need to restructure their U.K. operations. 
I also want to comment on the current state of the P&C insurance industry. The market remains stable for clients as pricing continues to decline in an orderly manner in most circumstances. Our Marsh Global REIT index continues to show mid-single-digit decreases across major products and geographies, with the steepest decline in the U.K. and the U.S. property. On the reinsurance side, we are beginning to see some moderation in rate declines, especially in U.S. pricing. Recent headlines have focused on CAT preannouncement on some of underwriters.  However, while insured natural catastrophe losses climbed over 40% in the first half of 2016, they are in line with what we have seen over the past decade. Capital remains abundant across major global markets, with surplus exceeding $1 trillion. Low interest rates are also squeezing profits for insurance carriers, as new money yields are lower than previous years. And reserve releases appear to be slowing after a decade of favorable development. Altogether, this translates into return likely below the cost of capital, net of reserve releases for a large portion of the P&C industry. We would expect this to ultimately stabilize pricing though it may take some time. To be clear, we don't anticipate industry pricing dynamics changing anytime soon. As history has shown us, some insurers will continue to write business at lower returns in declining rate environments. And in fact, we'll actually write business when rates are falling then when rates are rising. This is a topic we touched upon on our last earnings call. While there is ample capacity to place comprehensive programs at competitive prices, we believe there's an opportunity for the industry to provide greater value to clients. Success in our industry is increasingly based on delivering what matters to clients: Service; breadth of products; coverage innovation; contract certainty; claims performance; responsiveness; and yes, competitive pricing. Even in this tough market environment, underwriters continue to offer new products and services that meet a growing risk needs of our clients, and this bodes well for our industry to grow and enhance the value we deliver. 
On the health care side, we've seen recent news about proposed health insurer consolidation in the U.S. There is continued uncertainty regarding outcomes, especially in light of the recently filed DOJ lawsuits to block 2 possible mergers. Mercer will continue to be a trusted adviser regardless of the outcome of these proposed post-mergers. We will help our clients navigate all the options to design and implement benefit programs that are high quality and cost-effective for employees and their families. 
Now let me turn to our results.
MMC produced solid operating performance in the second quarter with underlying revenue growth across all 4 of our operating companies, margin expansion and 14% growth in adjusted earnings per share. MMC's revenue of $3.4 billion was the largest quarter in our history. Consolidated underwriter revenue growth was 3%, with excellent growth and profitability. Operating income rose 16% or 14% on an adjusted basis. For the 6-month period, underlying revenue growth was 4%, with margin expansion in both segments and 8% growth in adjusted earnings per share. 
Looking at Risk and Insurance Services. Second quarter revenue increased 6%, with both Marsh and Guy Carpenter contributing. Underlying revenue growth was 2%. Adjusted operating income increased double digits, with the margin expanding 120 basis points to 26.8%, our highest second quarter margin since 1988. 
I'm excited about the addition of top-flight leadership talent into RIS, reporting to Peter Zaffino. There are no finer P&C executives than John Doyle, the President of Marsh; and Peter Hearn, the President and CEO of Guy Carpenter. I am certain that John and Peter will have a positive impact on MMC. 
I'd like to give a special acknowledgment to Alex Moczarski and thank him for his leadership of Guy Carpenter over the past 5 years. We all look forward to working with Alex in his role as Chairman of MMC International. 
The Consulting segment also delivered a strong quarter with revenue increasing 4%. On an underlying basis, revenue grew 5% with both Mercer and Oliver Wyman producing solid underlying revenue growth. Adjusted operating income increased double-digit and the adjusted operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 18.7%, the segment's highest second quarter margin in over 30 years. 
In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter results. We are a trusted adviser, helping our clients addressing the issues of the day relating to risk, strategy and people. Demand for our advice and services increases in a world filled with uncertainty. We have a leadership team that ahs proven its ability to grow revenue, expand margins and improve earnings each year over multiple years. And we have the financial strength and resources to manage through periods of stress and capitalize on opportunities. 
Notwithstanding the headlines and the noise in the market, we expect to deliver another year of excellent financial performance in 2016. 
For the full year, we continue to expect underlying revenue growth within the 3% to 5% range that we have operated in for the past 6 years, meaningful margin expansion in both segments and strong EPS growth at a level approaching our long-term target of 13%. All this while continuing to invest in our future and return capital to shareholders through dividends and substantial share repurchases. With that, let me turn it over to Mark to review our second quarter results in more detail."

In the second quarter, MMC delivered strong results, driven by underlying revenue growth in each of our operating companies while continuing to actively manage expenses. Overall revenue was up 5% and underlying revenue increased 3%. Adjusted operating income increased by double digits and our overall margin expanded by 190 basis points. GAAP EPS rose 17% to $0.90 and adjusted EPS increased 14% to $0.91. 
Looking at risk and insurance services, second quarter revenue was $1.8 billion, with underlying growth of 2%. Adjusted operating income increased 11% to $493 million with a margin expanding 140 basis points to 26.8%. 
At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of 6%. The top line was bolstered by quality acquisition such as in the U.K. and continued activity with Marsh & McLennan agency. On an underlying basis, revenue rose 2%; underlying growth was 4% in the international division; EMEA increased a solid 3% with growth across all regions; Asia Pacific was up 2% in Latin America had a strong growth of 11%; and the U.S./Canada division, underlying revenue was flat. We continue to see pressure in Canada and in parts of the U.S., largely driven by commodity-related headwinds. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $285 million, an increase of 3% on both a recorded and underlying basis. Another good performance. Growth was highlighted by strong new business across Asia Pacific, EMEA and Global Specialties. Guy Carpenter has produced positive underlying revenue growth and 28 in the past 30 quarters. 
In the Consulting segment, revenue rose 4% to $1.5 billion or 5% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 18% to $288 million and the adjusted operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 18.7%. 
Mercer's revenue increased 3% to $1.1 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 4%. Solid growth in the quarter reflects the benefits of the diversified portfolio. Investments and talent both rose 6%, health increased 5% and retirement was up 2%. 
All major geographic regions contributed led by growth market. Oliver Wyman continued to perform well. Revenue was $460 million, reflecting solid growth of 5% on both the reported and underlying basis. Growth was well distributed with particular strength in Europe and other international markets. 
In the third quarter, we expect to see a decline in underlying revenue from Oliver Wyman. This is driven by comparisons of very strong growth in the financial services practice last year as well as global growth concerns exacerbated by Brexit uncertainty. 
As Dan said, we continue to expect that for 2016, we will generate underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, increased operating margins in both segments and strong growth in earnings per share.
Let's make a few comments about our global retirement plan. We normally discuss the outlook for retirement plan expense after we have completed the annual year-end measurement process. However, given the decline in the interest rate, we want to share some thought that might be helpful to investors. We monitor our retirement program on an ongoing basis. Previously, we discussed several changes that reduced the sensitivity of our retirement expense to interest rates. As we have said many times, we view retirement expenses as just 1 component of overall expense, which we actively manage. We have been effectively mitigating retirement plan volatility and limiting the impact to shareholders over the past couple of years. Based on where we stand today, we expect to do so in 2017. 
Moving to Investment income. We recognized $1 million in the second quarter, a decrease from $3 million a year ago. For 2016, we expect to generate only modest investment income compared with $38 million we reported in 2015. 
On our last earnings call, we estimated the impact from foreign exchange would be de minimis for the remainder of 2016. As expected, the effect of foreign exchange in adjusted EPS was negligible in the second quarter, and our outlook for the rest of the year has not changed. There has been recent volatility in the British pound. The weakening of the pound has a minimal overall impact to MMC. This is because RIS have a natural hedge crated by U.S. dollar placements in London. While the weakening -- while the impact of the weakening pound to MMC in total was not significant, there would be a benefit to RIS offset by an adverse impact to consulting. 
Our tax rate fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter, reflecting the geographic mix of earnings, tax elements, completion of open tax years and other items. Our adjusted tax rate in the second quarter was 29.1% compared to 27.4% in the same quarter last year. Through the first half of the year, our adjusted tax rate was 28.8% compared with 28.5% in last year's first half. 
Based on the current landscape, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29% for the remainder of 2016.
Corporate debt at June 30 was $4.8 billion, which declined from $5 billion at the end of the first quarter with the reduction in commercial paper outstanding. The term structure of our debt portfolio provides us flexibility with modest near-term repayment obligations. Our net debt maturity is $250 million of senior notes due next April. 
In the second quarter, we repurchased 3.5 million shares of our stock for $225 million. For 6 months, we used $425 million to buy back 7 million shares. The second quarter marks the 17th consecutive quarter we have bought back our stock, and we have reduced shares outstanding 9 quarters in a row. Since announcing our commitment to reduce our annual share count at Investor Day, in March 2014, shares outstanding have declined by 30 million or 5%. Our cash position at the end of the second quarter was $974 million, with approximately $170 million in the U.S. Uses of cash in the second quarter included $225 million for share repurchases, $165 million for dividends and $47 million for acquisitions. 
For the first 6 months, uses of cash included $425 million for share repurchases, $326 million for dividends and $168 million for acquisitions. 
For the full year 2016, we continue to expect to deploy roughly $2.3 billion of capital through dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and investments. We also expect to deliver on our annual capital return commitments to reduce our share count and increase our dividend per share by double digits. 
And with that, I'm happy to turn it back over to Dan."

Strong organic growth in all major geographies. Some of the highlights were Latin America. We had 11% underlying organic growth and also over 15% new business growth. We had some real strong performances in Asia, and in EMEA having 3% growth in the second quarter, was terrific. And it was led by strong new business in Continental Europe. If you go and shift into the U.S. and Canada. Again, each quarter is really quite different. Overall, we're not pleased with a 0% growth in the quarter. But it is just 1 quarter. The fundamentals of the business are sound. What are still some of the fundamentals look out a certainly the renewal book. And we look at client retention, it was at historic highs. We've done really well. Strong new business. The challenges we had are really tough comparable year-on-year in the business in U.S./Canada division. It was a record in second quarter 2015. We had a lot more nonrecurring new business that we have had historically. We matched that new business in  this particular quarter, but it was hard to grow year-over-year. And that nonrecurring business that have an impact of not having renewal line grow as much as we have seen in the past. The division continues to be challenged by Canada, which is particularly exposed to commodity prices. We talked about this in the past. Project work which does a little bit of a new business. And despite the cash that we saw in Canada in the quarter, insurance pricing is still a headwind. And then just one last comment on another variable, Dan mentioned it in his opening comments is that while the rate decreases are orderly, they sequentially have increased a little bit on the property side in the U.S. And that had a little bit of an impact as well. But again, I look at client retention, new business and the underlying performance of the fundamentals. And I think U.S. and Canada will do well as it has historically when we look at the full year."

And so when we look at the expansion of the margins, it's been pretty consistent over multiple years. I was just looking the other day in the second quarter over a 5-year period, the margin for RIS is up almost 500 basis points. And for consulting, about 600 basis points.

I don't know whether that's going to be the case this year or not. Our pipelines are actually pretty good. But we're a disciplined acquirer.

Thank you, and thanks for the question. As we talked about in the past, I mean, Marsh is a pretty  broad business and gives us a lot of different opportunities to align margin expansion and ensure that our top line and our expense growth has a lot of air between them over sustainable periods of time. And so you see things that we make conscious decisions like disinvesting and things that don't give us the margin expansion or sustainability across the contribution into the future. One of the more primary recent examples of that is when we decided to disinvest in our DC record keeping business and strike up a strategic relationship with a partner that we can continue to have as part of a bundled solution into the future. And we continue to make active decisions like that. Our continued efficiency in our consultancy and administration businesses is really bolstered around a disciplined around higher utilization and use of off shoring is another example of what we do to continue to drive efficiency and air between expenses and revenue. Also the evolving mix of our business. I mean, there's no question that as you look at the improvements in operating leverage, you see businesses that have that operating leverage being more significant part of our mix, and that's going to have a sustainable impact over the long run. And our continuous portfolio review is also a part of our discipline now, and we accelerate those things to give us margin accretiveness and decelerate those things that don't. So it's really a lot about being very disciplined around ensuring that we are building the business that can have strength, both in the top line and on the bottom line, as we continue to grow. And I just also want to mention that importantly, our overall focus is still to increase and grow earnings. And we're confident that with the actions that we've taken and the actions that we continue to take, that we'll be successful in doing just that."

Well, yes, you're right when you're looking at the overall revenue growth in U.S. and Canada that is inclusive of acquisitions. And in fact, Marsh had a strong quarter on overall growth.

So yes, there is -- when you have an active acquisition strategy, then clearly, the combination of active acquisition performance and efficiencies gained through acquisitions, combined with organic would have an impact on margins. I think it's important. We talk about margins and we all recognize around the stable that margins are in important feature. Margin expansion is an important feature of us delivering on our long-term CAGR of EPS of 13%.

But overall, I got to tell you, marsh & McLennan agency has been a headwind for margin expansion for this segment. When you look at the amortization that we have added over a number of years, the net operating income margins of MMA now are lower than the margins for  greater -- than greater segment. So from that perspective, overtime, that will be, more of a tailwind as the amortization schedule falls off. But fundamentally, MMA has not been a help to Peter and his team on margins. And Peter and his team has proven -- because even if you look over the last number of years, we're getting about the 2% growth within Marsh in the last couple of quarters. Marsh over a number of years has averaged about 3%, which is really at the lower end of organic or underlying growth where we would expect to have any reasonable amount of margin expansion. But we -- knowing where we're going to be looking out into the future where we're likely to be and planning for it allows us to manage our expenses very carefully to where in virtually every corner, over revenue growth exceeds our expense growth. And when it doesn't, it's purposeful. We know it, we plan for it and we decide to do it. And so we're not holding up to the fact that we always have to happen that way. In fact Peter and I talk all the time that for the right opportunities, organic or  recruitment wise, we will always go into the tank expense wise to build a better business. And so that is part of what we are willing to do. But we're seeking for those opportunities. They don't unveil themselves all that often.

However, quarter-to-quarter, there'll be a fair bit of volatility and the reasons for that is that the majority of our revenues are nonrecurring, and we need to generate them as new business every year. So in any one quarter, we can have very strong growth like you've seen in the first quarter of this year or through 2014. But we can also have some downside volatility. In addition to that, we had a few very strong years in Oliver Wyman, setting up some pretty tough comparables for us. But in the third quarter, we will see a decline and that comes primarily from our Financial Services business, which has grown even faster than Oliver Wyman overall. And beyond Financial Services, we're feeling only a modest slowdown at this point across the portfolio, driven by the slower economic growth expectation, exacerbated a little bit by Brexit. So we still see very little to suggest this is any structural weakness and the business still feels very sound. So we're expecting to dip to be short-term. Although it may take 1 quarter or 2 to work out."

I think there's a lot of continued uncertainty, of course, around Brexit and the short as well as long-term implications of such. In the early days, as you can imagine, there's a significant amount of discussions that are taking place with our primary client around things like workforce planning, what's going to happen if migrant issues are resolved one way or the other, what potentially could happen in terms of the investment strategy going forward for pensions. And all of that we are actively involve in. Throughout those discussions you can imagine a bit of a slowdown in terms of that discretionary spend until the path is clear. And we  totally have an opportunity to propose some strategy on how to go forward. But let me clarify that increased uncertainty and market volatility will likely create some opportunities for us. And as clients are going to look for advice, of course, to manage in that uncertain world and through the issues. So in the longer-term, we'll look to develop these solutions to continue to meet these emerging needs.

As we said in our 10-K, roughly 50 basis points of discount rate change will have a $35 million or so impact on earnings. The comments -- the recently included -- the comments on pensions because it is so ask a lot of questions from investors and try to pick up a newspaper without reading something about it given little interest rate environment. So we just wanted to share where -- how we're  thinking about it right now and one to highlight what I just talked about that we are less sensitive today to interest rate volatility than we were. And if you go back a couple of years ago, we closed our largest benefit plan in the U.K. We closed our Irish plant. We need the changes that we talked about to our U.S. plans. sensitivity so that's a factoring and you remember what really matters is the interest rate environment at the end of the year. So although we've seen a drop in rates here in the first half of the year, just in the U.S. in the last couple of weeks, rates have come back a little bit, and asset value have actually come back off their post-Brexit lows. And so how we're looking at this, we're at the very beginning of our planning process. And as I said a few minutes ago, pension expense is just one element of an overall expense rate base that we manage very actively and we manage to deliver great results. And so given where we are in the year, we could see this coming. We could plan under a number of scenarios. And based on where we see things today, we expect we'll be able to limit the impact of pension volatility on earnings just we have for the last couple of years."

And considering should I actually join an industry that looks like it's going to the . The reality is that an increasingly complex world, the need for advice rises. And these were once transactional businesses. Now they are principally advisory businesses with transactional capability. Big, big difference. So I would say overall level risk of disintermediation is quite low. That's not saying that does not ways of creating distribution that we as a company have to be very focused on whether it's digital, whether it's online, whether it's worksite. There's different ways of getting to our client base, and we had to be very open to the idea. And clearly, as some parts of the segments, I feel that you'll have multi channels, right? Whether you look at motor or homeowners or maybe even small commercial. You'll end up having multi channels which means brokers, remain direct affinity there will be many different avenues for clients to be satisfied. The key is, what's the client experience, who provides the best level of comprehensive client experienced in a little bit less about was the capital line it. It's more about experience. Announces and with the thought as well because I recently took a trip into a country which was always very much on our broker market, which is beginning to turn more and more into a broker market. The reality is that more parts of the world have become brokers because the terms and conditions enterprising are better and markets in which brokers are active than in where brokers are not active. And so I feel pretty comfortable that we're positioned well. But not securing our position in the market. We have to always find ways of doing things better or else, yes, we would get this intermediated reps with other intermediaries but the always have the table in our toasted do things better.

Before moving onto our results, I thought I would spend a few minutes on Brexit, adding to my comments from our last earnings call. The U.K. vote to exit the EU created immediate uncertainty and volatility in capital markets throughout the world. However, over the last month, we have seen a recovery from the initial surprise of the event. Although it is too soon to predict the ultimate effects of the U.K.'s decision, it will have implications for some of our clients. In any circumstance, Brexit will likely lead to a multiyear period of uncertainty. MMC's top priority remains supporting our clients and colleagues in the U.K. and throughout Europe. Our clients will need advise around key issues, such as changes in regulatory perspectives on capital requirements, cross-border implications for employee benefit programs, work visa arrangements and the need to restructure U.K. operations in light of negotiations on passporting and the free movement of people. We are uniquely positioned to guide our clients through these challenges. At the same time, we are also addressing how Brexit could affect our own operations. One key question is the potential impact on the London insurance market. London is the global center of insurance and, in our view, will likely remain so in a post-Brexit world. While underwriters will adapt over time, our geographic footprint in every EU country offers us the ability to serve clients regardless of where they are located or do business. Beyond the U.K., we have 110 offices spread throughout the remaining 27 EU member countries. Fundamentally, we operate through subsidiaries rather than branches across the EU. We view capital as fungible, and we are able to place risk anywhere in the world, helping our clients avoid Brexit-related disruption around pricing terms and conditions and assets to capacity in the market.
In the short-term, the uncertainty in the U.K. will likely cause some clients to defer projects and investments, which can impact our revenue growth in the U.K. and Continental Europe. However, we believe as time passes and the political way forward becomes clearer, clients will need our help determining the best way for them to proceed strategically and structurally. Marsh and Guy Carpenter will help clients reassess their risk and insurance needs as they try to protect against stress on capital and credit positions. We will also help clients monitor economic and political risks and the associated business consequences. Clients will seek Mercer's assistance with mobility and workforce planning as they consider their future organizational structures and locations. Mercer will also help with employee rewards and executive compensation design, and there may be a need for investment in asset allocation strategic advice. Oliver Wyman will play a key role helping clients with corporate strategy as they consider their competitive positioning throughout Europe and potential need to restructure their U.K. operations.
I also want to comment on the current state of the P&C insurance industry. The market remains favorable for clients as pricing continues to decline in an orderly manner in most circumstances. Our Marsh Global REIT Index continues to show mid-single-digit decreases across major products and geographies with the steepest declines in the U.K. and U.S. property. On the reinsurance side, we are beginning to see some moderation in rate declines, especially in U.S. pricing. Recent headlines have focused on CAT preannouncement among underwriters. However, while insured natural catastrophe losses climbed over 40% in the first half of 2016, they are in line with what we have seen over the past decade. Capital remains abundant across major global markets with surplus exceeding $1 trillion. Low interest rates are also squeezing profits for insurance carriers as new money yields are lower than previous years. And reserve releases appear to be slowing after a decade of favorable development. Altogether, this translates into returns likely below the cost of capital, net of reserve releases, for a large portion of the P&C industry. We would expect this to ultimately stabilize pricing, though it may take some time. To be clear, we don't anticipate industry pricing dynamics changing anytime soon. As history has shown us, some insurers will continue to write business at lower returns in declining rate environments. And in fact, we'll actually write more new business when rates are falling than when rates are rising. This is a topic we touched upon on our last earnings call. While there is ample capacity to place comprehensive programs at competitive prices, we believe there is an opportunity for the industry to provide greater value to clients. Success in our industry is increasingly based on delivering what matters to clients: service; breadth of products; coverage innovation; contract certainty; claims performance; responsiveness; and yes, competitive pricing. Even in this tough market environment, underwriters continue to offer new products and services that meet the growing risk needs of our clients, and this bodes well for our industry to grow and enhance the value we deliver.
On the health care side, we've seen recent news about proposed health insurer consolidation in the U.S. There is continued uncertainty regarding outcomes, especially in light of the recently filed DOJ lawsuits to block 2 possible mergers. Mercer will continue to be a trusted adviser regardless of the outcome of these proposed mergers. We will help our clients navigate all the options to design and implement benefit programs that are high quality and cost-effective for employees and their families.
Now let me turn to our results. MMC produced solid operating performance in the second quarter with underlying revenue growth across all 4 of our operating companies, margin expansion and 14% growth in adjusted earnings per share. MMC's revenue of $3.4 billion was the largest quarter in our history. Consolidated underlying revenue growth was 3% with excellent growth and profitability. Operating income rose 16% or 14% on an adjusted basis. For the 6-month period, underlying revenue growth was 4% with margin expansion in both segments and 8% growth in adjusted earnings per share.
Looking at Risk and Insurance Services. Second quarter revenue increased 6% with both Marsh and Guy Carpenter contributing. Underlying revenue growth was 2%. Adjusted operating income increased double digits with the margin expanding 140 basis points to 26.8%, our highest second quarter margin since 1988.
I'm excited about the addition of top-flight leadership talent into RIS, reporting to Peter Zaffino. There are no finer P&C executives than John Doyle, the President of Marsh; and Peter Hearn, the President and CEO of Guy Carpenter. I am certain that John and Peter will have a positive impact on MMC.
I would like to give a special acknowledgment to Alex Moczarski and thank him for his leadership of Guy Carpenter over the past 5 years. We all look forward to working with Alex in his role as Chairman, MMC International.
The Consulting segment also delivered a strong quarter with revenue increasing 4%. On an underlying basis, revenue grew 5% with both Mercer and Oliver Wyman producing solid underlying revenue growth. Adjusted operating income increased double digits and the adjusted operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 18.7%, the segment's highest second quarter margin in over 30 years.
In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter results. We are a trusted adviser, helping our clients address the issues of the day relating to risk, strategy and people. Demand for our advice and services increases in a world filled with uncertainty. We have a leadership team that has proven its ability to grow revenue, expand margins and improve earnings each year over multiple years. And we have the financial strength and resources to manage through periods of stress and capitalize on opportunities.
Notwithstanding the headlines and the noise in the market, we expect to deliver another year of excellent financial performance in 2016.
For the full year, we continue to expect underlying revenue growth within the 3% to 5% range that we have operated in for the past 6 years, meaningful margin expansion in both segments and strong EPS growth at a level approaching our long-term target of 13%. All this while continuing to invest in our future and return capital to shareholders through dividends and substantial share repurchases.
With that, let me turn it over to Mark to review our second quarter results in more detail."

In the second quarter, MMC delivered strong results, driven by underlying revenue growth in each of our operating companies while continuing to actively manage expenses. Overall revenue was up 5% and underlying revenue increased 3%. Adjusted operating income increased by double digits, and our overall margin expanded by 190 basis points. GAAP EPS rose 17% to $0.90 and adjusted EPS increased 14% to $0.91.
Looking at risk and insurance services. Second quarter revenue was $1.8 billion with underlying growth of 2%. Adjusted operating income increased 11% to $493 million with the margin expanding 140 basis points to 26.8%.
At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of 6%. The top line was bolstered by quality acquisitions, such as Jelf in the U.K. and continued activity in Marsh & McLennan agency. On an underlying basis, revenue rose 2%. Underlying growth was 4% in the international division. EMEA increased a solid 3% with growth across all region. Asia Pacific was up 2% and Latin America had a strong growth of 11%. In the U.S./Canada division, underlying revenue was flat. We continue to see pressure in Canada and in parts of the U.S., largely driven by commodity-related headwinds. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $285 million, an increase of 3% on both a recorded and underlying basis. Another good performance. Growth was highlighted by strong new business across Asia Pacific, EMEA in Global Specialties. Guy Carpenter has produced positive underlying revenue growth in 28 of the past 30 quarters.
In the Consulting segment, revenue rose 4% to $1.5 billion or 5% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 18% to $288 million and the adjusted operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 18.7%.
Mercer's revenue increased 3% to $1.1 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 4%. Solid growth in the quarter reflects the benefits of the diversified portfolio. Investments and talent both rose 6%, health increased 5% and retirement was up 2%.
All major geographic regions contributed, led by growth market. Oliver Wyman continued to perform well. Revenue was $460 million, reflecting solid growth of 5% on both the reported and underlying basis. Growth was well distributed with particular strength in Europe and other international markets.
In the third quarter, we expect to see a decline in underlying revenue from Oliver Wyman. This is driven by comparisons to very strong growth in the financial services practice last year as well as global growth concerns exacerbated by Brexit uncertainty.
As Dan said, we continue to expect that for 2016, we will generate underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, increased operating margins in both segments and strong growth in earnings per share.
Let's take a -- make a few comments about our global retirement plan. We normally discuss the outlook for retirement plan expense after we have completed the annual year-end measurement process. However, given the declines in the interest rates, we want to share some thoughts that might be helpful to investors. We monitor our retirement programs on an ongoing basis. Previously, we discussed several changes that have reduced the sensitivity of our retirement expense to interest rates. As we have said many times, we view retirement expenses as just 1 component of overall expense, which we actively manage. We have been effectively mitigating retirement plan volatility and limiting the impact to shareholders over the past couple of years. Based on where we stand today, we expect to do so in 2017.
Moving to investment income. We recognized $1 million in the second quarter, a decrease from $3 million a year ago. For 2016, we expect to generate only modest investment income compared with $38 million we reported in 2015.
On our last earnings call, we estimated the impact from foreign exchange would be de minimis for the remainder of 2016. As expected, the effect of foreign exchange on adjusted EPS was negligible in the second quarter, and our outlook for the rest of the year has not changed. There has been recent volatility in the British pound. Weakening of the pound has minimal overall impact to MMC. This is because RIS has a natural hedge created by U.S. dollar placements in London. While the weakening of -- while the impact of a weakening pound to MMC in total was not significant, there would be a benefit to RIS, offset by an adverse impact to consulting.
Our tax rate fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter, reflecting the geographic mix of earnings, tax settlements, completion of open tax years and other items. Our adjusted tax rate in the second quarter was 29.1% compared to 27.4% in the same quarter last year. Through the first half of the year, our adjusted tax rate was 28.8% compared with 28.5% in last year's first half. Based on the current landscape, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29% for the remainder of 2016.
Corporate debt at June 30 was $4.8 billion, which declined from $5 billion at the end of the first quarter due to a reduction in commercial paper outstanding. The term structure of our debt portfolio provides us flexibility with modest near-term repayment obligations. Our net debt maturity is $250 million of senior notes due next April.
In the second quarter, we repurchased 3.5 million shares of our stock for $225 million. Through 6 months, we used $425 million to buy back 7 million shares. The second quarter marks the 17th consecutive quarter we have bought back our stock, and we have reduced shares outstanding 9 quarters in a row. Since announcing our commitment to reduce our annual share count at Investor Day in March 2014, shares outstanding have declined by 30 million or 5%. Our cash position at the end of the second quarter was $974 million with approximately $170 million in the U.S. Uses of cash in the second quarter included $225 million for share repurchases, $165 million for dividends and $47 million for acquisitions. For the first 6 months, uses of cash included $425 million for share repurchases, $326 million for dividends and $168 million for acquisitions.
For the full year 2016, we continue to expect to deploy roughly $2.3 billion of capital through dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and investments. We also expect to deliver on our annual capital return commitments to reduce our share count and increase our dividends per share by double digits.
And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan."

So it really gets a very broad array of areas in which it can grow. Wherever there is growth, we're on the ground to capture it. I think the reality as you've seen from a lot of the insurance company reporting, it's a pretty tough market out there. There is -- the P&C rating levels are under a fair amount of pressure. There's a significant amount of competition amongst brokers, et cetera, which is having an impact. But I do think you have to look at it on a mixed basis. International did quite well. U.S./Canada was under a bit more pressure. But Peter, you want to give us some more color on this?"

We had some real strong performances in Asia, and in EMEA having 3% growth in the second quarter was terrific. And it was led by strong new business in Continental Europe. If we go and shift into the U.S. and Canada, again, each quarter is really quite different. Overall, we're not pleased with 0% growth in the quarter, but it is just 1 quarter. The fundamentals of the business are sound. What are some of the fundamentals we look out are certainly the renewal book. And we look at client retention, it was at historic highs. We've done really well, strong new business. The challenges we had are really tough comparable year-on-year on new business in the U.S./Canada division. It was a record in second quarter 2015. We had a lot more nonrecurring new business than we have had historically. We matched that new business in this particular quarter, but it was hard to grow year-over-year. And that nonrecurring business did have an impact of not having the renewal line grow as much as we've seen in the past. The division continues to be challenged by Canada, which is particularly exposed to commodity prices. We've talked about this in the past. Project work, which does mute a little bit of a new business. And despite the cash that we saw in Canada in the quarter, insurance pricing is still a headwind. And then just one last comment on another variable, Dan mentioned it in his opening comments, is that while the rate decreases are orderly, they sequentially have increased a little bit on the property side in the U.S. And that had a little bit of an impact as well. But again, I look at client retention, new business and the underlying performance of the fundamentals, and I think U.S. and Canada will do well as it has historically when we look at the full year."

I'll just remind everybody that we don't have any budget with regard to acquisitions. We look at a lot of things, we cultivate a lot of relationships, and we have a lot of conversations. We don't do very much at all, even over the past years. We've had a string of pearl strategy, and we are continuing on that basis. So acquisitions by their very nature are going to be lumpy. In some years, we're going to have lots of them, and some years, we won't have that much. I can tell you the back half of last year was more active than the first half of last year. I don't know whether that's going to be the case this year or not. Our pipelines are actually pretty good. But we're a disciplined acquirer. And so what I can say is that if acquisitions are lighter-than-normal in any given year, we're not seeking to build cash on our balance sheet. So we would use that -- those funds in other ways of creating value, whether that's organic investments through strategic recruitment, whether that is increased share repurchases. That is -- those are essentially avenues that we would take to make sure we're putting our cash to work."

As we've talked about in the past, I mean, Mercer is a pretty broad business and gives us a lot of different opportunities to align margin expansion and ensure that our top line and our expense growth has a lot of air between them over sustainable periods of time. And so you see things that we make conscious decisions like disinvesting and things that don't give us the margin expansion or sustainability of profit contribution into the future. One of the more primary recent examples of that is when we decided to disinvest in our DC record keeping business and strike up a strategic relationship with a partner that we can continue to have as part of a bundled solution into the future. And we continue to make active decisions like that. Our continued efficiency in our consultancy and administration businesses is really posted around a discipline, around higher utilization. Use of offshoring is another example of what we do to continue to drive efficiency and air between expenses and revenue. Also, the evolving mix of our business. I mean, there's no question that as you look at the improvements in operating leverage, you see businesses that have that operating leverage being more significant part of our mix, and that's going to have a sustainable impact over the long run. And our continuous portfolio review is also a part of our discipline now, and we accelerate those things to give us margin accretiveness, and we decelerate those things that don't. So it's really a lot about being very disciplined around ensuring that we are building a business that can have strength, both in the top line and the bottom line as we continue to grow. And I just also want to mention that importantly, our overall focus is still to increase and grow earnings. And we're confident that with the actions that we've taken and the actions that we continue to take, that we'll be successful in doing just that."

Well, yes, you're right when you're looking at the overall revenue growth in U.S. and Canada that is inclusive of acquisitions. And in fact, Marsh had a strong quarter on overall growth. And that really varies based upon the acquisitions which were done in the prior year. And clearly, one of the core strategic initiatives of the company since 2009 has been the development of Marsh & McLennan agency. And you can see through the contingent payments that we've made over the last several years that the agency -- many parts of agency are performing better than what our expectations were when we acquired different agents. And so yes, there is -- where you have an active acquisition strategy, then clearly, the combination of active acquisition performance and efficiencies gained through acquisitions, combined with organic, would have an impact on margins. I think it's important -- I mean, we talk about margins often, and we all recognize around this table that margins are an important feature. Margin expansion is an important feature of us delivering on our long-term CAGR of EPS of 13%. Having said that, I do want to reiterate to everybody that margins are about the last thing we talk about at an executive team level. We spent a lot of time on financial performance, organic growth strategies, acquisition strategies, people issues, risk issues.

But overall, I got to tell you, Marsh & McLennan agency has been a headwind for margin expansion for this segment. We -- when you look at the amortization that we have added over a number of years, the net operating income margins of MMA now are lower than the margins for greater -- the greater segment. And so from that perspective, over time, that will become more of a tailwind as the amortization schedule falls off. But fundamentally, MMA has not been a help to Peter and his team on margins. And Peter and his team have proven -- because even if you look over the last number of years, we're getting about the 2% growth within Marsh through last couple of quarters. Marsh over a number of years has averaged about 3%, which is really at the lower end of organic or underlying growth where we would expect to have any reasonable amount of margin expansion. But we -- knowing where we're going to be looking out into the future where we're likely to be and planning for it allows us to manage our expenses very carefully to where in virtually every corner, our revenue growth exceeds our expense growth. And when it doesn't, it's purposeful. We know it, we plan for it, and we decide to do it. And so we're not holding to the fact it always have to happen that way. In fact, Peter and I talk all the time that for the right opportunities, organic or recruitment wise, we will always go into the tank expense wise to build a better business. And so that is part of what we are willing to do. But we're seeking for those opportunities. They don't unveil themselves all that often. So the net effect of running the business on a consistent basis where revenue growth exceeds expense growth means we'll always have margin expansion."

I mean, Oliver Wyman is a strong business, and we're very confident that over time, we can grow it at mid- to high single digits as we've indicated consistently. However, quarter-to-quarter, there'll be a fair bit of volatility, and the reason for that is the majority of our revenues are nonrecurring, and we need to generate them as new business every year. So in any one quarter, we can have very strong growth like you've seen in the first quarter of this year or through 2014. But we can also have some downside volatility. In addition to that, we've had a few very strong years in Oliver Wyman setting up some pretty tough comparables for us. But in the third quarter, we will see a decline, and that comes primarily from our Financial Services business, which has grown even faster than Oliver Wyman overall. And beyond Financial Services, we're feeling only a modest slowdown at this point across the portfolio, driven by the slower economic growth expectations, exacerbated a little bit by Brexit. And we still see very little to suggest this is any structural weakness, and the business still feels very sound. So we're expecting to dip to be short-term, although it may take 1 quarter or 2 to work out."

So we just wanted to share where -- how we're thinking about it right now, and one is to highlight what I just talked about, that we are less sensitive today to interest rate volatility than we were. And if you go back a couple of years ago, we closed our largest benefit plan in the U.K. We closed our Irish plant. We need the changes that we talked about to our U.S. plans. We have less sensitivity, so that's factoring. Remember, what really matters is the interest rate environment at the end of the year. And so -- although we've seen a drop in rates here in the first half of the year, just in the U.S. in the last couple of weeks, rates have come back a little bit, and asset values have actually come back off their post-Brexit lows. And so how we're looking at this? We're at the very beginning of our planning process. And as I said a few minutes ago, pension expense is just one element of an overall expense base that we manage very actively, and we manage to deliver great results. And so given where we are in the year, we could see this coming. We can plan under a number of scenarios.

We're such a different company than we were back in 1988 that unloads to create those comparison, even though we write them into our script. I would say we're better than in at anytime in our history. Because when I look back in 1988, if you look at total RIS, it was $1.3 billion of revenue. I mean, we are multiple times larger and more diverse geographically, line of business, quality, et cetera. And so this is the new world. I don't set margin targets. Peter doesn't as well. We don't believe in them. We believe that there's something about the human brain that looks at a target as something to reach and then draw back from. So I would not put any hurdle out there as to what this business could do and how it could perform. I do know that I'm quite confident that the leading factor in how we will do over time is organic growth. And if we have good levels of organic growth, we will have good levels of margin expansion period. If we don't have that organic growth, then all of our annual and multiyear search for efficiency, obviously, that never ends, and we have found different ways of running this business through structure, through the layering, through technology, through better levels of client connectivity to create more ability for us to service clients on an efficient basis.

And considering should I actually join an industry that looks like it's going to go the way of the dodo bird. The reality is in an increasingly complex world, the need for advice rises. And these were once transactional businesses, now they are principally advisory businesses with transactional capability. Big, big difference. And so I would say overall level risk of disintermediation is quite low. That's not saying that there's not ways of creating distribution that we as a company have to be very focused on, whether it's digital, whether it's online, whether it's work site. There's different ways of getting to our client base, and we have to be very open to the idea. And clearly, in some parts of segments, I feel you'll have multichannels, right? Whether you look at motor or homeowners or maybe even small commercial, you'll end up having multichannels, which means brokers, there will be direct, there will be affinity, there will be many different avenues for clients to be satisfied. The key is what's the client's experience, who provides the best level of comprehensive client experience, a little bit less about what's the capital behind it is. It's more about experience. And I would just end with the thought as well because I recently took a trip into a country which was always very much a nonbroker market, which is beginning to turn more and more into a brokered market. The reality is that more parts of the world have become brokers because the terms and conditions and the pricing are better in markets in which brokers are active than in where brokers are not active. And so I feel pretty comfortable that we're positioned well, but not securing our position in the market. We have to always find ways of doing things better, or else, yes, we won't get disintermediated, perhaps, by another intermediary, but we always have to stay on toes and do things better.

Before moving on to our results, I thought I would spend a few minutes on Brexit, adding to my comments from our last earnings call. The U.K. vote to exit the EU created immediate uncertainty and volatility in capital markets throughout the world. However, over the last month, we have seen a recovery from the initial surprise of the event. Although it is too soon to predict the ultimate effects of the U.K.'s decision, it will have implications for some of our clients. In any circumstance, Brexit will likely lead to a multiyear period of uncertainty. MMC's top priority remains supporting our clients and colleagues in the U.K. and throughout Europe. Our clients will need advice around key issues such as changes in regulatory perspectives on capital requirements, cross-border implications for employee benefit programs, work visa arrangements and the need to restructure U.K. operations in light of negotiations on passporting and the free movement of people. We are uniquely positioned to guide our clients through these challenges. At the same time, we are also addressing how Brexit could affect our own operations. One key question is the potential impact on the London insurance market. London is the global center of insurance and, in our view, will likely remain so in a post-Brexit world. While underwriters will adapt over time, our geographic footprint in every EU country offers us the ability to serve clients regardless of where they are located or do business. Beyond the U.K., we have 110 offices spread throughout the remaining 27 EU member countries. Fundamentally, we operate through subsidiaries rather than branches across the EU. We view capital as fungible, and we are able to place risk anywhere in the world, helping our clients avoid Brexit-related disruption around pricing terms and conditions and assets to capacity in the market.
In the short-term, the uncertainty in the U.K. will likely cause some clients to defer projects and investments, which can impact our revenue growth in the U.K. and Continental Europe. However, we believe as time passes and the political way forward becomes clearer, clients will need our help determining the best way for them to proceed strategically and structurally. Marsh and Guy Carpenter will help clients reassess their risk and insurance needs as they try to protect against stress on capital and credit positions. We will also help clients monitor economic and political risks and the associated business consequences. Clients will seek Mercer's assistance with mobility and workforce planning as they consider their future organizational structures and locations. Mercer will also help with employee rewards and executive compensation design, and there may be a need for investment in asset allocation strategic advice. Oliver Wyman will play a key role helping clients with corporate strategy as they consider their competitive positioning throughout Europe and potential need to restructure their U.K. operations.
I also want to comment on the current state of the P&C insurance industry. The market remains favorable for clients as pricing continues to decline in an orderly manner in most circumstances. Our Marsh Global REIT Index continues to show mid-single-digit decreases across major products and geographies with the steepest declines in the U.K. and U.S. property. On the reinsurance side, we are beginning to see some moderation in rate declines, especially in U.S. pricing. Recent headlines have focused on CAT preannouncement among underwriters. However, while insured natural catastrophe losses climbed over 40% in the first half of 2016, they are in line with what we have seen over the past decade. Capital remains abundant across major global markets with surplus exceeding $1 trillion. Low interest rates are also squeezing profits for insurance carriers as new money yields are lower than previous years. And reserve releases appear to be slowing after a decade of favorable development. Altogether, this translates into returns likely below the cost of capital, net of reserve releases, for a large portion of the P&C industry. We would expect this to ultimately stabilize pricing, though it may take some time. To be clear, we don't anticipate industry pricing dynamics changing anytime soon. As history has shown us, some insurers will continue to write business at lower returns in declining rate environments. And in fact, will actually write more new business when rates are falling than when rates are rising. This is a topic we touched upon on our last earnings call. While there is ample capacity to place comprehensive programs at competitive prices, we believe there is an opportunity for the industry to provide greater value to clients. Success in our industry is increasingly based on delivering what matters to clients: service; breadth of products; coverage innovation; contract certainty; claims performance; responsiveness; and yes, competitive pricing. Even in this tough market environment, underwriters continue to offer new products and services that meet the growing risk needs of our clients, and this bodes well for our industry to grow and enhance the value we deliver.
On the health care side, we've seen recent news about proposed health insurer consolidation in the U.S. There is continued uncertainty regarding outcomes, especially in light of the recently filed DOJ lawsuits to block 2 possible mergers. Mercer will continue to be a trusted adviser regardless of the outcome of these proposed mergers. We will help our clients navigate all the options to design and implement benefit programs that are high quality and cost-effective for employees and their families.
Now let me turn to our results. MMC produced solid operating performance in the second quarter with underlying revenue growth across all 4 of our operating companies, margin expansion and 14% growth in adjusted earnings per share. MMC's revenue of $3.4 billion was the largest quarter in our history. Consolidated underlying revenue growth was 3% with excellent growth and profitability. Operating income rose 16% or 14% on an adjusted basis. For the 6-month period, underlying revenue growth was 4% with margin expansion in both segments and 8% growth in adjusted earnings per share.
Looking at Risk and Insurance Services. Second quarter revenue increased 6% with both Marsh and Guy Carpenter contributing. Underlying revenue growth was 2%. Adjusted operating income increased double digits with the margin expanding 140 basis points to 26.8%, our highest second quarter margin since 1988.
I'm excited about the addition of top-flight leadership talent into RIS reporting to Peter Zaffino. There are no finer P&C executives than John Doyle, the President of Marsh; and Peter Hearn, the President and CEO of Guy Carpenter. I am certain that John and Peter will have a positive impact on MMC.
I would like to give a special acknowledgment to Alex Moczarski and thank him for his leadership of Guy Carpenter over the past 5 years. We all look forward to working with Alex in his role as Chairman, MMC International.
The Consulting segment also delivered a strong quarter with revenue increasing 4%. On an underlying basis, revenue grew 5% with both Mercer and Oliver Wyman producing solid underlying revenue growth. Adjusted operating income increased double digits and the adjusted operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 18.7%, the segment's highest second quarter margin in over 30 years.
In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter results. We are a trusted adviser, helping our clients address the issues of the day relating to risk, strategy and people. Demand for our advice and services increases in a world filled with uncertainty. We have a leadership team that has proven its ability to grow revenue, expand margins and improve earnings each year over multiple years. And we have the financial strength and resources to manage through periods of stress and capitalize on opportunities.
Notwithstanding the headlines and the noise in the market, we expect to deliver another year of excellent financial performance in 2016.
For the full year, we continue to expect underlying revenue growth within the 3% to 5% range that we have operated in for the past 6 years, meaningful margin expansion in both segments and strong EPS growth at a level approaching our long-term target of 13%. All this while continuing to invest in our future and return capital to shareholders through dividends and substantial share repurchases.
With that, let me turn it over to Mark to review our second quarter results in more detail."

In the second quarter, MMC delivered strong results, driven by underlying revenue growth in each of our operating companies while continuing to actively manage expenses. Overall revenue was up 5% and underlying revenue increased 3%. Adjusted operating income increased by double digits, and our overall margin expanded by 190 basis points. GAAP EPS rose 17% to $0.90 and adjusted EPS increased 14% to $0.91.
Looking at risk and insurance services. Second quarter revenue was $1.8 billion with underlying growth of 2%. Adjusted operating income increased 11% to $493 million with the margin expanding 140 basis points to 26.8%.
At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of 6%. The top line was bolstered by quality acquisitions, such as Jelf in the U.K. and continued activity in Marsh & McLennan agency. On an underlying basis, revenue rose 2%. Underlying growth was 4% in the international division. EMEA increased a solid 3% with growth across all region. Asia Pacific was up 2% and Latin America had a strong growth of 11%. In the U.S./Canada division, underlying revenue was flat. We continue to see pressure in Canada and in parts of the U.S., largely driven by commodity-related headwinds. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $285 million, an increase of 3% on both a recorded and underlying basis. Another good performance. Growth was highlighted by strong new business across Asia Pacific, EMEA and Global Specialties. Guy Carpenter has produced positive underlying revenue growth in 28 of the past 30 quarters.
In the Consulting segment, revenue rose 4% to $1.5 billion or 5% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 18% to $288 million and the adjusted operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 18.7%.
Mercer's revenue increased 3% to $1.1 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 4%. Solid growth in the quarter reflects the benefits of the diversified portfolio. Investments and talent both rose 6%, health increased 5% and retirement was up 2%.
All major geographic regions contributed, led by growth market. Oliver Wyman continued to perform well. Revenue was $460 million, reflecting solid growth of 5% on both a reported and underlying basis. Growth was well distributed with particular strength in Europe and other international markets.
In the third quarter, we expect to see a decline in underlying revenue from Oliver Wyman. This is driven by comparisons to very strong growth in the financial services practice last year as well as global growth concerns exacerbated by Brexit uncertainty.
As Dan said, we continue to expect that for 2016, we will generate underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, increased operating margins in both segments and strong growth in earnings per share.
Let's take a -- make a few comments about our global retirement plan. We normally discuss the outlook for retirement plan expense after we have completed the annual year-end measurement process. However, given the declines in global interest rates, we want to share some thoughts that might be helpful to investors. We monitor our retirement programs on an ongoing basis. Previously, we discussed several changes that have reduced the sensitivity of our retirement expense to interest rates. As we have said many times, we view retirement expenses as just 1 component of overall expense which we actively manage. We have been effectively mitigating retirement plan volatility and limiting the impact to shareholders over the past couple of years. Based on where we stand today, we expect to do so in 2017.
Moving to investment income. We recognized $1 million in the second quarter, a decrease from $3 million a year ago. For 2016, we expect to generate only modest investment income compared with $38 million we reported in 2015.
On our last earnings call, we estimated the impact from foreign exchange would be de minimis for the remainder of 2016. As expected, the effect of foreign exchange on adjusted EPS was negligible in the second quarter, and our outlook for the rest of the year has not changed. There has been recent volatility in the British pound. Weakening of the pound has minimal overall impact to MMC. This is because RIS has a natural hedge created by U.S. dollar placements in London. While the weakening of -- while the impact of a weakening pound to MMC in total is not significant, there would be a benefit to RIS, offset by an adverse impact to consulting.
Our tax rate fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter, reflecting the geographic mix of earnings, tax settlements, completion of open tax years and other items. Our adjusted tax rate in the second quarter was 29.1% compared to 27.4% in the same quarter last year. Through the first half of the year, our adjusted tax rate was 28.8% compared with 28.5% in last year's first half. Based on the current landscape, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29% for the remainder of 2016.
Corporate debt at June 30 was $4.8 billion, which declined from $5 billion at the end of the first quarter due to a reduction in commercial paper outstanding. The term structure of our debt portfolio provides us flexibility with modest near-term repayment obligations. Our next debt maturity is $250 million of senior notes due next April.
In the second quarter, we repurchased 3.5 million shares of our stock for $225 million. Through 6 months, we used $425 million to buy back 7 million shares. The second quarter marks the 17th consecutive quarter we have bought back our stock, and we have reduced shares outstanding 9 quarters in a row. Since announcing our commitment to reduce our annual share count at Investor Day in March 2014, shares outstanding have declined by 30 million or 5%. Our cash position at the end of the second quarter was $974 million with approximately $170 million in the U.S. Uses of cash in the second quarter included $225 million for share repurchases, $165 million for dividends and $47 million for acquisitions. For the first 6 months, uses of cash included $425 million for share repurchases, $326 million for dividends and $168 million for acquisitions.
For the full year 2016, we continue to expect to deploy roughly $2.3 billion of capital through dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and investments. We also expect to deliver on our annual capital return commitments to reduce our share count and increase our dividends per share by double digits.
And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan."

So it really gets a very broad array of areas in which it can grow. Wherever there is growth, we're on the ground to capture it. But I think the reality as you've seen from a lot of the insurance company reporting, it's a pretty tough market out there. There is -- the P&C rating levels are under a fair amount of pressure. There's a significant amount of competition amongst brokers, et cetera, which is having an impact. But I do think you have to look at it on a mixed basis. International did quite well. U.S./Canada was under a bit more pressure. But Peter, you want to give us some more color on this?"

Strong organic growth in all major geographies. Some of the highlights were Latin America. We had 11% underlying organic growth, but also over 15% new business growth. We had some real strong performances in Asia, and in EMEA having 3% growth in the second quarter was terrific. And it was led by strong new business in Continental Europe. If we go and shift into the U.S. and Canada, again, each quarter is really quite different. Overall, we're not pleased with 0% growth in the quarter, but it is just 1 quarter. The fundamentals of the business are sound. What are some of the fundamentals we look out are certainly the renewal book. And we look at client retention, it was at historic highs. We've done really well, strong new business. The challenges we had are really tough comparable year-on-year on new business in the U.S./Canada division. It was a record in second quarter 2015. We had a lot more nonrecurring new business than we have had historically. We matched that new business in this particular quarter, but it was hard to grow year-over-year. And that nonrecurring business did have an impact of not having the renewal line grow as much as we've seen in the past. The division continues to be challenged by Canada, which is particularly exposed to commodity prices. We've talked about this in the past. Project work, which does mute a little bit of the new business. And despite the cash that we saw in Canada in the quarter, insurance pricing is still a headwind. And then just one last comment on another variable, Dan mentioned it in his opening comments, is that while the rate decreases are orderly, they sequentially have increased a little bit on the property side in the U.S. And that had a little bit of an impact as well. But again, I look at client retention, new business and the underlying performance of the fundamentals, and I think U.S. and Canada will do well as it has historically when we look at the full year."

And so when we look at the expansion of the margins, it's been pretty consistent over multiple years. I was just looking the other day in the second quarter over a 5-year period, the margin for RIS is up almost 500 basis points, and for consulting, about 600 basis points. And so there has been a consistent level of significant margin expansion. We expect 2016 to be a good year for margin expansion despite the slow growth environment within RIS."

I don't know whether that's going to be the case this year or not. Our pipelines are actually pretty good. But we're a disciplined acquirer. And so what I can say is that if acquisitions are lighter than normal in any given year, we're not seeking to build cash on our balance sheet.

As we've talked about in the past, I mean, Mercer is a pretty broad business and gives us a lot of different opportunities to align margin expansion and ensure that our top line and our expense growth has a lot of air between them over sustainable periods of time. And so you see things that we make conscious decisions like disinvesting in things that don't give us the margin expansion or sustainability of profit contribution into the future. One of the more primary recent examples of that is when we decided to disinvest in our DC recordkeeping business and strike up a strategic relationship with a partner that we can continue to have as part of a bundled solution into the future. And we’ve continued to make active decisions like that. Our continued efficiency in our consultancy and administration businesses is really posted around a discipline, around higher utilization. Use of offshoring is another example of what we do to continue to drive efficiency and air between expenses and revenue. Also, the evolving mix of our business. I mean, there's no question that as you look at the improvement in operating leverage, you see businesses that have that operating leverage being more significant part of our mix, and that's going to have a sustainable impact over the long run. And our continuous portfolio review is also a part of our discipline now, and we accelerate those things that give us margin accretiveness, and we decelerate those things that don't. So it's really a lot about being very disciplined around ensuring that we are building a business that can have strength, both in the top line and the bottom line, as we continue to grow.

Well, yes, you're right when you're looking at the overall revenue growth in U.S. and Canada that is inclusive of acquisitions. And in fact, Marsh had a strong quarter on overall growth. And that really varies based upon the acquisitions which were done in the prior year. And clearly, one of the core strategic initiatives of the company since 2009 has been the development of Marsh & McLennan agency. And you can see through the contingent payments that we've made over the last several years that the agency -- many parts of the agency are performing better than what our expectations were when we acquired different agents. And so yes, there is -- where you have an active acquisition strategy, then clearly, the combination of active acquisition performance and efficiencies gained through acquisitions, combined with organic, would have an impact on margins. I think it's important -- I mean, we talk about margins often, and we all recognize around this table that margins are an important feature. Margin expansion is an important feature of us delivering on our long-term CAGR of EPS of 13%. Having said that, I do want to reiterate to everybody that margins are about the last thing we talk about at an executive team level. We spent a lot of time on financial performance, organic growth strategies, acquisition strategies, people issues, risk issues.

But overall, I got to tell you, Marsh & McLennan agency has been a headwind to margin expansion for this segment. We -- when you look at the amortization that we have added over a number of years, the net operating income margins of MMA now are lower than the margins for greater -- the greater segment. And so from that perspective, over time, that will become more of a tailwind as the amortization schedule falls off. But fundamentally, MMA has not been a help to Peter and his team on margins. And Peter and his team have proven -- because even if you look over the last number of years, forgetting about the 2% growth within Marsh the last couple of quarters, Marsh over a number of years has averaged about 3%, which is really at the lower end of organic or underlying growth where we would expect to have any reasonable amount of margin expansion. But we -- knowing where we're going to be looking out into the future where we're likely to be and planning for it allows us to manage our expenses very carefully to where in virtually every quarter, our revenue growth exceeds our expense growth. And when it doesn't, it's purposeful. We know it, we plan for it, and we decide to do it. And so we're not beholden to the fact it always has to happen that way. In fact, Peter and I talk all the time that for the right opportunities, organic or recruitment wise, we will always go into the tank expense wise to build a better business. And so that is part of what we are willing to do. But we're seeking for those opportunities. They don't avail themselves all that often. So the net effect of running the business on a consistent basis where revenue growth exceeds expense growth means we'll always have margin expansion."

I mean, Oliver Wyman is a strong business, and we're very confident that over time, we can grow it at mid- to high single digits as we've indicated consistently. However, quarter-to-quarter, there'll be a fair bit of volatility, and the reason for that is that the majority of our revenues are nonrecurring, and we need to generate them as new business every year. So in any one quarter, we can have very strong growth like you've seen in the first quarter of this year or through 2014. But we can also have some downside volatility. In addition to that, we've had a few very strong years in Oliver Wyman setting up some pretty tough comparables for us. But in the third quarter, we will see a decline, and that comes primarily from our Financial Services business, which has grown even faster than Oliver Wyman overall. And beyond Financial Services, we're feeling only a modest slowdown at this point across the portfolio, driven by the slower economic growth expectations, exacerbated a little bit by Brexit. And we still see very little to suggest this is any structural weakness, and the business still feels very sound. So we're expecting the dip to be short-term, although it may take a quarter or 2 to work out."

As we said in our 10-K, roughly 50 basis points of discount rate change will have a $35 million or so impact on earnings. The comments -- the reason we included the comments on pension is just because it is so topical. We've gotten lot of questions from investors, and it’s hard to pick up a newspaper without reading something about it given the low interest rate environment. So we just wanted to share where -- how we're thinking about it right now, and one is to highlight what I just talked about, that we are less sensitive today to interest rate volatility than we were. And if you go back a couple of years ago, we closed our largest defined-benefit plan in the U.K. We closed our Irish plan. We need the changes that we talked about to our U.S. plans. We have less sensitivity, so that's a factor. And remember, what really matters is the interest rate environment at the end of the year. And so -- although we've seen a drop in rates here in the first half of the year, just in the U.S. in the last couple of weeks, rates have come back a little bit, and asset values have actually come back off their post-Brexit lows. And so how we're looking at this, we're at the very beginning of our planning process. And as I said a few minutes ago, pension expense is just one element of an overall expense base that we manage very actively, and we manage to deliver great results. And so given where we are in the year, we could see this coming. We can plan under a number of scenarios. And based on where we see things today, we expect we'll be able to limit the impact of pension volatility on earnings just we have for the last couple of years."

We are such a different company than we were back in 1988 that I’m loathe to create those comparisons even though we write them into our script. I would say we're better than in at any time in our history. Because when I look back in 1988, if you look at total RIS, it was $1.3 billion of revenue. I mean, we are multiple times larger and more diverse geographically, line of business, quality, et cetera. And so this is the new world. I don't set margin targets. Peter doesn't as well. We don't believe in them. We believe that there's something about the human brain that looks at a target as something to reach and then draw back from. So I would not put any hurdle out there as to what this business could do and how it could perform. I do know that I'm quite confident that the leading factor in how we will do over time is organic growth. And if we have good levels of organic growth, we will have good levels of margin expansion period. If we don't have that organic growth, then all of our annual and multiyear search for efficiency, obviously, that never ends, and we have found different ways of running this business through structure, through delayering, through technology, through better levels of client connectivity to create more ability for us to service clients on an efficient basis. And that creates a margin benefit to us going forward. But do you have any other questions, Charles? Okay. I think we have time for one more question."

The reality is in an increasingly complex world, the need for advice rises. And these were once transactional businesses, now they are principally advisory businesses with transactional capability. Big, big difference. And so I would say the broad-level risk of disintermediation is quite low. That's not saying that there's not ways of creating distribution that we as a company have to be very focused on, whether it's digital, whether it's online, whether it's worksite. There's different ways of getting to our client base, and we have to be very open to the idea. And clearly, in some parts of segments, I feel you'll have multichannels, right? Whether you look at motor or homeowners or maybe even small commercial, you'll end up having multichannels, which means brokers, there will be direct, there will be affinity, there will be many different avenues for clients to be satisfied. The key is what's the client's experience, who provides the best level of comprehensive client experience, and a little bit less about what's the capital behind it is. It's more about experience. And I would just end with the thought as well because I recently took a trip into a country which was always very much a nonbroker market, which is beginning to turn more and more into a brokered market. The reality is that more parts of the world have become brokers because the terms and conditions and the pricing are better in markets in which brokers are active than in where brokers are not active. And so I feel pretty comfortable that we're positioned well, but not secure in our position in the market. We have to always find ways of doing things better, or else, yes, we will get disintermediated, perhaps, by another intermediary, but we always have to stay on our toes and do things better.

Before moving on to our results, I thought I would spend a few minutes on Brexit, adding to my comments from our last earnings call. The U.K. vote to exit the EU created immediate uncertainty and volatility in capital markets throughout the world. However, over the last month, we have seen a recovery from the initial surprise of the event. Although it is too soon to predict the ultimate effects of the U.K.'s decision, it will have implications for some of our clients. In any circumstance, Brexit will likely lead to a multiyear period of uncertainty. MMC's top priority remains supporting our clients and colleagues in the U.K. and throughout Europe. Our clients will need advice around key issues such as changes in regulatory perspectives on capital requirements, cross-border implications for employee benefit programs, work visa arrangements and the need to restructure U.K. operations in light of negotiations on passporting and the free movement of people. We are uniquely positioned to guide our clients through these challenges. At the same time, we are also addressing how Brexit could affect our own operations. One key question is the potential impact on the London insurance market. London is the global center of insurance and, in our view, will likely remain so in a post-Brexit world. While underwriters will adapt over time, our geographic footprint in every EU country offers us the ability to serve clients regardless of where they are located or do business. Beyond the U.K., we have 110 offices spread throughout the remaining 27 EU member countries. Fundamentally, we operate through subsidiaries rather than branches across the EU. We view capital as fungible, and we are able to place risk anywhere in the world, helping our clients avoid Brexit-related disruption around pricing terms and conditions and assets to capacity in the market.
In the short-term, the uncertainty in the U.K. will likely cause some clients to defer projects and investments, which can impact our revenue growth in the U.K. and Continental Europe. However, we believe as time passes and the political way forward becomes clearer, clients will need our help determining the best way for them to proceed strategically and structurally. Marsh and Guy Carpenter will help clients reassess their risk and insurance needs as they try to protect against stress on capital and credit positions. We will also help clients monitor economic and political risks and the associated business consequences. Clients will seek Mercer's assistance with mobility and workforce planning as they consider their future organizational structures and locations. Mercer will also help with employee rewards and executive compensation design, and there may be a need for investment in asset allocation strategic advice. Oliver Wyman will play a key role helping clients with corporate strategy as they consider their competitive positioning throughout Europe and potential need to restructure their U.K. operations.
I also want to comment on the current state of the P&C insurance industry. The market remains favorable for clients as pricing continues to decline in an orderly manner in most circumstances. Our Marsh Global REIT Index continues to show mid-single-digit decreases across major products and geographies with the steepest declines in the U.K. and U.S. property. On the reinsurance side, we are beginning to see some moderation in rate declines, especially in U.S. pricing. Recent headlines have focused on CAT preannouncement among underwriters. However, while insured natural catastrophe losses climbed over 40% in the first half of 2016, they are in line with what we have seen over the past decade. Capital remains abundant across major global markets with surplus exceeding $1 trillion. Low interest rates are also squeezing profits for insurance carriers as new money yields are lower than previous years. And reserve releases appear to be slowing after a decade of favorable development. Altogether, this translates into returns likely below the cost of capital, net of reserve releases, for a large portion of the P&C industry. We would expect this to ultimately stabilize pricing, though it may take some time. To be clear, we don't anticipate industry pricing dynamics changing anytime soon. As history has shown us, some insurers will continue to write business at lower returns in declining rate environments. And in fact, will actually write more new business when rates are falling than when rates are rising. This is a topic we touched upon on our last earnings call. While there is ample capacity to place comprehensive programs at competitive prices, we believe there is an opportunity for the industry to provide greater value to clients. Success in our industry is increasingly based on delivering what matters to clients: service; breadth of products; coverage innovation; contract certainty; claims performance; responsiveness; and yes, competitive pricing. Even in this tough market environment, underwriters continue to offer new products and services that meet the growing risk needs of our clients, and this bodes well for our industry to grow and enhance the value we deliver.
On the health care side, we've seen recent news about proposed health insurer consolidation in the U.S. There is continued uncertainty regarding outcomes, especially in light of the recently filed DOJ lawsuits to block 2 possible mergers. Mercer will continue to be a trusted adviser regardless of the outcome of these proposed mergers. We will help our clients navigate all the options to design and implement benefit programs that are high quality and cost-effective for employees and their families.
Now let me turn to our results. MMC produced solid operating performance in the second quarter with underlying revenue growth across all 4 of our operating companies, margin expansion and 14% growth in adjusted earnings per share. MMC's revenue of $3.4 billion was the largest quarter in our history. Consolidated underlying revenue growth was 3% with excellent growth and profitability. Operating income rose 16% or 14% on an adjusted basis. For the 6-month period, underlying revenue growth was 4% with margin expansion in both segments and 8% growth in adjusted earnings per share.
Looking at Risk and Insurance Services. Second quarter revenue increased 6% with both Marsh and Guy Carpenter contributing. Underlying revenue growth was 2%. Adjusted operating income increased double digits with the margin expanding 140 basis points to 26.8%, our highest second quarter margin since 1988.
I'm excited about the addition of top-flight leadership talent into RIS reporting to Peter Zaffino. There are no finer P&C executives than John Doyle, the President of Marsh; and Peter Hearn, the President and CEO of Guy Carpenter. I am certain that John and Peter will have a positive impact on MMC.
I would like to give a special acknowledgment to Alex Moczarski and thank him for his leadership of Guy Carpenter over the past 5 years. We all look forward to working with Alex in his role as Chairman, MMC International.
The Consulting segment also delivered a strong quarter with revenue increasing 4%. On an underlying basis, revenue grew 5% with both Mercer and Oliver Wyman producing solid underlying revenue growth. Adjusted operating income increased double digits and the adjusted operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 18.7%, the segment's highest second quarter margin in over 30 years.
In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter results. We are a trusted adviser, helping our clients address the issues of the day relating to risk, strategy and people. Demand for our advice and services increases in a world filled with uncertainty. We have a leadership team that has proven its ability to grow revenue, expand margins and improve earnings each year over multiple years. And we have the financial strength and resources to manage through periods of stress and capitalize on opportunities.
Notwithstanding the headlines and the noise in the market, we expect to deliver another year of excellent financial performance in 2016.
For the full year, we continue to expect underlying revenue growth within the 3% to 5% range that we have operated in for the past 6 years, meaningful margin expansion in both segments and strong EPS growth at a level approaching our long-term target of 13%. All this while continuing to invest in our future and return capital to shareholders through dividends and substantial share repurchases.
With that, let me turn it over to Mark to review our second quarter results in more detail."

In the second quarter, MMC delivered strong results, driven by underlying revenue growth in each of our operating companies while continuing to actively manage expenses. Overall revenue was up 5% and underlying revenue increased 3%. Adjusted operating income increased by double digits, and our overall margin expanded by 190 basis points. GAAP EPS rose 17% to $0.90 and adjusted EPS increased 14% to $0.91.
Looking at risk and insurance services. Second quarter revenue was $1.8 billion with underlying growth of 2%. Adjusted operating income increased 11% to $493 million with the margin expanding 140 basis points to 26.8%.
At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of 6%. The top line was bolstered by quality acquisitions, such as Jelf in the U.K. and continued activity in Marsh & McLennan agency. On an underlying basis, revenue rose 2%. Underlying growth was 4% in the international division. EMEA increased a solid 3% with growth across all region. Asia Pacific was up 2% and Latin America had a strong growth of 11%. In the U.S./Canada division, underlying revenue was flat. We continue to see pressure in Canada and in parts of the U.S., largely driven by commodity-related headwinds. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $285 million, an increase of 3% on both a recorded and underlying basis. Another good performance. Growth was highlighted by strong new business across Asia Pacific, EMEA and Global Specialties. Guy Carpenter has produced positive underlying revenue growth in 28 of the past 30 quarters.
In the Consulting segment, revenue rose 4% to $1.5 billion or 5% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 18% to $288 million and the adjusted operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 18.7%.
Mercer's revenue increased 3% to $1.1 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 4%. Solid growth in the quarter reflects the benefits of the diversified portfolio. Investments and talent both rose 6%, health increased 5% and retirement was up 2%.
All major geographic regions contributed, led by growth market. Oliver Wyman continued to perform well. Revenue was $460 million, reflecting solid growth of 5% on both a reported and underlying basis. Growth was well distributed with particular strength in Europe and other international markets.
In the third quarter, we expect to see a decline in underlying revenue from Oliver Wyman. This is driven by comparisons to very strong growth in the financial services practice last year as well as global growth concerns exacerbated by Brexit uncertainty.
As Dan said, we continue to expect that for 2016, we will generate underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, increased operating margins in both segments and strong growth in earnings per share.
Let's take a -- make a few comments about our global retirement plan. We normally discuss the outlook for retirement plan expense after we have completed the annual year-end measurement process. However, given the declines in global interest rates, we want to share some thoughts that might be helpful to investors. We monitor our retirement programs on an ongoing basis. Previously, we discussed several changes that have reduced the sensitivity of our retirement expense to interest rates. As we have said many times, we view retirement expenses as just 1 component of overall expense which we actively manage. We have been effectively mitigating retirement plan volatility and limiting the impact to shareholders over the past couple of years. Based on where we stand today, we expect to do so in 2017.
Moving to investment income. We recognized $1 million in the second quarter, a decrease from $3 million a year ago. For 2016, we expect to generate only modest investment income compared with $38 million we reported in 2015.
On our last earnings call, we estimated the impact from foreign exchange would be de minimis for the remainder of 2016. As expected, the effect of foreign exchange on adjusted EPS was negligible in the second quarter, and our outlook for the rest of the year has not changed. There has been recent volatility in the British pound. Weakening of the pound has minimal overall impact to MMC. This is because RIS has a natural hedge created by U.S. dollar placements in London. While the weakening of -- while the impact of a weakening pound to MMC in total is not significant, there would be a benefit to RIS, offset by an adverse impact to consulting.
Our tax rate fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter, reflecting the geographic mix of earnings, tax settlements, completion of open tax years and other items. Our adjusted tax rate in the second quarter was 29.1% compared to 27.4% in the same quarter last year. Through the first half of the year, our adjusted tax rate was 28.8% compared with 28.5% in last year's first half. Based on the current landscape, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29% for the remainder of 2016.
Corporate debt at June 30 was $4.8 billion, which declined from $5 billion at the end of the first quarter due to a reduction in commercial paper outstanding. The term structure of our debt portfolio provides us flexibility with modest near-term repayment obligations. Our next debt maturity is $250 million of senior notes due next April.
In the second quarter, we repurchased 3.5 million shares of our stock for $225 million. Through 6 months, we used $425 million to buy back 7 million shares. The second quarter marks the 17th consecutive quarter we have bought back our stock, and we have reduced shares outstanding 9 quarters in a row. Since announcing our commitment to reduce our annual share count at Investor Day in March 2014, shares outstanding have declined by 30 million or 5%. Our cash position at the end of the second quarter was $974 million with approximately $170 million in the U.S. Uses of cash in the second quarter included $225 million for share repurchases, $165 million for dividends and $47 million for acquisitions. For the first 6 months, uses of cash included $425 million for share repurchases, $326 million for dividends and $168 million for acquisitions.
For the full year 2016, we continue to expect to deploy roughly $2.3 billion of capital through dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and investments. We also expect to deliver on our annual capital return commitments to reduce our share count and increase our dividends per share by double digits.
And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan."

So it really gets a very broad array of areas in which it can grow. Wherever there is growth, we're on the ground to capture it. But I think the reality as you've seen from a lot of the insurance company reporting, it's a pretty tough market out there. There is -- the P&C rating levels are under a fair amount of pressure. There's a significant amount of competition amongst brokers, et cetera, which is having an impact. But I do think you have to look at it on a mixed basis. International did quite well. U.S./Canada was under a bit more pressure. But Peter, you want to give us some more color on this?"

Strong organic growth in all major geographies. Some of the highlights were Latin America. We had 11% underlying organic growth, but also over 15% new business growth. We had some real strong performances in Asia, and in EMEA having 3% growth in the second quarter was terrific. And it was led by strong new business in Continental Europe. If we go and shift into the U.S. and Canada, again, each quarter is really quite different. Overall, we're not pleased with 0% growth in the quarter, but it is just 1 quarter. The fundamentals of the business are sound. What are some of the fundamentals we look out are certainly the renewal book. And we look at client retention, it was at historic highs. We've done really well, strong new business. The challenges we had are really tough comparable year-on-year on new business in the U.S./Canada division. It was a record in second quarter 2015. We had a lot more nonrecurring new business than we have had historically. We matched that new business in this particular quarter, but it was hard to grow year-over-year. And that nonrecurring business did have an impact of not having the renewal line grow as much as we've seen in the past. The division continues to be challenged by Canada, which is particularly exposed to commodity prices. We've talked about this in the past. Project work, which does mute a little bit of the new business. And despite the cash that we saw in Canada in the quarter, insurance pricing is still a headwind. And then just one last comment on another variable, Dan mentioned it in his opening comments, is that while the rate decreases are orderly, they sequentially have increased a little bit on the property side in the U.S. And that had a little bit of an impact as well. But again, I look at client retention, new business and the underlying performance of the fundamentals, and I think U.S. and Canada will do well as it has historically when we look at the full year."

The reality is in both RIS and consulting, we have had significant efficiency gains over multiple periods of time. And so when we look at the expansion of the margins, it's been pretty consistent over multiple years. I was just looking the other day in the second quarter over a 5-year period, the margin for RIS is up almost 500 basis points, and for consulting, about 600 basis points. And so there has been a consistent level of significant margin expansion. We expect 2016 to be a good year for margin expansion despite the slow growth environment within RIS."

I don't know whether that's going to be the case this year or not. Our pipelines are actually pretty good. But we're a disciplined acquirer. And so what I can say is that if acquisitions are lighter than normal in any given year, we're not seeking to build cash on our balance sheet.

Thank you, and thanks for the question. As we've talked about in the past, I mean, Mercer is a pretty broad business and gives us a lot of different opportunities to align margin expansion and ensure that our top line and our expense growth has a lot of air between them over sustainable periods of time. And so you see things that we make conscious decisions like disinvesting in things that don't give us the margin expansion or sustainability of profit contribution into the future. One of the more primary recent examples of that is when we decided to disinvest in our DC recordkeeping business and strike up a strategic relationship with a partner that we can continue to have as part of a bundled solution into the future. And we’ve continued to make active decisions like that. Our continued efficiency in our consultancy and administration businesses is really posted around a discipline, around higher utilization. Use of offshoring is another example of what we do to continue to drive efficiency and air between expenses and revenue. Also, the evolving mix of our business. I mean, there's no question that as you look at the improvement in operating leverage, you see businesses that have that operating leverage being more significant part of our mix, and that's going to have a sustainable impact over the long run. And our continuous portfolio review is also a part of our discipline now, and we accelerate those things that give us margin accretiveness, and we decelerate those things that don't. So it's really a lot about being very disciplined around ensuring that we are building a business that can have strength, both in the top line and the bottom line, as we continue to grow. And I just also want to mention that importantly, our overall focus is still to increase and grow earnings. And we're confident that with the actions that we've taken and the actions that we continue to take, that we'll be successful in doing just that."

And so yes, there is -- where you have an active acquisition strategy, then clearly, the combination of active acquisition performance and efficiencies gained through acquisitions, combined with organic, would have an impact on margins.

We spent a lot of time on financial performance, organic growth strategies, acquisition strategies, people issues, risk issues.

But overall, I got to tell you, Marsh & McLennan agency has been a headwind to margin expansion for this segment. We -- when you look at the amortization that we have added over a number of years, the net operating income margins of MMA now are lower than the margins for greater -- the greater segment. And so from that perspective, over time, that will become more of a tailwind as the amortization schedule falls off. But fundamentally, MMA has not been a help to Peter and his team on margins. And Peter and his team have proven -- because even if you look over the last number of years, forgetting about the 2% growth within Marsh the last couple of quarters, Marsh over a number of years has averaged about 3%, which is really at the lower end of organic or underlying growth where we would expect to have any reasonable amount of margin expansion. But we -- knowing where we're going to be looking out into the future where we're likely to be and planning for it allows us to manage our expenses very carefully to where in virtually every quarter, our revenue growth exceeds our expense growth. And when it doesn't, it's purposeful. We know it, we plan for it, and we decide to do it. And so we're not beholden to the fact it always has to happen that way. In fact, Peter and I talk all the time that for the right opportunities, organic or recruitment wise, we will always go into the tank expense wise to build a better business. And so that is part of what we are willing to do. But we're seeking for those opportunities. They don't avail themselves all that often. So the net effect of running the business on a consistent basis where revenue growth exceeds expense growth means we'll always have margin expansion."

I mean, Oliver Wyman is a strong business, and we're very confident that over time, we can grow it at mid- to high single digits as we've indicated consistently. However, quarter-to-quarter, there'll be a fair bit of volatility, and the reason for that is that the majority of our revenues are nonrecurring, and we need to generate them as new business every year. So in any one quarter, we can have very strong growth like you've seen in the first quarter of this year or through 2014. But we can also have some downside volatility. In addition to that, we've had a few very strong years in Oliver Wyman setting up some pretty tough comparables for us. But in the third quarter, we will see a decline, and that comes primarily from our Financial Services business, which has grown even faster than Oliver Wyman overall. And beyond Financial Services, we're feeling only a modest slowdown at this point across the portfolio, driven by the slower economic growth expectations, exacerbated a little bit by Brexit. And we still see very little to suggest this is any structural weakness, and the business still feels very sound. So we're expecting the dip to be short-term, although it may take a quarter or 2 to work out."

Throughout those discussions, you can imagine there's a bit of a slowdown in terms of that discretionary spend until the path is clear and until we have an opportunity to propose some strategy on how to go forward.

As we said in our 10-K, roughly 50 basis points of discount rate change will have a $35 million or so impact on earnings. The comments -- the reason we included the comments on pension is just because it is so topical. We've gotten lot of questions from investors, and it’s hard to pick up a newspaper without reading something about it given the low interest rate environment. So we just wanted to share where -- how we're thinking about it right now, and one is to highlight what I just talked about, that we are less sensitive today to interest rate volatility than we were. And if you go back a couple of years ago, we closed our largest defined-benefit plan in the U.K. We closed our Irish plan. We need the changes that we talked about to our U.S. plans. We have less sensitivity, so that's a factor. And remember, what really matters is the interest rate environment at the end of the year. And so -- although we've seen a drop in rates here in the first half of the year, just in the U.S. in the last couple of weeks, rates have come back a little bit, and asset values have actually come back off their post-Brexit lows. And so how we're looking at this, we're at the very beginning of our planning process. And as I said a few minutes ago, pension expense is just one element of an overall expense base that we manage very actively, and we manage to deliver great results. And so given where we are in the year, we could see this coming. We can plan under a number of scenarios. And based on where we see things today, we expect we'll be able to limit the impact of pension volatility on earnings just we have for the last couple of years."

We are such a different company than we were back in 1988 that I’m loathe to create those comparisons even though we write them into our script. I would say we're better than in at any time in our history. Because when I look back in 1988, if you look at total RIS, it was $1.3 billion of revenue. I mean, we are multiple times larger and more diverse geographically, line of business, quality, et cetera. And so this is the new world. I don't set margin targets. Peter doesn't as well. We don't believe in them. We believe that there's something about the human brain that looks at a target as something to reach and then draw back from. So I would not put any hurdle out there as to what this business could do and how it could perform. I do know that I'm quite confident that the leading factor in how we will do over time is organic growth. And if we have good levels of organic growth, we will have good levels of margin expansion period. If we don't have that organic growth, then all of our annual and multiyear search for efficiency, obviously, that never ends, and we have found different ways of running this business through structure, through delayering, through technology, through better levels of client connectivity to create more ability for us to service clients on an efficient basis. And that creates a margin benefit to us going forward. But do you have any other questions, Charles? Okay. I think we have time for one more question."

The reality is in an increasingly complex world, the need for advice rises. And these were once transactional businesses, now they are principally advisory businesses with transactional capability. Big, big difference. And so I would say the broad-level risk of disintermediation is quite low. That's not saying that there's not ways of creating distribution that we as a company have to be very focused on, whether it's digital, whether it's online, whether it's worksite. There's different ways of getting to our client base, and we have to be very open to the idea. And clearly, in some parts of segments, I feel you'll have multichannels, right? Whether you look at motor or homeowners or maybe even small commercial, you'll end up having multichannels, which means brokers, there will be direct, there will be affinity, there will be many different avenues for clients to be satisfied. The key is what's the client's experience, who provides the best level of comprehensive client experience, and a little bit less about what's the capital behind it is. It's more about experience. And I would just end with the thought as well because I recently took a trip into a country which was always very much a nonbroker market, which is beginning to turn more and more into a brokered market. The reality is that more parts of the world have become brokers because the terms and conditions and the pricing are better in markets in which brokers are active than in where brokers are not active. And so I feel pretty comfortable that we're positioned well, but not secure in our position in the market. We have to always find ways of doing things better, or else, yes, we will get disintermediated, perhaps, by another intermediary, but we always have to stay on our toes and do things better.

I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is our CFO, Mark McGivney; Peter Zaffino, the Chairman of Risk and Insurance Services; Julio Portalatin, CEO of Mercer; Scott McDonald, CEO of Oliver Wyman; and Keith Walsh, Head of Investor Relations. 
I'll begin with a discussion of our third quarter and 9-month results, and then address our outlook for growth. MMC produced another strong quarter, delivering double-digit growth in adjusted EPS, with margin expansion in both Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting. Underlying revenue growth was 1%, driven by a decline at Oliver Wyman. 
Operating income rose 24% or 16% on an adjusted basis. We have positioned the firm to deliver strong EPS growth in a variety of market environment as we actively manage expenses while investing for the future. Our ability to consistently grow earnings is a testament to our culture of execution and accountability throughout the firm. Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, third quarter underlying revenue rose 2%. Adjusted operating income increased double digits, with the adjusted margin expanding to 18.5%. 
In Consulting, underlying revenue growth of 3% at Mercer was offset by a 9% decline at Oliver Wyman. Earnings growth was strong, with adjusted operating income rising 8%, bringing the adjusted margin to 20.4%, the highest level in over 30 years. 
Through 9 months, we produced consolidated underlying revenue growth of 3%. The adjusted operating margin of the company in both operating segments expanded 100 basis points. Growth in earnings per share was 12%, with 8% growth in adjusted earnings per share. We were pleased with our year-to-date performance and are on track for a strong 2016. Over the last couple of years, we have seen volatility around commodity prices and foreign exchange, declining interest rates, weak global GDP growth, political instability and lower P&C insurance pricing. Despite this backdrop, we have produced significantly higher earnings growth than the S&P 500. In the current macro environment, where there may be a tendency to hunker down or become short-term focused, we remain focused on the mid to long-term. I remain positive about our prospects. I want to share with you what we are doing to position MMC for continued growth. 
We aspire to be recognized among the elite global growth companies. Our goal is to continue to produce higher returns at lower risk than the overall market. We continue to position the company for long-term revenue growth. Our optimism is driven by 3 factors: We are in growth businesses; we have consistently invested for growth; and we are harnessing the talent and power of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
First, we are well-positioned in growth businesses. We are a trusted adviser, helping our clients not only address the critical issues of the day, but prepare for the issues of the future relating to risk, strategy and people. Our existing businesses are part of an expanding global pie that should drive greater demand for our advice and services over time. The strategic positioning of MMC has never been stronger. We firmly believe our businesses will continue to expand. The world is becoming more complex, and our clients are grappling with a number of issues relating to risk, strategy and people.
In many markets, there is limited penetration of insurance broking and consulting that will grow over time. And in many parts of the world, governments have taken on too much risk that could be more efficiently placed in the private market. And this carries beyond P&C insurance to include healthcare and retirement savings. We have the people, expertise and infrastructure to capitalize on these global trends across all of our operating companies. We have also made significant investments for growth over many years, both organic and through acquisitions. 
Since 2009, we have invested over $7 billion for growth and efficiency. This includes over 120 acquisitions approaching $5 billion, capital expenditures of $2.4 billion and the addition of over 10,000 colleagues. 
Our investments fall into 3 broad categories: geographic expansion; segmentation; and new capabilities and innovations. We expect these faster-growing businesses will become a larger proportion of the overall company over time, enhancing our long-term revenue growth.
Starting with geographic expansion, we have made substantial investments throughout Latin America and Africa as well as increased our presence in Asia and other emerging economies. These regions have been underserved by professional services and have higher long-term growth prospects relative to the developed world.
Another area of growth is developing new segments and specializations within existing businesses. At Marsh, we have had success with the mid-market strategy in the U.S. with our MMA platform and, more recently, in the U.K. with the acquisition of Jelf. Mercer has created growth segments in key areas, including investment management and its global Health & Benefits platforms. Guy Carpenter has grown specialist practices in areas such as mutuals, agriculture, medical and strategic advisory. And Oliver Wyman continues to invest in industry verticals where we see potential, such as the public sector, healthcare and financial services.
Many of our investments include new capabilities and innovations. Our data and analytics platforms continue to differentiate in the market across all of our operating companies. Consulting has generated strong growth from OW labs with its market-leading use of predictive analytics. 
Mercer has expanded its capabilities to include its Workday implementation business, the Pension Risk Exchange for pension buyouts and is developing an array of digital and mobile solutions to serve clients.
Turning to RIS, flood, cyber and digital distribution are just a few of the areas that could represent faster growth for the segment.
Lastly, I want to touch on harnessing the power of MMC. We are a unique firm built around risk, strategy and people. There is no single company we compete against that matches the collective capabilities of our 4 operating companies. We view this as an enduring competitive advantage. We have made great strides in connecting the strengths of our operating companies and how we manage MMC, generate cost efficiencies and how we deliver value to clients.
Over the last several years, we have taken a significant number of structural steps to bring together the collective strength of MMC for clients. Some examples include forming Mercer Marsh benefits, which brings the best of Mercer and Marsh together in driving global benefit solutions outside the United States; bringing leadership of the RIS segment under Peter Zaffino; a more unified Oliver Wyman, which enhances the intellectual capital of MMC; promoting colleague mobility. In fact, in the past 3 years, approximately 3,000 colleagues have moved within the company, the formation of our strategic solutions group to deliver the full capabilities of MMC and the establishment of chief country officers that helped drive in-country collaboration. Taken together, these actions better position us for sustainable growth and profitability. No matter what the environment, we are always thinking about the mid and long term. And I believe MMC is better positioned today than at any time in its history.
In summary, we produced strong earnings growth in the third quarter and are on track to deliver another year of excellent financial performance in 2016. For the full year, we continue to expect underlying revenue growth, meaningful margin expansion in both segments and strong EPS growth, all this while continuing to invest in our future and return capital to shareholders through dividends and substantial share repurchase. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mark to review our third quarter results in more detail."
473342,402855577,1059921,"Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone.

In the third quarter, MMC delivered strong earnings, producing double-digit growth in both GAAP and adjusted earnings per share. Consolidated revenue increased 1% on both the reported and underlying basis. Operating income increased 24%, while adjusted operating income rose 16%. GAAP EPS rose 20% to $0.73, with adjusted EPS increasing 10% to $0.69. And our adjusted margin rose 240 basis points to 18%. 
As we stated on last quarter's call, you get a better sense of our underlying performance looking at margins and margin improvements on a year-to-date basis. 
Through 9 months, adjusted margin expanded 100 basis points overall and in each operating segment. 
Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, third quarter revenue rose 3% to $1.6 billion, with underlying growth of 2%. Adjusted operating income increased 22% to $302 million, and the margin expanded 280 basis points to 18.5%.
At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $1.4 billion, an increase of 4%. This solid growth reflects recent acquisitions, such as Jelf in the U.K., and ongoing activity in Marsh & McLennan agencies. On an underlying basis, revenue rose 2%. 
In the U.S./Canada division, underlying growth was 3%, driven primarily by strong new business in the U.S. 
In the International division, underlying growth was 2%. 
EMEA was flat with growth in the U.K., offset by Europe in the Middle East. Asia Pacific was up 2%, and Latin America had strong growth of 9%, which came on top of 6% growth in last year's third quarter.
Guy Carpenter's revenue was $260 million, flat on both the reported and underlying basis. EMEA and Global Specialties, led by Marine, had positive trends in the quarter. Year-to-date, underlying revenue growth was 2%.
In the Consulting segment, underlying revenue was flat, reflecting growth at Mercer, offset by a decline at Oliver Wyman.
As we've discussed on prior calls, we've built a model where Oliver Wyman's compensation is performance-sensitive. So their expense base, which is largely compensation and benefits, naturally flexes with their revenue. Whether up or down, Oliver Wyman has much more of a revenue impact to [ph] MMC than an earnings impact.
Consulting's adjusted operating income increased 8% to $309 million, which represents the highest level of profitability for any quarter in Consulting's history. The adjusted operating margin expanded 190 basis points to 20.4%. Mercer's underlying revenue increased 3% to $1.1 billion. Solid performance in the quarter continues to reflect the benefits of a diversified portfolio. Investments and Talent both rose 7%, Health increased 2% and Retirement was flat. 
On a geographic basis, revenue increased in all major regions for both the third quarter and 9 months. 
In our Mercer Marketplace 365 benefits platform, we are providing access for approximately 1.5 million lives, flat with last year. We have consistently talked about how Mercer Marketplace is not a material contributor to our overall results, and we don't expect it will be in the near-term. However, we remain positive regarding the long-term growth potential of our Health & Benefits business.
As we anticipated on last quarter's call, Oliver Wyman had a decline in underlying revenue in the third quarter. This was driven by comparisons to very strong growth in the financial service practice last year as well as global growth concern, exacerbated by Brexit uncertainty. Oliver Wyman's revenue was $404 million, a decline of 9% on an underlying basis.
In the fourth quarter, we expect Oliver Wyman's revenue growth to be relatively flat with last year. As we look ahead to the first quarter of next year, recall that Oliver Wyman generated 15% growth in the first quarter of this year.
Overall, we continue to expect that for 2016, MMC will generate underlying revenue growth, increased operating margins in both segments and strong growth in earnings per share.
Next, I'd like to update you on changes we will be making to our U.S. retirement plan. We recently decided to close our U.S. defined benefit plan effective December 31, 2016, and freeze future benefit accruals. In their place, we will implement an enhanced defined contribution plan effective January 2017. These actions are consistent with our global benefits philosophy, providing competitive benefits and a preference for DC over DB.
This represents the latest of several actions we've taken around retirement benefits in the last 3 years. With the closing of the U.S. DB plan, we will look up [ph] the growth of benefit accruals for the vast majority of our global pension liabilities, which reduces risk and volatility. The timing and nature of this announcement requires that we revisit the assumptions used at year-end 2015 and remeasure our U.S. pension liabilities in the fourth quarter. Based on current assumptions, including lower interest rates, we expect to incur incremental pension expense with $0.01 or so in the fourth quarter. This additional expense will be included in our adjusted EPS.
Last quarter, I mentioned that although the decline in global interest rates could mean higher pension expense in 2017, we were planning for this risk and expected we would be able to effectively mitigate any increase. Based on the environment today, we continue to believe we will be able to mitigate any pension expense volatility in 2017.
Moving to foreign exchange. In the third quarter, the effective foreign exchange on adjusted EPS was a slight positive. Assuming exchange rates remain at their current levels, we expect FX to be immaterial in the fourth quarter, resulting in a de minimis impact for the full year.
We have seen continued volatility in the British pound. But as we discussed last quarter, a weakening pound generally has a minimum overall impact to MMC over the course of the year, just because RIS has a natural hedge created by U.S. dollar placements in London. While the impact of a weakening pound to MMC in total is not significant, there is a benefit to RIS, offset by an adverse impact to Consulting. Investment income was negligible in the third quarter and was down $34 million or about $0.04 per share from last year. 
For the full year of 2016, we expect investment income to be immaterial compared with $38 million in 2015.
As you may remember, we have a substantially smaller private equity portfolio following the liquidation of Trident III in 2015. As a result, we expect to generate only modest investment income going forward.
Our adjusted tax rate in the third quarter was 28.7% compared to 28.4% in last year's third quarter. Through the first 9 months of 2016, our adjusted tax rate was 28.8% compared with 28.5% for the same period last year. 
Based on the current landscape, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29% for the remainder of 2016.
Corporate debt at September 30 was $4.8 billion, unchanged from the end of June. Our next debt maturity is $250 million of notes due next April. 
In the third quarter, we repurchased 3 million shares of our stock for $200 million. Through 9 months, we used $625 million to buy back 10 million shares. 
Third quarter marks the 18th consecutive quarter we have bought back our stock, and we have reduced shares outstanding 10 quarters in a row. With announcing [ph] our commitment to reduce our annual share count at Investor Day in March 2014, shares outstanding have declined by 33 million or 6%. 
Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was $1.4 billion, of which approximately $400 million was in the U.S. Uses of cash in the third quarter totaled $440 million and included $200 million for share repurchases, $178  million for dividends and $62 million for acquisitions.
For the 9 months, uses of cash totaled $1.4 billion and included $625 million for share repurchases, $504 million for acquisitions and $229 million -- I'm sorry, $504 million for dividends and $229 million for acquisitions. 
For the full year 2016, we continue to expect to deploy roughly $2.3 billion of capital through dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions. We also expect to deliver on our annual capital return commitments to reduce our share count and increase our dividends per share by double digits. With that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan."

Quentin, first, let me start with the core fundamentals of what happened in the U.S./Canada in the third quarter. We're very pleased with the growth of 3%. The U.S. had a very strong new business quarter as well as contribution from strong client and revenue retention. MMA continues to be a strong contributor. The core U.S. was a strong contributor, and Canada was less of a headwind. In terms of leadership, I will start with John Doyle. John has had a material impact since he has arrived at Marsh. There's no executive that I'm aware of that knows more of our clients and has been heavily engaged in working with clients, working with our colleagues and focusing on top line growth. Martin South has been with Marsh for many years, and is a very established leader. His most positive attributes are how he grows businesses and his innovation. And he has had a positive impact on the U.S./Canada division as well. It's early days for him, but expect the combination of John's arrival and Martin's arrival in the United States is going to have a really positive impact for our ability to grow the business in the future."

But that higher level of growth will come with volatility because Oliver Wyman's business by its very nature has much, much less recurring revenue than the other 3 operating companies.

The first part of growth is looking at how you're retaining your clients. And we have  had terrific retention on clients. The next is, certainly, are you winning new business in the market. And when I look at our new business growth, I'm really pleased with what we see across Many contributions from many countries, and we've been able to grow the business quite well. When we look at -- again, there's definitely been some headwinds in the market with global, macroeconomic issues as well as insurance pricing largely been headwinds. But like we've been able to grow in 26 consecutive quarters of underlying organic growth. So the business is built to drive underlying organic growth. You had mentioned a couple of places where we're growing. They're not material to the overall today, but we're excited about it. Cyber is a big part of our innovation. We've developed programs in the London market, which prearranged $50 million of capacity for clients across the world. We have launched for smaller commercial clients capability through our MGA. And through 9 months, we had about 4,000 quotes with the take-up of around 15%. We're planting seeds in flood. We have a digital capability that will expand and position us differently in the small end of commercial. So I think when Dan references the investments that we're making, it's about focusing on growth and efficiencies in order to enable us to invest more in growth over time. And we feel like the company's well positioned to do that."

I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Joining me on the call today is our CFO, Mark McGivney; Peter Zaffino, the Chairman of Risk and Insurance Services; Julio Portalatin, CEO of Mercer; Scott McDonald, CEO of Oliver Wyman; and Keith Walsh, Head of Investor Relations. 
I'll begin with a discussion of our third quarter and 9-month results, and then address our outlook for growth. MMC produced another strong quarter, delivering double-digit growth in adjusted EPS, with margin expansion in both Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting. Underlying revenue growth was 1%, driven by a decline at Oliver Wyman. 
Operating income rose 24% or 16% on an adjusted basis. We have positioned the firm to deliver strong EPS growth in a variety of market environment as we actively manage expenses while investing for the future. Our ability to consistently grow earnings is a testament to our culture of execution and accountability throughout the firm. Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, third quarter underlying revenue rose 2%. Adjusted operating income increased double digits, with the adjusted margin expanding to 18.5%. 
In Consulting, underlying revenue growth of 3% at Mercer was offset by a 9% decline at Oliver Wyman. Earnings growth was strong, with adjusted operating income rising 8%, bringing the adjusted margin to 20.4%, the highest level in over 30 years. 
Through 9 months, we produced consolidated underlying revenue growth of 3%. The adjusted operating margin of the company in both operating segments expanded 100 basis points. Growth in earnings per share was 12%, with 8% growth in adjusted earnings per share. We were pleased with our year-to-date performance and are on track for a strong 2016. Over the last couple of years, we have seen volatility around commodity prices and foreign exchange, declining interest rates, weak global GDP growth, political instability and lower P&C insurance pricing. Despite this backdrop, we have produced significantly higher earnings growth than the S&P 500. In the current macro environment, where there may be a tendency to hunker down or become short-term focused, we remain focused on the mid to long-term. I remain positive about our prospects. I want to share with you what we are doing to position MMC for continued growth. 
We aspire to be recognized among the elite global growth companies. Our goal is to continue to produce higher returns at lower risk than the overall market. We continue to position the company for long-term revenue growth. Our optimism is driven by 3 factors: We are in growth businesses; we have consistently invested for growth; and we are harnessing the talent and power of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
First, we are well-positioned in growth businesses. We are a trusted adviser, helping our clients not only address the critical issues of the day, but prepare for the issues of the future relating to risk, strategy and people. Our existing businesses are part of an expanding global pie that should drive greater demand for our advice and services over time. The strategic positioning of MMC has never been stronger. We firmly believe our businesses will continue to expand. The world is becoming more complex, and our clients are grappling with a number of issues relating to risk, strategy and people.
In many markets, there is limited penetration of insurance broking and consulting that will grow over time. And in many parts of the world, governments have taken on too much risk that could be more efficiently placed in the private market. And this carries beyond P&C insurance to include healthcare and retirement savings. We have the people, expertise and infrastructure to capitalize on these global trends across all of our operating companies. We have also made significant investments for growth over many years, both organic and through acquisitions. 
Since 2009, we have invested over $7 billion for growth and efficiency. This includes over 120 acquisitions approaching $5 billion, capital expenditures of $2.4 billion and the addition of over 10,000 colleagues. 
Our investments fall into 3 broad categories: geographic expansion; segmentation; and new capabilities and innovations. We expect these faster-growing businesses will become a larger proportion of the overall company over time, enhancing our long-term revenue growth.
Starting with geographic expansion, we have made substantial investments throughout Latin America and Africa as well as increased our presence in Asia and other emerging economies. These regions have been underserved by professional services and have higher long-term growth prospects relative to the developed world.
Another area of growth is developing new segments and specializations within existing businesses. At Marsh, we have had success with the mid-market strategy in the U.S. with our MMA platform and, more recently, in the U.K. with the acquisition of Jelf. Mercer has created growth segments in key areas, including investment management and its global Health & Benefits platforms. Guy Carpenter has grown specialist practices in areas such as mutuals, agriculture, medical and strategic advisory. And Oliver Wyman continues to invest in industry verticals where we see potential, such as the public sector, healthcare and financial services.
Many of our investments include new capabilities and innovations. Our data and analytics platforms continue to differentiate in the market across all of our operating companies. Consulting has generated strong growth from OW labs with its market-leading use of predictive analytics. 
Mercer has expanded its capabilities to include its Workday implementation business, the Pension Risk Exchange for pension buyouts and is developing an array of digital and mobile solutions to serve clients.
Turning to RIS, flood, cyber and digital distribution are just a few of the areas that could represent faster growth for the segment.
Lastly, I want to touch on harnessing the power of MMC. We are a unique firm built around risk, strategy and people. There is no single company we compete against that matches the collective capabilities of our 4 operating companies. We view this as an enduring competitive advantage. We have made great strides in connecting the strengths of our operating companies and how we manage MMC, generate cost efficiencies and how we deliver value to clients.
Over the last several years, we have taken a significant number of structural steps to bring together the collective strength of MMC for clients. Some examples include forming Mercer Marsh benefits, which brings the best of Mercer and Marsh together in driving global benefit solutions outside the United States; bringing leadership of the RIS segment under Peter Zaffino; a more unified Oliver Wyman, which enhances the intellectual capital of MMC; promoting colleague mobility. In fact, in the past 3 years, approximately 3,000 colleagues have moved within the company, the formation of our strategic solutions group to deliver the full capabilities of MMC and the establishment of chief country officers that helped drive in-country collaboration. Taken together, these actions better position us for sustainable growth and profitability. No matter what the environment, we are always thinking about the mid and long term. And I believe MMC is better positioned today than at any time in its history.
In summary, we produced strong earnings growth in the third quarter and are on track to deliver another year of excellent financial performance in 2016. For the full year, we continue to expect underlying revenue growth, meaningful margin expansion in both segments and strong EPS growth, all this while continuing to invest in our future and return capital to shareholders through dividends and substantial share repurchase. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mark to review our third quarter results in more detail."

In the third quarter, MMC delivered strong earnings, producing double-digit growth in both GAAP and adjusted earnings per share. Consolidated revenue increased 1% on both the reported and underlying basis. Operating income increased 24%, while adjusted operating income rose 16%. GAAP EPS rose 20% to $0.73, with adjusted EPS increasing 10% to $0.69. And our adjusted margin rose 240 basis points to 18%. 
As we stated on last quarter's call, you get a better sense of our underlying performance looking at margins and margin improvements on a year-to-date basis. 
Through 9 months, adjusted margin expanded 100 basis points overall and in each operating segment. 
Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, third quarter revenue rose 3% to $1.6 billion, with underlying growth of 2%. Adjusted operating income increased 22% to $302 million, and the margin expanded 280 basis points to 18.5%.
At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $1.4 billion, an increase of 4%. This solid growth reflects recent acquisitions, such as Jelf in the U.K., and ongoing activity in Marsh & McLennan agencies. On an underlying basis, revenue rose 2%. 
In the U.S./Canada division, underlying growth was 3%, driven primarily by strong new business in the U.S. 
In the International division, underlying growth was 2%. 
EMEA was flat with growth in the U.K., offset by Europe in the Middle East. Asia Pacific was up 2%, and Latin America had strong growth of 9%, which came on top of 6% growth in last year's third quarter.
Guy Carpenter's revenue was $260 million, flat on both the reported and underlying basis. EMEA and Global Specialties, led by Marine, had positive trends in the quarter. Year-to-date, underlying revenue growth was 2%.
In the Consulting segment, underlying revenue was flat, reflecting growth at Mercer, offset by a decline at Oliver Wyman.
As we've discussed on prior calls, we've built a model where Oliver Wyman's compensation is performance-sensitive. So their expense base, which is largely compensation and benefits, naturally flexes with their revenue. Whether up or down, Oliver Wyman has much more of a revenue impact on MMC than an earnings impact.
Consulting's adjusted operating income increased 8% to $309 million, which represents the highest level of profitability for any quarter in Consulting's history. The adjusted operating margin expanded 190 basis points to 20.4%. Mercer's underlying revenue increased 3% to $1.1 billion. Solid performance in the quarter continues to reflect the benefits of a diversified portfolio. Investments and Talent both rose 7%, Health increased 2% and Retirement was flat. 
On a geographic basis, revenue increased in all major regions for both the third quarter and 9 months. 
In our Mercer Marketplace 365 benefits platform, we are providing access for approximately 1.5 million lives, flat with last year. We have consistently talked about how Mercer Marketplace is not a material contributor to our overall results, and we don't expect it will be in the near-term. However, we remain positive regarding the long-term growth potential of our Health & Benefits business.
As we anticipated on last quarter's call, Oliver Wyman had a decline in underlying revenue in the third quarter. This was driven by comparisons to very strong growth in the financial service practice last year as well as global growth concern, exacerbated by Brexit uncertainty. Oliver Wyman's revenue was $404 million, a decline of 9% on an underlying basis.
In the fourth quarter, we expect Oliver Wyman's revenue growth to be relatively flat with last year. As we look ahead to the first quarter of next year, recall that Oliver Wyman generated 15% growth in the first quarter of this year.
Overall, we continue to expect that for 2016, MMC will generate underlying revenue growth, increased operating margins in both segments and strong growth in earnings per share.
Next, I'd like to update you on changes we will be making to our U.S. retirement plan. We recently decided to close our U.S. defined benefit plan effective December 31, 2016, and freeze future benefit accruals. In their place, we will implement an enhanced defined contribution plan effective January 2017. These actions are consistent with our global benefits philosophy, providing competitive benefits and a preference for DC over DB.
This represents the latest of several actions we've taken around retirement benefits in the last 3 years. With the closing of the U.S. DB plan, we will have capped the growth of benefit accruals for the vast majority of our global pension liabilities, which reduces risk and volatility. The timing and nature of this announcement requires that we revisit the assumptions used at year-end 2015 and remeasure our U.S. pension liabilities in the fourth quarter. Based on current assumptions, including lower interest rates, we expect to incur incremental pension expense with $0.01 or so in the fourth quarter. This additional expense will be included in our adjusted EPS.
Last quarter, I mentioned that although the decline in global interest rates could mean higher pension expense in 2017, we were planning for this risk and expected we would be able to effectively mitigate any increase. Based on the environment today, we continue to believe we will be able to mitigate any pension expense volatility in 2017.
Moving to foreign exchange. In the third quarter, the effective foreign exchange on adjusted EPS was a slight positive. Assuming exchange rates remain at their current levels, we expect FX to be immaterial in the fourth quarter, resulting in a de minimis impact for the full year.
We have seen continued volatility in the British pound. But as we discussed last quarter, a weakening pound generally has a minimum overall impact to MMC over the course of the year, just because RIS has a natural hedge created by U.S. dollar placements in London. While the impact of a weakening pound to MMC in total is not significant, there is a benefit to RIS, offset by an adverse impact to Consulting. Investment income was negligible in the third quarter and was down $34 million or about $0.04 per share from last year. 
For the full year of 2016, we expect investment income to be immaterial compared with $38 million in 2015.
As you may remember, we have a substantially smaller private equity portfolio following the liquidation of Trident III in 2015. As a result, we expect to generate only modest investment income going forward.
Our adjusted tax rate in the third quarter was 28.7% compared to 28.4% in last year's third quarter. Through the first 9 months of 2016, our adjusted tax rate was 28.8% compared with 28.5% for the same period last year. 
Based on the current landscape, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29% for the remainder of 2016.
Corporate debt at September 30 was $4.8 billion, unchanged from the end of June. Our next debt maturity is $250 million of notes due next April. 
In the third quarter, we repurchased 3 million shares of our stock for $200 million. Through 9 months, we used $625 million to buy back 10 million shares. 
Third quarter marks the 18th consecutive quarter we have bought back our stock, and we have reduced shares outstanding 10 quarters in a row. Since announcing our commitment to reduce our annual share count at Investor Day in March 2014, shares outstanding have declined by 33 million or 6%. 
Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was $1.4 billion, of which approximately $400 million was in the U.S. Uses of cash in the third quarter totaled $440 million and included $200 million for share repurchases, $178  million for dividends and $62 million for acquisitions.
For the 9 months, uses of cash totaled $1.4 billion and included $625 million for share repurchases, $504 million for acquisitions and $229 million -- I'm sorry, $504 million for dividends and $229 million for acquisitions. 
For the full year 2016, we continue to expect to deploy roughly $2.3 billion of capital through dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions. We also expect to deliver on our annual capital return commitments to reduce our share count and increase our dividends per share by double digits. With that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan."

It's more important and more meaningful to look at it over a longer stretch of time, year-to-date basis or rolling 4 quarters, something like that. If you look on a year-to-date business, the company overall is up 100 basis points against 3% overall growth for the company, and each of the segments is also up 100 basis points. And I think that's more indicative of where our margin expansion really is. So I wouldn't take the dramatic expansion in the third quarter as the new reality going forward."

The U.S. had a very strong new business quarter as well as contribution from strong client and revenue retention. MMA continues to be a strong contributor. The core U.S. was a strong contributor, and Canada was less of a headwind. In terms of leadership, I will start with John Doyle. John has had a material impact since he has arrived at Marsh. There's no executive that I'm aware of that knows more of our clients and has been heavily engaged in working with clients, working with our colleagues and focusing on top line growth. Martin South has been with Marsh for many years, and is a very established leader. His most positive attributes are how he grows businesses and his innovation. And he has had a positive impact on the U.S./Canada division as well. It's early days for him, but expect the combination of John's arrival and Martin's arrival in the United States is going to have a really positive impact for our ability to grow the business in the future."

But being 3% through 9 months, we would look at it as we're likely on the lower end of that range for the year. But there's a lot going on underneath it. So why don't we start with Peter, and then I'll move to Julio and then Scott just to talk about their growth outlook a little bit. So Peter?"

Yes, just adding, Dan, to what I've said in terms of the narrative for the quarter and the year-to-date, the first part of growth is looking at how you're retaining your clients. And we have had terrific retention on clients. The next is, certainly, are you winning new business in the market? And when I look at our new business growth, I'm really pleased with what we see across the world, many contributions from many countries, and we've been able to grow the business quite well. When we look at -- again, there's definitely been some headwinds in the market with global macroeconomic issues as well as insurance pricing. They've largely been headwinds. But then I look -- we've been able to grow in 26 consecutive quarters of underlying organic growth. So the business is built to drive underlying organic growth. You've mentioned a couple of places where we're growing. They're not material to the overall today, but we're excited about it. Cyber is a big part of our innovation. We've developed programs in the London market, which prearranged $50 million of capacity for clients across the world. We have launched for smaller commercial clients capability through our MGA. And through 9 months, we've had over 4,000 quotes with the take-up of around 15%. We're planting seeds in flood. We have a digital capability that will expand and position us differently in the small end of commercial. And so I think when Dan references the investments that we're making, it's about focusing on growth and efficiencies in order to enable us to invest more in growth over time. We feel like the company's really well positioned to do that."

Secondly, our growth markets in Asia, Middle East, Latin America are all growing very strongly. Third, we're expanding into new areas for us or building areas like data, analytics, a lot more around digital solutions, functional capabilities, operations, organizations, things like that. And then 2 other areas. I mean, we're expanding the size of our relationships. So the length and size of projects through a lot of work around client managements and development of our senior teams. And then finally, the Oliver Wyman brand is just growing in strength. The franchise is getting stronger. We think that will give us a boost over the years to come."

One, clearly, when you're buying back shares, you have a more immediate EPS impact, forgetting about revenue growth, but really just focusing on short-term delivery to shareholders. And acquisitions are more about building a company for the mid and long-term and, oftentimes, have a negative impact in the short-term on EPS either through amortization or restructuring charges or anything integration types of issues. We are absolutely focused, when we look at building our company through acquisition, on getting better. Either that's getting better by geography, by segment, by capability, we look at things which are growing at least as fast as we are and preferably faster than we are and companies that we can acquire at our multiple or lower. Now clearly, and you've heard it from many people before, the multiples have risen over the last 5 or 6 years. And so there's a tighter frame around execution, and you have to make sure that the perfume of an acquisition does not entice you to do something that shouldn't be done. But we are a very disciplined company. And as you can see, by not only our revenue growth, but also our earnings growth over a number of years across 120 acquisitions, that most of them are performing at or better than what our expectations have been."

It's a very good question, and that's why companies like ours have big controls and systems around managing growth in different places around the world. You can look at growth in the developing world in exactly the same way as you look at it in a developed world.

So from that -- and so we're open to the ability of more brokerage penetrations in even parts of the developed world.

The good things about intermediaries versus some capital providers in some of these territories, it's pretty inexpensive for us to plant a flag and have people on the ground and provide good levels of service. So our margins in the developing world are not that dissimilar to our margins in places where we have a lot of -- a lot more infrastructure. But we do look at the risk associated with growth.

Joining me on the call today is our CFO, Mark McGivney; Peter Zaffino, the Chairman of Risk and Insurance Services; Julio Portalatin, CEO of Mercer; Scott McDonald, CEO of Oliver Wyman; and Keith Walsh, Head of Investor Relations. 
I'll begin with a discussion of our third quarter and 9-month results, and then address our outlook for growth. MMC produced another strong quarter, delivering double-digit growth in adjusted EPS, with margin expansion in both Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting. Underlying revenue growth was 1%, driven by a decline at Oliver Wyman. 
Operating income rose 24%, or 16% on an adjusted basis. We have positioned the firm to deliver strong EPS growth in a variety of market environments as we actively manage expenses while investing for the future. Our ability to consistently grow earnings is a testament to our culture of execution and accountability throughout the firm. Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, third quarter underlying revenue rose 2%. Adjusted operating income increased double digits, with the adjusted margin expanding to 18.5%. 
In Consulting, underlying revenue growth of 3% at Mercer was offset by a 9% decline at Oliver Wyman. Earnings growth was strong, with adjusted operating income rising 8%, bringing the adjusted margin to 20.4%, the highest level in over 30 years. 
Through 9 months, we produced consolidated underlying revenue growth of 3%. The adjusted operating margin of the company and both operating segments expanded 100 basis points. Growth in earnings per share was 12%, with 8% growth in adjusted earnings per share. We were pleased with our year-to-date performance and are on track for a strong 2016. Over the last couple of years, we have seen volatility around commodity prices and foreign exchange, declining interest rates, weak global GDP growth, political instability and lower P&C insurance pricing. Despite this backdrop, we have produced significantly higher earnings growth than the S&P 500. In the current macro environment, where there may be a tendency to hunker down or become short-term focused, we remain focused on the mid- to long term. I remain positive about our prospects. I want to share with you what we are doing to position MMC for continued growth. 
We aspire to be recognized among the elite global growth companies. Our goal is to continue to produce higher returns at lower risk than the overall market. We continue to position the company for long-term revenue growth. Our optimism is driven by 3 factors: We are in growth businesses; we have consistently invested for growth; and we are harnessing the talent and power of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
First, we are well positioned in growth businesses. We are a trusted adviser, helping our clients not only address the critical issues of the day, but prepare for the issues of the future relating to risk, strategy and people. Our existing businesses are part of an expanding global pie that should drive greater demand for our advice and services over time. The strategic positioning of MMC has never been stronger. We firmly believe our businesses will continue to expand. The world is becoming more complex, and our clients are grappling with a number of issues relating to risk, strategy and people.
In many markets, there is limited penetration of insurance broking and consulting that will grow over time. And in many parts of the world, governments have taken on too much risk that could be more efficiently placed in the private market. And this carries beyond P&C insurance to include healthcare and retirement savings. We have the people, expertise and infrastructure to capitalize on these global trends across all of our operating companies. We have also made significant investments for growth over many years, both organic and through acquisitions. 
Since 2009, we have invested over $7 billion for growth and efficiency. This includes over 120 acquisitions approaching $5 billion, capital expenditures of $2.4 billion and the addition of over 10,000 colleagues. 
Our investments fall into 3 broad categories: geographic expansion, segmentation, and new capabilities and innovations. We expect these faster-growing businesses will become a larger proportion of the overall company over time, enhancing our long-term revenue growth.
Starting with geographic expansion, we have made substantial investments throughout Latin America and Africa as well as increased our presence in Asia and other emerging economies. These regions have been underserved by professional services and have higher long-term growth prospects relative to the developed world.
Another area of growth is developing new segments and specializations within existing businesses. At Marsh, we have had success with the mid-market strategy in the U.S. with our MMA platform and, more recently, in the U.K. with the acquisition of Jelf. Mercer has created growth segments in key areas, including investment management and its global Health & Benefits platforms. Guy Carpenter has grown specialist practices in areas such as mutuals, agriculture, medical and strategic advisory. And Oliver Wyman continues to invest in industry verticals where we see potential, such as the public sector, healthcare and financial services.
Many of our investments include new capabilities and innovations. Our data and analytics platforms continue to differentiate in the market across all of our operating companies. Consulting has generated strong growth from OW labs with its market-leading use of predictive analytics. 
Mercer has expanded its capabilities to include its Workday implementation business, the Pension Risk Exchange for pension buyouts, and is developing an array of digital and mobile solutions to serve clients.
Turning to RIS, flood, cyber and digital distribution are just a few of the areas that could represent faster growth for the segment.
Lastly, I want to touch on harnessing the power of MMC. We are a unique firm built around risk, strategy and people. There is no single company we compete against that matches the collective capabilities of our 4 operating companies. We view this as an enduring competitive advantage. We have made great strides in connecting the strengths of our operating companies in how we manage MMC, generate cost efficiencies and how we deliver value to clients.
Over the last several years, we have taken a significant number of structural steps to bring together the collective strength of MMC for clients. Some examples include forming Mercer Marsh benefits, which brings the best of Mercer and Marsh together in driving global benefit solutions outside the United States; bringing leadership of the RIS segment under Peter Zaffino; a more unified Oliver Wyman, which enhances the intellectual capital of MMC; promoting colleague mobility, in fact, in the past 3 years, approximately 3,000 colleagues have moved within the company; the formation of our strategic solutions group to deliver the full capabilities of MMC; and the establishment of chief country officers that help drive in-country collaboration. Taken together, these actions better position us for sustainable growth and profitability. No matter what the environment, we are always thinking about the mid and long term. And I believe MMC is better positioned today than at any time in its history.
In summary, we produced strong earnings growth in the third quarter and are on track to deliver another year of excellent financial performance in 2016. For the full year, we continue to expect underlying revenue growth, meaningful margin expansion in both segments and strong EPS growth, all this while continuing to invest in our future and return capital to shareholders through dividends and substantial share repurchase. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mark to review our third quarter results in more detail."

In the third quarter, MMC delivered strong earnings, producing double-digit growth in both GAAP and adjusted earnings per share.

In the third quarter, MMC delivered strong earnings, producing double-digit growth in both GAAP and adjusted earnings per share. Consolidated revenue increased 1% on both the reported and underlying basis. Operating income increased 24%, while adjusted operating income rose 16%. GAAP EPS rose 20% to $0.73, with adjusted EPS increasing 10% to $0.69. And our adjusted margin rose 240 basis points to 18%. 
As we stated on last quarter's call, you get a better sense of our underlying performance looking at margins and margin improvements on a year-to-date basis. 
Through 9 months, adjusted margins expanded 100 basis points overall and in each operating segment. 
Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, third quarter revenue rose 3% to $1.6 billion, with underlying growth of 2%. Adjusted operating income increased 22% to $302 million, and the margin expanded 280 basis points to 18.5%.
At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $1.4 billion, an increase of 4%. This solid growth reflects recent acquisitions, such as Jelf in the U.K., and ongoing activity in Marsh & McLennan agencies. On an underlying basis, revenue rose 2%. 
In the U.S./Canada division, underlying growth was 3%, driven primarily by strong new business in the U.S. 
In the International division, underlying growth was 2%. 
EMEA was flat, with growth in the U.K. offset by Europe and the Middle East. Asia Pacific was up 2%, and Latin America had strong growth of 9%, which came on top of 6% growth in last year's third quarter.
Guy Carpenter's revenue was $260 million, flat on both the reported and underlying basis. EMEA and Global Specialties, led by Marine, had positive trends in the quarter. Year-to-date, underlying revenue growth was 2%.
In the Consulting segment, underlying revenue was flat, reflecting growth at Mercer offset by a decline at Oliver Wyman.
As we've discussed on prior calls, we've built a model where Oliver Wyman's compensation is performance-sensitive. So their expense base, which is largely compensation and benefits, naturally flexes with their revenue. Whether up or down, Oliver Wyman has much more of a revenue impact on MMC than an earnings impact.
Consulting's adjusted operating income increased 8% to $309 million, which represents the highest level of profitability for any quarter in Consulting's history. The adjusted operating margin expanded 190 basis points to 20.4%. Mercer's underlying revenue increased 3% to $1.1 billion. Solid performance in the quarter continues to reflect the benefits of a diversified portfolio. Investments and Talent both rose 7%, Health increased 2% and Retirement was flat. 
On a geographic basis, revenue increased in all major regions for both the third quarter and 9 months. 
In our Mercer Marketplace 365 benefits platform, we are providing access for approximately 1.5 million lives, flat with last year. We have consistently talked about how Mercer Marketplace is not a material contributor to our overall results, and we don't expect it will be in the near term. However, we remain positive regarding the long-term growth potential of our Health & Benefits business.
As we anticipated on last quarter's call, Oliver Wyman had a decline in underlying revenue in the third quarter. This was driven by comparisons to very strong growth in the financial service practice last year as well as global growth concerns, exacerbated by Brexit uncertainty. Oliver Wyman's revenue was $404 million, a decline of 9% on an underlying basis.
In the fourth quarter, we expect Oliver Wyman's revenue growth to be relatively flat with last year. As we look ahead to the first quarter of next year, recall that Oliver Wyman generated 15% growth in the first quarter of this year.
Overall, we continue to expect that for 2016, MMC will generate underlying revenue growth, increased operating margins in both segments and strong growth in earnings per share.
Next, I'd like to update you on changes we will be making to our U.S. retirement plan. We recently decided to close our U.S. defined benefit plan effective December 31, 2016, and freeze future benefit accruals. In their place, we will implement an enhanced defined contribution plan effective January 2017. These actions are consistent with our global benefits philosophy of providing competitive benefits and a preference for DC over DB.
This represents the latest of several actions we've taken around retirement benefits in the last 3 years. With the closing of the U.S. DB plan, we will have capped the growth of benefit accruals for the vast majority of our global pension liabilities, which reduces risk and volatility. The timing and nature of this announcement requires that we revisit the assumptions used at year-end 2015 and remeasure our U.S. pension liabilities in the fourth quarter. Based on current assumptions, including lower interest rates, we expect to incur incremental pension expense of $0.01 or so in the fourth quarter. This additional expense will be included in our adjusted EPS.
Last quarter, I mentioned that although the decline in global interest rates could mean higher pension expense in 2017, we were planning for this risk and expected we would be able to effectively mitigate any increase. Based on the environment today, we continue to believe we will be able to mitigate any pension expense volatility in 2017.
Moving to foreign exchange. In the third quarter, the effective foreign exchange on adjusted EPS was a slight positive. Assuming exchange rates remain at their current levels, we expect FX to be immaterial in the fourth quarter, resulting in a de minimis impact for the full year.
We have seen continued volatility in the British pound. But as we discussed last quarter, a weakening pound generally has a minimal overall impact to MMC over the course of the year. This is because RIS has a natural hedge created by U.S. dollar placements in London. While the impact of a weakening pound to MMC in total is not significant, there is a benefit to RIS, offset by an adverse impact to Consulting. Investment income was negligible in the third quarter and was down $34 million or about $0.04 per share from last year. 
For the full year of 2016, we expect investment income to be immaterial compared with $38 million in 2015.
As you may remember, we have a substantially smaller private equity portfolio following the liquidation of Trident III in 2015. As a result, we expect to generate only modest investment income going forward.
Our adjusted tax rate in the third quarter was 28.7% compared to 28.4% in last year's third quarter. Through the first 9 months of 2016, our adjusted tax rate was 28.8% compared with 28.5% for the same period last year. 
Based on the current landscape, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29% for the remainder of 2016.
Corporate debt at September 30 was $4.8 billion, unchanged from the end of June. Our next debt maturity is $250 million of notes due next April. 
In the third quarter, we repurchased 3 million shares of our stock for $200 million. Through 9 months, we used $625 million to buy back 10 million shares. 
Third quarter marks the 18th consecutive quarter we have bought back our stock, and we have reduced shares outstanding 10 quarters in a row. Since announcing our commitment to reduce our annual share count at Investor Day in March 2014, shares outstanding have declined by 33 million or 6%. 
Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was $1.4 billion, of which approximately $400 million was in the U.S. Uses of cash in the third quarter totaled $440 million and included $200 million for share repurchases, $178 million for dividends and $62 million for acquisitions.
For the 9 months, uses of cash totaled $1.4 billion and included $625 million for share repurchases, $504 million for acquisitions and $229 million -- I'm sorry, $504 million for dividends and $229 million for acquisitions. 
For the full year 2016, we continue to expect to deploy roughly $2.3 billion of capital through dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions. We also expect to deliver on our annual capital return commitments to reduce our share count and increase our dividends per share by double digits. With that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan."

We grow revenues faster than expenses virtually all the time. And when that's not the case, it's purposeful and it's planned for. We've said before that you shouldn't really look at margin expansion in an individual quarter. It's more important and more meaningful to look at it over a longer stretch of time, year-to-date basis or rolling 4 quarters, something like that. If you look on a year-to-date basis, the company overall is up 100 basis points against 3% overall growth for the company, and each of the segments is also up 100 basis points. And I think that's more indicative of where our margin expansion really is. So I wouldn't take the dramatic expansion in the third quarter as the new reality going forward."

The core U.S. was a strong contributor, and Canada was less of a headwind. In terms of leadership, I will start with John Doyle. John has had a material impact since he has arrived at Marsh. There's no executive that I'm aware of that knows more of our clients and has been heavily engaged in working with clients, working with our colleagues and focusing on top line growth. Martin South has been with Marsh for many years and is a very established leader. His most positive attributes are how he grows businesses and his innovation. And he has had a positive impact on the U.S./Canada division as well. It's early days for him, but expect the combination of John's arrival and Martin's arrival in the United States is going to have a really positive impact for our ability to grow the business in the future."

I think I'll handle it a little bit, and then walk around with our opcos and have them talk a little bit about their feelings about growth because I really do think that's the core issue. Now clearly, macro factors have been challenging for a number of years, but we've managed to grow underlying revenue in the 3% to 5% range for the past 6 years. 3% to 5% is the likely outcome for us in 2016 as well, with 3% through 9 months. But being 3% through 9 months, we would look at it as we're likely on the lower end of that range for the year. But there's a lot going on underneath it. So why don't we start with Peter, and then I'll move to Julio and then Scott just to talk about their growth outlook a little bit. So Peter?"

And we have had terrific retention on clients. The next is, certainly, are you winning new business in the market? And when I look at our new business growth, I'm really pleased with what we see across the world, many contributions from many countries, and we've been able to grow the business quite well. When we look at -- again, there's definitely been some headwinds in the market with global macroeconomic issues as well as insurance pricing. They've largely been headwinds. But then I look -- we've been able to grow in 26 consecutive quarters of underlying organic growth. So the business is built to drive underlying organic growth. You've mentioned a couple of places where we're growing. They're not material to the overall today, but we're excited about it. Cyber is a big part of our innovation. We've developed programs in the London market, which prearranged $50 million of capacity for clients across the world. We have launched for smaller commercial clients capability through our MGA. And through 9 months, we've had over 4,000 quotes with a take-up of around 15%. We're planting seeds in flood. We have a digital capability that will expand and position us differently in the small end of commercial. And so I think when Dan references the investments that we're making, it's about focusing on growth and efficiencies in order to enable us to invest more in growth over time. We feel like the company's really well positioned to do that."

One, clearly, when you're buying back shares, you have a more immediate EPS impact, forgetting about revenue growth, but really just focusing on short-term delivery to shareholders. And acquisitions are more about building a company for the mid and long term and, oftentimes, have a negative impact in the short term on EPS, either through amortization or restructuring charges or anything -- integration types of issues. We are absolutely focused, when we look at building our company through acquisition, on getting better. Either that's getting better by geography, by segment, by capability. We look at things which are growing at least as fast as we are, and preferably faster than we are, and companies that we can acquire at our multiple or lower. Now clearly, and you've heard it from many people before, the multiples have risen over the last 5 or 6 years. And so there's a tighter frame around execution, and you have to make sure that the perfume of an acquisition does not entice you to do something that shouldn't be done. But we are a very disciplined company. And as you can see by not only our revenue growth, but also our earnings growth over a number of years across 120 acquisitions, that most of them are performing at or better than what our expectations have been."

The good things about intermediaries versus some capital providers in some of these territories, it's pretty inexpensive for us to plant a flag and have people on the ground and provide good levels of service.

Joining me on the call today is our CFO, Mark McGivney; Peter Zaffino, the Chairman of Risk and Insurance Services; Julio Portalatin, CEO of Mercer; Scott McDonald, CEO of Oliver Wyman; and Keith Walsh, Head of Investor Relations. 
I'll begin with a discussion of our third quarter and 9-month results, and then address our outlook for growth. MMC produced another strong quarter, delivering double-digit growth in adjusted EPS, with margin expansion in both Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting. Underlying revenue growth was 1%, driven by a decline at Oliver Wyman. 
Operating income rose 24%, or 16% on an adjusted basis. We have positioned the firm to deliver strong EPS growth in a variety of market environments as we actively manage expenses while investing for the future. Our ability to consistently grow earnings is a testament to our culture of execution and accountability throughout the firm. Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, third quarter underlying revenue rose 2%. Adjusted operating income increased double digits, with the adjusted margin expanding to 18.5%. 
In Consulting, underlying revenue growth of 3% at Mercer was offset by a 9% decline at Oliver Wyman. Earnings growth was strong, with adjusted operating income rising 8%, bringing the adjusted margin to 20.4%, the highest level in over 30 years. 
Through 9 months, we produced consolidated underlying revenue growth of 3%. The adjusted operating margin of the company and both operating segments expanded 100 basis points. Growth in earnings per share was 12%, with 8% growth in adjusted earnings per share. We were pleased with our year-to-date performance and are on track for a strong 2016. Over the last couple of years, we have seen volatility around commodity prices and foreign exchange, declining interest rates, weak global GDP growth, political instability and lower P&C insurance pricing. Despite this backdrop, we have produced significantly higher earnings growth than the S&P 500. In the current macro environment, where there may be a tendency to hunker down or become short-term focused, we remain focused on the mid- to long term. I remain positive about our prospects. I want to share with you what we are doing to position MMC for continued growth. 
We aspire to be recognized among the elite global growth companies. Our goal is to continue to produce higher returns at lower risk than the overall market. We continue to position the company for long-term revenue growth. Our optimism is driven by 3 factors: We are in growth businesses; we have consistently invested for growth; and we are harnessing the talent and power of Marsh & McLennan Companies.
First, we are well positioned in growth businesses. We are a trusted adviser, helping our clients not only address the critical issues of the day, but prepare for the issues of the future relating to risk, strategy and people. Our existing businesses are part of an expanding global pie that should drive greater demand for our advice and services over time. The strategic positioning of MMC has never been stronger. We firmly believe our businesses will continue to expand. The world is becoming more complex, and our clients are grappling with a number of issues relating to risk, strategy and people.
In many markets, there is limited penetration of insurance broking and consulting that will grow over time. And in many parts of the world, governments have taken on too much risk that could be more efficiently placed in the private market. And this carries beyond P&C insurance to include healthcare and retirement savings. We have the people, expertise and infrastructure to capitalize on these global trends across all of our operating companies. We have also made significant investments for growth over many years, both organic and through acquisitions. 
Since 2009, we have invested over $7 billion for growth and efficiency. This includes over 120 acquisitions approaching $5 billion, capital expenditures of $2.4 billion and the addition of over 10,000 colleagues. 
Our investments fall into 3 broad categories: geographic expansion, segmentation, and new capabilities and innovations. We expect these faster-growing businesses will become a larger proportion of the overall company over time, enhancing our long-term revenue growth.
Starting with geographic expansion, we have made substantial investments throughout Latin America and Africa as well as increased our presence in Asia and other emerging economies. These regions have been underserved by professional services and have higher long-term growth prospects relative to the developed world.
Another area of growth is developing new segments and specializations within existing businesses. At Marsh, we have had success with the mid-market strategy in the U.S. with our MMA platform and, more recently, in the U.K. with the acquisition of Jelf. Mercer has created growth segments in key areas, including investment management and its global Health & Benefits platforms. Guy Carpenter has grown specialist practices in areas such as mutuals, agriculture, medical and strategic advisory. And Oliver Wyman continues to invest in industry verticals where we see potential, such as the public sector, healthcare and financial services.
Many of our investments include new capabilities and innovations. Our data and analytics platforms continue to differentiate in the market across all of our operating companies. Consulting has generated strong growth from OW labs with its market-leading use of predictive analytics. 
Mercer has expanded its capabilities to include its Workday implementation business, the Pension Risk Exchange for pension buyouts, and is developing an array of digital and mobile solutions to serve clients.
Turning to RIS, flood, cyber and digital distribution are just a few of the areas that could represent faster growth for the segment.
Lastly, I want to touch on harnessing the power of MMC. We are a unique firm built around risk, strategy and people. There is no single company we compete against that matches the collective capabilities of our 4 operating companies. We view this as an enduring competitive advantage. We have made great strides in connecting the strengths of our operating companies in how we manage MMC, generate cost efficiencies and how we deliver value to clients.
Over the last several years, we have taken a significant number of structural steps to bring together the collective strength of MMC for clients. Some examples include forming Mercer Marsh benefits, which brings the best of Mercer and Marsh together in driving global benefit solutions outside the United States; bringing leadership of the RIS segment under Peter Zaffino; a more unified Oliver Wyman, which enhances the intellectual capital of MMC; promoting colleague mobility, in fact, in the past 3 years, approximately 3,000 colleagues have moved within the company; the formation of our strategic solutions group to deliver the full capabilities of MMC; and the establishment of chief country officers that help drive in-country collaboration. Taken together, these actions better position us for sustainable growth and profitability. No matter what the environment, we are always thinking about the mid and long term. And I believe MMC is better positioned today than at any time in its history.
In summary, we produced strong earnings growth in the third quarter and are on track to deliver another year of excellent financial performance in 2016. For the full year, we continue to expect underlying revenue growth, meaningful margin expansion in both segments and strong EPS growth, all this while continuing to invest in our future and return capital to shareholders through dividends and substantial share repurchase. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mark to review our third quarter results in more detail."

In the third quarter, MMC delivered strong earnings, producing double-digit growth in both GAAP and adjusted earnings per share. Consolidated revenue increased 1% on both the reported and underlying basis. Opera",1363,"Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, MMC delivered strong earnings, producing double-digit growth in both GAAP and adjusted earnings per share. Consolidated revenue increased 1% on both the reported and underlying basis. Operating income increased 24%, while adjusted operating income rose 16%. GAAP EPS rose 20% to $0.73, with adjusted EPS increasing 10% to $0.69. And our adjusted margin rose 240 basis points to 18%. 
As we stated on last quarter's call, you get a better sense of our underlying performance looking at margins and margin improvements on a year-to-date basis. 
Through 9 months, adjusted margins expanded 100 basis points overall and in each operating segment. 
Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, third quarter revenue rose 3% to $1.6 billion, with underlying growth of 2%. Adjusted operating income increased 22% to $302 million, and the margin expanded 280 basis points to 18.5%.
At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $1.4 billion, an increase of 4%. This solid growth reflects recent acquisitions, such as Jelf in the U.K., and ongoing activity in Marsh & McLennan agencies. On an underlying basis, revenue rose 2%. 
In the U.S./Canada division, underlying growth was 3%, driven primarily by strong new business in the U.S. 
In the International division, underlying growth was 2%. 
EMEA was flat, with growth in the U.K. offset by Europe and the Middle East. Asia Pacific was up 2%, and Latin America had strong growth of 9%, which came on top of 6% growth in last year's third quarter.
Guy Carpenter's revenue was $260 million, flat on both the reported and underlying basis. EMEA and Global Specialties, led by Marine, had positive trends in the quarter. Year-to-date, underlying revenue growth was 2%.
In the Consulting segment, underlying revenue was flat, reflecting growth at Mercer offset by a decline at Oliver Wyman.
As we've discussed on prior calls, we've built a model where Oliver Wyman's compensation is performance-sensitive. So their expense base, which is largely compensation and benefits, naturally flexes with their revenue. Whether up or down, Oliver Wyman has much more of a revenue impact on MMC than an earnings impact.
Consulting's adjusted operating income increased 8% to $309 million, which represents the highest level of profitability for any quarter in Consulting's history. The adjusted operating margin expanded 190 basis points to 20.4%. Mercer's underlying revenue increased 3% to $1.1 billion. Solid performance in the quarter continues to reflect the benefits of a diversified portfolio. Investments and Talent both rose 7%, Health increased 2% and Retirement was flat. 
On a geographic basis, revenue increased in all major regions for both the third quarter and 9 months. 
In our Mercer Marketplace 365 benefits platform, we are providing access for approximately 1.5 million lives, flat with last year. We have consistently talked about how Mercer Marketplace is not a material contributor to our overall results, and we don't expect it will be in the near term. However, we remain positive regarding the long-term growth potential of our Health & Benefits business.
As we anticipated on last quarter's call, Oliver Wyman had a decline in underlying revenue in the third quarter. This was driven by comparisons to very strong growth in the financial service practice last year as well as global growth concerns, exacerbated by Brexit uncertainty. Oliver Wyman's revenue was $404 million, a decline of 9% on an underlying basis.
In the fourth quarter, we expect Oliver Wyman's revenue growth to be relatively flat with last year. As we look ahead to the first quarter of next year, recall that Oliver Wyman generated 15% growth in the first quarter of this year.
Overall, we continue to expect that for 2016, MMC will generate underlying revenue growth, increased operating margins in both segments and strong growth in earnings per share.
Next, I'd like to update you on changes we will be making to our U.S. retirement plan. We recently decided to close our U.S. defined benefit plan effective December 31, 2016, and freeze future benefit accruals. In their place, we will implement an enhanced defined contribution plan effective January 2017. These actions are consistent with our global benefits philosophy of providing competitive benefits and a preference for DC over DB.
This represents the latest of several actions we've taken around retirement benefits in the last 3 years. With the closing of the U.S. DB plan, we will have capped the growth of benefit accruals for the vast majority of our global pension liabilities, which reduces risk and volatility. The timing and nature of this announcement requires that we revisit the assumptions used at year-end 2015 and remeasure our U.S. pension liabilities in the fourth quarter. Based on current assumptions, including lower interest rates, we expect to incur incremental pension expense of $0.01 or so in the fourth quarter. This additional expense will be included in our adjusted EPS.
Last quarter, I mentioned that although the decline in global interest rates could mean higher pension expense in 2017, we were planning for this risk and expected we would be able to effectively mitigate any increase. Based on the environment today, we continue to believe we will be able to mitigate any pension expense volatility in 2017.
Moving to foreign exchange. In the third quarter, the effective foreign exchange on adjusted EPS was a slight positive. Assuming exchange rates remain at their current levels, we expect FX to be immaterial in the fourth quarter, resulting in a de minimis impact for the full year.
We have seen continued volatility in the British pound. But as we discussed last quarter, a weakening pound generally has a minimal overall impact to MMC over the course of the year. This is because RIS has a natural hedge created by U.S. dollar placements in London. While the impact of a weakening pound to MMC in total is not significant, there is a benefit to RIS, offset by an adverse impact to Consulting. Investment income was negligible in the third quarter and was down $34 million or about $0.04 per share from last year. 
For the full year of 2016, we expect investment income to be immaterial compared with $38 million in 2015.
As you may remember, we have a substantially smaller private equity portfolio following the liquidation of Trident III in 2015. As a result, we expect to generate only modest investment income going forward.
Our adjusted tax rate in the third quarter was 28.7% compared to 28.4% in last year's third quarter. Through the first 9 months of 2016, our adjusted tax rate was 28.8% compared with 28.5% for the same period last year. 
Based on the current landscape, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of 29% for the remainder of 2016.
Corporate debt at September 30 was $4.8 billion, unchanged from the end of June. Our next debt maturity is $250 million of notes due next April. 
In the third quarter, we repurchased 3 million shares of our stock for $200 million. Through 9 months, we used $625 million to buy back 10 million shares. 
Third quarter marks the 18th consecutive quarter we have bought back our stock, and we have reduced shares outstanding 10 quarters in a row. Since announcing our commitment to reduce our annual share count at Investor Day in March 2014, shares outstanding have declined by 33 million or 6%. 
Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was $1.4 billion, of which approximately $400 million was in the U.S. Uses of cash in the third quarter totaled $440 million and included $200 million for share repurchases, $178 million for dividends and $62 million for acquisitions.
For the 9 months, uses of cash totaled $1.4 billion and included $625 million for share repurchases, $504 million for acquisitions and $229 million -- I'm sorry, $504 million for dividends and $229 million for acquisitions. 
For the full year 2016, we continue to expect to deploy roughly $2.3 billion of capital through dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions. We also expect to deliver on our annual capital return commitments to reduce our share count and increase our dividends per share by double digits. With that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan."

We've said before that you shouldn't really look at margin expansion in an individual quarter. It's more important and more meaningful to look at it over a longer stretch of time, year-to-date basis or rolling 4 quarters, something like that. If you look on a year-to-date basis, the company overall is up 100 basis points against 3% overall growth for the company, and each of the segments is also up 100 basis points. And I think that's more indicative of where our margin expansion really is. So I wouldn't take the dramatic expansion in the third quarter as the new reality going forward."

There's no executive that I'm aware of that knows more of our clients and has been heavily engaged in working with clients, working with our colleagues and focusing on top line growth. Martin South has been with Marsh for many years and is a very established leader. His most positive attributes are how he grows businesses and his innovation.

I'd start by saying that we're a company that cares deeply for our colleagues. So we don't take pension decisions lightly. Several years ago, we adopted a general philosophy that favors DC plans over DB. And we actually wrote a document and published it within our HR department. And that philosophy had more to do with risk and volatility than with P&L or cash contribution considerations. You may recall that in 2014, we closed and froze our U.K. plans. The U.K. plans were our highest, largest clients, and they represented about 50% of our overall global plan liabilities. And so we really, over the course of the last 18 months or so, confronted ourselves as a global firm and basically said that we had an obligation to follow the same philosophy, which was favoring DC in the U.S., as we do in the rest of the world. So it was more to do with being a global firm, not a U.S. multinational, that we made this decision."

But being 3% through 9 months, we would look at it as we're likely on the lower end of that range for the year. But there's a lot going on underneath it.

When we look at -- again, there's definitely been some headwinds in the market with global macroeconomic issues as well as insurance pricing. They've largely been headwinds. But then I look -- we've been able to grow in 26 consecutive quarters of underlying organic growth. So the business is built to drive underlying organic growth. You've mentioned a couple of places where we're growing. They're not material to the overall today, but we're excited about it. Cyber is a big part of our innovation. We've developed programs in the London market, which prearranged $50 million of capacity for clients across the world. We have launched for smaller commercial clients capability through our MGA. And through 9 months, we've had over 4,000 quotes with a take-up of around 15%. We're planting seeds in flood. We have a digital capability that will expand and position us differently in the small end of commercial. And so I think when Dan references the investments that we're making, it's about focusing on growth and efficiencies in order to enable us to invest more in growth over time.

One, clearly, when you're buying back shares, you have a more immediate EPS impact, forgetting about revenue growth, but really just focusing on short-term delivery to shareholders. And acquisitions are more about building a company for the mid and long term and, oftentimes, have a negative impact in the short term on EPS, either through amortization or restructuring charges or anything -- integration types of issues. We are absolutely focused, when we look at building our company through acquisition, on getting better. Either that's getting better by geography, by segment, by capability. We look at things which are growing at least as fast as we are, and preferably faster than we are, and companies that we can acquire at our multiple or lower. Now clearly, and you've heard it from many people before, the multiples have risen over the last 5 or 6 years. And so there's a tighter frame around execution, and you have to make sure that the perfume of an acquisition does not entice you to do something that shouldn't be done. But we are a very disciplined company. And as you can see by not only our revenue growth, but also our earnings growth over a number of years across 120 acquisitions, that most of them are performing at or better than what our expectations have been."

It's a very good question, and that's why companies like ours have big controls and systems around managing growth in different places around the world. You can't look at growth in the developing world in exactly the same way as you look at it in the developed world. We actually believe we have opportunities for growth throughout the developed and developing world. And in fact, some of our strongest areas of growth over the last year or so has come from pretty traditional countries like Japan and Germany. So from that -- and so we're open to the ability of more brokerage penetrations in even parts of the developed world. In taking your question, if we were growing super strong in certain countries, we would -- you can grow too fast at certain places, too. The good things about intermediaries versus some capital providers in some of these territories, it's pretty inexpensive for us to plant a flag and have people on the ground and provide good levels of service. So our margins in the developing world are not that dissimilar to our margins in places where we have a lot of -- a lot more infrastructure. But we do look at the risk associated with growth. In fact, if you look at our executive team, we essentially work on 4 categories of issues: growth strategies, financial performance, people issues and risk issues. That occupies almost all of the time of the executive committee. And so risk is always on the table when we're looking at growth. Any other question?"

As we've said, we had good growth in the U.K. It was offset by Continental Europe and the Middle East. There were a few discrete items.

But generally, over the last several years, there is a very tight relationship between our GAAP results and our adjusted results.

Having said that, every time we bring in new leadership, we try to get them to -- I know Peter and I in particular, and Julio as well, we're open to the idea of looking at our businesses with fresh eyes, particularly when we bring new executive talent in to try to figure out ways of being more efficient and to make decisions that would reduce our cost and improve our capabilities. So I never want to say that we'll never dip into that sort of thing, where we have a restructuring charge or something. But ultimately, I would say that for a number of years, we are much tighter than the S&P 500 in terms of the relationship between GAAP results and adjusted results. But Mark, do you have something to add to that?"

Very similar to what we saw in the second quarter. I mean, if you take the pieces, you think about the $125 million credit we had last year that was onetime and how we talked about this year expense going down to replace that, and overall for the year retirement expense being down about $30 million. So you take that full package, it gives you sort of the underlying drop in pension expense for the year. That is a good baseline, as we've talked about, and it happens pretty ratably over the course of the year. So I think with those pieces, you can get at the rough impact of the quarter. But as we've said earlier, even if you take out the benefit in the quarter, the underlying performance of the business was very strong. So even without any retirement benefit, both segments had strong performance in the quarter."
