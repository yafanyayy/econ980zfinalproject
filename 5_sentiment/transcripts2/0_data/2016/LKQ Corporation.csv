Good morning, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We are again delighted with our quarterly and full year results and before I provide an update on our operations, let me briefly highlight a few key financial metrics from the fourth quarter and full the full year 2015. 
Turning to Slide 3. Q4 revenue reached $1.75 billion, an increase of 3.8% as compared to $1.68 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. Excluding the impact to our other revenue category, revenue grew 8% for the quarter. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $95.1 million, an increase of 18.1% as compared to $80.5 million for the same period of 2014. Diluted earnings per share of $0.31 for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015, increased 19.2% from $0.26 for the fourth quarter of 2014, while adjusted EPS increased from $0.27 to $0.32. 
Organic revenue growth for parts and services, was 6.2% for the quarter and on a constant currency basis, total growth for parts and services was 10.9%. I am particularly pleased with our EPS performance given that the effect from FX and weakness in commodity prices, which combined, negatively impacted the year-over-year change in EPS by $0.03.
For full year 2015, revenue reached $7.19 billion, an increase of 6.7% as compared to 2014. For the first time ever, revenues surpasses $7 billion, a major milestone for the company. Net income for the full year was $423.2 million compared with $381.5 million for the prior year, an increase of 10.9%. 
Organic revenue growth for parts and services for 2015 was 7%, a solid performance given the tough comp of 9% in 2014. On a constant currency basis, total revenue growth for 2015 was 10.1%, while total revenue growth for parts and services was 14.1%. Our adjusted EPS for all of 2015 was $1.42, representing an increase of 11.8% from $1.27 reported in 2014, again, net of the adverse impact of FX in commodity pricing.
Now a brief update on our operations, which are highlighted on Slides 6 and 7. During the quarter, our North American operations continue to benefit from various macro trends. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, miles driven was up 3.5% in 2015 as compared to 2014. Miles driven in 2015 was the highest number reported since 1990. With low gas prices and ongoing improvements in unemployment rate, we do expect a continuation of this trend. 
Though initially a headwind, as newer vehicles requiring repair tend to receive new OE parts, the increase in the SAAR rate presents attractive growth prospects for alternative products at these vehicles age. The SAAR rate for 2015 was 17.4 million units compared to 16.4 million units for 2014, a 6.1% increase year-over-year. Auto industry analysts expect this trend to continue in 2016, which again, should be good for our North American collision businesses as well as our Specialty segment. 
These trends help drive North American organic growth for parts and services of 5.6% in Q4, despite the mild weather patterns we faced throughout December. During Q4, and for full year 2015, we purchased over 73,000 and 288,000 vehicles, respectively, for dismantling by our wholesale operations, which is essentially flat year-over-year for both periods.
During Q4, our pricing auction was flat compared to Q4 2014 but we were also buying a younger vehicle by over 1 year. This younger vehicle procurement strategy continues to perform well and play a role in the improvements we witnessed in Q4 year-over-year in North American gross margins. 
For our North American aftermarket business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 13.2% and 32.2%, respectively, in 2015. 
In our self-service retail business. During Q4, we acquired over 112,000 lower-cost self-service and crush-only cars, which is a 4% decrease over Q4 2014. For full year 2015, vehicle procurement was approximately 471,000, a decrease of 8.4% from 2014. As mentioned on past calls, this reduction in the self-service procurement was intentional given of dynamics we faced with the scrap market throughout the year. Nick will provide more detail on scrap during his comments and in particular, its impact on revenue.
Turning to the 2015 results of our ongoing intelligent parts solution initiative with CCC Information Services, the revenue and number of purchase orders processed through the CCC platform during 2015, each grew 66%, respectively, year-over-year. Clearly, the trend toward shop adopting this feature within the CCC platform continues to gain traction with this initiative currently annualizing over $28 million in revenue for LKQ.
And last on North America, I want to provide an update on our productivity initiatives to identify potential operational efficiencies. As mentioned in previous calls, we've identified several significant opportunities in 4 key areas, with one of them being procurement. During the quarter, Alix Partners, led an and internal focus group test with assessing our current maintenance, repair and operations, or MRO, and indirect spend categories, and the details behind what we can change or can consolidate. Following this extensive analysis, we modified and redefined several positions within our procurement team in an attempt to optimize our ability to capture the potential savings uncovered. But early in the process, we are extremely encouraged by the savings we could achieve in areas of both direct spend on aftermarket parts and the MRO and the indirect spend categories, such as logistics, corrugated boxings -- boxes and shipment supplies, vehicle rentals, IT hardware and various services. While it'll take a few quarters for the savings on parts purchases to be realized and roll to our inventory turns, we anticipate that we will begin to realize some of the savings on the other items in late Q1 of this year. 
Now moving on to our European operations. In Q4, our Europe segment had organic revenue growth of 6.3% and acquisition growth of 5%, which was offset by a decrease of 6.7% related to foreign exchange rates. 
During Q4, DCP drove organic revenue growth of 8.9% and for branches opened more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 6.8%. Solid performance came in at the U.K. and witnessed one of the warmest and most mild winters since 1985. During the quarter ECP opened one additional branch, bringing our U.K. network to 199, an increase of 110 branches since we acquired ECP. With the continued market opportunities in the U.K., I am pleased to announce that we approved an additional 13 branches in 2016. 
During Q4, collision parts sales in ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 21.2%. I am pleased with the continued double-digit performance in this line of business, especially given the mild Q4 weather in the U.K. and a tough 2014 comp.
And lastly on ECP, I'd like to provide a brief update on our new 750,000 square foot national distribution warehouse currently under development in the U.K. Upon completion of the building shell in early February 2016, we began our lease payments and also started absorbing duplicate expenses that will continue through 2017 as we begin to move towards finalizing the full consolidation of our existing NDCs into this state-of-the-art facility. Nick will cover the impact of those cost shortly. 
During Q1, we began installing interior racking in preparation for using the facility for bulk storage in Q2 with the automation and more sophisticated storage spaces scheduled to be completed in 2017.
For the quarter and for full year 2015, we did not incur any material cost related to this project.
And now turning to our business. With the network buildup in the Netherlands largely completed via combination of acquisitions and innovative partnering solutions, Sator has now turned its focus towards integrating the systems in place and the wholesale level. By year end 2016, we plan to have consolidated from 6 systems to 2 with integrated end-to-end inventory and customer visibility, a key enabler for driving logistical and working capital improvements in the business. 
And now to our Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment continued its strong performance by posting year-over-year total revenue growth of 16.2% in the quarter, including the benefits of the Coast acquisition and strong organic revenue growth of 8.1%. 
During the quarter, all integration activities from the Coast acquisition continued as planned. In total, our Specialty team integrated 5 of the 17 Coast warehouses into our existing KAO distribution centers with 2 additional warehouses integrated in January. 
In addition, during Q4, our Specialty team stocked the 360,000 square foot warehouse in Michigan mentioned in the previous call and in January, we officially began shipping product from this facility. I am also pleased to announce that in 2015, the Specialty team achieved 2 significant milestones. For the first time Specialty eclipsed $1 billion annual revenue and made over 1 million delivery stops. Congratulations to our Specialty team for reaching such an impressive milestone.
Now on to corporate development. In December 2015, the company announced that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Rhiag-Inter Auto Parts, a leading pan-European business-to-business distributor of aftermarket spare parts for passenger cars and commercial vehicles for enterprise value of EUR 1.04 billion. This acquisition gives us access in a rapidly growing Eastern European market and, of course, Italy, where base business is well positioned for continued growth beyond their current 15% market share. 
The targeted closing for Rhiag is progressing as expected with all the filings required by the EU and Ukraine regulatory authorities submitted, accepted and deemed complete. Both the regulatory agencies are now in the final review process and we anticipate this deal to close in the first half of 2016.
In addition to the Rhiag announcement during the fourth quarter of 2015, we acquired a wholesale salvage business in Sweden and an interest in a pan-European distributor and remanufacturer of engines and powertrain products. 
Lastly, earlier this month, the company sold its interests at ACM Parts, our JV in Australia to our JV partner, Sun Corp. LKQ played a pivotal role in the provision of ECM parts and we will continue to have a strong working relationship with the business. Key formal strategic alliances between ACM parts and LKQ, particularly those related to aftermarket parts sourcing and technology, will remain in place. This transaction allows us to maintain a presence in Australia, while redeploying our capital, both human and financial towards the multiple opportunities we have in Europe.
Clearly, 2015 was another very active year with our development efforts resulting in the completion of 18 acquisitions, which, combined, expanded our geographic footprint and extended our leadership position in each of our operating segments.
At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more detail and perspective on our financial results and our 2016 guidance."
4303924,324673445,940537,"LKQ Corp., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2016",2016-02-25,"Earnings Calls","LKQ Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'm delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter. Over the next few minutes, I will address of the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of the 3",2758,"Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'm delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter. Over the next few minutes, I will address of the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of the 3 segments before touching on the balance sheet and addressing our guidance for 2016. For those of you who access our earnings presentation on the website, you will notice that we have included detail on both the fourth quarter and the December 31, as well as the full year of 2015. My comments will generally follow the flow of presentation but as usual, I will primarily focus on quarterly results. 
The short version of our financial performance in the fourth quarter of the 2015 would be a repeat of the third quarter. Same for our self-service operation, we had a great quarter in which we experienced solid revenue and earnings growth, despite the continued headwinds from lower scrap prices and strong dollar. 
As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.75 billion, representing a 3.8% increase over last year. That reflects an 8% increase in revenue from parts and services, offset, in part, by a 38% decline in other revenue, primarily related to the continued decline in prices for scrap, steel and other metals, which I will address in a few minutes. 
The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 6.2% growth from organic activities, plus 4.7% from acquisitions, equating to a constant currency growth of 10.9%, before backing out the translation impact of FX, which was a 2.9% decline. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each business as I walk through the segment results. 
As noted on Slide 11 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins improved 40 basis points to 39.9% during the quarter. The reflected approximately a 50 basis point improvement from operations, offset by a 10 basis point decline due to revenue mix as the revenue growth in our Specialty business, which has the lowest gross margin structure, outpaced that of our other operations. 
We lost about 20 basis points of efficiencies in our operating expenses, again, largely due to our self-service operations. This operation continue to experience a meaningful decline in revenue related to the lower scrap steel prices and an uptick in expenses, the combination of which resulted in materially higher cost as a percent of revenue in each expense category. 
Outside of the impact of metal prices, our consolidated distribution costs as a percent of revenue, benefited from lower fuel prices and our SG&A expense benefited from the acquisition integration synergies in our Specialty operation. 
Segment EBITDA totaled $193 million for the quarter, reflecting a 5.7% increase from 2014. As a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 11.0%, a 20 basis point improvement over the 10.8% recorded last year. The increase in EBITDA, when combined with lower relative levels of depreciation and amortization and interest expense, allows pretax income to increase by 7.5% during the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period last year and pretax margins expanded by 30 basis points to 8.0% from 7.7%.
Our net cash rate during the fourth quarter was 30.4%, down from 37.3% in 2014. The tax rate reflects an effective rate of 34.55% for the quarter as well as a favorable adjustment to get us to that level on a year-to-date basis as we have been accruing at an effective rate of 34.75% through the first 3 quarters. 
The 2015 annual rate reflects a favorable shift due to a relative increase in earnings source from the U.K., which had a low tax range. We also benefited from a few discrete items during the quarter, including a couple of deferred attacks adjustments due to favorable state or foreign tax rate changes, a couple of refunds and some Fin 48 reserve releases due to settlements for statutory expirations. 
As Rob mentioned, fully diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.31 compared to $0.26 last year, a 19% increase and adjusted earnings per share, before restructuring charges, was $0.32 a share versus $0.27, again reflecting a 19% improvement. The solid fourth quarter brought our adjusted EPS for the year to $1.42, which is exactly the midpoint of our guidance provided in February of 2015, notwithstanding the fact that the plunge in scrap prices had a $0.07 negative impact and the strong dollar had a $0.04 negative impact on our year-over-year EPS growth during 2015.
As I mentioned in December, starting in 2016, we are changing the definition of adjusted EPS to exclude the after-tax impact of intangible amortization as highlighted in Appendix 4 on Page 32 of the slide deck, 2015 adjusted EPS under the new definition is $1.49 a share.
As highlighted on Slide 13, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to the varying growth rates of our different businesses and the impact of acquisition. Since each of our segments has a different margin structure, this mix shift impacts the trend in consolidated margins and that will become more accentuated once we close the pending Rhiag acquisition and we begin to consolidate the Rhiag results.
And with that, let's get into the details on the segments. Revenue in our North American segment during the fourth quarter in 2015 increased to $1,018,000,000 or almost 1% over 2014. This is the combination of a 7.9% growth rate in parts and services, offset by a 39% decline in other revenue, again, the latter of which was due to the lower prices received for scrap, steel and other metals. 
Importantly, organic growth in North American parts and services was 5.6%. All in all, this was a very solid quarter. 
Margins in North America during the fourth quarter increased 90 basis points relative to the comparable period of the prior year to 43.2% from 42.3%. This increase was primarily due to our improved pricing to customers and our aftermarket operations, improved procurement in our salvage operations and a mix shift away from self-service, which has an lower gross margin than our wholesale operations. 
With respect to operating expenses in our North American segment, we lost approximately 90 basis points of margin compared to the comparable quarter of 2014. On the upside, we continue to experience improvements in fuel costs relative to last year as diesel fuel well averaged $2.43 a gallon compared to $3.58 a gallon. As a percent of revenue, fuel cost declined by 40 basis points, while we experienced some modest increases in facility and SG&A expenses in our wholesale business. 
Unfortunately, our self-serve unit experienced an increase in operating expenses, but meaningfully lower revenue due both to the significant decline in scrap prices and a modest reduction in the number of cars processed. As a result, operating expenses as a percent of revenue for our self-service operation increased very significantly on a year-over-year basis. 
Slide 16 takes a closer look at the scrap steel prices over the past 24 months. You will note that the average price we realized in Q4 of 2015, with approximately $82 a ton, down 56% compared to the average of $187 a ton, realized in Q4 of last year. In total, the lower pricing for scrap steel reduced our revenue for the quarter by approximately $26 million on a year-over-year basis. The decline in scrap steel prices had approximately a $0.03 negative impact on our EPS during the quarter.
Scrap steel prices have leveled out the last few months and hopefully, we will not see continued deterioration. 
While we have been dealing with falling scrap prices for a while, during Q4, we also experienced a continued material decline in the prices received for other metals that are a residual of our recycling activity, including aluminum, copper, platinum, Palladium and rhodium, which were down between 20% and 45% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. 
So while revenue from scrap steel was down $30 million during the quarter, revenue derived from selling these other precious metals and catalytic converters, was down an incremental $16 million compared to Q4 of last year. So in total, the falling metals prices depressed our North American business by approximately 160 basis points during Q4 of 2015 relative to the margins in the prior year.
In total, for the North American business, during the fourth quarter of 2015, the total EBITDA was $131 million, reflecting a 1.3% increase compared to last year. As a percent of revenue, EBITDA for North America was 12.8%, flat with the comparable period of the prior year. 
In both dollar and percentage terms, the wholesale operations improved relative to the comparable period, with EBITDA margins being up 70 basis points but the overall segment results were flat as a result of the decline at our self-service operations.
Moving on to our European segment. Total revenue in the fourth quarter accelerated to $487 million from $465 million. Organic growth in Europe during the quarter was 6.3%, reflecting the combination of 8.9% growth at ECP and just under 1% at Sator. The impact of acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 5% increase in revenue. So on a constant currency basis, European revenue was up 11.3%. These gains were offset by a 6.7% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, creating a negative impact on revenue and resulting in total growth for Europe of 4.6%. 
Gross margins in Europe increased to 38.9%, which was 160 basis point improvement over the comparable of 2014. Both ECP and Sator experienced higher costs margins from operations as we continue to benefit from improved procurement in the U.K. and the internalization of the gross margins from acquisitions in the Netherlands. These are the highest quarterly gross margins we have achieved in Europe since early 2012. 
With respect to operating expenses in Europe, we lost about 40 basis points due largely to higher SG&A expense at our U.K. operation, reflecting higher personnel cost to support the growth of the business, including our e-commerce development. European EBITDA totaled $47.4 million, which was a 23.6% increase, even after taking into account the impact of the strong dollar, which had a negative impact of about $3 million. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 9.7% versus 8.2% last year, reflecting a 150 basis point improvement. 
As noted on Slide 19, relative to the fourth quarter of 2014, the pound declined 4% and the euro declined 13% against the dollar. We estimate that for the fourth quarter, the strong dollar reduced European revenue by approximately $31 million compared to Q4 of last year and removing the impact of the currency swings, would have resulted in Q4 revenue growth of 11.3%. Given the significant margin improvement, constant currency EBITDA growth was 32%, which we believe is quite strong. When taking all currencies into account, the strong dollar reduced Q4 year-over-year EPS growth by a fraction of a $0.01 compared to last year.
Turning to our Specialty segment. Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $245 million, a 16% increase over the comparable quarter of last year. Obviously, the impact of the acquisition of Coast Distribution in August of 2015, accounted for the largest component of growth at 9.5%, but the organic growth rate of 8.1% was also quite strong. 
Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the fourth quarter declined by 280 basis points compared to last year, largely due to the impact of the Coast acquisition. On the bright side, operating expenses, as a percent of revenue in Specialty, were down by about 150 basis points as we continued to see the leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing distribution network as well as the benefit of the lower fuel prices. EBITDA for the Specialty segment was $15 million, essentially flat with 2014, and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment decreased by approximately 120 basis points to 6.1%. This is a highly seasonal business and the fourth quarter is by far the weakest as demonstrated by the graph in the lower right hand corner of Slide 20. 
As highlighted during the third quarter call, we fully anticipate that the Coast acquisition with its focus on the RV marketplace, would accentuate the normal drop in fourth quarter margins and it did.
Now let's move on to capital allocation, which given working capital swings, the lumpiness of capital spending and the timing of acquisitions is best viewed on a full year basis as presented on Slide 22. You will note that our after-tax cash flow from operations for 2015 was approximately $530 million as we experienced a strong increase in earnings and only a moderate increase in working capital.
In 2015, we deployed $330 million of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $170 million to fund capital expenditures and $160 million to fund acquisitions and other investments. So for 2015, we generated $200 million of free cash flow and we used all at that and some excess cash to repay $224 million of our debt. We closed the quarter with approximately $87 million of cash, of which about $59 million was held outside of the United States.
At December 31, we had $1.6 billion of total debt outstanding, which reflected a leverage ratio of approximately 1.7x as defined by our credit agreement. As announced earlier this month, we completed an amendment to our credit facility, increasing the total capacity by $900 million to a total of $3.2 billion and extending the maturity to January of 2021. Today, our total availability under the new facility is approximately $2.2 billion, which is more than sufficient to fund the acquisition of Rhiag and support the continued growth of our businesses. 
Finally, as noted in our press release, we have provided some guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2016. Please note that our guidance excludes any impact from the proposed Rhiag transfer acquisition, which we hope to close in the second quarter. 
As it relates to the organic growth for parts and services, we ended up at 7% for 2015 and have set the full year range for 2016 at 6% to 8%, essentially consistent with our recent experience. Our range for adjusted EPS, which now excludes the impact of intangible amortization is $1.59 to $1.69 a share with a midpoint of $1.64. Assumed in that estimate is approximately $19 million of after-tax amortization or about $0.06 per share. So another way, based on the former reporting definition, the midpoint of adjusted EPS would be $1.58, which is consistent with the current analyst estimate for 2016. 
Going forward, I would ask that all the analysts adapt to the new adjusted EPS format so we have consistency in the EPS estimate. To assist with some of the year-over-year comparisons Appendices 4 and 5 of the call back include a reconciliation to the new adjusted format on an annual basis from 2015 to -- or from 2011 to 2015 and on a quarterly basis, for the fourth quarters of 2015. The EPS guidance all assumes that the pound Sterling, euro and Canadian dollar remain at budgeted levels of $1.45, $1.10 and $0.70, respectively, and importantly, that remain at current levels as well. On a year-over-year basis, I would note that the lower exchange rates have a $0.03 per share negative impact on earnings and consistent with what we presented in the second quarter call back in July, the new Tamworth distribution facility will have another $0.03 negative impact during 2016. So that's the combined headwind of $0.06 a share compared to 2015 and at the midpoint of the guidance, we are still expecting a 10% year-over-year improvement. 
The corresponding adjusted net income guidance is from $490 million to $520 million. Our assumed tax rate for 2016 is 34.7%, reflecting the slightly lower relative earnings contribution coming from the low tax rate in United Kingdom and the impact of the new distributions facility in Tamworth will slow the earnings growth from that country. 
Our guidance for cash flow from operations is approximately $520 million to $550 million, with the midpoint of $535 million, a small increase over 2015, reflecting continued growth in cash earnings, offset by a more meaningful investment in working capital during 2016 compared to 2015. 
And finally, we set the guidance for capital spending at $170 million to $180 million, up just a bit over 2015. At 
this point, I will turn the call back over to Rob to wrap up."

To summarize, we faced some challenging headwinds this year with scrap and currency, 2 dynamics that are outside of our control, yet despite these challenges, we delivered solid results for 2015. And now looking ahead. Since the 2008 reces",377,"Thanks, Nick. To summarize, we faced some challenging headwinds this year with scrap and currency, 2 dynamics that are outside of our control, yet despite these challenges, we delivered solid results for 2015. 
And now looking ahead. Since the 2008 recession in North America, we have witnessed an increased level of road congestion, which undoubtedly has played a role in the number of the paid claims increasing every year since 2009. Also, the number of vehicles in the U.S. continues to rise with 264 million registered vehicles on the road at the end of 2015, a year when we witnessed the highest growth rate since 1999. These trends, coupled with the recent upswing in miles driven and lower gas prices, should continue to provide a nice tailwind to our collision business. 
In the U.K., the miles traveled on all roads and classes and the number of vehicles licensed reached the highest levels on record in 2015, trends that should continue to benefit our branch network across the U.K.. 
At Sator, we have largely completed our 3 step to 2 step transformation and are now prepared to move the business forward as a single business operating unit. 
In addition, with the pending acquisition of Rhiag, our European strategy continues to evolve and once closed, Rhiag will solidify our market-leading position across all of Europe yet we have more run rate to grow this fragmented market. 
Also, we continue to be pleased with the performance of our Specialty segment and the timing of our entry in this large and highly fragmented market. The project -- the projected trend -- upward trend in the SAAR rate should continue to benefit this segment. 
In closing, I am proud of the hard work and dedication of our 31,000 plus employees delivered for the company, our stockholders, and most importantly, our customers in 2015. I am equally proud of our team's commitments on delivering continued and consistent performance as reflected in our 2016 guidance. To further that point, over the last 16 years, the LKQ team has delivered, on average, 7.5% organic growth, an accomplishment that few can claim yet one that we have delivered predictably and consistently each and every year. 
Devon, we are now prepared to open the call for Q&A."

Obviously, the North American margins are a little bit of a tale of 2 cities, right, with the increase in EBITDA margins and the wholesale business, I mentioned on the call, about 70 basis point against a drop in the self-service margins. The margins in Europe hit double digits for the year. There are a lot of folks who 12 months ago were wondering how years it was going to take us to get to double-digit margins in Europe. And we're at 10.1% for the year, so we're very proud of that. We do think that ultimately the margins in Europe will have the ability to trend north, though I would caution folks that actually in 2016, because of the Tamworth facility, I quantify that as $0.03 a share. The reality from a margin perspective, if you take the roughly $13 million of P&L hit due to Tamworth and you laid that out against our 2015 results coming out of Europe, we would lose about 65 to 70 basis points of margin just because of that facility. So taking that aside, we think we can get some improvement in margins in Europe in the coming years as we continue to rationalize. We think that once that Rhiag is transaction ahs rolled in, that will give us incremental opportunities to get some savings on procurement, some savings on cataloging, some savings on the e-commerce platform, private label and all the things that John is hard at work on -- over in Europe."

As I said earlier, we do think that's a benefit as these tend to be higher priced parts but what we have seen interestingly enough is a number of parts per estimate continues to grow in 2015, it went up to 9.2 parts per estimates, which is a huge trend in our favor. Obviously, as cars gets inactive, we like to see parts get replaced versus repair because we can sell products. So we see that trend continuing for 2 reasons. One, the complexity of ours, the aluminum car is coming and we see them at needs them as being entered into the parts stream as well. These will get replace more often and then repaired, that's a positive. And then, the complexity -- the body shop industry tends to be focusing more on replacing than repairing.

We do not anticipate, we will get them up or down take accounts receivable. We actually think a receivables are going to grow in 2015 as our revenues grow. And so that's the biggest swing.

We are again delighted with our quarterly and full year results. And before I provide an update on our operations, let me briefly highlight a few key financial metrics from the fourth quarter and for the full year 2015. 
Turning to Slide 3. Q4 revenue reached $1.75 billion, an increase of 3.8% as compared to $1.68 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. Excluding the impact to our other revenue category, revenue grew 8% for the quarter. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $95.1 million, an increase of 18.1% as compared to $80.5 million for the same period of 2014. Diluted earnings per share of $0.31 for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015, increased 19.2% from $0.26 for the fourth quarter of 2014 while adjusted EPS increased from $0.27 to $0.32. 
Organic revenue growth for parts and services was 6.2% for the quarter, and on a constant-currency basis, total growth for parts and services was 10.9%. I am particularly pleased with our EPS performance given that the effect from FX and weakness in commodity prices, which combined, negatively impacted the year-over-year change in EPS by $0.03.
For full year 2015, revenue reached $7.19 billion, an increase of 6.7% as compared to 2014. For the first time ever, revenues surpassed $7 billion, a major milestone for the company. Net income for the full year was $423.2 million compared with $381.5 million for the prior year, an increase of 10.9%. Organic revenue growth for parts and services for 2015 was 7%, a solid performance given the tough comp of 9% in 2014. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue growth for 2015 was 10.1% while total revenue growth for parts and services was 14.1%. Our adjusted EPS for all of 2015 was $1.42, representing an increase of 11.8% from $1.27 reported in 2014, again, net of the adverse impact of FX and commodity pricing.
Now a brief update on our operations, which are highlighted on Slides 6 and 7. During the quarter, our North American operations continue to benefit from various macro trends. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, miles driven was up 3.5% in 2015 as compared to 2014. Miles driven in 2015 was the highest number reported since 1990. With low gas prices and ongoing improvements in unemployment rate, we do expect a continuation of this trend. 
Though initially a headwind, as newer vehicles requiring repair tend to receive new OE parts, the increase in the SAAR rate presents attractive growth prospects for alternative products as these vehicles age. The SAAR rate for 2015 was 17.4 million units compared to 16.4 million units for 2014, a 6.1% increase year-over-year. Auto industry analysts expect this trend to continue in 2016, which, again, should be good for our North American collision businesses as well as our Specialty segment. These trends helped drive North American organic growth for parts and services of 5.6% in Q4, despite the mild weather patterns we faced throughout December. 
During Q4 and for full year 2015, we purchased over 73,000 and 288,000 vehicles, respectively, for dismantling by our wholesale operations, which is essentially flat year-over-year for both periods. During Q4, our pricing at auction was flat compared to Q4 2014 but we were also buying a younger vehicle by over 1 year. This younger vehicle procurement strategy continues to perform well and play a role in the improvements we witnessed in Q4 year-over-year North American gross margins. For our North American aftermarket business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 13.2% and 32.2%, respectively, in 2015. 
In our self-service retail business, during Q4, we acquired over 112,000 lower-cost, self-service and crush-only cars, which is a 4% decrease over Q4 2014. For full year 2015, vehicle procurement was approximately 471,000, a decrease of 8.4% from 2014. As mentioned on past calls, this reduction in the self-service procurement was intentional given the dynamics we faced with the scrap markets throughout the year. Nick will provide more detail on scrap during his comments and, in particular, its impact on revenue.
Turning to the 2015 results of our ongoing intelligent parts solution initiative with CCC Information Services. The revenue and number of purchase orders processed through the CCC platform during 2015 each grew 66%, respectively, year-over-year. Clearly, the trend toward shops adopting this feature within the CCC platform continues to gain traction, with this initiative currently annualizing over $28 million in revenue for LKQ.
And last, on North America, I want to provide an update on our productivity initiatives to identify potential operational efficiencies. As mentioned on previous calls, we have identified several significant opportunities in 4 key areas, with one of them being procurement. During the quarter, Alix Partners led an internal focus group tasked with assessing our current maintenance, repair and operations or MRO and indirect spend categories and the details behind what we can change or can consolidate. 
Following this extensive analysis, we modified and redefined several positions within our procurement team in an attempt to optimize our ability to capture the potential savings uncovered. Though early in the process, we are extremely encouraged by the savings we could achieve in areas of both direct spend on aftermarket parts and the MRO and the indirect spend categories, such as logistics, corrugated boxings -- boxes, shipment supplies, vehicle rentals, IT hardware and various services. While it will take a few quarters for the savings on parts purchases to be realized and roll through our inventory turns, we anticipate we will begin to realize some of the savings on the other items in late Q1 of this year. 
Now moving on to our European operations. In Q4, our Europe segment had organic revenue growth of 6.3% and acquisition growth of 5%, which was offset by a decrease of 6.7% related to foreign exchange rates. During Q4, ECP drove organic revenue growth of 8.9%, and for branches opened more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 6.8%, solid performance given that the U.K. witnessed one of the warmest and most mild winters since 1985. 
During the quarter ECP opened one additional branch, bringing our U.K. network to 199, an increase of 110 branches since we acquired ECP. With the continued market opportunities in the U.K., I am pleased to announce that we approved an additional 13 branches in 2016. During Q4, collision parts sales in ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 21.2%. I am pleased with the continued double-digit performance in this line of business, especially given the mild Q4 weather in the U.K. and a tough 2014 comp.
And lastly on ECP, I'd like to provide a brief update on our new 750,000 square-foot national distribution warehouse currently under development in the U.K. Upon completion of the building shell in early February 2016, we began our lease payments and also started absorbing duplicate expenses that will continue through 2017 as we begin to move towards finalizing the full consolidation of our existing NDCs into this state-of-the-art facility. Nick will cover the impact of those costs shortly. 
During Q1, we began installing interior racking in preparation for using the facility for bulk storage in Q2, with the automation and more sophisticated storage spaces scheduled to be complete in 2017. For the quarter and for full year 2015, we did not incur any material costs related to this project.
And now turning to our Sator business. With the network buildup in The Netherlands largely completed via the combination of acquisitions and innovative partnering solutions, Sator has now turned its focus towards integrating the systems in place at the wholesale level. By year-end 2016, we plan to have consolidated from 6 systems to 2 with integrated end-to-end inventory and customer visibility, a key enabler for driving logistical and working capital improvements in the business. 
And now to our Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment continued its strong performance by posting year-over-year total revenue growth of 16.2% in the quarter, including the benefits of the Coast acquisition, and strong organic revenue growth of 8.1%. During the quarter, all integration activities from the Coast acquisition continued as planned. In total, our Specialty team integrated 5 of the 17 Coast warehouses into our existing KAO distribution centers, with 2 additional warehouses integrated in January. 
In addition, during Q4, our Specialty team stocked the 360,000 square-foot warehouse in Michigan mentioned on the previous call, and in January, we officially began shipping product from this facility. I am also pleased to announce that in 2015, the Specialty team achieved 2 significant milestones. For the first time, Specialty eclipsed $1 billion annual revenue and made over 1 million delivery stops. Congratulations to our Specialty team for reaching such an impressive milestone.
Now on to corporate development. In December 2015, the company announced that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Rhiag-Inter Auto Parts, a leading pan-European business-to-business distributor of aftermarket spare parts for passenger cars and commercial vehicles, for an enterprise value of EUR 1.04 billion. This acquisition gives us access to the rapidly growing Eastern European market and, of course, Italy, where Rhiag's base business is well positioned for continued growth beyond their current 15% market share. The targeted closing for Rhiag is progressing as expected, with all the filings required by the EU and Ukraine regulatory authorities submitted, accepted and deemed complete. Both regulatory agencies are now in the final review process, and we anticipate this deal to close in the first half of 2016.  
In addition to the Rhiag announcement, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we acquired a wholesale salvage business in Sweden and an interest in a pan-European distributor and remanufacturer of engines and powertrain products. Lastly, earlier this month, the company sold its interests in ACM Parts, our JV in Australia, to our JV partner, Suncorp. LKQ played a pivotal role in the coordination [ph] of ACM Parts, and we will continue to have a strong working relationship with the business. 
Key formal strategic alliances between ACM Parts and LKQ, particularly those related to aftermarket parts sourcing and technology, will remain in place. This transaction allows us to maintain a presence in Australia while redeploying our capital, both human and financial, towards the multiple opportunities we have in Europe.  Clearly, 2015 was another very active year, with our development efforts resulting in the completion of 18 acquisitions, which, combined, expanded our geographic footprint and extended our leadership position in each of our operating segments.
At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more detail and perspective on our financial results and our 2016 guidance."

I'm delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter, and over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of the",2750,"Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'm delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter, and over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of the 3 segments before touching on the balance sheet and addressing our guidance for 2016. For those of you who accessed our earnings presentation on the website, you will notice that we have included detail on both the fourth quarter ended December 31 as well as the full year of 2015. My comments will generally follow the flow of the presentation, but as usual, I will primarily focus on the quarterly results. 
The short version of our financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2015 would be a repeat of the third quarter. Save  for our self-service operation, we've had a great quarter in which we experienced solid revenue and earnings growth despite the continued headwinds from lower scrap prices and the strong dollar. 
As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.75 billion, representing a 3.8% increase over last year. That reflects an 8% increase in revenue from parts and services, offset in part by a 38% decline in other revenue, primarily related to the continued decline in prices for scrap steel and other metals, which I will address in a few minutes. The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 6.2% growth from organic activities, plus 4.7% from acquisitions, equating to constant-currency growth of 10.9% before backing out the translation impact of FX, which was a 2.9% decline. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each business as I walk through the segment results. 
As noted on Slide 11 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins improved 40 basis points to 39.9% during the quarter. The uptick reflected approximately a 50 basis point improvement from operations, offset by a 10 basis point decline due to revenue mix as the revenue growth in our Specialty business, which has the lowest gross margin structure, outpaced that of our other operations. 
We lost about 20 basis points of efficiencies in our operating expenses, again, largely due to our self-service operation. This operation continued to experience a meaningful decline in revenue related to the lower scrap steel prices and an uptick in expenses, the combination of which resulted in materially higher cost as a percent of revenue in each expense category. 
Outside of the impact of metal prices, our consolidated distribution costs as a percent of revenue benefited from lower fuel prices, and our SG&A expense benefited from the acquisition integration synergies in our Specialty operation. 
Segment EBITDA totaled $193 million for the quarter, reflecting a 5.7% increase from 2014. As a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 11.0%, a 20 basis point improvement over the 10.8% recorded last year. The increase in EBITDA when combined with lower relative levels of depreciation and amortization and interest expense allows pretax income to increase by 7.5% during the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period last year, and pretax margins expanded by 30 basis points to 8.0% from 7.7%.
Our net cash rate during the fourth quarter was 30.4%, down from 37.3% in 2014. The tax rate reflects an effective rate of 34.55% for the quarter as well as a favorable adjustment to get us to that level on a year-to-date basis as we have been accruing at an effective rate of 34.75% through the first 3 quarters. The 2015 annual rate reflects a favorable shift due to a relative increase in earnings sourced from the U.K., which has a low tax rate. We also benefited from a few discrete items during the quarter, including a couple of deferred tax adjustments due to favorable state or foreign tax rate changes, a couple of refunds and some Fin 48 reserve releases due to settlements or statute expirations. 
As Rob mentioned, fully diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.31 compared to $0.26 last year, a 19% increase, and adjusted earnings per share before restructuring charges was $0.32 a share versus $0.27, again reflecting a 19% improvement. The solid fourth quarter brought our adjusted EPS for the year to $1.42, which is exactly the midpoint of our guidance provided in February of 2015, notwithstanding the fact that the plunge in scrap prices had a $0.07 negative impact and the strong dollar had a $0.04 negative impact on our year-over-year EPS growth during 2015.
As mentioned in December, starting in 2016, we are changing the definition of adjusted EPS to exclude the after-tax impact of intangible amortization. As highlighted in Appendix 4 on Page 32 of the slide deck, 2015 adjusted EPS under the new definition is $1.49 a share.
As highlighted on Slide 13, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to the varying growth rates of our different businesses and the impact of acquisition. Since each of our segments has a different margin structure, this mix shift impacts the trend in consolidated margins, and that will become more accentuated once we close the pending Rhiag acquisition and we begin to consolidate the Rhiag results.
And with that, let's get into the details on the segments. Revenue in our North American segment during the fourth quarter in 2015 increased to $1,018,000,000 or almost 1% over 2014. This is the combination of a 7.9% growth rate in parts and services, offset by a 39% decline in other revenue, again the latter of which was due to the lower prices received for scrap steel and other metals. Importantly, organic growth in North American parts and services was 5.6%. All in all, this was a very solid quarter. 
Margins in North America during the fourth quarter increased 90 basis points relative to the comparable period of the prior year to 43.2% from 42.3%. This increase was primarily due to our improved pricing to customers in our aftermarket operations, improved procurement in our salvage operations and a mix shift away from self-service, which has lower gross margins than our wholesale operations. 
With respect to operating expenses in our North American segment, we lost approximately 90 basis points of margin compared to the comparable quarter of 2014. On the upside, we continued to experience improvements in fuel cost relative to last year as diesel fuel averaged $2.43 a gallon compared to $3.58 a gallon. As a percent of revenue, fuel cost declined by 40 basis points while we experienced some modest increases in facility and SG&A expenses in our wholesale business. 
Unfortunately, our self-serve unit experienced an increase in operating expenses but meaningfully lower revenue due both to the significant decline in scrap prices and a modest reduction in the number of cars processed. As a result, operating expenses as a percent of revenue for our self-service operation increased very significantly on a year-over-year basis. 
Slide 16 takes a closer look at scrap steel prices over the past 24 months. You will note that the average price we realized in Q4 of 2015 was approximately $82 a ton, down 56% compared to the average of $187 a ton realized in Q4 of last year. In total, the lower pricing for scrap steel reduced our revenue for the quarter by approximately $26 million on a year-over-year basis. The decline in scrap steel prices had approximately a $0.03 negative impact on our EPS during the quarter. Scrap steel prices have leveled out the last few months, and hopefully, we will not see continued deterioration. 
While we have been dealing with falling scrap prices for a while, during Q4, we also experienced a continued material decline in the prices received for other metals that are a residual of our recycling activities, including aluminum, copper, platinum, palladium and rhodium, which were down between 20% and 45% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. So while revenue from scrap steel was down $30 million during the quarter, revenue derived from selling these other precious metals and catalytic converters was down an incremental $16 million compared to Q4 of last year. So in total, the falling metals prices depressed our North American business by approximately 160 basis points during Q4 of 2015 relative to the margins in the prior year.
In total, for the North American business, during the fourth quarter of 2015, the total EBITDA was $131 million, reflecting a 1.3% increase compared to last year. As a percent of revenue, EBITDA for North America was 12.8%, flat with the comparable period of the prior year. In both dollar and percentage terms, the wholesale operations improved relative to the comparable period, with EBITDA margins being up 70 basis points but the overall segment results were flat as a result of the decline at our self-service operations.
Moving on to our European segment. Total revenue in the fourth quarter accelerated to $487 million from $465 million. Organic growth in Europe during the quarter was 6.3%, reflecting the combination of 8.9% growth at ECP and just under 1% at Sator. The impact of acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 5% increase in revenue. So on a constant-currency basis, European revenue was up 11.3%. These gains were offset by a 6.7% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, creating a negative impact on revenue and resulting in total growth for Europe of 4.6%. 
Gross margins in Europe increased to 38.9%, which was 160 basis point improvement over the comparable period of 2014. Both ECP and Sator experienced higher gross margins from operations as we continue to benefit from improved procurement in the U.K. and the internalization of the gross margins from acquisitions in The Netherlands. These are the highest quarterly gross margins we have achieved in Europe since early 2012. 
With respect to operating expenses in Europe, we lost about 40 basis points due largely to higher SG&A expense at our U.K. operation, reflecting higher personnel costs to support the growth of the business, including our e-commerce development. European EBITDA totaled $47.4 million, which was a 23.6% increase, even after taking into account the impact of the strong dollar, which had a negative effect of about $3 million. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 9.7% versus 8.2% last year, reflecting a 150 basis point improvement. 
As noted on Slide 19, relative to the fourth quarter of 2014, the pound declined 4% and the euro declined 13% against the dollar. We estimate that for the fourth quarter, the strong dollar reduced European revenue by approximately $31 million compared to Q4 of last year and removing the impact of the currency swings, would have resulted in Q4 revenue growth of 11.3%. Given the significant margin improvement, constant-currency EBITDA growth was 32%, which we believe is quite strong. When taking all currencies into account, the strong dollar reduced Q4 year-over-year EPS growth by a fraction of $0.01 compared to last year.
Turning to our Specialty segment. Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $245 million, a 16% increase over the comparable quarter of last year. Obviously, the impact of the acquisition of Coast Distribution in August of 2015 accounted for the largest component of growth at 9.5%, but the organic growth rate of 8.1% was also quite strong. 
Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the fourth quarter declined by 280 basis points compared to last year, largely due to the impact of the Coast acquisition. On the bright side, operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were down by about 150 basis points as we continued to see the leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing distribution network as well as the benefit of the lower fuel prices. 
EBITDA for the Specialty segment was $15 million, essentially flat with 2014, and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment decreased by 120 basis points to 6.1%. This is a highly seasonal business, and the fourth quarter is by far the weakest, as demonstrated by the graph in the lower right-hand corner of Slide 20. As highlighted during the third quarter call, we fully anticipate that the Coast acquisition with its focus on the RV marketplace would accentuate the normal drop in fourth quarter margins, and it did.
Now let's move on to capital allocation, which, given working capital swings, the lumpiness of capital spending and the timing of acquisitions, is best viewed on a full year basis, as presented on Slide 22. You will note that our after-tax cash flow from operations for 2015 was approximately $530 million as we experienced a strong increase in earnings and only a moderate increase in working capital. In 2015, we deployed $330 million of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $170 million to fund capital expenditures and $160 million to fund acquisitions and other investments. So for 2015, we generated $200 million of free cash flow, and we used all of that and some excess cash to repay $224 million of our debt. We closed the quarter with approximately $87 million of cash, of which about $59 million was held outside of the United States.
At December 31, we had $1.6 billion of total debt outstanding, which reflected a leverage ratio of approximately 1.7x as defined by our credit agreement. As announced earlier this month, we completed an amendment to our credit facility, increasing the total capacity by $900 million to a total of $3.2 billion and extending the maturity to January of 2021. Today, our total availability under the new facility is approximately $2.2 billion, which is more than sufficient to fund the acquisition of Rhiag and support the continued growth of our businesses. 
Finally, as noted in our press release, we have provided some guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2016. Please note that our guidance excludes any impact from the proposed Rhiag acquisition, which we hope to close in the second quarter. 
As it relates to the organic growth for parts and services, we ended up at 7% for 2015 and have set the full year range for 2016 at 6% to 8%, essentially consistent with our recent experience. Our range for adjusted EPS, which now excludes the impact of intangible amortization, is $1.59 to $1.69 a share with a midpoint of $1.64. Assumed in that estimate is approximately $19 million of after-tax amortization or about $0.06 per share. Said another way, based on the former reporting definition, the midpoint of adjusted EPS would be $1.58, which is consistent with the current analyst estimates for 2016. 
Going forward, I would ask that all the analysts adapt to the new adjusted EPS format so we have consistency in the EPS estimate. To assist with some of the year-over-year comparisons, Appendices 4 and 5 of the call deck include a reconciliation to the new adjusted format on an annual basis from 2015 to -- or from 2011 to 2015 and on a quarterly basis, for the 4 quarters of 2015. 
The EPS guidance all assumes that the pound sterling, euro and Canadian dollar remain at budgeted levels of $1.45, $1.10 and $0.70, respectively and, importantly, that scrap remains at current levels as well. On a year-over-year basis, I would note that the lower exchange rates have a $0.03 per share negative impact on earnings, and consistent with what we presented in the second quarter call back in July, the new Tamworth distribution facility will have another $0.03 negative impact during 2016. So that's the combined headwind of $0.06 a share compared to 2015, and at the midpoint of the guidance, we are still expecting a 10% year-over-year improvement. 
The corresponding adjusted net income guidance is from $490 million to $520 million. Our assumed tax rate for 2016 is 34.7%, reflecting the slightly lower relative earnings contribution coming from the low tax rate in United Kingdom, and the impact of the new distribution facility in Tamworth will slow the earnings growth from that country. 
Our guidance for cash flow from operations is approximately $520 million to $550 million, with a midpoint of $535 million, a small increase over 2015, reflecting continued growth in cash earnings, offset by a more meaningful investment in working capital during 2016 compared to 2015. And finally, we set the guidance for capital spending at $170 million to $180 million, up just a bit over 2015. 
At this point, I will turn the call back over to Rob to wrap up."

Yet despite these challenges, we delivered solid results for 2015. 
Now looking ahead. Since the 2008 recession in North America, we have witnessed an increased level of road congestion, which undoubtedly has played a role in the number of the paid claims increasing every year since 2009. Also, the number of vehicles in the U.S. continues to rise with 264 million registered vehicles on the road at the end of 2015, a year when we witnessed the highest growth rate since 1999. These trends, coupled with the recent upswing in miles driven and lower gas prices, should continue to provide a nice tailwind to our collision business. 
In the U.K., the miles traveled on all roads and classes and the number of vehicles licensed reached the highest levels on record in 2015, trends that should continue to benefit our branch network across the U.K. At Sator, we have largely completed our 3-step to 2-step transformation and are now prepared to move the business forward as a single business operating unit. In addition, with the pending acquisition of Rhiag, our European strategy continues to evolve, and once closed, Rhiag will solidify our market-leading position across all of Europe. Yet we have more runway to grow this fragmented market. 
Also, we continue to be pleased with the performance of our Specialty segment and the timing of our entry in this large and highly fragmented market. The project -- the projected trend -- upward trend in the SAAR rate should continue to benefit this segment. 
In closing, I am proud of the hard work and dedication of our 31,000-plus employees delivered for the company, our stockholders and, most importantly, our customers in 2015. I am equally proud of our team's commitment on delivering continued and consistent performance as reflected in our 2016 guidance. To further that point, over the last 16 years, the LKQ team has delivered, on average, 7.5% organic growth, an accomplishment that few can claim, yet one that we have delivered predictably and consistently each and every year. 
Devon, we are now prepared to open the call for Q&A."

Obviously, the North American margins are a little bit of a tale of 2 cities, right, with the increase in EBITDA margins in the wholesale business, I mentioned on the call, about 70 basis points, against a drop in the self-service margins. The margins in Europe hit double digits for the year. There are a lot of folks who 12 months ago were wondering how many years it was going to take us to get to double-digit margins in Europe, and we're at 10.1% for the year. So we're very proud of that. We do think that, ultimately, the margins in Europe will have the ability to trend north, though I would caution folks that actually, in 2016, because of the Tamworth facility, I quantified that as $0.03 a share. The reality, from a margin perspective, if you take the roughly $13 million of P&L hit due to Tamworth and you lay it out against our 2015 results coming out of Europe, we would lose about 65 to 70 basis points of margin just because of that facility. So taking that aside, we think we can get some improvement in margins in Europe in the coming years as we continue to rationalize. We think that once the Rhiag transaction has rolled in, that will give us incremental opportunities to get some savings on procurement, some savings on cataloging, some savings on the e-commerce platform, private label and all the things that John is hard at work on  over in Europe."

The other thing I'd like to add in, I mentioned in my notes, we did take a JV interest in a remanufacturer in Europe. We are going to end -- start bringing those products into our different operations, so that's another opportunity as well. So those are the major priorities over in Europe this year."

These MSOs are very tied to the insurance industry and driving alternative parts. So we are very pleased with that, and that -- I don't see that slowing down anytime soon, David. They are very aggressive in consolidating. I did just see a recent report that there are still 40,000 body shops in the United States, so there are still a tremendous amount of independence. But the consolidation will continue. As far as AP usage goes, we haven't seen the 2015 number yet from CCC, but we expect it to be relatively flat again at 36%, mainly as a result of the SAAR rate. These new cars are demanding new parts. As I said earlier, we do think that's a benefit as these tend to be higher-priced parts. But what we have seen, interestingly enough, is the number of parts per estimate continues to grow. In 2015, it went up to 9.2 parts per estimate, which is a huge trend in our favor. Obviously, as cars get in accidents, we like to see parts get replaced versus repair because then we can sell our products. So we see that trend continuing for 2 reasons: one, the complexity of the cars. The aluminum car is coming, and we magnesium is being entered into the parts stream as well. These will get replaced more often than repaired. That's a positive. And then the complexity -- the body shop industry tends to be focusing more on replacing than repairing. So all positive trends. And we think when this SAAR rate starts to get into the sweet spot, we'll see that alternative part usage go from 36% to even higher as the parts make their way into the system."

When you look at the -- if you go back and you look historically at the kind of cash flow from operations, we were at $206 million in 2012, $428 million in '13, down to $371 million in '14, up to $521 million in '15. Almost all of that has to do with swings related to working capital. And what I would suggest, if you kind of trend-lined it and normalized that, is to take out the peaks and the valleys. That's what you should be thinking about on a kind of a long-term basis, recognizing that, in any given year, things could move up or down a little bit."

And from what we've -- the research we've -- look, Bill, most of this is currently an option right now. It's not a standard part, and it's mainly on higher-end vehicles, although they are starting to work their way down. There was actually a study done by Sachem [ph] over in U.K. that suggests that they believe claims volume will not drop precipitously but severity will. And they actually expect total losses to drop, but the number of claims will. So instead of the violent rollover collision, there'll still be a collision but it just won't be as severe. So they're actually predicting pretty stability. So I think it's fair to say that it's still early days. But I will say this, it is actually part of our strategy to diversify the business. We do think it's coming, but we -- and everything we've read says it's a-decade-out problem at the earliest. So we're going to continue to diversify the business, look to get away a little bit from the collision, as we've been doing over the last couple of years.

We are again delighted with our quarterly and full year results. And before I provide an update on our operations, let me briefly highlight a few key financial metrics from the fourth quarter and for the full year 2015. 
Turning to Slide 3. Q4 revenue reached $1.75 billion, an increase of 3.8% as compared to $1.68 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. Excluding the impact to our other revenue category, revenue grew 8% for the quarter. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $95.1 million, an increase of 18.1% as compared to $80.5 million for the same period of 2014. Diluted earnings per share of $0.31 for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015 increased 19.2% from $0.26 for the fourth quarter of 2014, while adjusted EPS increased from $0.27 to $0.32. 
Organic revenue growth for parts and services was 6.2% for the quarter, and on a constant-currency basis, total growth for parts and services was 10.9%. I am particularly pleased with our EPS performance given that the effect from FX and weakness in commodity prices, which combined, negatively impacted the year-over-year change in EPS by $0.03.
For full year 2015, revenue reached $7.19 billion, an increase of 6.7% as compared to 2014. For the first time ever, revenues surpassed $7 billion, a major milestone for the company. Net income for the full year was $423.2 million compared with $381.5 million for the prior year, an increase of 10.9%. Organic revenue growth for parts and services for 2015 was 7%, a solid performance given the tough comp of 9% in 2014. On a constant-currency basis, total revenue growth for 2015 was 10.1% while total revenue growth for parts and services was 14.1%. Our adjusted EPS for all of 2015 was $1.42, representing an increase of 11.8% from $1.27 reported in 2014, again, net of the adverse impact of FX and commodity pricing.
Now a brief update on our operations, which are highlighted on Slides 6 and 7. During the quarter, our North American operations continued to benefit from various macro trends. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, miles driven was up 3.5% in 2015 as compared to 2014. Miles driven in 2015 was the highest number reported since 1990. With low gas prices and ongoing improvements in the unemployment rate, we do expect a continuation of this trend. 
Though initially a headwind, as newer vehicles requiring repair tend to receive new OE parts, the increase in the SAAR rate presents attractive growth prospects for our alternative products as these vehicles age. The SAAR rate for 2015 was 17.4 million units compared to 16.4 million units for 2014, a 6.1% increase year-over-year. Auto industry analysts expect this trend to continue in 2016, which, again, should be good for our North American collision businesses as well as our Specialty segment. These trends helped drive North American organic growth for parts and services of 5.6% in Q4, despite the mild weather patterns we faced throughout December. 
During Q4 and for full year 2015, we purchased over 73,000 and 288,000 vehicles, respectively, for dismantling by our wholesale operations, which is essentially flat year-over-year for both periods. During Q4, our pricing at auction was flat compared to Q4 2014, but we were also buying a younger vehicle by over 1 year. This younger vehicle procurement strategy continues to perform well, and plays a role in the improvements we witnessed in Q4 year-over-year North American gross margins. For our North American aftermarket business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 13.2% and 32.2%, respectively, in 2015. 
In our self-service retail business, during Q4, we acquired over 112,000 lower-cost, self-service and crush-only cars, which is a 4% decrease over Q4 2014. For full year 2015, vehicle procurement was approximately 471,000, a decrease of 8.4% from 2014. As mentioned on past calls, this reduction in the self-service procurement was intentional given the dynamics we faced with the scrap markets throughout the year. Nick will provide more detail on scrap during his comments and, in particular, its impact on revenue.
Turning to the 2015 results of our ongoing intelligent parts solution initiative with CCC Information Services, the revenue and number of purchase orders processed through the CCC platform during 2015 each grew 66%, respectively, year-over-year. Clearly, the trend toward shops adopting this feature within the CCC platform continues to gain traction, with this initiative currently annualizing over $28 million in revenue for LKQ.
And lastly on North America, I want to provide an update on our productivity initiatives to identify potential operational efficiencies. As mentioned on previous calls, we have identified several significant opportunities in 4 key areas, with one of them being procurement. During the quarter, Alix Partners led an internal focus group tasked with assessing our current maintenance, repair and operations, or MRO, and indirect spend categories and the details behind what we can change or can consolidate. 
Following this extensive analysis, we modified and redefined several positions within our procurement team in an attempt to optimize our ability to capture the potential savings uncovered. Though early in the process, we are extremely encouraged by the savings we could achieve in areas of both direct spend on aftermarket parts and the MRO and the indirect spend categories, such as logistics, corrugated boxings -- boxes and shipping supplies, vehicle rentals, IT hardware and various services. While it will take a few quarters for the savings on parts purchases to be realized and roll through our inventory turns, we anticipate we will begin to realize some of the savings on the other items in late Q1 of this year. 
Now moving on to our European operations. In Q4, our Europe segment had organic revenue growth of 6.3% and acquisition growth of 5%, which was offset by a decrease of 6.7% related to foreign exchange rates. During Q4, ECP drove organic revenue growth of 8.9%, and for branches open more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 6.8%, solid performance given that the U.K. witnessed one of the warmest and most mild winters since 1985. 
During the quarter, ECP opened one additional branch, bringing our U.K. network to 199, an increase of 110 branches since we acquired ECP. With the continued market opportunities in the U.K., I am pleased to announce that we approved an additional 13 branches in 2016. During Q4, collision parts sales at ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 21.2%. I am pleased with the continued double-digit performance in this line of business, especially given the mild Q4 weather in the U.K. and a tough 2014 comp.
And lastly on ECP, I'd like to provide a brief update on our new 750,000 square-foot national distribution warehouse currently under development in the U.K. Upon completion of the building's shell in early February 2016, we began our lease payments and also started absorbing duplicate expenses that will continue through 2017 as we begin to move towards finalizing the full consolidation of our existing NDCs into this state-of-the-art facility. Nick will cover the impact of those costs shortly. 
During Q1, we began installing interior racking in preparation for using the facility for bulk storage in Q2, with the automation and more sophisticated storage spaces scheduled to be complete in 2017. For the quarter and for full year 2015, we did not incur any material costs related to this project.
And now turning to our Sator business. With the network buildup in The Netherlands largely completed via a combination of acquisitions and innovative partnering solutions, Sator has now turned its focus towards integrating the systems in place at the wholesale level. By year-end 2016, we plan to have consolidated from 6 systems to 2 with integrated end-to-end inventory and customer visibility, a key enabler for driving logistical and working capital improvements in the business. 
And now to our Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment continued its strong performance by posting year-over-year total revenue growth of 16.2% in the quarter, including the benefits of the Coast acquisition, and strong organic revenue growth of 8.1%. During the quarter, all integration activities from the Coast acquisition continued as planned. In total, our Specialty team integrated 5 of the 17 Coast warehouses into our existing KAO distribution centers, with 2 additional warehouses integrated in January. 
In addition, during Q4, our Specialty team stocked the 360,000 square-foot warehouse in Michigan mentioned on the previous call, and in January, we officially began shipping product from this facility. I am also pleased to announce that in 2015, the Specialty team achieved 2 significant milestones. For the first time, Specialty eclipsed $1 billion annual revenue and made over 1 million delivery stops. Congratulations to our Specialty team for reaching such an impressive milestone.
Now on to corporate development. In December 2015, the company announced it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Rhiag-Inter Auto Parts, a leading pan-European business-to-business distributor of aftermarket spare parts for passenger cars and commercial vehicles, for an enterprise value of EUR 1.04 billion. This acquisition gives us access to the rapidly growing Eastern European market, and of course, Italy, where Rhiag's base business is well positioned for continued growth beyond their current 15% market share. The targeted closing for Rhiag is progressing as expected, with all the filings required by the EU and Ukraine regulatory authorities submitted, accepted and deemed complete. Those regulatory agencies are now in the final review process, and we anticipate this deal to close in the first half of 2016.  
In addition to the Rhiag announcement, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we acquired a wholesale salvage business in Sweden and an interest in a pan-European distributor and remanufacturer of engines and powertrain products. Lastly, earlier this month, the company sold its interest in ACM Parts, our JV in Australia, to our JV partner, Suncorp. LKQ played a pivotal role in the coordination [ph] of ACM Parts, and we will continue to have a strong working relationship with the business. 
Key formal strategic alliances between ACM Parts and LKQ, particularly those related to aftermarket parts sourcing and technology, will remain in place. This transaction allows us to maintain a presence in Australia while redeploying our capital, both human and financial, towards the multiple opportunities we have in Europe.  Clearly, 2015 was another very active year, with our development efforts resulting in the completion of 18 acquisitions, which combined, expanded our geographic footprint and extended our leadership position in each of our operating segments.
At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more detail and perspective on our financial results and our 2016 guidance."

I'm delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter, and over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of the 3 segments before touching on the balance sheet and addressing our guidance for 2016. For those of you who accessed our earnings presentation on the website, you will notice that we have included detail on both the fourth quarter ended December 31 as well as the full year of 2015. My comments will generally follow the flow of the presentation, but as usual, I will primarily focus on the quarterly results. 
The short version of our financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2015 would be a repeat of the third quarter. Save  for our self-service operation, we had a great quarter in which we experienced solid revenue and earnings growth despite the continued headwinds from lower scrap prices and the strong dollar. 
As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.75 billion, representing a 3.8% increase over last year. That reflects an 8% increase in revenue from parts and services offset in part by a 38% decline in other revenue, primarily related to the continued decline in prices for scrap steel and other metals, which I will address in a few minutes. The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 6.2% growth from organic activities, plus 4.7% from acquisitions, equating to a constant-currency growth of 10.9% before backing out the translation impact of FX, which was a 2.9% decline. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each business as I walk through the segment results. 
As noted on Slide 11 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins improved 40 basis points to 39.9% during the quarter. The uptick reflected approximately a 50 basis point improvement from operations, offset by a 10 basis point decline due to revenue mix as the revenue growth in our Specialty business, which has the lowest gross margin structure, outpaced that of our other operations. 
We lost about 20 basis points of efficiencies in our operating expenses, again, largely due to our self-service operation. This operation continued to experience a meaningful decline in revenue related to the lower scrap steel prices and an uptick in expenses, the combination of which resulted in materially higher cost as a percent of revenue in each expense category. 
Outside of the impact of metal prices, our consolidated distribution costs as a percent of revenue benefited from lower fuel prices, and our SG&A expense benefited from the acquisition integration synergies in our Specialty operation. 
Segment EBITDA totaled $193 million for the quarter, reflecting a 5.7% increase from 2014. As a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 11.0%, a 20 basis point improvement over the 10.8% recorded last year. The increase in EBITDA when combined with lower relative levels of depreciation and amortization and interest expense allowed pretax income to increase by 7.5% during the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period last year, and pretax margins expanded by 30 basis points to 8.0% from 7.7%.
Our net cash rate during the fourth quarter was 30.4%, down from 37.3% in 2014. The tax rate reflects an effective rate of 34.55% for the quarter as well as a favorable adjustment to get us to that level on a year-to-date basis as we had been accruing at an effective rate of 34.75% through the first 3 quarters. The 2015 annual rate reflects a favorable shift due to a relative increase in earnings sourced from the U.K., which has a low tax rate. We also benefited from a few discrete items during the quarter, including a couple of deferred tax adjustments due to favorable state or foreign tax rate changes, a couple of refunds and some Fin 48 reserve releases due to settlements or statute expirations. 
As Rob mentioned, fully diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.31 compared to $0.26 last year, a 19% increase, and adjusted earnings per share before restructuring charges was $0.32 a share versus $0.27, again reflecting a 19% improvement. The solid fourth quarter brought our adjusted EPS for the year to $1.42, which is exactly at the midpoint of our guidance provided in February of 2015, notwithstanding the fact that the plunge in scrap prices had a $0.07 negative impact and the strong dollar had a $0.04 negative impact on our year-over-year EPS growth during 2015.
As mentioned in December, starting in 2016, we are changing the definition of adjusted EPS to exclude the after-tax impact of intangible amortization. As highlighted in Appendix 4 on Page 32 of the slide deck, 2015 adjusted EPS under the new definition is $1.49 a share.
As highlighted on Slide 13, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to the varying growth rates of our different businesses and the impact of acquisitions. Since each of our segments has a different margin structure, this mix shift impacts the trend in consolidated margins, and that will become more accentuated once we close the pending Rhiag acquisition and we begin to consolidate the Rhiag results.
And with that, let's get into the details on the segments. Revenue in our North American segment during the fourth quarter in 2015 increased to $1,018,000,000 or almost 1% over 2014. This is the combination of a 7.9% growth rate in parts and services offset by a 39% decline in other revenue, again the latter of which was due to the lower prices received for scrap steel and other metals. Importantly, organic growth in North American parts and services was 5.6%. All in all, this was a very solid quarter. 
Margins in North America during the fourth quarter increased 90 basis points relative to the comparable period of the prior year to 43.2% from 42.3%. This increase was primarily due to our improved pricing to customers in our aftermarket operations, improved procurement in our salvage operations and a mix shift away from self-service, which has lower gross margins than our wholesale operations. 
With respect to operating expenses in our North American segment, we lost approximately 90 basis points of margin compared to the comparable quarter of 2014. On the upside, we continued to experience improvements in fuel costs relative to last year as diesel fuel averaged $2.43 a gallon compared to $3.58 a gallon. As a percent of revenue, fuel costs declined by 40 basis points while we experienced some modest increases in facility and SG&A expenses in our wholesale business. 
Unfortunately, our self-serve unit experienced an increase in operating expenses but meaningfully lower revenue, due both to the significant decline in scrap prices and a modest reduction in the number of cars processed. As a result, operating expenses as a percent of revenue for our self-service operation increased very significantly on a year-over-year basis. 
Slide 16 takes a closer look at scrap steel prices over the past 24 months. You will note that the average price we realized in Q4 of 2015 was approximately $82 a ton, down 56% compared to the average of $187 a ton realized in Q4 of last year. In total, the lower pricing for scrap steel reduced our revenue for the quarter by approximately $26 million on a year-over-year basis. The decline in scrap steel prices had approximately a $0.03 negative impact on our EPS during the quarter. Scrap steel prices have leveled out the last few months, and hopefully, we will not see continued deterioration. 
While we have been dealing with falling scrap prices for a while, during Q4, we also experienced a continued material decline in the prices received for other metals that are a residual of our recycling activities, including aluminum, copper, platinum, palladium and rhodium, which were down between 20% and 45% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. So while revenue from scrap steel was down $30 million during the quarter, revenue derived from selling these other precious metals and catalytic converters was down an incremental $16 million compared to Q4 of last year. So in total, the falling metals prices depressed our North American business by approximately 160 basis points during Q4 of 2015 relative to the margins in the prior year.
In total, for the North American business during the fourth quarter of 2015, the total EBITDA was $131 million, reflecting a 1.3% increase compared to last year. As a percent of revenue, EBITDA for North America was 12.8%, flat with the comparable period of the prior year. In both dollar and percentage terms, the wholesale operations improved relative to the comparable period, with EBITDA margins being up 70 basis points, but the overall segment results were flat as a result of the decline at our self-service operations.
Moving on to our European segment. Total revenue in the fourth quarter accelerated to $487 million from $465 million. Organic growth in Europe during the quarter was 6.3%, reflecting the combination of 8.9% growth at ECP and just under 1% at Sator. The impact of acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 5% increase in revenue. So on a constant-currency basis, European revenue was up 11.3%. These gains were offset by a 6.7% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, creating a negative impact on revenue and resulting in total growth for Europe of 4.6%. 
Gross margins in Europe increased to 38.9%, which was a 160 basis point improvement over the comparable period of 2014. Both ECP and Sator experienced higher gross margins from operations as we continued to benefit from improved procurement in the U.K. and the internalization of the gross margins from acquisitions in The Netherlands. These are the highest quarterly gross margins we have achieved in Europe since early 2012. 
With respect to operating expenses in Europe, we lost about 40 basis points due largely to higher SG&A expense at our U.K. operation, reflecting higher personnel costs to support the growth of the business, including our e-commerce development. European EBITDA totaled $47.4 million, which was a 23.6% increase, even after taking into account the impact of the strong dollar, which had a negative effect of about $3 million. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 9.7% versus 8.2% last year, reflecting a 150 basis point improvement. 
As noted on Slide 19, relative to the fourth quarter of 2014, the pound declined 4% and the euro declined 13% against the dollar. We estimate that for the fourth quarter, the strong dollar reduced European revenue by approximately $31 million compared to Q4 of last year, and removing the impact of the currency swings would have resulted in Q4 revenue growth of 11.3%. Given the significant margin improvement, constant-currency EBITDA growth was 32%, which we believe is quite strong. When taking all currencies into account, the strong dollar reduced Q4 year-over-year EPS growth by a fraction of $0.01 compared to last year.
Turning to our Specialty segment. Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $245 million, a 16% increase over the comparable quarter of last year. Obviously, the impact of the acquisition of Coast Distribution in August of 2015 accounted for the largest component of growth, at 9.5%, but the organic growth rate of 8.1% was also quite strong. 
Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the fourth quarter declined by 280 basis points compared to last year, largely due to the impact of the Coast acquisition. On the bright side, operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were down by about 150 basis points as we continued to see the leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing distribution network as well as the benefit of the lower fuel prices. 
EBITDA for the Specialty segment was $15 million, essentially flat with 2014, and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment decreased by 120 basis points to 6.1%. This is a highly seasonal business, and the fourth quarter is by far the weakest, as demonstrated by the graph in the lower right-hand corner of Slide 20. As highlighted during the third quarter call, we fully anticipated the Coast acquisition, with its focus on the RV marketplace, would accentuate the normal drop in fourth quarter margins, and it did.
Now let's move on to capital allocation, which, given working capital swings, the lumpiness of capital spending and the timing of acquisitions, is best viewed on a full year basis, as presented on Slide 22. You will note that our after-tax cash flow from operations for 2015 was approximately $530 million as we experienced a strong increase in earnings and only a moderate increase in working capital. In 2015, we deployed $330 million of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $170 million to fund capital expenditures and $160 million to fund acquisitions and other investments. So for 2015, we generated $200 million of free cash flow, and we used all of that and some excess cash to repay $224 million of our debt. We closed the quarter with approximately $87 million of cash, of which about $59 million was held outside of the United States.
At December 31, we had $1.6 billion of total debt outstanding, which reflected a leverage ratio of approximately 1.7x as defined by our credit agreement. As announced earlier this month, we completed an amendment to our credit facility, increasing the total capacity by $900 million to a total of $3.2 billion and extending the maturity to January of 2021. Today, our total availability under the new facility is approximately $2.2 billion, which is more than sufficient to fund the acquisition of Rhiag and support the continued growth of our businesses. 
Finally, as noted in our press release, we have provided some guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2016. Please note that our guidance excludes any impact from the proposed Rhiag acquisition, which we hope to close in the second quarter. 
As it relates to the organic growth for parts and services, we ended up at 7% for 2015 and have set the full year range for 2016 at 6% to 8%, essentially consistent with our recent experience. Our range for adjusted EPS, which now excludes the impact of intangible amortization, is $1.59 to $1.69 a share with a midpoint of $1.64. Assumed in that estimate is approximately $19 million of after-tax amortization or about $0.06 per share. Said another way, based on the former reporting definition, the midpoint of adjusted EPS would be $1.58, which is consistent with the current analyst estimates for 2016. 
Going forward, I would ask that all the analysts adapt to the new adjusted EPS format so we have consistency in the EPS estimates. To assist with some of the year-over-year comparisons, Appendices 4 and 5 of the call deck include a reconciliation to the new adjusted format on an annual basis from 2015 to -- or from 2011 to 2015, and on a quarterly basis, for the 4 quarters of 2015. 
The EPS guidance all assumes that the pound sterling, euro and Canadian dollar remain at budgeted levels of $1.45, $1.10 and $0.70, respectively, and importantly, that scrap remains at current levels as well. On a year-over-year basis, I would note that the lower exchange rates have a $0.03 per share negative impact on earnings, and consistent with what we presented in the second quarter call back in July, the new Tamworth distribution facility will have another $0.03 negative impact during 2016. So that's a combined headwind of $0.06 a share compared to 2015, and at the midpoint of the guidance, we are still expecting a 10% year-over-year improvement. 
The corresponding adjusted net income guidance is from $490 million to $520 million. Our assumed tax rate for 2016 is 34.7%, reflecting the slightly lower relative earnings contribution coming from the low tax rate United Kingdom, as the impact of the new distribution facility in Tamworth will slow the earnings growth from that country. 
Our guidance for cash flow from operations is approximately $520 million to $550 million, with a midpoint of $535 million, a small increase over 2015, reflecting continued growth in cash earnings offset by a more meaningful investment in working capital during 2016 compared to 2015. And finally, we set the guidance for capital spending at $170 million to $180 million, up just a bit over 2015. 
At this point, I will turn the call back over to Rob to wrap up."

Yet despite these challenges, we delivered solid results for 2015. 
Now looking ahead. Since the 2008 recession in North America, we have witnessed an increased level of road congestion, which undoubtedly has played a role in the number of the paid claims increasing every year since 2009. Also, the number of vehicles in the U.S. continues to rise, with 264 million registered vehicles on the road at the end of 2015, a year when we witnessed the highest growth rate since 1999. These trends, coupled with the recent upswing in miles driven and lower gas prices, should continue to provide a nice tailwind to our collision business. 
In the U.K., the miles traveled on all roads and classes and the number of vehicles licensed reached the highest levels on record in 2015, trends that should continue to benefit our branch network across the U.K. At Sator, we have largely completed our 3-step to 2-step transformation and are now prepared to move the business forward as a single business operating unit. In addition, with the pending acquisition of Rhiag, our European strategy continues to evolve, and once closed, Rhiag will solidify our market-leading position across all of Europe. Yet we have more runway to grow this fragmented market. 
Also, we continue to be pleased with the performance of our Specialty segment and the timing of our entry in this large and highly fragmented market. The project -- the projected trend -- upward trend in the SAAR rate should continue to benefit this segment. 
In closing, I am proud of the hard work and dedication of our 31,000-plus employees delivered for the company, our stockholders and most importantly, our customers in 2015. I am equally proud of our team's commitment on delivering continued and consistent performance as reflected in our 2016 guidance. To further that point, over the last 16 years, the LKQ team has delivered, on average, 7.5% organic growth, an accomplishment that few can claim, yet one that we have delivered predictably and consistently each and every year. 
Devon, we are now prepared to open the call for Q&A."

Obviously, the North American margins are a little bit of a tale of 2 cities, right, with the increase in EBITDA margins in the wholesale business I mentioned on the call, about 70 basis points, against a drop in the self-service margins. The margins in Europe hit double digits for the year. There are a lot of folks who 12 months ago were wondering how many years it was going to take us to get to double-digit margins in Europe, and we're at 10.1% for the year. So we're very proud of that. We do think that, ultimately, the margins in Europe will have the ability to trend north, though I would caution folks that actually, in 2016, because of the Tamworth facility, I quantified that as $0.03 a share. The reality, from a margin perspective, if you take the roughly $13 million of P&L hit due to Tamworth and you'd lay that against our 2015 results coming out of Europe, we would lose about 65 to 70 basis points of margin just because of that facility. So taking that aside, we think we can get some improvement in margins in Europe in the coming years as we continue to rationalize. We think that once the Rhiag transaction is rolled in, that will give us incremental opportunities to get some savings on procurement, some savings on cataloging, some savings on the e-commerce platform, private labeling, all the things that John is hard at work on  over in Europe."

These MSOs are very tied to the insurance industry in driving alternative parts. So we are very pleased with that, and that -- I don't see that slowing down anytime soon, David. They are very aggressive in consolidating. I did just see a recent report that there are still 40,000 body shops in the United States, so there are still a tremendous amount of independents. But the consolidation will continue. As far as AP usage goes, we haven't seen the 2015 number yet from CCC, but we expect it to be relatively flat again, at 36%, mainly as a result of the SAAR rate. These new cars are demanding new parts. As I said earlier, we do think that's a benefit as these tend to be higher-priced parts. But what we have seen, interestingly enough, is the number of parts per estimate continues to grow. In 2015, it went up to 9.2 parts per estimate, which is a huge trend in our favor. Obviously, as cars get in accidents, we like to see parts get replaced versus repaired because then we can sell our products. So we see that trend continuing for 2 reasons: one, the complexity of the cars. The aluminum car is coming, and I know we see magnesium is being entered into the parts stream as well. These will get replaced more often than repaired. That's a positive. And then the complexity -- the body shop industry tends to be focusing more on replacing than repairing. So all positive trends. And we think when these SAAR rates starts to get into the sweet spot, we'll see that alternative part usage go from 36% to even higher as the parts make their way into the system."

As we told you, going back a year, we had built inventories in Q4 of 2014 in anticipation of a potential port strike on the West Coast. And so as -- we came into the year kind of flush with inventory, and so we didn't need to add as much during the year to support the growth of the business. There was $83 million expansion in inventory during the year. Accounts receivable actually went down in 2015. That is very unusual given a company that's growing its revenues. A lot of that had to do with some new things we were doing, particularly over in The Netherlands at Sator, some new focus on their receivables processing, if you will. We do not anticipate we will get another downtick in accounts receivable. We actually think receivables are going to grow in 2015 (sic) [ 2016 ] as our revenues grow. And so that's the biggest swing. I know, each year, there seems to be something unusual. When you look at the -- if you go back and you look historically at the kind of cash flow from operations, we were at $206 million in 2012, $428 million in '13, down to $371 million in '14, up to $521 million in '15. Most all of that has to do with swings related to working capital. And what I would suggest, if you kind of trend-lined it and normalized that, but take out the peaks and the valleys, that's what you should be thinking about on a kind of on a long-term basis, recognizing that, in any given year, things could move up or down a little bit."

There was actually a study done by Thatcham over in the U.K. that suggests that they believe claims volume will not drop precipitously but severity will. And they actually expect total losses to drop, but the number of claims will. So instead of the violent rollover collision, there'll still be a collision but it just won't be as severe. So they're actually predicting pretty stability. So I think it's fair to say that it's still early days. But I will say this, it is actually part of our strategy to diversify the business. We do think it's coming, but we -- and everything we've read says it's a decade out problem at the earliest.

Nick will follow with a detailed overview of our Q1 financial performance.
Turning to Slide 3. Q1 revenue reached a record $1.92 billion, an increase of 8.3% as compared to $1.77 billion in the first quarter of 2015. Net income for the first quarter of 2016 was $107.7 million, an increase of 0.6% as compared to $107.1 million for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, net income was $128.7 million, an increase of 10.2% as compared to the $116.8 million for the same period of 2015. Diluted earnings per share of $0.35 for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016, was unchanged from the $0.35 for the first quarter of 2015. It is important to note, however, that the Q1 2016 diluted earnings per share included charges equal to $0.07 per share, resulting from restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, losses on debt extinguishment, amortization of acquired intangibles, change in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and an adjustment for gains associated with the hedging the Rhiag purchase price. So on an adjusted basis, EPS grew 10.5% year-over-year in Q1. Nick will provide more specifics on the adjustments shortly. 
Organic revenue growth for parts and services was 6.3% in the quarter, a solid number given the mild weather headwinds we faced in North America and Europe and a tough comp in 2015.
Turning to North America. According to the National Center for Environmental Information, March snow cover in the U.S. was 48% lower than the average coverage witnessed from 1981 to 2015 and the second smallest in the 50 year [indiscernible] with February and March of 2012, ranking third and fourth, respectively, and February of this year was not far behind, recording the 13th smallest level over that same 50-year period. With that as a backdrop, North America delivered an organic revenue growth for parts and services of 4.9% in the quarter, which compared to the 3.6% achieved in Q1 2012 is solid given we experience similar weather anomalies in each of those quarters. 
During Q1, we purchased over 72,000 vehicles for dismantling by our North American wholesale operations, a 2.8% increase over Q1 2015. During Q1, our pricing at auction increased over Q1 2015 by 9%, but we're also buying a younger vehicle by over one year or 13% younger. This younger vehicle procurement strategy positions us to take advantage of the inevitable reduction in the average age of vehicle being repaired, a direct result of the increase in the SAAR rates. Illustrating this point, during the quarter, the average model year age of a vehicle being repaired was younger by over a year compared to the same period in 2015.
For our North American aftermarket business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 18.5% and 58.4%, respectively year-over-year in the quarter.
In our self-service retail business. During Q1, we acquired over 125,000 lower-cost, self-service cars, which is a 25% increase over Q1 2015. Compared to the prior year, we increased our cell service procurement in the quarter to take advantage of the favorable pricing for higher-quality vehicles in this line of business, given the year-over-year declines scrapped pricing. As of late, we have seen a stabilization of scrapped scar pricing. 
Turning to our ongoing intelligent parts solution initiative with CCC Information Systems. In March 2015, we introduced LKQ's recycled parts offering through this platform with initial base of 100 shops in Portland, Grand Rapids and Oklahoma City. From a base of 0 and within less than a year, the initial results are encouraging. Through the end of Q1, LKQ's recycled parts are now accessible to over 2,500 shops in virtually every major city throughout the United States. During Q1, the revenue and number of aftermarket parts purchased processed through the CCC platform grew 82% and 84%, respectively year-over-year.
And lastly, on North America, I want to provide an update on our productivity initiatives to identify potential operational efficiencies. As mentioned on previous calls, we have identified several significant opportunities in 4 key areas with 1 being sales force effectiveness and the second one being optimization. During the quarter, our sales responsibilities were separated from our operations across the United States resulting in a more focused structure.
This structure has 3 regional sales Vice Presidents, a leadership team of district sales manager and inside sales managers as well. We now have a geographically focused sales force that is positioned to compete at a local level, allowing our broader team to handle to increased fall volumes. During the quarter, we implemented additional sales KPI's, focus on increasing total talk time, outbound calls and peer coaching. The initial results of these KPI's are positive, with total talk time and outbound calls increasing 27% and 15%, respectively in the quarter. Under our peer coaching, we have engaged each inside sales manager to increase his or her time on the floor with their sales force. The goal is to have each sales manager spend 18 hours per week on the floor, engaging in side-by-side coaching, which will increase sales skills, lead to higher volume of sales per rep and simultaneously improve the overall, experience to our customer.
Though this coaching structure may create a slight headwind with sales, the long term benefit of driving the performance of our top salespeople should lead to reduction in the overall side of our sales force. In addition, during the quarter, we've made great strides with the information implementation of Roadnet, the Tier 1 provided we've selected for the technology component of our road optimization efforts. Roadnet's fleet and mobile software provide strategic territory and street-level route plans, multi-stock vehicle routing and scheduling, wireless dispatch, vehicle telematics, fuel management and real-time vehicle GPS strategy. Our current utilization rate with Roadnet represents 65% of our North American fleet, which today is accounting for over 2,500 vehicles, driving over 140,000 miles and made over 22,000 stops on a daily basis.
Our goal is to be at a 100% utilization by the end of 2016. 
Now moving onto our European operations. In Q1, our Europe segment had organic revenue growth for proxy services of 6.9%, and acquisition growth of 9.9%, which was offset by a decrease of 4.5% related to foreign exchange rates. During Q1, ECP drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 7.4% and for branches opened more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 5.8%, a solid performance given that ECP had 1 less selling day year-over-year. During the quarter, ECP did not open any additional branches providing our team the bandwidth to focus on capturing incremental margin expansion year-over-year in Q1. During Q1, collision part sales at ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 15.5%. I am pleased with the continued double-digit performance in this line of business, especially given the mild Q1 weather in the U.K, a tough comp in 2015 and again, with 1 less selling day. 
Now turning to our business. During Q1, drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.2%, its highest quarterly rates since we acquired business in May of 2013. We believe our investments in 2014 and 2015 to convert our distribution model from 3 step to two-step is predominantly responsible for not only this acceleration of organic growth but also the year-over-year improvements in gross and EBITDA margins. 
And now on to our Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment continued its strong performance by posting year-over-year total revenue growth of 19.5% in the quarter, including the benefits of Coast acquisition and strong organic revenue growth of 10.8%. I am also pleased with the margin expansion at Specialty, realized in the quarter which Nick will cover shortly. During the quarter, Specialty continued their integration activities from the Coast acquisition by consolidating 2 additional warehouses into our network. Also, the Coast administrative synergies continue to be ahead of our schedule. In addition, our previously mentioned Specialty distribution centers in Michigan and Washington state were both fully operational at the end of Q1. 
Now on Corporate Development. On March 21, 2016, the company closed its previously announced acquisition of Rhiag, a leading Pan-European business-to-business distributor of aftermarket spare parts for passenger cars and commercial vehicles. Rhiag operates to 252 distribution centers and 10 warehouses and serves more than 100,000 professional clients in 10 European countries. And on April 21, 2016, the company closed on its previously announced acquisition of PGW, a leading global distributor and manufacturer of automotive glass products. With the acquisition of PGW and our entrance into the sizable $3.5 billion automotive glass market, we continue to grow our industry-leading position and product offerings to further serve the needs of our professional repair customers. PGW's offerings are complementary to LKQ's existing business and product offerings and together, our respective teams now have the to technology, products and expertise to introduce automotive glass to LKQ's global growth strategy. I am also pleased to announce that PGW has secured 2 new material OE contracts since we announced the acquisition in late February. I am excited to welcome the folks at Rhiag and PGW to the LKQ team. In addition to the Rhiag and PGW acquisitions, during the first quarter of 2016, the company acquired an additional wholesale salvage business based in Sweden. At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more detail and perspective on our financial results and our updated 2016 guidance."

I am delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter, and over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results for our company and review the performance of each of ou",2577,"Thanks, Rob and good morning, to everyone on the call. I am delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter, and over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results for our company and review the performance of each of our 3 segments before touching on the balance sheet and addressing our revised guidance for 2016 now that the Rhiag and PGW transactions have closed. The short version of our financial performance in the first quarter of 2016 is that we had a very good quarter and taken as a whole, was right in line with our expectations. We experienced solid revenue and earnings growth and the headwinds from lower scrapped prices and the strong dollar has started to abate. To be clear, Rhiag closed in late March and was included in our first quarter for only a few days. PGW, just closed last week, and had no impact on our Q1 results. As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the first quarter of 2016 was $1.9 billion, representing an 8.3% increase over last year. That reflects a 10.5% increase in revenue for parts and services, partially offset by a 20% decrease in other revenue, primarily related to the decline in prices for scrapped steel and other metals on a year-over-year basis. The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 6.3% from organic, plus 6% from acquisitions, for constant currency growth of 12.3% before backing out the translation impact of FX, which was a 1.8% decline. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each of the businesses as I walk through the segment results.
As noted on Slide 10 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins improved 20 basis points to 39.6% during the quarter. The uptick reflected approximately a 40 basis point improvement from operations, largely in Europe, offset by a 20 basis point decline due to revenue mix as the revenue growth in our Specialty business, which has the lowest gross margin structure, continued to outpace that of our other operations. We lost about 50 basis points of efficiencies in our operating expenses, largely due to our North American operations. This was due primarily to the continued impact of lower revenue from scrapped in core, which was down $39 million on a year-over-year basis and particularly impacted our self-service operations. Outside of the impact of metal prices, our consolidated distribution costs as a percent of revenue, benefited from lower fuel prices and our SG&A expenses benefited from the acquisition integration synergies in our Specialty operation.
Segment EBITDA totaled $237 million for the quarter, reflecting a 7% increase from 2015. As a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 12.3%, a 20 basis point decrease over the 12.5% recorded last year. The increase in segment EBITDA was offset by an increase in restructuring cost, and the operating income for the first quarter of 2016 was flat in dollar terms and down a bit as a percent of revenue when compared to the same period of the prior year. The restructuring items, primarily relate to expenses connected to the Rhiag acquisition.
You will note a couple of relatively large nonoperating items in our income statement during the first quarter of 2016, including a loss on debt extinguishment and significant other income. As you may recall, we amended our credit facility at the end of January. In addition, we repaid all of Rhiag's debt shortly after closing. Collectively, that accounted for approximately $26.7 million of onetime expenses related to unamortized issuance cost on the former credit agreement and the prepayment penalty associated with the high cost Rhiag debt. Going in the other direction, we hedged the anticipated payment for the Rhiag acquisition and given the movement in the euro between when we set the hedge and the closing date, we had sizable gain, about $18 million, on the hedge. On a combined basis, the net effect of these onetime items was a negative impact on pretax margins, which contracted by about 90 basis points to 8.6%. Our net cash rate during the first quarter was 34.75%, down from 35.5% in 2015 and even with the annual guidance we provided this past February. Diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.35, which was flat last year. However, adjusted EPS, before restructuring charges, the loss on debt extinguishment, the hedge gain and intangible asset amortization was $0.42 a share compared to $0.38, reflecting a 10.5% improvement. As mentioned, the impact of scrapped and currency fluctuations have abated quite a bit and collectively impacted EPS by less than $0.01 during the quarter. While we have included the details on scrapped and currencies in the presentation materials, given their minor impact, I am happy to say I won't be spending much time on those topics during this discussion.
As highlighted on Slide 11, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to the varying growth rates of our different businesses and the impact of acquisitions since in each of our segment has a different margin structure, this makeshift impacts the trend in consolidated margins. This will became more accentuated now that we have closed both Rhiag and PGW and you will begin to see a shift in the second quarter results.
And with that, let's get into the details on the segments. Revenue in our North American segment during the first quarter of 2016 increased to $1.88 billion or a 4% increase over 2015. This is the combination of a 7.3% growth rate in parts and services, offset by a 20% decline in other revenue. The latter, which was primarily due to the lower prices received for scrapped sales and other metals. The 7.3% growth in North American parts and services was a combination of 4.9% organic growth and 3.1% acquisition growth, offset by a 70 basis point FX related decline due to the weakness of the Canadian dollar. There is no doubt that the mild weather had a impact in our revenue escalation claims were down in many states. But it's hard to quantify the impact and in the end, we simply need to work through Mother Nature. All in all, this was a solid quarter in revenue for our North American business.
Gross margins in North America during the first quarter were 42.7%, up just a few basis points. With respect to operating expenses, we lost about 80 basis points of margin compared to the comparable quarter of last year. Our self-serve unit experienced an increase in operating expenses but meaningfully lower revenue due to the significant decline in commodity prices and as a result, operating expenses as a percent of revenue for our self-service operation increased very significantly on a year-over-year basis.
For the North American segment as a whole, the impact of the lower revenue from the sale of scrapped and other commodities increased operating costs as a percent of revenue by approximately 110 basis points. On the upside, we continue to experience improvements in fuel costs relative to last year, picking about 20 basis point of margin as diesel average $2.08 a gallon compared to $2.92 a gallon last year, a 29% decline. Importantly, we began to experience some preliminary benefit from our productivity initiatives during Q1 with our non-inventory related purchasing activities, benefiting from about $400,000 of savings. We would expect this to pick up as we move throughout the year.
The inventory related savings will begin as we purchased inventory at new negotiated prices. The products are received and place in our warehouses and return to inventory. In total, EBITDA for the North American business during the first quarter was $147 million, and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the segment was 13.6% in Q1 of 2016 and down from 14.3% reported in the comparable period the prior year.  The impact of lower revenue from commodities should dissipate in the second half, assuming we get to more comparable scrap pricing. 
Moving onto our European segment. Total revenue in the first quarter accelerated to $547 million from $487 million, a 12.2% increase. Organic growth for parts and services in Europe during the first quarter was 6.9%, reflecting the combination of 7.4% growth at ECP and 6.2% at. The impact of the acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 9.9% increase in revenues, which includes only 2 weeks of activity for Rhiag. So on a constant currency basis, European parts and services revenue was up 16.8% for the quarter. These gains were offset by a 4.5% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, particularly relative to the pound sterling. Gross margins in Europe increased to 38.1%, a 110 basis point improvement over the comparable period of last year. Both ECP and experienced higher gross margins from operations as we continue to benefit from improved procurements in the U.K. and the internalization of the gross margins from the acquisitions in The Netherlands. These are the highest first quarter gross margins we have achieved in Europe in several years. As mentioned, when we announced the Rhiag acquisition back in December, given the three-step distribution model in Italy and Switzerland, Rhiag has lower gross margins than either of ECP or, and beginning in the second quarter, you will see the impact of that on our consolidated European gross margins. 
With respect to operating expenses, as a percent of revenue, we experienced a 10% basis -- or 10 basis point increase on a consolidated European basis. We started paying rent related property cost on the new distribution facility in England, which we call T2 back in February. The incremental cost related to this project in Q1 were about GBP 1.2 million or about $1.8 million, which reflects a 30 basis point increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue for Europe.  Offsetting some of these increase in expense were some FX gains related to hedges utilize to manage our foreign currency exposure on inventory purchases in the U.K. European EBITDA totaled $57.5 million, a 23.6% increase over last year. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA in the first quarter of 2016 was 10.5% versus 9.5% last year, a full 100 basis point improvement even after taking into account the impact of the T2 project.
Relative to the first quarter of 2015, the pound had declined 6% and the euro declined 3% against the dollar. Given the significant margin improvement, constant currency EBITDA growth in Europe was 28.6%, which we believe is robust.
Turning to our Specialty segment. Revenue for the first quarter totaled $288 million, a 19.5% increase over the comparable quarter of 2015. The organic growth rate of 10.8% was very strong while the impact of the acquisition of Coast in August of 2015 added 9.4% of revenue growth. Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the first quarter increased by about 20 basis points compared to last year due to some favorable product mix and favorable inventory capitalization adjustments related to the acquisition integration activities. Operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were down about 30 basis points. We continue to see the leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing network, as well as the benefit of lower fuel prices and lower advertising expenses.
These savings were in part offset by higher costs related to the 2 new distribution facilities added in late 2015 and slightly higher freight expense. EBITDA for the Specialty segment was $32 million, up 25% from the first quarter of last year and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment increased
[Audio Gap]
of our businesses, including $50 million to fund capital expenditures and $575 million to fund the acquisitions and other investments. Now the latter amount includes the monies paid for Rhiag, net of the hedging gain on the purchase price and net of the proceeds from the previously announced sale of our interest in the Australian joint venture. The Rhiag acquisition was financed by drawing down on our line of credit, thus the big inflow from financing. We closed the quarter with about $229 million of cash, of which $177 million was held outside of the United States. The big increase in foreign cash relates to the amounts on Rhiag's balance sheet at the time of acquisition. On March 31, we had about $2.8 billion of total debt outstanding, which reflected the monies borrowed to complete the Rhiag acquisition in late March. The quarter end balance does not include any borrowings related to PGW as that transaction closed in Q2. On a pro forma basis, taking into account the PGW closing, our net debt was approximately $3.3 billion or about 3x pro forma EBITDA. Also, we completed a very successful EUR 500 million issuance of senior notes in early April and we used those proceeds to in part paid down a revolving credit facility used to finance the Rhiag transaction. The key terms of that offering were maturity of 8 years and a fixed interest rate of 3.875%. Today, our total availability under the new credit facility is approximately $1 billion, which we believe is more than sufficient to support the growth of our business. 
Finally, as noted in our press release, we have provided updated guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2016 to includes the impact from the Rhiag and PGW acquisitions. Again, Rhiag closed in May and PGW in late April, so we effectively will record a tad more than 9 month and 8 month of their respective results in 2016. As it relates to the organic growth rates for parts and services, we continue to be comfortable with the range of 6% to 8%, essentially consistent with our recent experience. Our range for adjusted EPS, which again now excludes the after-tax impact of intangible amortization, is $1.76 at the low end to $1.86 per share at the high end, with the midpoint of $1.81 a share. Again, this includes the anticipated impact from our ownership of Rhiag and PGW for 9 and 8 months, respectively in 2016.  The EPS guidance also assumes that the pound sterling and euro remain at budgeted levels of $1.45 and $1.10, respectively and importantly, that scrap remains at current levels as well.
Based on our shares outstanding, that range implies an adjusted net income of approximately $545 million to $575 million, with a midpoint of $560 million.  Our assumed tax rate for 2016 remains at 34.75%. As part of the PGW transaction, under U.S. GAAP, we need to marked the closing date inventory up to market value, which means about an $8 million to $12 million increase in inventory valuation. This amount will get amortized as a noncash expense as we turn the inventory. It won't affect the adjusted net income or adjusted EPS, but it will be a onetime impact on diluted net income and diluted EPS in Q2 and perhaps a bit in Q3.  I believe all the analysts have adapted to the new adjusted EPS format, which we greatly appreciate, and that will ensure we have consistency in the EPS estimates. The appendices to this presentation include the relevant reconciliations for prior year periods.
Our guidance for cash flow from operations is approximately $575 million to $625 million, with the midpoint of $600 million. And finally, we set the adjusted guidance for capital spending at $200 million to $225 million. And at this point, I will turn the call back over to Rob to wrap things up."

If I rank them both, I would say Roadnet's got the bigger impact for a couple of reasons. 1, we can just be so much more confident with our customers as to when their products are going to be there. The route optimization is just incredible on how they route the drivers and for example, one thing that it tries to do is take more right turns than left turns, so you can turn right on red as opposed to crossing traffic when you have to turn left. Those little efficiencies add up dramatically and the effect of ultimately fewer trucks on the road with better service is really going to have an impact on our customer base. As far as the sales KPI's, Tony, we're looking at total clock time sitting with our reps. I think in coaching, this peer coaching that we're doing and monitoring the outbound calls more effectively, I think the net effect of that is better customer service, you're absolutely right. Better contact with our customers, more time on the phone with our customers and really become that vendor of choice as a result because we'll be so much more responsive for their request and needs. So that's moving full steam ahead. Back to the run optimization, I mentioned in my prepared remarks were 65% rolled out. We expect to have that 100% rolled out by the end of this year. So I think the combination of the 2 will provide better customer service on the phone and then better customer service on the delivery end. Really, will raise the bar significant on our customer service levels. So both are equally important."

Nick will follow with a detailed overview of our Q1 financial performance.
  
  Turning to Slide 3. Q1 revenue reached a record $1.92 billion, an increase of 8.3% as compared to $1.77 billion in the first quarter of 2015. Net income for the first quarter of 2016 was $107.7 million, an increase of 0.6% as compared to $107.1 million for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, net income was $128.7 million, an increase of 10.2% as compared to the $116.8 million for the same period of 2015. 
  
  Diluted earnings per share of $0.35 for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016, was unchanged from the $0.35 for the first quarter of 2015. It is important to note, however, that the Q1 2016 diluted earnings per share included charges equal to $0.07 per share, resulting from restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, losses on debt extinguishment, amortization of acquired intangibles, change in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and an adjustment for gains associated with the hedging of the Rhiag purchase price. So on an adjusted basis, EPS grew 10.5% year-over-year in Q1. Nick will provide more specifics on the adjustments shortly. 
  
  Organic revenue growth for parts and services was 6.3% in the quarter, a solid number given the mild weather headwinds we faced in North America and Europe and a tough comp in 2015. Turning to North America. According to the National Center for Environmental Information, March snow cover in the U.S. was 48% lower than the average coverage witnessed from 1981 to 2015 and the second smallest in the 50-year period on record, with February and March of 2012 ranking third and fourth, respectively. And February of this year was not far behind, recording the 13th smallest level over that same 50-year period. With that as a backdrop, North America delivered organic revenue growth for parts and services of 4.9% in the quarter, which, compared to the 3.6% achieved in Q1 2012, is solid given we experienced similar weather anomalies in each of those quarters. 
  
  During Q1, we purchased over 72,000 vehicles for dismantling by our North American wholesale operations, a 2.8% increase over Q1 2015. During Q1, our pricing at auction increased over Q1 2015 by 9%, but we're also buying a younger vehicle by over 1 year or 13% younger. This younger vehicle procurement strategy positions us to take advantage of the inevitable reduction in the average age of vehicle being repaired, a direct result of the increase in the SAAR rates. Illustrating this point, during the quarter, the average model year age of a vehicle being repaired was younger by over a year compared to the same period in 2015.
  
  For our North American aftermarket business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 18.5% and 58.4%, respectively, year-over-year in the quarter. In our self-service retail business, during Q1, we acquired over 125,000 lower-cost, self-service, crush-only cars, which is a 25% increase over Q1 2015. Compared to the prior year, we increased our self-service procurement in the quarter to take advantage of the favorable pricing for higher-quality vehicles in this line of business, given the year-over-year decline in scrap pricing. As of late, we have seen a stabilization of scrap pricing. 
  
  Turning to our ongoing intelligent parts solution initiative with CCC Information Systems (sic) [CCC Information Services] . In March of 2015, we introduced LKQ's recycled parts offering through this platform with initial base of 100 shops in Portland, Grand Rapids and Oklahoma City. From a base of 0 and within less than a year, the initial results are encouraging. Through the end of Q1, LKQ's recycled parts are now accessible to over 2,500 shops in virtually every major city throughout the United States. During Q1, the revenue and number of aftermarket parts purchased processed through the CCC platform grew 82% and 84%, respectively, year-over-year.
  
  And lastly on North America, I want to provide an update on our productivity initiatives to identify potential operational efficiencies. As mentioned on previous calls, we have identified several significant opportunities in 4 key areas with 1 being sales force effectiveness and the second one being route optimization. During the quarter, our sales responsibilities were separated from our operations across the United States, resulting in a more focused structure. This structure has 3 regional sales vice presidents, a leadership team of district sales manager and inside sales managers as well. We now have a geographically focused sales force that is positioned to compete at a local level, allowing our broader team to handle increased fall volumes. 
  
  During the quarter, we implemented additional sales KPIs focused on increasing total talk time, outbound calls and peer coaching. The initial results of these KPIs are positive, with total talk time and outbound calls increasing 27% and 15%, respectively, in the quarter. Under our peer coaching, we have engaged each inside sales manager to increase his or her time on the floor with their sales force. The goal is to have each sales manager spend 18 hours per week on the floor engaging in side-by-side coaching, which will increase sales skills, lead to higher volume of sales per rep and simultaneously improve the overall experience to our customer. Though this coaching structure may create a slight headwind with sales, the long-term benefit of driving the performance of our top salespeople should lead to reduction in the overall size of our sales force. 
  
  In addition, during the quarter, we made great strides with the inflammation -- implementation of Roadnet, the Tier 1 provider we've selected for the technology component of our route optimization efforts. Roadnet's fleet and mobile management software provides strategic territory- and street-level route plans, multi-stack vehicle routing and scheduling, wireless dispatch, vehicle telematics, fuel management and real-time vehicle GPS tracking. Our current utilization rate with Roadnet represents 65% of our North American fleet, which today is accounting for over 2,500 vehicles driving over 140,000 miles and make over 22,000 stops on a daily basis.
  Our goal is to be at a 100% utilization by the end of 2016. 
  
  Now moving on to our European operations. In Q1, our Europe segment had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.9% and acquisition growth of 9.9%, which was offset by a decrease of 4.5% related to foreign exchange rates. During Q1, ECP drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 7.4%, and for branches open more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 5.8%, a solid performance given that ECP had 1 less selling day year-over-year. During the quarter, ECP did not open any additional branches, providing our team the bandwidth to focus on capturing incremental margin expansion year-over-year in Q1. 
  
  During Q1, collision part sales at ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 15.5%. I am pleased with the continued double-digit performance in this line of business, especially given the mild Q1 weather in the U.K, a tough comp in 2015 and, again, with 1 less selling day. 
  
  Now turning to our Sator business. During Q1, Sator drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.2%, its highest quarterly rate since we acquired the business in May of 2013. We believe that our investments in 2014 and 2015 to convert our distribution model from 3-step to 2-step is predominantly responsible for not only this acceleration of organic growth but also the year-over-year improvements in gross and EBITDA margins. 
  
  And now on to our Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment continued strong performance by posting year-over-year total revenue growth of 19.5% in the quarter, including the benefits of Coast acquisition and strong organic revenue growth of 10.8%. I am also pleased with the margin expansion at Specialty realized in the quarter, which Nick will cover shortly. 
  
  During the quarter, Specialty continued their integration activities from the Coast acquisition by consolidating 2 additional warehouses into our network. Also, the Coast administrative synergies continue to be ahead of our schedule. In addition, our previously mentioned Specialty distribution centers in Michigan and Washington state were both fully operational at the end of Q1. 
  
  Now to corporate development. On March 21, 2016, the company closed its previously announced acquisition of Rhiag, a leading pan-European business-to-business distributor of aftermarket spare parts for passenger cars and commercial vehicles. Rhiag operates 252 distribution centers and 10 warehouses and serves more than 100,000 professional clients in 10 European countries.
  
   And on April 21, 2016, the company closed on its previously announced acquisition of PGW, a leading global distributor and manufacturer of automotive glass products. 
  With the acquisition of PGW and our entrance into the sizable $3.5 billion automotive glass market, we continue to grow our industry-leading position and product offerings to further serve the needs of our professional repair customers. PGW's offerings are complementary to LKQ's existing business and product offerings, and together, our respective teams now have the technology, products and expertise to introduce automotive glass to LKQ's global growth strategy. I am also pleased to announce that PGW has secured 2 new material OE contracts since we announced the acquisition in late February. 
  
  I am excited to welcome the folks at both Rhiag and PGW to the LKQ team. In addition to the Rhiag and PGW acquisitions, during the first quarter of 2016, the company acquired an additional wholesale salvage business based in Sweden. 
  
  At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more detail and perspective on our financial results and our updated 2016 guidance."
4303924,331124501,966009,"LKQ Corp., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","LKQ Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everyone on the call. I am delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter, and over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results for our company and review the performance of each of ou",2694,"Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everyone on the call. I am delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter, and over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results for our company and review the performance of each of our 3 segments before touching on the balance sheet and addressing our revised guidance for 2016 now that the Rhiag and PGW transactions have closed. 
  
  The short version of our financial performance in the first quarter of 2016 is that we had a very good quarter, and taken as a whole, it was right in line with our expectations. We experienced solid revenue and earnings growth, and the headwinds from lower scrap prices and the strong dollar has started to abate. To be clear, Rhiag closed in late March and was included in our first quarter for only a few days. PGW, just closed last week and had no impact on our Q1 results. 
  
  As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the first quarter of 2016 was $1.9 billion, representing an 8.3% increase over last year. That reflects a 10.5% increase in revenue from parts and services, partially offset by a 20% decrease in other revenue primarily related to the decline in prices for scrap steel and other metals on a year-over-year basis. The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 6.3% from organic plus 6% from acquisitions, for constant-currency growth of 12.3% before backing out the translation impact of FX, which was a 1.8% decline. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each of the businesses as I walk through the segment results.
  
  As noted on Slide 10 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins improved 20 basis points to 39.6% during the quarter. The uptick reflected approximately a 40 basis point improvement from operations, largely in Europe, offset by a 20 basis point decline due to revenue mix as the revenue growth in our Specialty business, which has the lowest gross margin structure, continued to outpace that of our other operations. 
  
  We lost about 50 basis points of efficiencies in our operating expenses, largely due to our North American operations. This was due primarily to the continued impact of lower revenue from scrap and core, which was down $39 million on a year-over-year basis and particularly impacted our self-service operations. Outside of the impact of metal prices, our consolidated distribution cost as a percent of revenue benefited from lower fuel prices, and our SG&A expenses benefited from the acquisition integration synergies in our Specialty operation.
  
  Segment EBITDA totaled $237 million for the quarter, reflecting a 7% increase from 2015. As a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 12.3%, a 20 basis point decrease over the 12.5% recorded last year. The increase in segment EBITDA was offset by an increase in restructuring cost, and the operating income for the first quarter of 2016 was flat in dollar terms and down a bit as a percent of revenue when compared to the same period of the prior year. The restructuring items primarily relate to expenses connected to the Rhiag acquisition.
  
  You will note a couple of relatively large nonoperating items in our income statement during the first quarter of 2016, including a loss on debt extinguishment and significant other income. As you may recall, we amended our credit facility at the end of January. In addition, we repaid all of Rhiag's debt shortly after closing. Collectively, that accounted for approximately $26.7 million of onetime expenses related to unamortized issuance costs on the former credit agreement and the prepayment penalty associated with the high-cost Rhiag debt. Going in the other direction, we hedged the anticipated payment for the Rhiag acquisition, and given the movement in the euro between when we set the hedge and the closing date, we had sizable gain, about $18 million, on the hedge. On a combined basis, the net effect of these onetime items was a negative impact on pretax margins, which contracted by about 90 basis points to 8.6%. 
  
  Our net cash rate during the first quarter was 34.75%, down from 35.5% in 2015 and even with the annual guidance we provided this past February. Diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.35, which was flat to last year. However, adjusted EPS before restructuring charges, the loss on debt extinguishment, the hedging gain and intangible asset amortization was $0.42 a share compared to $0.38, reflecting a 10.5% improvement. 
  
  As mentioned, the impact of scrap and currency fluctuations have abated quite a bit and collectively impacted EPS by less than $0.01 during the quarter. While we have included the details on scrap and currencies in the presentation material, given their minor impact, I am happy to say I won't be spending much time on those topics during this discussion.
  
  As highlighted on Slide 11, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to the varying growth rates of our different businesses and the impact of acquisitions. Since each of our segment has a different margin structure, this mix shift impacts the trend in consolidated margins. This will become more accentuated now that we have closed both Rhiag and PGW, and you will begin to see a shift in the second quarter results.
  
  And with that, let's get into the details on the segments. Revenue in our North American segment during the first quarter of 2016 increased to $1,088,000,000 or a 4% increase over 2015. This is the combination of a 7.3% growth rate in parts and services, offset by a 20% decline in other revenue, the latter of which was primarily due to the lower prices received for scrap steel and other metals. The 7.3% growth in North American parts and services was a combination of 4.9% organic growth and 3.1% acquisition growth, offset by a 70 basis point FX-related decline due to the weakness of the Canadian dollar. 
  
  There is no doubt that the mild weather had an impact on our revenue as collision claims were down in many states. But it's hard to quantify the impact, and in the end, we simply need to work through Mother Nature. All in all, this was a solid quarter in revenue for our North American business.
  
  Gross margins in North America during the first quarter were 42.7%, up just a few basis points. With respect to operating expenses, we lost about 80 basis points of margin compared to the comparable quarter of last year. Our self-serve unit experienced an increase in operating expenses but meaningfully lower revenue due to the significant decline in commodity prices, and as a result, operating expenses as a percent of revenue for our self-service operation increased very significantly on a year-over-year basis. For the North American segment as a whole, the impact of the lower revenue from the sale of scrap and other commodities increased operating costs as a percent of revenue by approximately 110 basis points. 
  
  On the upside, we continue to experience improvements in fuel costs relative to last year, picking up about 20 basis points of margin as diesel averaged $2.08 a gallon compared to $2.92 a gallon last year, a 29% decline. Importantly, we began to experience some preliminary benefit from our productivity initiatives during Q1, with our non-inventory-related purchasing activities benefiting from about $400,000 of savings. We would expect this to pick up as we move throughout the year. The inventory-related savings will begin as we purchase inventory at new negotiated prices, the products are received and placed in our warehouses and we turn the inventory. 
  
  In total, EBITDA for the North American business during the first quarter was $147 million, and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the segment was 13.6% in Q1 of 2016, down from 14.3% reported in the comparable period the prior year. The impact of lower revenue from commodities should dissipate in the second half, assuming we get to more comparable scrap pricing. 
  
  Moving on to our European segment. Total revenue in the first quarter accelerated to $547 million from $487 million, a 12.2% increase. Organic growth for parts and services in Europe during the first quarter was 6.9%, reflecting the combination of 7.4% growth at ECP and 6.2% at Sator. The impact of the acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 9.9% increase in revenues, which includes only 2 weeks of activity for Rhiag. So on a constant-currency basis, European parts and services revenue was up 16.8% for the quarter. These gains were offset by a 4.5% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, particularly relative to the pound sterling. 
  
  Gross margins in Europe increased to 38.1%, a 110 basis point improvement over the comparable period of last year. Both ECP and Sator experienced higher gross margins from operations as we continue to benefit from improved procurements in the U.K. and the internalization of the gross margins from the acquisitions in The Netherlands. These are the highest first quarter gross margins we have achieved in Europe in several years. As mentioned when we announced the Rhiag acquisition back in December, given the 3-step distribution model in Italy and Switzerland, Rhiag has lower gross margins than either of ECP or Sator, and beginning in the second quarter, you will see the impact of that on our consolidated European gross margins. 
  
  With respect to operating expenses as a percent of revenue, we experienced a 10% basis -- or 10 basis point increase on a consolidated European basis. We started paying rent-related property cost on the new distribution facility in Tamworth England, which we call T2, back in February. The incremental cost related to this project in Q1 were about GBP 1.2 million or about $1.8 million, which reflects a 30 basis point increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue for Europe. Offsetting some of this increase in expense were some FX gains related to hedges utilized to manage our foreign currency exposure on inventory purchases in the U.K. 
  
  European EBITDA totaled $57.5 million, a 23.6% increase over last year. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA in the first quarter of 2016 was 10.5% versus 9.5% last year, a full 100 basis point improvement even after taking into account the impact of the T2 project. Relative to the first quarter of 2015, the pound had declined 6% and the euro declined 3% against the dollar. Given the significant margin improvement, constant-currency EBITDA growth in Europe was 28.6%, which we believe is robust.
  
  Turning to our Specialty segment. Revenue for the first quarter totaled $288 million, a 19.5% increase over the comparable quarter of 2015. The organic growth rate of 10.8% was very strong while the impact of the acquisition of Coast in August of 2015 added 9.4% to revenue growth. 
  Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the first quarter increased by about 20 basis points compared to last year due to some favorable product mix and favorable inventory capitalization adjustments related to the acquisition integration activities. 
  
  Operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were down about 30 basis points. We continue to see the leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing network as well as the benefit of lower fuel prices and lower advertising expenses. These savings were in part offset by higher costs related to the 2 new distribution facilities added in late 2015 and slightly higher freight expense. 
  
  EBITDA for the Specialty segment was $32 million, up 25% from the first quarter of last year, and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment increased 50 basis points to 11% in 2016 compared to 10.5% last year. Remember, this is a highly seasonal business and the first quarter is typically pretty strong, as demonstrated by the graph in the lower-right corner of Slide 16. Consistent with the normal seasonal patterns, you should assume these margins will moderate as we move through the back half of the year.
  
  Let's move on to capital allocation. As presented on Slide 17, you will note that our after-tax cash flow from operations during the first quarter was approximately $119 million as we experienced strong earnings and only a moderate increase in working capital. During the quarter we deployed $625 million of capital to support the growth 
  of our businesses, including $50 million to fund capital expenditures and $575 million to fund the acquisitions and other investments. 
  
  The latter amount includes the moneys paid for Rhiag, net of the hedging gain on the purchase price and net of the proceeds from the previously announced sale of our interest in the Australian joint venture. The Rhiag acquisition was financed by drawing down on our line of credit, thus the big inflow from financing. We closed the quarter with about $229 million of cash, of which $177 million was held outside of the United States. The big increase in foreign cash relates to the amounts on Rhiag's balance sheet at the time of acquisition. 
  
  On March 31, we had about $2.8 billion of total debt outstanding, which reflected the moneys borrowed to complete the Rhiag acquisition in late March. The quarter-end balance does not include any borrowings related to PGW as that transaction closed in Q2. On a pro forma basis, taking into account the PGW closing, our net debt was approximately $3.3 billion or about 3x pro forma EBITDA. 
  
  Also, we completed a very successful EUR 500 million issuance of senior notes in early April, and we used those proceeds to in part pay down the revolving credit facility used to finance the Rhiag transaction. The key terms of that offering were bullet maturity of 8 years and a fixed interest rate of 3.875%. Today, our total availability under the new credit facility is approximately $1 billion, which we believe is more than sufficient to support the growth of our business. 
  
  Finally, as noted in our press release, we have provided updated guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2016 to include the impact from the Rhiag and PGW acquisitions. Again, Rhiag closed in late March and PGW in late April, so we effectively will record a tad more than 9 months and 8 months of their respective results in 2016. 
  As it relates to the organic growth rates for parts and services, we continue to be comfortable with the range of 6% to 8%, essentially consistent with our recent experience. 
  
  Our range for adjusted EPS, which again now excludes the after-tax impact of intangible amortization, is $1.76 at the low end to $1.86 per share at the high end, with a midpoint of $1.81 a share. Again, this includes the anticipated impact from our ownership of Rhiag and PGW for 9 and 8 months, respectively, in 2016. The EPS guidance also assumes that the pound sterling and the euro remain at budgeted levels of $1.45 and $1.10, respectively, and importantly, that scrap remains at current levels as well.  Based on our shares outstanding, that range implies an adjusted net income of approximately $545 million to $575 million, with a midpoint of $560 million. Our assumed tax rate for 2016 remains at 34.75%. 
  
  As part of the PGW transaction, under U.S. GAAP, we need to mark the closing date inventory up to market value, which means about an $8 million to $12 million increase in inventory valuation. This amount will get amortized as a noncash expense as we turn the inventory. It won't affect the adjusted net income or adjusted EPS, but it will be a onetime impact on diluted net income and diluted EPS in Q2 and perhaps a bit in Q3.  
  
  I believe all the analysts have adapted to the new adjusted EPS format, which we greatly appreciate, and that will ensure we have consistency in the EPS estimates. The appendices to this presentation include the relevant reconciliations for prior year periods.
  
  Our guidance for cash flow from operations is approximately $575 million to $625 million, with the midpoint of $600 million. And finally, we set the adjusted guidance for capital spending at $200 million to $225 million. 
  
  And at this point, I will turn the call back over to Rob to wrap things up."

Again, the 2 new facilities from the Specialty segment that we introduced in Q4 of last year, those are, as Rob indicated, fully up and running.

If I rank them both, I would say Roadnet's got the bigger impact for a couple of reasons. One, we can just be so much more confident with our customers as to when their products are going to be there. The route optimization is just incredible on how they route the drivers. And for example, one thing they try to do is take more right turns than left turns. So you can turn right on red as opposed to crossing traffic when you have to turn left. Those little efficiencies add up dramatically. And the effect of ultimately partly putting fewer trucks on the road with better service is really going to have an impact on our customer base. As far as the sales KPIs, Tony, we're looking at total clock time, sitting with our reps. I think -- and coaching, this peer coaching that we're doing, and monitoring the outbound calls more effectively. I think the net effect of that is better customer service, you're absolutely right. We have better contact with our customers, more time on the phone with our customers and really become that vendor of choice as a result because we'll be so much more responsive to their request and needs. So that's moving full steam ahead. Back to the route optimization, I mentioned in my prepared remarks is 65% rolled out. We expect to have that 100% rolled out by the end of this year. So I think the combination of the 2, where we'll provide better customer service on the phone and then better customer service on the delivery end, really will raise the bar significantly on our customer service levels.

Nick will follow with a detailed overview of our Q1 financial performance.
  
  Turning to Slide 3. Q1 revenue reached a record $1.92 billion, an increase of 8.3% as compared to $1.77 billion in the first quarter of 2015. Net income for the first quarter of 2016 was $107.7 million, an increase of 0.6% as compared to $107.1 million for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, net income was $128.7 million, an increase of 10.2% as compared to the $116.8 million for the same period of 2015. 
  
  Diluted earnings per share of $0.35 for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016, was unchanged from the $0.35 for the first quarter of 2015. It is important to note, however, that the Q1 2016 diluted earnings per share included charges equal to $0.07 per share, resulting from restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, losses on debt extinguishment, amortization of acquired intangibles, change in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and an adjustment for gains associated with the hedging of the Rhiag purchase price. So on an adjusted basis, EPS grew 10.5% year-over-year in Q1. Nick will provide more specifics on the adjustments shortly. 
  
  Organic revenue growth for parts and services was 6.3% in the quarter, a solid number given the mild weather headwinds we faced in North America and Europe and a tough comp in 2015. Turning to North America. According to the National Center for Environmental Information, March snow cover in the U.S. was 48% lower than the average coverage witnessed from 1981 to 2015 and the second smallest in the 50-year period on record, with February and March of 2012 ranking third and fourth, respectively. And February of this year was not far behind, recording the 13th smallest level over that same 50-year period. With that as a backdrop, North America delivered organic revenue growth for parts and services of 4.9% in the quarter, which, compared to the 3.6% achieved in Q1 2012, is solid given we experienced similar weather anomalies in each of those quarters. 
  
  During Q1, we purchased over 72,000 vehicles for dismantling by our North American wholesale operations, a 2.8% increase over Q1 2015. During Q1, our pricing at auction increased over Q1 2015 by 9%, but we were also buying a younger vehicle by over 1 year or 13% younger. This younger vehicle procurement strategy positions us to take advantage of the inevitable reduction in the average age of vehicle being repaired, a direct result of the increase in the SAAR rates. Illustrating this point, during the quarter, the average model year age of a vehicle being repaired was younger by over a year compared to the same period in 2015.
  
  For our North American aftermarket business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 18.5% and 58.4%, respectively, year-over-year in the quarter. In our self-service retail business, during Q1, we acquired over 125,000 lower-cost, self-service and crush-only cars, which is a 25% increase over Q1 2015. Compared to the prior year, we increased our self-service procurement in the quarter to take advantage of the favorable pricing for higher-quality vehicles in this line of business, given the year-over-year decline in scrap pricing. As of late, we have seen a stabilization of scrap pricing. 
  
  Turning to our ongoing intelligent parts solution initiative with CCC Information Systems (sic) [CCC Information Services] . In March of 2015, we introduced LKQ's recycled parts offering through this platform with initial base of 100 shops in Portland, Grand Rapids and Oklahoma City. From a base of 0 and within less than a year, the initial results are encouraging. Through the end of Q1, LKQ's recycled parts are now accessible to over 2,500 shops in virtually every major city throughout the United States. During Q1, the revenue and number of aftermarket parts purchased processed through the CCC platform grew 82% and 84%, respectively, year-over-year.
  
  And lastly on North America, I want to provide an update on our productivity initiatives to identify potential operational efficiencies. As mentioned on previous calls, we have identified several significant opportunities in 4 key areas with 1 being sales force effectiveness and the second one being route optimization. During the quarter, our sales responsibilities were separated from our operations across the United States, resulting in a more focused structure. This structure has 3 regional sales vice presidents, a leadership team of district sales manager and inside sales managers as well. We now have a geographically focused sales force that is positioned to compete at a local level, allowing our broader team to handle increased call volumes. 
  
  During the quarter, we implemented additional sales KPIs focused on increasing total talk time, outbound calls and peer coaching. The initial results of these KPIs are positive, with total talk time and outbound calls increasing 27% and 15%, respectively, in the quarter. Under our peer coaching, we have engaged each inside sales manager to increase his or her time on the floor with their sales force. The goal is to have each sales manager spend 18 hours per week on the floor engaging in side-by-side coaching, which will increase sales skills, lead to higher volume of sales per rep and simultaneously improve the overall experience to our customer. Though this coaching structure may create a slight headwind with sales, the long-term benefit of driving the performance of our top salespeople should lead to a reduction in the overall size of our sales force. 
  
  In addition, during the quarter, we made great strides with the inflammation -- implementation of Roadnet, the Tier 1 provider we've selected for the technology component of our route optimization efforts. Roadnet's fleet and mobile management software provides strategic territory- and street-level route plans, multi-stop vehicle routing and scheduling, wireless dispatch, vehicle telematics, fuel management and real-time vehicle GPS tracking. Our current utilization rate with Roadnet represents 65% of our North American fleet, which today is accounting for over 2,500 vehicles driving over 140,000 miles and make over 22,000 stops on a daily basis.
  Our goal is to be at a 100% utilization by the end of 2016. 
  
  Now moving on to our European operations. In Q1, our Europe segment had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.9% and acquisition growth of 9.9%, which was offset by a decrease of 4.5% related to foreign exchange rates. During Q1, ECP drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 7.4%, and for branches open more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 5.8%, a solid performance given that ECP had 1 less selling day year-over-year. During the quarter, ECP did not open any additional branches, providing our team the bandwidth to focus on capturing incremental margin expansion year-over-year in Q1. 
  
  During Q1, collision part sales at ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 15.5%. I am pleased with the continued double-digit performance in this line of business, especially given the mild Q1 weather in the U.K, a tough comp in 2015 and, again, with 1 less selling day. 
  
  Now turning to our Sator business. During Q1, Sator drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.2%, its highest quarterly rate since we acquired the business in May of 2013. We believe that our investments in 2014 and 2015 to convert our distribution model from 3-step to 2-step is predominantly responsible for not only this acceleration of organic growth but also the year-over-year improvements in gross and EBITDA margins. 
  
  And now on to our Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment continued strong performance by posting year-over-year total revenue growth of 19.5% in the quarter, including the benefits of Coast acquisition and strong organic revenue growth of 10.8%. I am also pleased with the margin expansion at Specialty realized in the quarter, which Nick will cover shortly. 
  
  During the quarter, Specialty continued their integration activities from the Coast acquisition by consolidating 2 additional warehouses into our network. Also, the Coast administrative synergies continue to be ahead of our schedule. In addition, our previously mentioned Specialty distribution centers in Michigan and Washington state were both fully operational at the end of Q1. 
  
  Now to corporate development. On March 21, 2016, the company closed its previously announced acquisition of Rhiag, a leading pan-European business-to-business distributor of aftermarket spare parts for passenger cars and commercial vehicles. Rhiag operates through 252 distribution centers and 10 warehouses and serves more than 100,000 professional clients in 10 European countries.
  
  And on April 21, 2016, the company closed on its previously announced acquisition of PGW, a leading global distributor and manufacturer of automotive glass products. 
  With the acquisition of PGW and our entrance into the sizable $3.5 billion automotive glass market, we continue to grow our industry-leading position and product offerings to further serve the needs of our professional repair customers. PGW's offerings are complementary to LKQ's existing business and product offerings, and together, our respective teams now have the technology, products and expertise to introduce automotive glass to LKQ's global growth strategy. I am also pleased to announce that PGW has secured 2 new material OE contracts since we announced the acquisition in late February. 
  
  I am excited to welcome the folks at both Rhiag and PGW to the LKQ team. In addition to the Rhiag and PGW acquisitions, during the first quarter of 2016, the company acquired an additional wholesale salvage business based in Sweden. 
  
  At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more detail and perspective on our financial results and our updated 2016 guidance."
4303924,331124501,966187,"LKQ Corp., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","LKQ Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everyone on the call. I am delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter, and over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results for our company and review the performance of each of ou",2694,"Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everyone on the call. I am delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter, and over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results for our company and review the performance of each of our 3 segments before touching on the balance sheet and addressing our revised guidance for 2016 now that the Rhiag and PGW transactions have closed. 
  
  The short version of our financial performance in the first quarter of 2016 is that we had a very good quarter, and taken as a whole, it was right in line with our expectations. We experienced solid revenue and earnings growth, and the headwinds from lower scrap prices and the strong dollar has started to abate. To be clear, Rhiag closed in late March and was included in our first quarter for only a few days. PGW just closed last week and had no impact on our Q1 results. 
  
  As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the first quarter of 2016 was $1.9 billion, representing an 8.3% increase over last year. That reflects a 10.5% increase in revenue from parts and services, partially offset by a 20% decrease in other revenue, primarily related to the decline in prices for scrap steel and other metals on a year-over-year basis. The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 6.3% from organic plus 6% from acquisitions, for constant-currency growth of 12.3% before backing out the translation impact of FX, which was a 1.8% decline. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each of the businesses as I walk through the segment results.
  
  As noted on Slide 10 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins improved 20 basis points to 39.6% during the quarter. The uptick reflected approximately a 40 basis point improvement from operations, largely in Europe, offset by a 20 basis point decline due to revenue mix as the revenue growth in our Specialty business, which has the lowest gross margin structure, continued to outpace that of our other operations. 
  
  We lost about 50 basis points of efficiencies in our operating expenses, largely due to our North American operations. This was due primarily to the continued impact of lower revenue from scrap and core, which was down $39 million on a year-over-year basis and particularly impacted our self-service operations. Outside of the impact of metal prices, our consolidated distribution cost as a percent of revenue benefited from lower fuel prices, and our SG&A expenses benefited from the acquisition integration synergies in our Specialty operation.
  
  Segment EBITDA totaled $237 million for the quarter, reflecting a 7% increase from 2015. As a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 12.3%, a 20 basis point decrease over the 12.5% recorded last year. The increase in segment EBITDA was offset by an increase in restructuring cost, and the operating income for the first quarter of 2016 was flat in dollar terms and down a bit as a percent of revenue when compared to the same period of the prior year. The restructuring items primarily relate to expenses connected to the Rhiag acquisition.
  
  You will note a couple of relatively large nonoperating items in our income statement during the first quarter of 2016, including a loss on debt extinguishment and significant other income. As you may recall, we amended our credit facility at the end of January. In addition, we repaid all of Rhiag's debt shortly after closing. Collectively, that accounted for approximately $26.7 million of onetime expenses related to unamortized issuance costs on the former credit agreement and the prepayment penalty associated with the high-cost Rhiag debt. Going in the other direction, we hedged the anticipated payment for the Rhiag acquisition, and given the movement in the euro between when we set the hedge and the closing date, we had sizable gain, about $18 million, on the hedge. On a combined basis, the net effect of these onetime items was a negative impact on pretax margins, which contracted by about 90 basis points to 8.6%. 
  
  Our net cash rate during the first quarter was 34.75%, down from 35.5% in 2015 and even with the annual guidance we provided this past February. Diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.35, which was flat to last year. However, adjusted EPS before restructuring charges, the loss on debt extinguishment, the hedging gain and intangible asset amortization was $0.42 a share compared to $0.38, reflecting a 10.5% improvement. 
  
  As mentioned, the impact of scrap and currency fluctuations have abated quite a bit and collectively impacted EPS by less than $0.01 during the first quarter. While we have included the details on scrap and currencies in the presentation material, given their minor impact, I am happy to say I won't be spending much time on those topics during this discussion.
  
  As highlighted on Slide 11, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to the varying growth rates of our different businesses and the impact of acquisitions. Since each of our segments has a different margin structure, this mix shift impacts the trend in consolidated margins. This will become more accentuated now that we have closed both Rhiag and PGW, and you will begin to see a shift in the second quarter results.
  
  And with that, let's get into the details on the segments. Revenue in our North American segment during the first quarter of 2016 increased to $1,088,000,000 or a 4% increase over 2015. This is the combination of a 7.3% growth rate in parts and services, offset by a 20% decline in other revenue, the latter of which was primarily due to the lower prices received for scrap steel and other metals. The 7.3% growth in North American parts and services was a combination of 4.9% organic growth and 3.1% acquisition growth, offset by a 70 basis point FX-related decline due to the weakness of the Canadian dollar. 
  
  There is no doubt that the mild weather had an impact on our revenue as collision claims were down in many states. But it's hard to quantify the impact, and in the end, we simply need to work through Mother Nature. All in all, this was a solid quarter in revenue for our North American business.
  
  Gross margins in North America during the first quarter were 42.7%, up just a few basis points. With respect to operating expenses, we lost about 80 basis points of margin compared to the comparable quarter of last year. Our self-serve unit experienced an increase in operating expenses but meaningfully lower revenue due to the significant decline in commodity prices, and as a result, operating expenses as a percent of revenue for our self-service operation increased very significantly on a year-over-year basis. For the North American segment as a whole, the impact of the lower revenue from the sale of scrap and other commodities increased operating costs as a percent of revenue by approximately 110 basis points. 
  
  On the upside, we continue to experience improvements in fuel costs relative to last year, picking up about 20 basis points of margin as diesel averaged $2.08 a gallon compared to $2.92 a gallon last year, a 29% decline. Importantly, we began to experience some preliminary benefit from our productivity initiatives during Q1, with our non-inventory-related purchasing activities benefiting from about $400,000 of savings. We would expect this to pick up as we move throughout the year. The inventory-related savings will begin as we purchase inventory at new negotiated prices, the products are received and placed in our warehouses and we turn the inventory. 
  
  In total, EBITDA for the North American business during the first quarter was $147 million, and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for this segment was 13.6% in Q1 of 2016, down from 14.3% reported in the comparable period the prior year. The impact of lower revenue from commodities should dissipate in the second half, assuming we get to more comparable scrap pricing. 
  
  Moving on to our European segment. Total revenue in the first quarter accelerated to $547 million from $487 million, a 12.2% increase. Organic growth for parts and services in Europe during the first quarter was 6.9%, reflecting the combination of 7.4% growth at ECP and 6.2% at Sator. The impact of the acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 9.9% increase in revenues, which includes only 2 weeks of activity for Rhiag. So on a constant-currency basis, European parts and services revenue was up 16.8% for the quarter. These gains were offset by a 4.5% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, particularly relative to the pound sterling. 
  
  Gross margins in Europe increased to 38.1%, a 110 basis point improvement over the comparable period of last year. Both ECP and Sator experienced higher gross margins from operations as we continue to benefit from improved procurements in the U.K. and the internalization of the gross margins from the acquisitions in The Netherlands. These are the highest first quarter gross margins we have achieved in Europe in several years. As mentioned when we announced the Rhiag acquisition back in December, given the 3-step distribution model in Italy and Switzerland, Rhiag has lower gross margins than either ECP or Sator, and beginning in the second quarter, you will see the impact of that on our consolidated European gross margins. 
  
  With respect to operating expenses as a percent of revenue, we experienced a 10% basis -- or 10 basis point increase on a consolidated European basis. We started paying rent-related property cost on the new distribution facility in Tamworth, England, which we call T2, back in February. The incremental costs related to this project in Q1 were about GBP 1.2 million or about $1.8 million, which reflects a 30 basis point increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue for Europe. Offsetting some of this increase in expense were some FX gains related to hedges utilized to manage our foreign currency exposure on inventory purchases in the U.K. 
  
  European EBITDA totaled $57.5 million, a 23.6% increase over last year. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA in the first quarter of 2016 was 10.5% versus 9.5% last year, a full 100 basis point improvement even after taking into account the impact of the T2 project. Relative to the first quarter of 2015, the pound had declined 6% and the euro declined 3% against the dollar. Given the significant margin improvement, constant-currency EBITDA growth in Europe was 28.6%, which we believe is robust.
  
  Turning to our Specialty segment. Revenue for the first quarter totaled $288 million, a 19.5% increase over the comparable quarter of 2015. The organic growth rate of 10.8% was very strong while the impact of the acquisition of Coast in August of 2015 added 9.4% to revenue growth. 
  Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the first quarter increased by about 20 basis points compared to last year due to some favorable product mix and favorable inventory capitalization adjustments related to the acquisition integration activities. 
  
  Operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were down about 30 basis points. We continue to see the leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing network as well as the benefit of lower fuel prices and lower advertising expenses. These savings were in part offset by higher costs related to the 2 new distribution facilities added in late 2015 and slightly higher freight expense. 
  
  EBITDA for the Specialty segment was $32 million, up 25% from the first quarter of last year, and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment increased 50 basis points to 11% in 2016 compared to 10.5% last year. Remember, this is a highly seasonal business and the first quarter is typically pretty strong, as demonstrated by the graph in the lower-right corner of Slide 16. Consistent with the normal seasonal patterns, you should assume these margins will moderate as we move through the back half of the year.
  
  Let's move on to capital allocation. As presented on Slide 17, you will note that our after-tax cash flow from operations during the first quarter was approximately $119 million as we experienced strong earnings and only a moderate increase in working capital. During the quarter we deployed $625 million of capital to support the growth 
  of our businesses, including $50 million to fund capital expenditures and $575 million to fund the acquisitions and other investments. 
  
  The latter amount includes the moneys paid for Rhiag, net of the hedging gain on the purchase price and net of the proceeds from the previously announced sale of our interest in the Australian joint venture. The Rhiag acquisition was financed by drawing down on our line of credit, thus the big inflow from financing. We closed the quarter with about $229 million of cash, of which $177 million was held outside of the United States. The big increase in foreign cash relates to the amounts on Rhiag's balance sheet at the time of acquisition. 
  
  On March 31, we had about $2.8 billion of total debt outstanding, which reflected the moneys borrowed to complete the Rhiag acquisition in late March. The quarter-end balance does not include any borrowings related to PGW as that transaction closed in Q2. On a pro forma basis, taking into account the PGW closing, our net debt was approximately $3.3 billion or about 3x pro forma EBITDA. 
  
  Also, we completed a very successful EUR 500 million issuance of senior notes in early April, and we used those proceeds to in part pay down the revolving credit facility used to finance the Rhiag transaction. The key terms of that offering were bullet maturity of 8 years and a fixed interest rate of 3.875%. Today, our total availability under the new credit facility is approximately $1 billion, which we believe is more than sufficient to support the growth of our business. 
  
  Finally, as noted in our press release, we have provided updated guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2016 to include the impact from the Rhiag and PGW acquisitions. Again, Rhiag closed in late March and PGW in late April, so we effectively will record a tad more than 9 months and 8 months of their respective results in 2016. 
  As it relates to the organic growth rates for parts and services, we continue to be comfortable with the range of 6% to 8%, essentially consistent with our recent experience. 
  
  Our range for adjusted EPS, which again now excludes the after-tax impact of intangible amortization, is $1.76 at the low end to $1.86 per share at the high end, with a midpoint of $1.81 a share. Again, this includes the anticipated impact from our ownership of Rhiag and PGW for 9 and 8 months, respectively, in 2016. The EPS guidance also assumes that the pound sterling and the euro remain at budgeted levels of $1.45 and $1.10, respectively, and importantly, that scrap remains at current levels as well. Based on our shares outstanding, that range implies an adjusted net income of approximately $545 million to $575 million, with a midpoint of $560 million. Our assumed tax rate for 2016 remains at 34.75%. 
  
  As part of the PGW transaction, under U.S. GAAP, we need to mark the closing date inventory up to market value, which means about an $8 million to $12 million increase in inventory valuation. This amount will get amortized as a noncash expense as we turn the inventory. It won't affect the adjusted net income or adjusted EPS, but it will be a onetime impact on diluted net income and diluted EPS in Q2 and perhaps a bit in Q3.  
  
  I believe all the analysts have adapted to the new adjusted EPS format, which we greatly appreciate, and that will ensure we have consistency in the EPS estimates. The appendices to this presentation include the relevant reconciliations for prior year periods.
  
  Our guidance for cash flow from operations is approximately $575 million to $625 million, with the midpoint of $600 million. And finally, we set the adjusted guidance for capital spending at $200 million to $225 million. 
  
  And at this point, I will turn the call back over to Rob to wrap things up."

And most importantly, I believe we have a stellar team of 35,000-plus fellow employees dedicated to carrying on our mission globally, and I want to thank each and every one of them for their collective efforts.

And of course, just with the automation, we do expect a lot more efficiencies as well, both in terms of pulling quicker and getting it to our customers even quicker as well."

That's more of a timing issue ultimately that'll work through the system. The inventory may go up a bit, but it's not going to be a wholesale change. The key of what the large national distribution facilities allow us to do is that's where some of the longer-dated inventory is held. And being able to have that and get it to our branches when needed quickly and through some of the automated picking processes and the like, that's the real benefit of that. So near-term inventory will go up a little bit as we're working through the transition going from 4 facilities down to 2 facilities because you need to have inventory ready for the customer, but longer term, there shouldn't be a major impact."

If I rank them both, I would say Roadnet's got the bigger impact for a couple of reasons. One, we can just be so much more confident with our customers as to when their products are going to be there. The route optimization is just incredible on how they route the drivers. And for example, one thing they try to do is take more right turns than left turns. So you can turn right on red as opposed to crossing traffic when you have to turn left. Those little efficiencies add up dramatically. And the effect of ultimately partly putting fewer trucks on the road with better service is really going to have an impact on our customer base. As far as the sales KPIs, Tony, we're looking at total clock time, sitting with our reps. I think -- and coaching, this peer coaching that we're doing, and monitoring the outbound calls more effectively. I think the net effect of that is better customer service, you're absolutely right. We have better contact with our customers, more time on the phone with our customers and really become that vendor of choice as a result because we'll be so much more responsive to their request and needs. So that's moving full steam ahead. Back to the route optimization, I mentioned in my prepared remarks is 65% rolled out. We expect to have that 100% rolled out by the end of this year. So I think the combination of the 2, where we'll provide better customer service on the phone and then better customer service on the delivery end, really will raise the bar significantly on our customer service levels. So both are equally important."

This morning, I will begin our review of the quarter with a few high-level financial metrics, followed by an update on our operating segments and the various macro trends each segment witnessed in their respective markets and conclude with an update on our corporate development achievements in the quarter. Nick will follow with a detailed overview of our Q1 financial performance.
Turning to Slide 3. Q1 revenue reached a record $1.92 billion, an increase of 8.3% as compared to $1.77 billion in the first quarter of 2015. Net income for the first quarter of 2016 was $107.7 million, an increase of 0.6% as compared to $107.1 million for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, net income was $128.7 million, an increase of 10.2% as compared to the $116.8 million for the same period of 2015.
Diluted earnings per share of $0.35 for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016, was unchanged from the $0.35 for the first quarter of 2015. It is important to note, however, that the Q1 2016 diluted earnings per share included charges equal to $0.07 per share, resulting from restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, losses on debt extinguishment, amortization of acquired intangibles, change in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and an adjustment for gains associated with the hedging of the Rhiag purchase price. So on an adjusted basis, EPS grew 10.5% year-over-year in Q1. Nick will provide more specifics on the adjustments shortly.
Organic revenue growth for parts and services was 6.3% in the quarter, a solid number given the mild weather headwinds we faced in North America and Europe and a tough comp in 2015. Turning to North America. According to the National Center for Environmental Information, March snow cover in the U.S. was 48% lower than the average coverage witnessed from 1981 to 2015 and the second smallest in the 50-year period on record, with February and March of 2012 ranking third and fourth, respectively. And February of this year was not far behind, recording the 13th smallest level over that same 50-year period. With that as a backdrop, North America delivered organic revenue growth for parts and services of 4.9% in the quarter, which, compared to the 3.6% achieved in Q1 2012, is solid given we experienced similar weather anomalies in each of those quarters.
During Q1, we purchased over 72,000 vehicles for dismantling by our North American wholesale operations, a 2.8% increase over Q1 2015. During Q1, our pricing at auction increased over Q1 2015 by 9%, but we were also buying a younger vehicle by over 1 year or 13% younger. This younger vehicle procurement strategy positions us to take advantage of the inevitable reduction in the average age of vehicle being repaired, a direct result of the increase in the SAAR rates. Illustrating this point, during the quarter, the average model year age of a vehicle being repaired was younger by over a year compared to the same period in 2015.
For our North American aftermarket business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 18.5% and 58.4%, respectively, year-over-year in the quarter. In our self-service retail business, during Q1, we acquired over 125,000 lower-cost, self-service and crush-only cars, which is a 25% increase over Q1 2015. Compared to the prior year, we increased our self-service procurement in the quarter to take advantage of the favorable pricing for higher-quality vehicles in this line of business, given the year-over-year decline in scrap pricing. As of late, we have seen a stabilization of scrap pricing.
Turning to our ongoing intelligent parts solution initiative with CCC Information Systems (sic) [CCC Information Services] . In March of 2015, we introduced LKQ's recycled parts offering through this platform with initial base of 100 shops in Portland, Grand Rapids and Oklahoma City. From a base of 0 and within less than a year, the initial results are encouraging. Through the end of Q1, LKQ's recycled parts are now accessible to over 2,500 shops in virtually every major city throughout the United States. During Q1, the revenue and number of aftermarket parts purchased processed through the CCC platform grew 82% and 84%, respectively, year-over-year.
And lastly on North America, I want to provide an update on our productivity initiatives to identify potential operational efficiencies. As mentioned on previous calls, we have identified several significant opportunities in 4 key areas with 1 being sales force effectiveness and the second one being route optimization. During the quarter, our sales responsibilities were separated from our operations across the United States, resulting in a more focused structure. This structure has 3 regional sales vice presidents, a leadership team of district sales manager and inside sales managers as well. We now have a geographically focused sales force that is positioned to compete at a local level, allowing our broader team to handle increased call volumes.
During the quarter, we implemented additional sales KPIs focused on increasing total talk time, outbound calls and peer coaching. The initial results of these KPIs are positive, with total talk time and outbound calls increasing 27% and 15%, respectively, in the quarter. Under our peer coaching, we have engaged each inside sales manager to increase his or her time on the floor with their sales force. The goal is to have each sales manager spend 18 hours per week on the floor engaging in side-by-side coaching, which will increase sales skills, lead to higher volume of sales per rep and simultaneously improve the overall experience to our customer. Though this coaching structure may create a slight headwind with sales, the long-term benefit of driving the performance of our top salespeople should lead to a reduction in the overall size of our sales force.
In addition, during the quarter, we made great strides with the inflammation -- implementation of Roadnet, the Tier 1 provider we've selected for the technology component of our route optimization efforts. Roadnet's fleet and mobile management software provides strategic territory- and street-level route plans, multi-stop vehicle routing and scheduling, wireless dispatch, vehicle telematics, fuel management and real-time vehicle GPS tracking. Our current utilization rate with Roadnet represents 65% of our North American fleet, which today is accounting for over 2,500 vehicles driving over 140,000 miles and make over 22,000 stops on a daily basis. Our goal is to be at a 100% utilization by the end of 2016.
Now moving on to our European operations. In Q1, our Europe segment had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.9% and acquisition growth of 9.9%, which was offset by a decrease of 4.5% related to foreign exchange rates. During Q1, ECP drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 7.4%, and for branches open more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 5.8%, a solid performance given that ECP had 1 less selling day year-over-year. During the quarter, ECP did not open any additional branches, providing our team the bandwidth to focus on capturing incremental margin expansion year-over-year in Q1.
During Q1, collision part sales at ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 15.5%. I am pleased with the continued double-digit performance in this line of business, especially given the mild Q1 weather in the U.K, a tough comp in 2015 and, again, with 1 less selling day.
Now turning to our Sator business. During Q1, Sator drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.2%, its highest quarterly rate since we acquired the business in May of 2013. We believe that our investments in 2014 and 2015 to convert our distribution model from 3-step to 2-step is predominantly responsible for not only this acceleration of organic growth but also the year-over-year improvements in gross and EBITDA margins.
And now on to our Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment continued strong performance by posting year-over-year total revenue growth of 19.5% in the quarter, including the benefits of Coast acquisition and strong organic revenue growth of 10.8%. I am also pleased with the margin expansion at Specialty realized in the quarter, which Nick will cover shortly.
During the quarter, Specialty continued their integration activities from the Coast acquisition by consolidating 2 additional warehouses into our network. Also, the Coast administrative synergies continue to be ahead of our schedule. In addition, our previously mentioned Specialty distribution centers in Michigan and Washington state were both fully operational at the end of Q1.
Now to corporate development. On March 21, 2016, the company closed its previously announced acquisition of Rhiag, a leading pan-European business-to-business distributor of aftermarket spare parts for passenger cars and commercial vehicles. Rhiag operates through 252 distribution centers and 10 warehouses and serves more than 100,000 professional clients in 10 European countries.
And on April 21, 2016, the company closed on its previously announced acquisition of PGW, a leading global distributor and manufacturer of automotive glass products.
With the acquisition of PGW and our entrance into the sizable $3.5 billion automotive glass market, we continue to grow our industry-leading position and product offerings to further serve the needs of our professional repair customers. PGW's offerings are complementary to LKQ's existing business and product offerings, and together, our respective teams now have the technology, products and expertise to introduce automotive glass to LKQ's global growth strategy. I am also pleased to announce that PGW has secured 2 new material OE contracts since we announced the acquisition in late February.
I am excited to welcome the folks at both Rhiag and PGW to the LKQ team. In addition to the Rhiag and PGW acquisitions, during the first quarter of 2016, the company acquired an additional wholesale salvage business based in Sweden.
At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more detail and perspective on our financial results and our updated 2016 guidance."

I am delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter, and over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results for our company and review the performance of each of ou",2694,"Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everyone on the call. I am delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter, and over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results for our company and review the performance of each of our 3 segments before touching on the balance sheet and addressing our revised guidance for 2016 now that the Rhiag and PGW transactions have closed.
The short version of our financial performance in the first quarter of 2016 is that we had a very good quarter, and taken as a whole, it was right in line with our expectations. We experienced solid revenue and earnings growth, and the headwinds from lower scrap prices and the strong dollar has started to abate. To be clear, Rhiag closed in late March and was included in our first quarter for only a few days. PGW just closed last week and had no impact on our Q1 results.
As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the first quarter of 2016 was $1.9 billion, representing an 8.3% increase over last year. That reflects a 10.5% increase in revenue from parts and services, partially offset by a 20% decrease in other revenue, primarily related to the decline in prices for scrap steel and other metals on a year-over-year basis. The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 6.3% from organic plus 6% from acquisitions, for constant-currency growth of 12.3% before backing out the translation impact of FX, which was a 1.8% decline. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each of the businesses as I walk through the segment results.
As noted on Slide 10 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins improved 20 basis points to 39.6% during the quarter. The uptick reflected approximately a 40 basis point improvement from operations, largely in Europe, offset by a 20 basis point decline due to revenue mix as the revenue growth in our Specialty business, which has the lowest gross margin structure, continued to outpace that of our other operations.
We lost about 50 basis points of efficiencies in our operating expenses, largely due to our North American operations. This was due primarily to the continued impact of lower revenue from scrap and core, which was down $39 million on a year-over-year basis and particularly impacted our self-service operations. Outside of the impact of metal prices, our consolidated distribution cost as a percent of revenue benefited from lower fuel prices, and our SG&A expenses benefited from the acquisition integration synergies in our Specialty operation.
Segment EBITDA totaled $237 million for the quarter, reflecting a 7% increase from 2015. As a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 12.3%, a 20 basis point decrease over the 12.5% recorded last year. The increase in segment EBITDA was offset by an increase in restructuring cost, and the operating income for the first quarter of 2016 was flat in dollar terms and down a bit as a percent of revenue when compared to the same period of the prior year. The restructuring items primarily relate to expenses connected to the Rhiag acquisition.
You will note a couple of relatively large nonoperating items in our income statement during the first quarter of 2016, including a loss on debt extinguishment and significant other income. As you may recall, we amended our credit facility at the end of January. In addition, we repaid all of Rhiag's debt shortly after closing. Collectively, that accounted for approximately $26.7 million of onetime expenses related to unamortized issuance costs on the former credit agreement and the prepayment penalty associated with the high-cost Rhiag debt. Going in the other direction, we hedged the anticipated payment for the Rhiag acquisition, and given the movement in the euro between when we set the hedge and the closing date, we had sizable gain, about $18 million, on the hedge. On a combined basis, the net effect of these onetime items was a negative impact on pretax margins, which contracted by about 90 basis points to 8.6%.
Our net cash rate during the first quarter was 34.75%, down from 35.5% in 2015 and even with the annual guidance we provided this past February. Diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.35, which was flat to last year. However, adjusted EPS before restructuring charges, the loss on debt extinguishment, the hedging gain and intangible asset amortization was $0.42 a share compared to $0.38, reflecting a 10.5% improvement.
As mentioned, the impact of scrap and currency fluctuations have abated quite a bit and collectively impacted EPS by less than $0.01 during the first quarter. While we have included the details on scrap and currencies in the presentation material, given their minor impact, I am happy to say I won't be spending much time on those topics during this discussion.
As highlighted on Slide 11, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to the varying growth rates of our different businesses and the impact of acquisitions. Since each of our segments has a different margin structure, this mix shift impacts the trend in consolidated margins. This will become more accentuated now that we have closed both Rhiag and PGW, and you will begin to see a shift in the second quarter results.
And with that, let's get into the details on the segments. Revenue in our North American segment during the first quarter of 2016 increased to $1,088,000,000 or a 4% increase over 2015. This is the combination of a 7.3% growth rate in parts and services, offset by a 20% decline in other revenue, the latter of which was primarily due to the lower prices received for scrap steel and other metals. The 7.3% growth in North American parts and services was a combination of 4.9% organic growth and 3.1% acquisition growth, offset by a 70 basis point FX-related decline due to the weakness of the Canadian dollar.
There is no doubt that the mild weather had an impact on our revenue as collision claims were down in many states. But it's hard to quantify the impact, and in the end, we simply need to work through Mother Nature. All in all, this was a solid quarter in revenue for our North American business.
Gross margins in North America during the first quarter were 42.7%, up just a few basis points. With respect to operating expenses, we lost about 80 basis points of margin compared to the comparable quarter of last year. Our self-serve unit experienced an increase in operating expenses but meaningfully lower revenue due to the significant decline in commodity prices, and as a result, operating expenses as a percent of revenue for our self-service operation increased very significantly on a year-over-year basis. For the North American segment as a whole, the impact of the lower revenue from the sale of scrap and other commodities increased operating costs as a percent of revenue by approximately 110 basis points.
On the upside, we continue to experience improvements in fuel costs relative to last year, picking up about 20 basis points of margin as diesel averaged $2.08 a gallon compared to $2.92 a gallon last year, a 29% decline. Importantly, we began to experience some preliminary benefit from our productivity initiatives during Q1, with our non-inventory-related purchasing activities benefiting from about $400,000 of savings. We would expect this to pick up as we move throughout the year. The inventory-related savings will begin as we purchase inventory at new negotiated prices, the products are received and placed in our warehouses and we turn the inventory.
In total, EBITDA for the North American business during the first quarter was $147 million, and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for this segment was 13.6% in Q1 of 2016, down from 14.3% reported in the comparable period the prior year. The impact of lower revenue from commodities should dissipate in the second half, assuming we get to more comparable scrap pricing.
Moving on to our European segment. Total revenue in the first quarter accelerated to $547 million from $487 million, a 12.2% increase. Organic growth for parts and services in Europe during the first quarter was 6.9%, reflecting the combination of 7.4% growth at ECP and 6.2% at Sator. The impact of the acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 9.9% increase in revenues, which includes only 2 weeks of activity for Rhiag. So on a constant-currency basis, European parts and services revenue was up 16.8% for the quarter. These gains were offset by a 4.5% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, particularly relative to the pound sterling.
Gross margins in Europe increased to 38.1%, a 110 basis point improvement over the comparable period of last year. Both ECP and Sator experienced higher gross margins from operations as we continue to benefit from improved procurements in the U.K. and the internalization of the gross margins from the acquisitions in The Netherlands. These are the highest first quarter gross margins we have achieved in Europe in several years. As mentioned when we announced the Rhiag acquisition back in December, given the 3-step distribution model in Italy and Switzerland, Rhiag has lower gross margins than either ECP or Sator, and beginning in the second quarter, you will see the impact of that on our consolidated European gross margins.
With respect to operating expenses as a percent of revenue, we experienced a 10% basis -- or 10 basis point increase on a consolidated European basis. We started paying rent-related property cost on the new distribution facility in Tamworth, England, which we call T2, back in February. The incremental costs related to this project in Q1 were about GBP 1.2 million or about $1.8 million, which reflects a 30 basis point increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue for Europe. Offsetting some of this increase in expense were some FX gains related to hedges utilized to manage our foreign currency exposure on inventory purchases in the U.K.
European EBITDA totaled $57.5 million, a 23.6% increase over last year. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA in the first quarter of 2016 was 10.5% versus 9.5% last year, a full 100 basis point improvement even after taking into account the impact of the T2 project. Relative to the first quarter of 2015, the pound had declined 6% and the euro declined 3% against the dollar. Given the significant margin improvement, constant-currency EBITDA growth in Europe was 28.6%, which we believe is robust.
Turning to our Specialty segment. Revenue for the first quarter totaled $288 million, a 19.5% increase over the comparable quarter of 2015. The organic growth rate of 10.8% was very strong while the impact of the acquisition of Coast in August of 2015 added 9.4% to revenue growth.
Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the first quarter increased by about 20 basis points compared to last year due to some favorable product mix and favorable inventory capitalization adjustments related to the acquisition integration activities.
Operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were down about 30 basis points. We continue to see the leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing network as well as the benefit of lower fuel prices and lower advertising expenses. These savings were in part offset by higher costs related to the 2 new distribution facilities added in late 2015 and slightly higher freight expense.
EBITDA for the Specialty segment was $32 million, up 25% from the first quarter of last year, and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment increased 50 basis points to 11% in 2016 compared to 10.5% last year. Remember, this is a highly seasonal business and the first quarter is typically pretty strong, as demonstrated by the graph in the lower-right corner of Slide 16. Consistent with the normal seasonal patterns, you should assume these margins will moderate as we move through the back half of the year.
Let's move on to capital allocation. As presented on Slide 17, you will note that our after-tax cash flow from operations during the first quarter was approximately $119 million as we experienced strong earnings and only a moderate increase in working capital. During the quarter we deployed $625 million of capital to support the growth
of our businesses, including $50 million to fund capital expenditures and $575 million to fund the acquisitions and other investments.
The latter amount includes the moneys paid for Rhiag, net of the hedging gain on the purchase price and net of the proceeds from the previously announced sale of our interest in the Australian joint venture. The Rhiag acquisition was financed by drawing down on our line of credit, thus the big inflow from financing. We closed the quarter with about $229 million of cash, of which $177 million was held outside of the United States. The big increase in foreign cash relates to the amounts on Rhiag's balance sheet at the time of acquisition.
On March 31, we had about $2.8 billion of total debt outstanding, which reflected the moneys borrowed to complete the Rhiag acquisition in late March. The quarter-end balance does not include any borrowings related to PGW as that transaction closed in Q2. On a pro forma basis, taking into account the PGW closing, our net debt was approximately $3.3 billion or about 3x pro forma EBITDA.
Also, we completed a very successful EUR 500 million issuance of senior notes in early April, and we used those proceeds to in part pay down the revolving credit facility used to finance the Rhiag transaction. The key terms of that offering were bullet maturity of 8 years and a fixed interest rate of 3.875%. Today, our total availability under the new credit facility is approximately $1 billion, which we believe is more than sufficient to support the growth of our business.
Finally, as noted in our press release, we have provided updated guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2016 to include the impact from the Rhiag and PGW acquisitions. Again, Rhiag closed in late March and PGW in late April, so we effectively will record a tad more than 9 months and 8 months of their respective results in 2016.
As it relates to the organic growth rates for parts and services, we continue to be comfortable with the range of 6% to 8%, essentially consistent with our recent experience.
Our range for adjusted EPS, which again now excludes the after-tax impact of intangible amortization, is $1.76 at the low end to $1.86 per share at the high end, with a midpoint of $1.81 a share. Again, this includes the anticipated impact from our ownership of Rhiag and PGW for 9 and 8 months, respectively, in 2016. The EPS guidance also assumes that the pound sterling and the euro remain at budgeted levels of $1.45 and $1.10, respectively, and importantly, that scrap remains at current levels as well. Based on our shares outstanding, that range implies an adjusted net income of approximately $545 million to $575 million, with a midpoint of $560 million. Our assumed tax rate for 2016 remains at 34.75%.
As part of the PGW transaction, under U.S. GAAP, we need to mark the closing date inventory up to market value, which means about an $8 million to $12 million increase in inventory valuation. This amount will get amortized as a noncash expense as we turn the inventory. It won't affect the adjusted net income or adjusted EPS, but it will be a onetime impact on diluted net income and diluted EPS in Q2 and perhaps a bit in Q3.
I believe all the analysts have adapted to the new adjusted EPS format, which we greatly appreciate, and that will ensure we have consistency in the EPS estimates. The appendices to this presentation include the relevant reconciliations for prior year periods.
Our guidance for cash flow from operations is approximately $575 million to $625 million, with the midpoint of $600 million. And finally, we set the adjusted guidance for capital spending at $200 million to $225 million.
And at this point, I will turn the call back over to Rob to wrap things up."

Again, the 2 new facilities from the Specialty segment that we introduced in Q4 of last year, those are, as Rob indicated, fully up and running. The impact of that expense should begin to moderate a little bit, and we have kind of rearranged some of our people as to where they're hitting on the P&L.

One, we can just be so much more confident with our customers as to when their products are going to be there. The route optimization is just incredible on how they route the drivers. And for example, one thing they try to do is take more right turns than left turns. So you can turn right on red as opposed to crossing traffic when you have to turn left. Those little efficiencies add up dramatically. And the effect of ultimately partly putting fewer trucks on the road with better service is really going to have an impact on our customer base. As far as the sales KPIs, Tony, we're looking at total clock time, sitting with our reps. I think -- and coaching, this peer coaching that we're doing, and monitoring the outbound calls more effectively. I think the net effect of that is better customer service, you're absolutely right. We have better contact with our customers, more time on the phone with our customers and really become that vendor of choice as a result because we'll be so much more responsive to their request and needs. So that's moving full steam ahead. Back to the route optimization, I mentioned in my prepared remarks is 65% rolled out. We expect to have that 100% rolled out by the end of this year. So I think the combination of the 2, where we'll provide better customer service on the phone and then better customer service on the delivery end, really will raise the bar significantly on our customer service levels.

Nick will follow with a detailed overview of our Q1 financial performance.
Turning to Slide 3. Q1 revenue reached a record $1.92 billion, an increase of 8.3% as compared to $1.77 billion in the first quarter of 2015. Net income for the first quarter of 2016 was $107.7 million, an increase of 0.6% as compared to $107.1 million for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, net income was $128.7 million, an increase of 10.2% as compared to the $116.8 million for the same period of 2015.
Diluted earnings per share of $0.35 for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016, was unchanged from the $0.35 for the first quarter of 2015. It is important to note, however, that the Q1 2016 diluted earnings per share included charges equal to $0.07 per share, resulting from restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, losses on debt extinguishment, amortization of acquired intangibles, change in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and an adjustment for gains associated with the hedging of the Rhiag purchase price. So on an adjusted basis, EPS grew 10.5% year-over-year in Q1. Nick will provide more specifics on the adjustments shortly.
Organic revenue growth for parts and services was 6.3% in the quarter, a solid number given the mild weather headwinds we faced in North America and Europe and a tough comp in 2015. Turning to North America. According to the National Center for Environmental Information, March snow cover in the U.S. was 48% lower than the average coverage witnessed from 1981 to 2015 and the second smallest in the 50-year period on record, with February and March of 2012 ranking third and fourth, respectively. And February of this year was not far behind, recording the 13th smallest level over that same 50-year period. With that as a backdrop, North America delivered organic revenue growth for parts and services of 4.9% in the quarter, which, compared to the 3.6% achieved in Q1 2012, is solid given we experienced similar weather anomalies in each of those quarters.
During Q1, we purchased over 72,000 vehicles for dismantling by our North American wholesale operations, a 2.8% increase over Q1 2015. During Q1, our pricing at auction increased over Q1 2015 by 9%, but we were also buying a younger vehicle by over 1 year or 13% younger. This younger vehicle procurement strategy positions us to take advantage of the inevitable reduction in the average age of vehicle being repaired, a direct result of the increase in the SAAR rates. Illustrating this point, during the quarter, the average model year age of a vehicle being repaired was younger by over a year compared to the same period in 2015.
For our North American aftermarket business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 18.5% and 58.4%, respectively, year-over-year in the quarter. In our self-service retail business, during Q1, we acquired over 125,000 lower-cost, self-service and crush-only cars, which is a 25% increase over Q1 2015. Compared to the prior year, we increased our self-service procurement in the quarter to take advantage of the favorable pricing for higher-quality vehicles in this line of business, given the year-over-year decline in scrap pricing. As of late, we have seen a stabilization of scrap pricing.
Turning to our ongoing intelligent parts solution initiative with CCC Information Systems (sic) [CCC Information Services] . In March of 2015, we introduced LKQ's recycled parts offering through this platform with initial base of 100 shops in Portland, Grand Rapids and Oklahoma City. From a base of 0 and within less than a year, the initial results are encouraging. Through the end of Q1, LKQ's recycled parts are now accessible to over 2,500 shops in virtually every major city throughout the United States. During Q1, the revenue and number of aftermarket parts purchased processed through the CCC platform grew 82% and 84%, respectively, year-over-year.
And lastly on North America, I want to provide an update on our productivity initiatives to identify potential operational efficiencies. As mentioned on previous calls, we have identified several significant opportunities in 4 key areas with 1 being sales force effectiveness and the second one being route optimization. During the quarter, our sales responsibilities were separated from our operations across the United States, resulting in a more focused structure. This structure has 3 regional sales vice presidents, a leadership team of district sales manager and inside sales managers as well. We now have a geographically focused sales force that is positioned to compete at a local level, allowing our broader team to handle increased call volumes.
During the quarter, we implemented additional sales KPIs focused on increasing total talk time, outbound calls and peer coaching. The initial results of these KPIs are positive, with total talk time and outbound calls increasing 27% and 15%, respectively, in the quarter. Under our peer coaching, we have engaged each inside sales manager to increase his or her time on the floor with their sales force. The goal is to have each sales manager spend 18 hours per week on the floor engaging in side-by-side coaching, which will increase sales skills, lead to higher volume of sales per rep and simultaneously improve the overall experience to our customer. Though this coaching structure may create a slight headwind with sales, the long-term benefit of driving the performance of our top salespeople should lead to a reduction in the overall size of our sales force.
In addition, during the quarter, we made great strides with the inflammation -- implementation of Roadnet, the Tier 1 provider we've selected for the technology component of our route optimization efforts. Roadnet's fleet and mobile management software provides strategic territory- and street-level route plans, multi-stop vehicle routing and scheduling, wireless dispatch, vehicle telematics, fuel management and real-time vehicle GPS tracking. Our current utilization rate with Roadnet represents 65% of our North American fleet, which today is accounting for over 2,500 vehicles driving over 140,000 miles and make over 22,000 stops on a daily basis. Our goal is to be at a 100% utilization by the end of 2016.
Now moving on to our European operations. In Q1, our Europe segment had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.9% and acquisition growth of 9.9%, which was offset by a decrease of 4.5% related to foreign exchange rates. During Q1, ECP drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 7.4%, and for branches open more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 5.8%, a solid performance given that ECP had 1 less selling day year-over-year. During the quarter, ECP did not open any additional branches, providing our team the bandwidth to focus on capturing incremental margin expansion year-over-year in Q1.
During Q1, collision part sales at ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 15.5%. I am pleased with the continued double-digit performance in this line of business, especially given the mild Q1 weather in the U.K, a tough comp in 2015 and, again, with 1 less selling day.
Now turning to our Sator business. During Q1, Sator drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.2%, its highest quarterly rate since we acquired the business in May of 2013. We believe that our investments in 2014 and 2015 to convert our distribution model from 3-step to 2-step is predominantly responsible for not only this acceleration of organic growth but also the year-over-year improvements in gross and EBITDA margins.
And now on to our Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment continued strong performance by posting year-over-year total revenue growth of 19.5% in the quarter, including the benefits of Coast acquisition and strong organic revenue growth of 10.8%. I am also pleased with the margin expansion at Specialty realized in the quarter, which Nick will cover shortly.
During the quarter, Specialty continued their integration activities from the Coast acquisition by consolidating 2 additional warehouses into our network. Also, the Coast administrative synergies continue to be ahead of our schedule. In addition, our previously mentioned Specialty distribution centers in Michigan and Washington state were both fully operational at the end of Q1.
Now to corporate development. On March 21, 2016, the company closed its previously announced acquisition of Rhiag, a leading pan-European business-to-business distributor of aftermarket spare parts for passenger cars and commercial vehicles. Rhiag operates through 252 distribution centers and 10 warehouses and serves more than 100,000 professional clients in 10 European countries.
And on April 21, 2016, the company closed on its previously announced acquisition of PGW, a leading global distributor and manufacturer of automotive glass products.
With the acquisition of PGW and our entrance into the sizable $3.5 billion automotive glass market, we continue to grow our industry-leading position and product offerings to further serve the needs of our professional repair customers. PGW's offerings are complementary to LKQ's existing business and product offerings, and together, our respective teams now have the technology, products and expertise to introduce automotive glass to LKQ's global growth strategy. I am also pleased to announce that PGW has secured 2 new material OE contracts since we announced the acquisition in late February.
I am excited to welcome the folks at both Rhiag and PGW to the LKQ team. In addition to the Rhiag and PGW acquisitions, during the first quarter of 2016, the company acquired an additional wholesale salvage business based in Sweden.
At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more detail and perspective on our financial results and our updated 2016 guidance."
4303924,331124501,966993,"LKQ Corp., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","LKQ Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everyone on the call. I am delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter, and over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results for our company and review the performance of each of ou",2694,"Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everyone on the call. I am delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter, and over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results for our company and review the performance of each of our 3 segments before touching on the balance sheet and addressing our revised guidance for 2016 now that the Rhiag and PGW transactions have closed.
The short version of our financial performance in the first quarter of 2016 is that we had a very good quarter, and taken as a whole, it was right in line with our expectations. We experienced solid revenue and earnings growth, and the headwinds from lower scrap prices and the strong dollar has started to abate. To be clear, Rhiag closed in late March and was included in our first quarter for only a few days. PGW just closed last week and had no impact on our Q1 results.
As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the first quarter of 2016 was $1.9 billion, representing an 8.3% increase over last year. That reflects a 10.5% increase in revenue from parts and services, partially offset by a 20% decrease in other revenue, primarily related to the decline in prices for scrap steel and other metals on a year-over-year basis. The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 6.3% from organic plus 6% from acquisitions, for constant-currency growth of 12.3% before backing out the translation impact of FX, which was a 1.8% decline. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each of the businesses as I walk through the segment results.
As noted on Slide 10 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins improved 20 basis points to 39.6% during the quarter. The uptick reflected approximately a 40 basis point improvement from operations, largely in Europe, offset by a 20 basis point decline due to revenue mix as the revenue growth in our Specialty business, which has the lowest gross margin structure, continued to outpace that of our other operations.
We lost about 50 basis points of efficiencies in our operating expenses, largely due to our North American operations. This was due primarily to the continued impact of lower revenue from scrap and core, which was down $39 million on a year-over-year basis and particularly impacted our self-service operations. Outside of the impact of metal prices, our consolidated distribution cost as a percent of revenue benefited from lower fuel prices, and our SG&A expenses benefited from the acquisition integration synergies in our Specialty operation.
Segment EBITDA totaled $237 million for the quarter, reflecting a 7% increase from 2015. As a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 12.3%, a 20 basis point decrease over the 12.5% recorded last year. The increase in segment EBITDA was offset by an increase in restructuring cost, and the operating income for the first quarter of 2016 was flat in dollar terms and down a bit as a percent of revenue when compared to the same period of the prior year. The restructuring items primarily relate to expenses connected to the Rhiag acquisition.
You will note a couple of relatively large nonoperating items in our income statement during the first quarter of 2016, including a loss on debt extinguishment and significant other income. As you may recall, we amended our credit facility at the end of January. In addition, we repaid all of Rhiag's debt shortly after closing. Collectively, that accounted for approximately $26.7 million of onetime expenses related to unamortized issuance costs on the former credit agreement and the prepayment penalty associated with the high-cost Rhiag debt. Going in the other direction, we hedged the anticipated payment for the Rhiag acquisition, and given the movement in the euro between when we set the hedge and the closing date, we had sizable gain, about $18 million, on the hedge. On a combined basis, the net effect of these onetime items was a negative impact on pretax margins, which contracted by about 90 basis points to 8.6%.
Our net cash rate during the first quarter was 34.75%, down from 35.5% in 2015 and even with the annual guidance we provided this past February. Diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.35, which was flat to last year. However, adjusted EPS before restructuring charges, the loss on debt extinguishment, the hedging gain and intangible asset amortization was $0.42 a share compared to $0.38, reflecting a 10.5% improvement.
As mentioned, the impact of scrap and currency fluctuations have abated quite a bit and collectively impacted EPS by less than $0.01 during the first quarter. While we have included the details on scrap and currencies in the presentation material, given their minor impact, I am happy to say I won't be spending much time on those topics during this discussion.
As highlighted on Slide 11, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to the varying growth rates of our different businesses and the impact of acquisitions. Since each of our segments has a different margin structure, this mix shift impacts the trend in consolidated margins. This will become more accentuated now that we have closed both Rhiag and PGW, and you will begin to see a shift in the second quarter results.
And with that, let's get into the details on the segments. Revenue in our North American segment during the first quarter of 2016 increased to $1,088,000,000 or a 4% increase over 2015. This is the combination of a 7.3% growth rate in parts and services, offset by a 20% decline in other revenue, the latter of which was primarily due to the lower prices received for scrap steel and other metals. The 7.3% growth in North American parts and services was a combination of 4.9% organic growth and 3.1% acquisition growth, offset by a 70 basis point FX-related decline due to the weakness of the Canadian dollar.
There is no doubt that the mild weather had an impact on our revenue as collision claims were down in many states. But it's hard to quantify the impact, and in the end, we simply need to work through Mother Nature. All in all, this was a solid quarter in revenue for our North American business.
Gross margins in North America during the first quarter were 42.7%, up just a few basis points. With respect to operating expenses, we lost about 80 basis points of margin compared to the comparable quarter of last year. Our self-serve unit experienced an increase in operating expenses but meaningfully lower revenue due to the significant decline in commodity prices, and as a result, operating expenses as a percent of revenue for our self-service operation increased very significantly on a year-over-year basis. For the North American segment as a whole, the impact of the lower revenue from the sale of scrap and other commodities increased operating costs as a percent of revenue by approximately 110 basis points.
On the upside, we continue to experience improvements in fuel costs relative to last year, picking up about 20 basis points of margin as diesel averaged $2.08 a gallon compared to $2.92 a gallon last year, a 29% decline. Importantly, we began to experience some preliminary benefit from our productivity initiatives during Q1, with our non-inventory-related purchasing activities benefiting from about $400,000 of savings. We would expect this to pick up as we move throughout the year. The inventory-related savings will begin as we purchase inventory at new negotiated prices, the products are received and placed in our warehouses and we turn the inventory.
In total, EBITDA for the North American business during the first quarter was $147 million, and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for this segment was 13.6% in Q1 of 2016, down from 14.3% reported in the comparable period the prior year. The impact of lower revenue from commodities should dissipate in the second half, assuming we get to more comparable scrap pricing.
Moving on to our European segment. Total revenue in the first quarter accelerated to $547 million from $487 million, a 12.2% increase. Organic growth for parts and services in Europe during the first quarter was 6.9%, reflecting the combination of 7.4% growth at ECP and 6.2% at Sator. The impact of the acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 9.9% increase in revenues, which includes only 2 weeks of activity for Rhiag. So on a constant-currency basis, European parts and services revenue was up 16.8% for the quarter. These gains were offset by a 4.5% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, particularly relative to the pound sterling.
Gross margins in Europe increased to 38.1%, a 110 basis point improvement over the comparable period of last year. Both ECP and Sator experienced higher gross margins from operations as we continue to benefit from improved procurements in the U.K. and the internalization of the gross margins from the acquisitions in The Netherlands. These are the highest first quarter gross margins we have achieved in Europe in several years. As mentioned when we announced the Rhiag acquisition back in December, given the 3-step distribution model in Italy and Switzerland, Rhiag has lower gross margins than either ECP or Sator, and beginning in the second quarter, you will see the impact of that on our consolidated European gross margins.
With respect to operating expenses as a percent of revenue, we experienced a 10% basis -- or 10 basis point increase on a consolidated European basis. We started paying rent-related property cost on the new distribution facility in Tamworth, England, which we call T2, back in February. The incremental costs related to this project in Q1 were about GBP 1.2 million or about $1.8 million, which reflects a 30 basis point increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue for Europe. Offsetting some of this increase in expense were some FX gains related to hedges utilized to manage our foreign currency exposure on inventory purchases in the U.K.
European EBITDA totaled $57.5 million, a 23.6% increase over last year. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA in the first quarter of 2016 was 10.5% versus 9.5% last year, a full 100 basis point improvement even after taking into account the impact of the T2 project. Relative to the first quarter of 2015, the pound had declined 6% and the euro declined 3% against the dollar. Given the significant margin improvement, constant-currency EBITDA growth in Europe was 28.6%, which we believe is robust.
Turning to our Specialty segment. Revenue for the first quarter totaled $288 million, a 19.5% increase over the comparable quarter of 2015. The organic growth rate of 10.8% was very strong while the impact of the acquisition of Coast in August of 2015 added 9.4% to revenue growth.
Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the first quarter increased by about 20 basis points compared to last year due to some favorable product mix and favorable inventory capitalization adjustments related to the acquisition integration activities.
Operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were down about 30 basis points. We continue to see the leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing network as well as the benefit of lower fuel prices and lower advertising expenses. These savings were in part offset by higher costs related to the 2 new distribution facilities added in late 2015 and slightly higher freight expense.
EBITDA for the Specialty segment was $32 million, up 25% from the first quarter of last year, and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment increased 50 basis points to 11% in 2016 compared to 10.5% last year. Remember, this is a highly seasonal business and the first quarter is typically pretty strong, as demonstrated by the graph in the lower-right corner of Slide 16. Consistent with the normal seasonal patterns, you should assume these margins will moderate as we move through the back half of the year.
Let's move on to capital allocation. As presented on Slide 17, you will note that our after-tax cash flow from operations during the first quarter was approximately $119 million as we experienced strong earnings and only a moderate increase in working capital. During the quarter we deployed $625 million of capital to support the growth
of our businesses, including $50 million to fund capital expenditures and $575 million to fund the acquisitions and other investments.
The latter amount includes the moneys paid for Rhiag, net of the hedging gain on the purchase price and net of the proceeds from the previously announced sale of our interest in the Australian joint venture. The Rhiag acquisition was financed by drawing down on our line of credit, thus the big inflow from financing. We closed the quarter with about $229 million of cash, of which $177 million was held outside of the United States. The big increase in foreign cash relates to the amounts on Rhiag's balance sheet at the time of acquisition.
On March 31, we had about $2.8 billion of total debt outstanding, which reflected the moneys borrowed to complete the Rhiag acquisition in late March. The quarter-end balance does not include any borrowings related to PGW as that transaction closed in Q2. On a pro forma basis, taking into account the PGW closing, our net debt was approximately $3.3 billion or about 3x pro forma EBITDA.
Also, we completed a very successful EUR 500 million issuance of senior notes in early April, and we used those proceeds to in part pay down the revolving credit facility used to finance the Rhiag transaction. The key terms of that offering were bullet maturity of 8 years and a fixed interest rate of 3.875%. Today, our total availability under the new credit facility is approximately $1 billion, which we believe is more than sufficient to support the growth of our business.
Finally, as noted in our press release, we have provided updated guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2016 to include the impact from the Rhiag and PGW acquisitions. Again, Rhiag closed in late March and PGW in late April, so we effectively will record a tad more than 9 months and 8 months of their respective results in 2016.
As it relates to the organic growth rates for parts and services, we continue to be comfortable with the range of 6% to 8%, essentially consistent with our recent experience.
Our range for adjusted EPS, which again now excludes the after-tax impact of intangible amortization, is $1.76 at the low end to $1.86 per share at the high end, with a midpoint of $1.81 a share. Again, this includes the anticipated impact from our ownership of Rhiag and PGW for 9 and 8 months, respectively, in 2016. The EPS guidance also assumes that the pound sterling and the euro remain at budgeted levels of $1.45 and $1.10, respectively, and importantly, that scrap remains at current levels as well. Based on our shares outstanding, that range implies an adjusted net income of approximately $545 million to $575 million, with a midpoint of $560 million. Our assumed tax rate for 2016 remains at 34.75%.
As part of the PGW transaction, under U.S. GAAP, we need to mark the closing date inventory up to market value, which means about an $8 million to $12 million increase in inventory valuation. This amount will get amortized as a noncash expense as we turn the inventory. It won't affect the adjusted net income or adjusted EPS, but it will be a onetime impact on diluted net income and diluted EPS in Q2 and perhaps a bit in Q3.
I believe all the analysts have adapted to the new adjusted EPS format, which we greatly appreciate, and that will ensure we have consistency in the EPS estimates. The appendices to this presentation include the relevant reconciliations for prior year periods.
Our guidance for cash flow from operations is approximately $575 million to $625 million, with the midpoint of $600 million. And finally, we set the adjusted guidance for capital spending at $200 million to $225 million.
And at this point, I will turn the call back over to Rob to wrap things up."

To summarize, I am proud of the momentum we have created with our Q1 performance, our recently completed strategic acquisitions and our recent financings. Combined, these achievements position LKQ well to deliver another year of organic and acquisition-related revenue growth in 2016 that has us now annualizing in excess of $10 billion of revenue.
Obviously, we can't predict weather patterns so we remain focused on the things we can control, which include continuing to offer an attractive value proposition to our insurance carrier partners, maintaining and increasing our industry-leading fulfillment rates and providing superior and responsive customer service to professional vehicle repair and supply businesses we serve, all supported by a highly effective and unmatched alternative parts distribution network in North America. And most importantly, I believe we have a stellar team of 35,000-plus fellow employees dedicated to carrying on our mission globally, and I want to thank each and every one of them for their collective efforts.

But you are correct, the trucks are different. They have a different handling capability. What our plan would be to do, as we start integrating those businesses and as trucks retire -- we're retiring almost 600 trucks a year, we're replacing, because of our large fleet. Those will be retrofitted appropriately to carry both glass and salvage. So we don't see it being a major hindrance given the time frame we have to integrate the businesses first."

And being able to have that and get it to our branches when needed quickly and through some of the automated picking processes and the like, that's the real benefit of that.

If I rank them both, I would say Roadnet's got the bigger impact for a couple of reasons. One, we can just be so much more confident with our customers as to when their products are going to be there. The route optimization is just incredible on how they route the drivers. And for example, one thing they try to do is take more right turns than left turns. So you can turn right on red as opposed to crossing traffic when you have to turn left. Those little efficiencies add up dramatically. And the effect of ultimately partly putting fewer trucks on the road with better service is really going to have an impact on our customer base. As far as the sales KPIs, Tony, we're looking at total clock time, sitting with our reps. I think -- and coaching, this peer coaching that we're doing, and monitoring the outbound calls more effectively. I think the net effect of that is better customer service, you're absolutely right. We have better contact with our customers, more time on the phone with our customers and really become that vendor of choice as a result because we'll be so much more responsive to their request and needs. So that's moving full steam ahead. Back to the route optimization, I mentioned in my prepared remarks is 65% rolled out. We expect to have that 100% rolled out by the end of this year. So I think the combination of the 2, where we'll provide better customer service on the phone and then better customer service on the delivery end, really will raise the bar significantly on our customer service levels. So both are equally important."

This morning, I will begin our review of the quarter with a few high-level financial metrics, followed by an update on our operating segments and the various macro trends each segment witnessed in their respective markets and conclude with an update on our corporate development achievements in the quarter. Nick will follow with a detailed overview of our Q1 financial performance.
Turning to Slide 3. Q1 revenue reached a record $1.92 billion, an increase of 8.3% as compared to $1.77 billion in the first quarter of 2015. Net income for the first quarter of 2016 was $107.7 million, an increase of 0.6% as compared to $107.1 million for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, net income was $128.7 million, an increase of 10.2% as compared to the $116.8 million for the same period of 2015.
Diluted earnings per share of $0.35 for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016, was unchanged from the $0.35 for the first quarter of 2015. It is important to note, however, that the Q1 2016 diluted earnings per share included charges equal to $0.07 per share, resulting from restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, losses on debt extinguishment, amortization of acquired intangibles, change in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and an adjustment for gains associated with the hedging of the Rhiag purchase price. So on an adjusted basis, EPS grew 10.5% year-over-year in Q1. Nick will provide more specifics on the adjustments shortly.
Organic revenue growth for parts and services was 6.3% in the quarter, a solid number given the mild weather headwinds we faced in North America and Europe and a tough comp in 2015. Turning to North America. According to the National Center for Environmental Information, March snow cover in the U.S. was 48% lower than the average coverage witnessed from 1981 to 2015 and the second smallest in the 50-year period on record, with February and March of 2012 ranking third and fourth, respectively. And February of this year was not far behind, recording the 13th smallest level over that same 50-year period. With that as a backdrop, North America delivered organic revenue growth for parts and services of 4.9% in the quarter, which, compared to the 3.6% achieved in Q1 2012, is solid given we experienced similar weather anomalies in each of those quarters.
During Q1, we purchased over 72,000 vehicles for dismantling by our North American wholesale operations, a 2.8% increase over Q1 2015. During Q1, our pricing at auction increased over Q1 2015 by 9%, but we were also buying a younger vehicle by over 1 year or 13% younger. This younger vehicle procurement strategy positions us to take advantage of the inevitable reduction in the average age of vehicle being repaired, a direct result of the increase in the SAAR rates. Illustrating this point, during the quarter, the average model year age of a vehicle being repaired was younger by over a year compared to the same period in 2015.
For our North American aftermarket business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 18.5% and 58.4%, respectively, year-over-year in the quarter. In our self-service retail business, during Q1, we acquired over 125,000 lower-cost, self-service and crush-only cars, which is a 25% increase over Q1 2015. Compared to the prior year, we increased our self-service procurement in the quarter to take advantage of the favorable pricing for higher-quality vehicles in this line of business, given the year-over-year decline in scrap pricing. As of late, we have seen a stabilization of scrap pricing.
Turning to our ongoing intelligent parts solution initiative with CCC Information Systems (sic) [CCC Information Services] . In March of 2015, we introduced LKQ's recycled parts offering through this platform with initial base of 100 shops in Portland, Grand Rapids and Oklahoma City. From a base of 0 and within less than a year, the initial results are encouraging. Through the end of Q1, LKQ's recycled parts are now accessible to over 2,500 shops in virtually every major city throughout the United States. During Q1, the revenue and number of aftermarket parts purchased processed through the CCC platform grew 82% and 84%, respectively, year-over-year.
And lastly on North America, I want to provide an update on our productivity initiatives to identify potential operational efficiencies. As mentioned on previous calls, we have identified several significant opportunities in 4 key areas with 1 being sales force effectiveness and the second one being route optimization. During the quarter, our sales responsibilities were separated from our operations across the United States, resulting in a more focused structure. This structure has 3 regional sales vice presidents, a leadership team of district sales manager and inside sales managers as well. We now have a geographically focused sales force that is positioned to compete at a local level, allowing our broader team to handle increased call volumes.
During the quarter, we implemented additional sales KPIs focused on increasing total talk time, outbound calls and peer coaching. The initial results of these KPIs are positive, with total talk time and outbound calls increasing 27% and 15%, respectively, in the quarter. Under our peer coaching, we have engaged each inside sales manager to increase his or her time on the floor with their sales force. The goal is to have each sales manager spend 18 hours per week on the floor engaging in side-by-side coaching, which will increase sales skills, lead to higher volume of sales per rep and simultaneously improve the overall experience to our customer. Though this coaching structure may create a slight headwind with sales, the long-term benefit of driving the performance of our top salespeople should lead to a reduction in the overall size of our sales force.
In addition, during the quarter, we made great strides with the inflammation -- implementation of Roadnet, the Tier 1 provider we've selected for the technology component of our route optimization efforts. Roadnet's fleet and mobile management software provides strategic territory- and street-level route plans, multi-stop vehicle routing and scheduling, wireless dispatch, vehicle telematics, fuel management and real-time vehicle GPS tracking. Our current utilization rate with Roadnet represents 65% of our North American fleet, which today is accounting for over 2,500 vehicles driving over 140,000 miles and make over 22,000 stops on a daily basis. Our goal is to be at a 100% utilization by the end of 2016.
Now moving on to our European operations. In Q1, our Europe segment had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.9% and acquisition growth of 9.9%, which was offset by a decrease of 4.5% related to foreign exchange rates. During Q1, ECP drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 7.4%, and for branches open more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 5.8%, a solid performance given that ECP had 1 less selling day year-over-year. During the quarter, ECP did not open any additional branches, providing our team the bandwidth to focus on capturing incremental margin expansion year-over-year in Q1.
During Q1, collision part sales at ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 15.5%. I am pleased with the continued double-digit performance in this line of business, especially given the mild Q1 weather in the U.K, a tough comp in 2015 and, again, with 1 less selling day.
Now turning to our Sator business. During Q1, Sator drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.2%, its highest quarterly rate since we acquired the business in May of 2013. We believe that our investments in 2014 and 2015 to convert our distribution model from 3-step to 2-step is predominantly responsible for not only this acceleration of organic growth but also the year-over-year improvements in gross and EBITDA margins.
And now on to our Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment continued strong performance by posting year-over-year total revenue growth of 19.5% in the quarter, including the benefits of Coast acquisition and strong organic revenue growth of 10.8%. I am also pleased with the margin expansion at Specialty realized in the quarter, which Nick will cover shortly.
During the quarter, Specialty continued their integration activities from the Coast acquisition by consolidating 2 additional warehouses into our network. Also, the Coast administrative synergies continue to be ahead of our schedule. In addition, our previously mentioned Specialty distribution centers in Michigan and Washington state were both fully operational at the end of Q1.
Now to corporate development. On March 21, 2016, the company closed its previously announced acquisition of Rhiag, a leading pan-European business-to-business distributor of aftermarket spare parts for passenger cars and commercial vehicles. Rhiag operates through 252 distribution centers and 10 warehouses and serves more than 100,000 professional clients in 10 European countries.
And on April 21, 2016, the company closed on its previously announced acquisition of PGW, a leading global distributor and manufacturer of automotive glass products.
With the acquisition of PGW and our entrance into the sizable $3.5 billion automotive glass market, we continue to grow our industry-leading position and product offerings to further serve the needs of our professional repair customers. PGW's offerings are complementary to LKQ's existing business and product offerings, and together, our respective teams now have the technology, products and expertise to introduce automotive glass to LKQ's global growth strategy. I am also pleased to announce that PGW has secured 2 new material OE contracts since we announced the acquisition in late February.
I am excited to welcome the folks at both Rhiag and PGW to the LKQ team. In addition to the Rhiag and PGW acquisitions, during the first quarter of 2016, the company acquired an additional wholesale salvage business based in Sweden.
At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more detail and perspective on our financial results and our updated 2016 guidance."

I am delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter, and over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results for our company and review the performance of each of ou",2694,"Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everyone on the call. I am delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter, and over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results for our company and review the performance of each of our 3 segments before touching on the balance sheet and addressing our revised guidance for 2016 now that the Rhiag and PGW transactions have closed.
The short version of our financial performance in the first quarter of 2016 is that we had a very good quarter, and taken as a whole, it was right in line with our expectations. We experienced solid revenue and earnings growth, and the headwinds from lower scrap prices and the strong dollar has started to abate. To be clear, Rhiag closed in late March and was included in our first quarter for only a few days. PGW just closed last week and had no impact on our Q1 results.
As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the first quarter of 2016 was $1.9 billion, representing an 8.3% increase over last year. That reflects a 10.5% increase in revenue from parts and services, partially offset by a 20% decrease in other revenue, primarily related to the decline in prices for scrap steel and other metals on a year-over-year basis. The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 6.3% from organic plus 6% from acquisitions, for constant-currency growth of 12.3% before backing out the translation impact of FX, which was a 1.8% decline. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each of the businesses as I walk through the segment results.
As noted on Slide 10 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins improved 20 basis points to 39.6% during the quarter. The uptick reflected approximately a 40 basis point improvement from operations, largely in Europe, offset by a 20 basis point decline due to revenue mix as the revenue growth in our Specialty business, which has the lowest gross margin structure, continued to outpace that of our other operations.
We lost about 50 basis points of efficiencies in our operating expenses, largely due to our North American operations. This was due primarily to the continued impact of lower revenue from scrap and core, which was down $39 million on a year-over-year basis and particularly impacted our self-service operations. Outside of the impact of metal prices, our consolidated distribution cost as a percent of revenue benefited from lower fuel prices, and our SG&A expenses benefited from the acquisition integration synergies in our Specialty operation.
Segment EBITDA totaled $237 million for the quarter, reflecting a 7% increase from 2015. As a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 12.3%, a 20 basis point decrease over the 12.5% recorded last year. The increase in segment EBITDA was offset by an increase in restructuring cost, and the operating income for the first quarter of 2016 was flat in dollar terms and down a bit as a percent of revenue when compared to the same period of the prior year. The restructuring items primarily relate to expenses connected to the Rhiag acquisition.
You will note a couple of relatively large nonoperating items in our income statement during the first quarter of 2016, including a loss on debt extinguishment and significant other income. As you may recall, we amended our credit facility at the end of January. In addition, we repaid all of Rhiag's debt shortly after closing. Collectively, that accounted for approximately $26.7 million of onetime expenses related to unamortized issuance costs on the former credit agreement and the prepayment penalty associated with the high-cost Rhiag debt. Going in the other direction, we hedged the anticipated payment for the Rhiag acquisition, and given the movement in the euro between when we set the hedge and the closing date, we had sizable gain, about $18 million, on the hedge. On a combined basis, the net effect of these onetime items was a negative impact on pretax margins, which contracted by about 90 basis points to 8.6%.
Our net cash rate during the first quarter was 34.75%, down from 35.5% in 2015 and even with the annual guidance we provided this past February. Diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.35, which was flat to last year. However, adjusted EPS before restructuring charges, the loss on debt extinguishment, the hedging gain and intangible asset amortization was $0.42 a share compared to $0.38, reflecting a 10.5% improvement.
As mentioned, the impact of scrap and currency fluctuations have abated quite a bit and collectively impacted EPS by less than $0.01 during the first quarter. While we have included the details on scrap and currencies in the presentation material, given their minor impact, I am happy to say I won't be spending much time on those topics during this discussion.
As highlighted on Slide 11, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to the varying growth rates of our different businesses and the impact of acquisitions. Since each of our segments has a different margin structure, this mix shift impacts the trend in consolidated margins. This will become more accentuated now that we have closed both Rhiag and PGW, and you will begin to see a shift in the second quarter results.
And with that, let's get into the details on the segments. Revenue in our North American segment during the first quarter of 2016 increased to $1,088,000,000 or a 4% increase over 2015. This is the combination of a 7.3% growth rate in parts and services, offset by a 20% decline in other revenue, the latter of which was primarily due to the lower prices received for scrap steel and other metals. The 7.3% growth in North American parts and services was a combination of 4.9% organic growth and 3.1% acquisition growth, offset by a 70 basis point FX-related decline due to the weakness of the Canadian dollar.
There is no doubt that the mild weather had an impact on our revenue as collision claims were down in many states. But it's hard to quantify the impact, and in the end, we simply need to work through Mother Nature. All in all, this was a solid quarter in revenue for our North American business.
Gross margins in North America during the first quarter were 42.7%, up just a few basis points. With respect to operating expenses, we lost about 80 basis points of margin compared to the comparable quarter of last year. Our self-serve unit experienced an increase in operating expenses but meaningfully lower revenue due to the significant decline in commodity prices, and as a result, operating expenses as a percent of revenue for our self-service operation increased very significantly on a year-over-year basis. For the North American segment as a whole, the impact of the lower revenue from the sale of scrap and other commodities increased operating costs as a percent of revenue by approximately 110 basis points.
On the upside, we continue to experience improvements in fuel costs relative to last year, picking up about 20 basis points of margin as diesel averaged $2.08 a gallon compared to $2.92 a gallon last year, a 29% decline. Importantly, we began to experience some preliminary benefit from our productivity initiatives during Q1, with our non-inventory-related purchasing activities benefiting from about $400,000 of savings. We would expect this to pick up as we move throughout the year. The inventory-related savings will begin as we purchase inventory at new negotiated prices, the products are received and placed in our warehouses and we turn the inventory.
In total, EBITDA for the North American business during the first quarter was $147 million, and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for this segment was 13.6% in Q1 of 2016, down from 14.3% reported in the comparable period the prior year. The impact of lower revenue from commodities should dissipate in the second half, assuming we get to more comparable scrap pricing.
Moving on to our European segment. Total revenue in the first quarter accelerated to $547 million from $487 million, a 12.2% increase. Organic growth for parts and services in Europe during the first quarter was 6.9%, reflecting the combination of 7.4% growth at ECP and 6.2% at Sator. The impact of the acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 9.9% increase in revenues, which includes only 2 weeks of activity for Rhiag. So on a constant-currency basis, European parts and services revenue was up 16.8% for the quarter. These gains were offset by a 4.5% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, particularly relative to the pound sterling.
Gross margins in Europe increased to 38.1%, a 110 basis point improvement over the comparable period of last year. Both ECP and Sator experienced higher gross margins from operations as we continue to benefit from improved procurements in the U.K. and the internalization of the gross margins from the acquisitions in The Netherlands. These are the highest first quarter gross margins we have achieved in Europe in several years. As mentioned when we announced the Rhiag acquisition back in December, given the 3-step distribution model in Italy and Switzerland, Rhiag has lower gross margins than either ECP or Sator, and beginning in the second quarter, you will see the impact of that on our consolidated European gross margins.
With respect to operating expenses as a percent of revenue, we experienced a 10% basis -- or 10 basis point increase on a consolidated European basis. We started paying rent-related property cost on the new distribution facility in Tamworth, England, which we call T2, back in February. The incremental costs related to this project in Q1 were about GBP 1.2 million or about $1.8 million, which reflects a 30 basis point increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue for Europe. Offsetting some of this increase in expense were some FX gains related to hedges utilized to manage our foreign currency exposure on inventory purchases in the U.K.
European EBITDA totaled $57.5 million, a 23.6% increase over last year. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA in the first quarter of 2016 was 10.5% versus 9.5% last year, a full 100 basis point improvement even after taking into account the impact of the T2 project. Relative to the first quarter of 2015, the pound had declined 6% and the euro declined 3% against the dollar. Given the significant margin improvement, constant-currency EBITDA growth in Europe was 28.6%, which we believe is robust.
Turning to our Specialty segment. Revenue for the first quarter totaled $288 million, a 19.5% increase over the comparable quarter of 2015. The organic growth rate of 10.8% was very strong while the impact of the acquisition of Coast in August of 2015 added 9.4% to revenue growth.
Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the first quarter increased by about 20 basis points compared to last year due to some favorable product mix and favorable inventory capitalization adjustments related to the acquisition integration activities.
Operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were down about 30 basis points. We continue to see the leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing network as well as the benefit of lower fuel prices and lower advertising expenses. These savings were in part offset by higher costs related to the 2 new distribution facilities added in late 2015 and slightly higher freight expense.
EBITDA for the Specialty segment was $32 million, up 25% from the first quarter of last year, and as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment increased 50 basis points to 11% in 2016 compared to 10.5% last year. Remember, this is a highly seasonal business and the first quarter is typically pretty strong, as demonstrated by the graph in the lower-right corner of Slide 16. Consistent with the normal seasonal patterns, you should assume these margins will moderate as we move through the back half of the year.
Let's move on to capital allocation. As presented on Slide 17, you will note that our after-tax cash flow from operations during the first quarter was approximately $119 million as we experienced strong earnings and only a moderate increase in working capital. During the quarter we deployed $625 million of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $50 million to fund capital expenditures and $575 million to fund the acquisitions and other investments.
The latter amount includes the moneys paid for Rhiag, net of the hedging gain on the purchase price and net of the proceeds from the previously announced sale of our interest in the Australian joint venture. The Rhiag acquisition was financed by drawing down on our line of credit, thus the big inflow from financing. We closed the quarter with about $229 million of cash, of which $177 million was held outside of the United States. The big increase in foreign cash relates to the amounts on Rhiag's balance sheet at the time of acquisition.
On March 31, we had about $2.8 billion of total debt outstanding, which reflected the moneys borrowed to complete the Rhiag acquisition in late March. The quarter-end balance does not include any borrowings related to PGW as that transaction closed in Q2. On a pro forma basis, taking into account the PGW closing, our net debt was approximately $3.3 billion or about 3x pro forma EBITDA.
Also, we completed a very successful EUR 500 million issuance of senior notes in early April, and we used those proceeds to in part pay down the revolving credit facility used to finance the Rhiag transaction. The key terms of that offering were bullet maturity of 8 years and a fixed interest rate of 3.875%. Today, our total availability under the new credit facility is approximately $1 billion, which we believe is more than sufficient to support the growth of our business.
Finally, as noted in our press release, we have provided updated guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2016 to include the impact from the Rhiag and PGW acquisitions. Again, Rhiag closed in late March and PGW in late April, so we effectively will record a tad more than 9 months and 8 months of their respective results in 2016.
As it relates to the organic growth rates for parts and services, we continue to be comfortable with the range of 6% to 8%, essentially consistent with our recent experience.
Our range for adjusted EPS, which again now excludes the after-tax impact of intangible amortization, is $1.76 at the low end to $1.86 per share at the high end, with a midpoint of $1.81 a share. Again, this includes the anticipated impact from our ownership of Rhiag and PGW for 9 and 8 months, respectively, in 2016. The EPS guidance also assumes that the pound sterling and the euro remain at budgeted levels of $1.45 and $1.10, respectively, and importantly, that scrap remains at current levels as well. Based on our shares outstanding, that range implies an adjusted net income of approximately $545 million to $575 million, with a midpoint of $560 million. Our assumed tax rate for 2016 remains at 34.75%.
As part of the PGW transaction, under U.S. GAAP, we need to mark the closing date inventory up to market value, which means about an $8 million to $12 million increase in inventory valuation. This amount will get amortized as a noncash expense as we turn the inventory. It won't affect the adjusted net income or adjusted EPS, but it will be a onetime impact on diluted net income and diluted EPS in Q2 and perhaps a bit in Q3.
I believe all the analysts have adapted to the new adjusted EPS format, which we greatly appreciate, and that will ensure we have consistency in the EPS estimates. The appendices to this presentation include the relevant reconciliations for prior year periods.
Our guidance for cash flow from operations is approximately $575 million to $625 million, with the midpoint of $600 million. And finally, we set the adjusted guidance for capital spending at $200 million to $225 million.
And at this point, I will turn the call back over to Rob to wrap things up."

One, we can just be so much more confident with our customers as to when their products are going to be there. The route optimization is just incredible on how they route the drivers. And for example, one thing they try to do is take more right turns than left turns. So you can turn right on red as opposed to crossing traffic when you have to turn left. Those little efficiencies add up dramatically. And the effect of ultimately partly putting fewer trucks on the road with better service is really going to have an impact on our customer base. As far as the sales KPIs, Tony, we're looking at total clock time, sitting with our reps. I think -- and coaching, this peer coaching that we're doing, and monitoring the outbound calls more effectively. I think the net effect of that is better customer service, you're absolutely right. We have better contact with our customers, more time on the phone with our customers and really become that vendor of choice as a result because we'll be so much more responsive to their request and needs. So that's moving full steam ahead. Back to the route optimization, I mentioned in my prepared remarks is 65% rolled out. We expect to have that 100% rolled out by the end of this year. So I think the combination of the 2, where we'll provide better customer service on the phone and then better customer service on the delivery end, really will raise the bar significantly on our customer service levels.

However, obviously, getting the part, making sure the customer is ordering the right part and a rep is making sure they're writing up the right part is critical. We do expect some improvement in return rates in terms of getting the right part on the truck. But again, there are so many other factors that affect return rates that I don't think it's going to be a huge diminishment in the return rates."

This morning, I will begin our review with a few high-level financial metrics followed by an update on our operating segments and some macro trends we witnessed in Q2. Nick will follow with a detailed overview of our financial performance. 
Turning to Slide 3. Q2 revenue reached a record $2.45 billion, an increase of 33.3% as compared to $1.84 billion in the second quarter of 2015. Net income for the second quarter of 2016 was $140.7 million, an increase of 17.6% as compared to $119.7 million for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, net income was $169.2 million, an increase of 34% as compared to the $126.3 million for the same period of 2015. 
Diluted earnings per share of $0.46 for Q2 increased 17.9% from $0.39 for the second quarter of 2015, while adjusted diluted EPS increased from $0.41 to $0.55, an increase of 34.1%. Nick will provide more specifics on these adjustments shortly. 
During the quarter, organic revenue growth for parts and services was a respectable 5.4%, despite facing tough year-over-year comps and a continuation of the challenging whether dynamics we faced in Q1 globally. 
Let's now turn to our North American operations. There is no doubt that the impact of the mild winter in Q1 continued into Q2 as collision claims were down in many states. According to CCC, total year-to-date collision claims were up only 2.3%. In addition, the U.S. market witnessed average temperatures well above historical levels, making year-to-date 2016 the third warmest on record with only 2012 and 2006 being warmer. Also, year-to-date precipitation was mixed across North America with key markets like Pennsylvania witnessing levels 17% below historical averages, while Colorado was 14% above. 
With that said, it's important to note that it is impacted was not consistent across North America. The geographic regions of Canada, the Northeast and the Midwest had declines in Q1 repairable claims and organic growth and the metrics in these regions were soft again in Q2. Conversely, our central and southeast regions, which have nearly double-digit organic growth in Q1 continued that trend of solid organic growth in Q2. 
Despite the tough comp and the short-term challenges of weather and subsequent lower claims volume, North America delivered Q2 and year-to-date organic revenue growth for parts and services of 3.1% and 4%, respectively. 
During Q2, we purchased over 72,000 vehicles for dismantling by our North American Wholesale operations, a 2.9% decrease over Q2 2015. Procurement costs at auction increased over Q2 2015 by 2.7%, but again, we continue to buy a slightly younger vehicle year-over-year. 
For our North American aftermarket business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 9.6% and 16.8%, respectively, year-over-year and in the quarter. In addition, our North American operations improved gross margins during the quarter, which included 40 basis points of improvement from the aftermarket procurement initiatives implemented during 2016. 
And lastly during the quarter, we added a top 10 carrier to our key IQ [ph] proprietary aftermarket parts program. This carrier was a solid win for our North American team given this carrier was using aftermarket parts only on a limited basis. We expect to have the entire program fully deployed by November 1, 2016. 
In our self-service retail business during Q2, we acquired over 138,000 lower-cost self-service and crush-only cars, which is a 5.3% increase over Q2 2015. Similar to Q1, we increased our self-service procurement to take advantage of the favorable pricing through the high-quality vehicles in this line of business. Nick will provide more details on scrap shortly. 
Turning to our ongoing intelligent parts solution initiative with CCC. During Q2, the revenue and number of aftermarket purchase orders processed through the CCC platform grew 91% and 66%, respectively, year-over-year. Briefly, I want to provide an update on our sales force effectiveness and optimization productivity initiatives discussed on the last call. 
During the quarter, our sales force effectiveness efforts focused on increasing the level of outbound calls for sales rep, which increased from 17.2 to 18 per day, a 4% increase sequentially from Q1 to Q2 2016. In addition, in June, we launched an add-on sales program to drive incremental sales per order with a specific group of SKUs. The early results of this launch are encouraging with some of the SKUs in the program doubling in sales. Those dollar increase from sales from this program are minimal. The intent is to in the discipline our sales force to continuously focus on selling deeper into every customer and every order. 
Also during the quarter, we continue to make great strides with the implementation of Roadnet, the Tier 1 provider we've selected for the technology component of our route optimization efforts. At the end of Q2, our current utilization rate with Roadnet reached 80%, accounting for over 3,400 vehicles, driving over 285,000 miles and making over 42,000 stops on a daily basis. Thus far, with this initiative, our focus has been to introduce our operations through the use of Roadnet. Once we have reached full installation by year-end, we will begin the arduous task of assessing all the opportunities that exist across our networks in fleet. Combined, this should generate operational efficiencies incremental margin within our North American business. 
Now moving to our European operations. In Q2, our Europe segment had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 8% and acquisition growth of 57.5% primarily related to Rhiag, which were offset by a decrease of 3.7% related to foreign exchange rates. 
During Q2, ECP drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 9.6%. And for branches opened more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 7.8%. I am pleased with this growth given the extremely wet weather conditions in the quarter. According to the U.K. net office, June was the 11th wettest since 1910, which had a slight impact on road travel in the midst of a normal busy driving season. During the quarter, ECP opened 7 new branches, bringing our network to 206 branches. 
During Q2, collision part sales of ECP has year-over-year rep year-over-year growth of 18.2%. Also during the quarter, ECP collision entered into a parts agreement with CRM, or the Car Repair Network, a nationwide network of over 170 repairers that combine are responsible for over 18,000 repairs per year. In addition to CRM, we successfully achieved approval status for the supply of parts to the largest U.K. repair group nationwide action and repair centers following successful tender process. 
And lastly on ECP, I'd like to note that while the U.K. referendum to leave the EU has created some near-term uncertainty and negatively impacted its currency, we do expect that people will largely continue to drive their vehicles. As most of you are aware, the demand for the parts we sell in Europe are related to the total miles driven and the average age of cars in the road, neither of which should be directly impacted by the results of the referendum. And frankly, in tough economic times, the value proposition of alternative parts becomes more attractive. Nick will provide additional color on the referendum impact shortly. 
And now turning to our Sator business. During Q2, Sator had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 4.4%. Also as mentioned on our Q1 call, our investments in 2014 and 2015 continue to drive margin improvements at Sator with Q2 recording the highest growth and EBITDA margins achieved since acquiring the business in May of 2013. 
And now an update on Rhiag. Q2 was the first full quarter of ownership of Rhiag. Overall, Rhiag tracked in line with our expectation and is executing on its growth initiatives. Since we acquired Rhiag in March, it has added 11 new branch locations to the network. 
We have been very busy with the integration with our team's focus on the purchasing functions. As I speak, we are keenly focused on gathering the necessary data to putting in place a big medication lines to achieve the targeted synergies for building a sustainable pan-European procurement function. As an example, we have learned that Rhiag has certain branded product that ECP will be able to distributes, allowing ECP to augment or replace some of its existing suppliers. Not only will this example reduce the number of vendors and the complexity associated with the principal years in the U.K, but will also improve margins. 
With that said, we continue to believe that we are well along and on the right path to building a company that's unique that will have benefit from our scale and common ownership to create a leading position through all of Europe. 
Now on to our Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment continued its strong performance by posting year-over-year total revenue growth of 18.5% in the quarter, including the benefits of the Coast acquisition and strong organic revenue growth of 8%. This continued solid organic growth is largely due to the expansion of our Specialty delivery routes, the integration of the Coast business on to our delivery fleet, expanded warehouse service levels, a SAAR and enhanced inventory offerings. And lastly, Specialty continued their integration activities from the Coast acquisition by consolidating additional Coast distribution centers into our existing network. At the end of Q2, only 4 of the 17 original Coast warehouses were in operation. 
As previously mentioned, on April 21, 2016, the company closed its acquisition of PGW, a leading global distributor and manufacturer of automotive glass products. With this acquisition, we now have a new reporting segments that Nick will cover further. 
Regarding their operations, during the quarter, the PGW team secured manufacturer renewal agreement point existing OE platform with a new model launch and also, a 1-year renewal contract with a large North American MSO for their ARG business. 
In addition to the PGW acquisitions during the second quarter of 2016, LKQ acquired a distributor of aftermarket automotive products in Belgium. 
At this time, I'd like to ask the Nick to provide more details and perspective on our financial results and our updated 2016 guidance."

I am delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter. And over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of our 4 segments during the second quarter before turning on the balance sheet and then addressing our revised guidance for 2016. 
The short version of our financial performance in Q2 of 2016 is that we had a terrific quarter and taken as a whole, performed ahead of our expectations. While revenue growth in North America was a bit behind expectations, the margins in the segment were very strong. In addition, the European operations performed well, the 2 big acquisitions were slightly above targets, and we finally got a small boost from a sequential increase in scrap steel prices. 
To refresh everyone's memory, we [indiscernible] in late March and was included for the full quarter of PGW close in late April and contributed for only 10 weeks. 
As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the second quarter of 2016 was $2.45 billion, representing a 33% increase over last year, that reflects a 36.8% increase in revenue from parts and services, partially offset by an 11.2% decrease in other revenue. The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 5.4% from organic, plus 32.8% from acquisitions for a constant currency growth of 38.2% before backing out the translation impact of FX, which was a 1.4% decline. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each business as I walk through the segment results. 
As noted on Page 11 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins declined 180 basis points to 37.6% due entirely to the impact of the acquisitions. You will recall that when we initially announced the transactions, we highlighted the fact that both Rhiag and PGW have a lower gross margins than our historical businesses. Excluding the 2 big acquisitions, gross margins were actually up by about 70 basis points during the quarter. 
While consolidated gross margins were down, consolidated operating expenses as a percent of revenue were also about 160 basis points below last year. Some of that reflects the impact of the different margin structure of the 2 acquisitions and some of it reflects improved efficiencies in the historical businesses. 
Segment EBITDA totaled $319 million for the quarter, reflecting a 37% increase from 2015. As a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 13%, a 30 basis points increase over the 12.7% recorded last year. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced an increase restructuring cost primarily related to expenses connected with the integration of our Specialty acquisitions. 
Depreciation and amortization was up almost $23 million, both all of which related to the impact of the 2 big acquisitions. The same holds true for interest expense, which was up by about $12 million. 
With that, pretax income increased 16% over last year. 
Our effective tax rate during the second quarter was 34.75%, down from the 34.85% in 2015 and consistent with the annual guidance we provided in April.
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.46, which was up 18% compared to the $0.39 reported last year. Adjusted EPS, which is before restructuring charges, the loss on debt extinguishment, the hedging gain, intangible asset amortization and noncash inventory step-up adjustment related to the PGW acquisition, was $0.55 a share versus $0.41, reflecting a 34% improvement. As mentioned, the impact of scrap was a bit of a tailwind in the quarter and actually helped earnings per share by about $0.02. Currency fluctuations negatively impacted the earnings per share by about a $0.01 during the second quarter. And w anticipate that currencies will have a bigger negative impact in the back half of the year given the devaluation of the pound Sterling following the Brexit vote.
As highlighted on Page 13, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to varying growth rates of our different businesses and the impact of acquisitions. Since each of our segment has a different margin structure, this mix shift impacts the trend in consolidated margins. This became more accentuated now that we have closed both Rhiag and PGW and you saw a shift in the second quarter metrics where in North American parts and services revenue accounted for less than 40% of the consolidated total. 
And with that, let's get on to the details of the operating segments. Revenue in our North American segment during the second quarter of 2016 increased to $1,081,000,000 or a 3.4% increase over 2015. This is the combination of a 5.6% growth rate in parts and services, offset by 11.4% decline in other revenue, the latter of which was due primarily to the sale of our precious metals business at the end of Q2 of last year; and lower prices received for other metals, such as aluminum, platinum, palladium and rhodium relative to Q2 of last year. The 5.6% growth in North American parts and services was the combination of 3.1% organic growth and 2.8% acquisition growth, offset by a 30 basis point FX decline due to the weakness of the Canadian dollar. 
There is no doubt that the impact of the mild winter had a bleed over impact on our Q2 revenue. According to CCC, repairable collision claims were down on a year-over-year basis in many of the big populations states, including Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois. Coalition parts typically they don't sell as well when accident frequency is down. As Rob mentioned, this was not consistent across North America as our central and southeast regions, which had excellent organic growth in Q1 continued to report above-average organic growth in Q2.
Gross margins in North America during the second quarter were 44.1%, a 170 basis point increase over 2015. The benefit of the procurement initiatives started to manifest themselves in Q2 and the lower cost of aftermarket inventory added approximately 40 basis points of improvement to the gross margin of our overall North American operations. 
Salvage also experienced a slight increase in gross margins, while our self-service operations contributed a 110 basis point increase to North American gross margins, largely reflecting the sequential improvement in scrap steel pricing. You will note that scrap price in May reaching over $150 per ton but has reversed course and were now back down into the low $100 range.
With respect to operating expenses in our North American segment, we gained about 30 basis points of the margin compared to the comparable quarter last year, reflecting improvements in both the Wholesale and self-service operations. On the upside, we continue to experience improvements in both fuel and facility costs relative to last year, but on the downside, we lost a bit of margin related to freight expense. In total, EBITDA for the North American business during the second quarter was $164 million. And as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the North American segment was 15.2% in Q2 of this year, up 190 basis points from the 13.3% reported in the comparable period of the prior year. 
You will recall that in Q1, we indicated that we expected the benefit from our productivity initiatives to pick up as we move through the year. As just mentioned, we saw some benefit in our cost of goods sold related to the procurement savings of our aftermarket parts inventory. In addition, there are procurement benefits in many other expense categories across North America. [indiscernible] optimization effort is now rolled out across 80% of the country and we anticipate we will begin to see the positive impact of the program begin to accrue over the next few quarters. In total, we estimate that the aggregate benefit of the productivity initiatives during the second quarter was approximately $0.01 a share. 
Moving on to our European segment. Total revenue in the second quarter accelerated to $824 million, up from $510 million, a 62% increase. Organic growth for parts and services in Europe during the second quarter was 8%, reflecting the combination of 9.6% growth at ECP, 4.4% growth at Sator and 9.9% in Sweden. The impact of the acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 58% increase in revenue with most -- with the most significant amount reflecting the addition of Rhiag. So on a constant currency basis, European parts and services revenue was up 66%. 
These gains were offset by a 4% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, particularly relative to the pound Sterling. As you can see on Page 19, the average rate during the quarter for the sterling was about 6% below last year and fell an incremental 7% to about $1.33 at quarter end due to the Brexit vote. More recently, the sterling has been down further to about $1.30 to $1.31. The translation impact of this will absolutely weigh on a reported U.S. dollar results for the rest of the year, probably to the tune of $0.01 in each of the third and fourth quarters. 
Gross margins in Europe were 37.4%, a 50 basis point decline from the comparable period of 2015, largely reflecting the impact of Rhiag. Excluding the impact of Rhiag, gross margins in Europe increased 100 basis points as we continue to benefit from improved procurement in the U.K. and the internalization of the gross margins from our acquisitions in the Netherlands. 
As mentioned when we announce the Rhiag acquisition back in December, given the 3 step distribution model in Italy and Switzerland, Rhiag has a lower gross margin structure than either ECP or Sator. The impact was not as significant as initially anticipated, however, and after mapping Rhiag's general weather accounts to LKQ chartered accounts and completing the conversion from IFRS to U.S. GAAP, Rhiag had gross margins are of 34.6% during the second quarter. With respect to operating expenses as a percent of revenue, we experienced a 60 basis point improvement on a consolidated European basis. We benefit from 170 basis point reduction in operating expense due to the addition of Rhiag, which has lower operating expenses as a percent of revenue than either ECP or Sator. We also saw about a 40 basis point improvement in SG&A expense as a percent of revenue primarily at ECP. Offsetting these gains was a 140 basis point increase in facility and warehouse expenses.
As you will recall, we started paying rents and related property cost on the new distribution facility in Tamworth, England in February. 
The incremental costs related to this project in Q2 were approximately GBP 2.2 million or about $3.2 million, which reflects a 40 basis point increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue for Europe. We were also impacted by new branches and [indiscernible] ECP and an increase in warehouse personnel at Sator related to new product introductions. 
European EBITDA totaled $90 million, a 67% increase over last year, reflecting solid performance at ECP and Sator and the positive impact of Rhiag. Excluding the negative impact of FX rates, constant currency EBITDA growth in Europe was 71%. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA for the second quarter of 2016 was at 10.9% versus 10.6% last year, a 30 basis point improvement, even after taking into account the impact of the T2 project.
Turning to our Specialty segment. Revenue for the quarter totaled $337 million, a 19% increase over the comparable quarter of 2015. The organic growth rate of 8% was quite strong, while the impact of the Coast acquisition in August of 2015 added 11% to revenue growth.
Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the second quarter decreased about 160 basis points compared to last year, largely due to the impact of stocking 2 new Specialty distribution centers in Michigan and Washington State, which were not in operation at this time last year, as well as increased customer volume rebates associated with the higher sales levels. 
Operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were up about 30 basis points. Facility expense increased due to certain costs related to the 2 new distribution centers mentioned a bit ago. On the plus side, we continue to see the SG&A leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing network as well as the benefit of the lower fuel prices. 
EBITDA for the Specialty segment was $42 million, up 4% from Q2 of 2015. And as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment decreased 170 basis points to 12.4% in 2016 compared to 14.1% last year. Remember this is a highly seasonal business and you should assume these margins will moderate as we move through the back half of the year. 
On Page 22, you can see the impact of the acquisition of PGW. Revenue for the quarter was $210 million, which again reflects 10 weeks of activity. You should note, Q2 tends to be a very strong quarter for PGW. Gross margins were 18.4%, but this included a onetime noncash charge of $10 million reflecting the write-off of inventory. You may recall that on the Q1 call, I mentioned that under U.S. GAAP, we had to mark the closing date inventory of PGW off to the market value and this increase of would get amortized as a noncash expense as we turn inventory. We anticipated an $8 million to $12 million charge and it came right in the middle at $10 million. It doesn't affect our adjusted net income or adjusted EPS, but it was a onetime hit to gross margin, diluted net income and diluted EPS during the quarter. Excluding this onetime noncash item, the gross margin at PGW would have been 23.3%, which is generally consistent with the expectations we highlighted at the time the transaction was announced. EBITDA margins for PGW where 11.1%, slightly higher than the annual level mentioned when we announced the transaction, largely reflecting the seasonality of the business as Q2 tends to be relatively strong. 
Let's move on to capital allocation. As presented on Slide 23, you will note that our after-tax cash flow from operations during the first 6 months was approximately $355 million as we experienced strong cash earnings and only a moderate increase in working capital. During the first 6 months of 2016, we deployed a little more than $1.9 billion of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $102 million to fund the capital expenditures and almost $1.8 billion to fund acquisitions. 
The acquisitions of Rhiag and PGW were financed by drawing down on our line of credit and the completion of a euro note offering back in April. We closed the quarter with approximately $273 million of cash, of which $196 million was held outside of the United States. And we had slightly more than $3.3 billion of total debt outstanding. So our net debt was approximately $3.1 billion. And on a pro forma basis, taking into account the impact of the acquisitions, our leverage ratio was about 2.8x latest 12-month EBITDA. At quarter end, total availability under our credit facility was approximately $1.1 billion, which we believe is sufficient to support the continued growth of our businesses. 
Finally, as you noted in the press release, we have provided updated guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2016. Again, we are closed on March 18 and PGW on April 21, so we will record a tad more than 9 months and 8 months of their respective results in 2016. As t relates to the organic growth for parts and services, we slightly reduced the guidance for 2016 to 5.5% to 7.0%, reflecting the softness in the North American year-to-date results following the mild winter. Our range for adjusted EPS, which excludes the after-tax impact of intangible amortization is now $1.79 to $1.87 per share with a midpoint of $1.83. The increase from the previous midpoint of $1.81 reflects the better-than-expected Q2 results, partially offset by anticipated headwinds from the currencies in the back half of the year, particularly the pound Sterling, and lower scrap steel prices than experienced in Q2 and the better appreciation of the seasonality of the 2 new acquisitions, particularly related to typical Q4 slowdowns. 
The new EPS guidance assumes the pound Sterling and euro exchange rates of $1.30 and $1.10, respectively. And importantly, that scrap remains at current levels as well. Our assumed tax rate for 2016 remains constant at 34.75%. Our current guidance for cash flow from operations is up a bit to approximately $585 million to $635 million and the guidance for capital spending is unchanged. 
At this point, I will return the call back over to Rob to wrap up."

This morning, I will begin our review with a few high-level financial metrics followed by an update on our operating segments and some macro trends we witnessed in Q2. Nick will follow with a detailed overview of our financial performance. 
Turning to Slide 3. Q2 revenue reached a record $2.45 billion, an increase of 33.3% as compared to $1.84 billion in the second quarter of 2015. Net income for the second quarter of 2016 was $140.7 million, an increase of 17.6% as compared to $119.7 million for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, net income was $169.2 million, an increase of 34% as compared to the $126.3 million for the same period of 2015. 
Diluted earnings per share of $0.46 for Q2 increased 17.9% from $0.39 for the second quarter of 2015, while adjusted diluted EPS increased from $0.41 to $0.55, an increase of 34.1%. Nick will provide more specifics on these adjustments shortly. 
During the quarter, organic revenue growth for parts and services was a respectable 5.4%, despite facing tough year-over-year comps and a continuation of the challenging weather dynamics we faced in Q1 globally. 
Let's now turn to our North American operations. There is no doubt that the impact of the mild winter in Q1 continued into Q2 as collision claims were down in many states. According to CCC, total year-to-date collision claims were up only 2.3%. In addition, the U.S. market witnessed average temperatures well above historical levels, making year-to-date 2016 the third warmest on record with only 2012 and 2006 being warmer. Also, year-to-date precipitation was mixed across North America with key markets like Pennsylvania witnessing levels 17% below historical averages, while Colorado was 14% above. 
With that said, it's important to note that this impact was not consistent across North America. The geographic regions of Canada, the Northeast and the Midwest had declines in Q1 repairable claims and organic growth, and the metrics in these regions were soft again in Q2. Conversely, our central and Southeast regions, which had nearly double-digit organic growth in Q1, continued that trend of solid organic growth in Q2. Despite the tough comp and the short-term challenges of weather and subsequent lower claims volume, North America delivered Q2 and year-to-date organic revenue growth for parts and services of 3.1% and 4%, respectively. 
During Q2, we purchased over 72,000 vehicles for dismantling by our North American wholesale operations, a 2.9% decrease over Q2 2015. Procurement costs at auction increased over Q2 2015 by 2.7%, but again, we continue to buy a slightly younger vehicle year-over-year. 
For our North American aftermarket business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 9.6% and 16.8%, respectively, year-over-year and in the quarter. In addition, our North American operations improved gross margins during the quarter, which included 40 basis points of improvement from the aftermarket procurement initiatives implemented during 2016. 
And lastly during the quarter, we added a top 10 carrier to our Ts IQ proprietary aftermarket parts program. This carrier was a solid win for our North American team given this carrier was using aftermarket parts only on a limited basis. We expect to have the entire program fully deployed by November 1, 2016. 
In our self-service retail business during Q2, we acquired over 138,000 lower-cost self-service and crush-only cars, which is a 5.3% increase over Q2 2015. Similar to Q1, we increased our self-service procurement to take advantage of the favorable pricing for the higher-quality vehicles in this line of business. Nick will provide more details on scrap shortly. 
Turning to our ongoing intelligent parts solution initiative with CCC. During Q2, the revenue and number of aftermarket purchase orders processed through the CCC platform grew 91% and 66%, respectively, year-over-year. Briefly, I want to provide an update on our sales force effectiveness and route optimization productivity initiatives discussed on the last call. 
During the quarter, our sales force effectiveness efforts focused on increasing the level of outbound calls for sales rep, which increased from 17.2 to 18 per day, a 4% increase sequentially from Q1 to Q2 2016. In addition, in June, we launched an add-on sales program to drive incremental sales per order with a specific group of SKUs. The early results of this launch are encouraging with some of the SKUs in the program doubling in sales. Though the dollar increase in sales from this program are minimal, the intent is to instill discipline in our sales force to continuously focus on selling deeper into every customer and every order. 
Also during the quarter, we continue to make great strides with the implementation of Roadnet, the Tier 1 provider we selected for the technology component of our route optimization efforts. At the end of Q2, our current utilization rate with Roadnet reached 80%, accounting for over 3,400 vehicles, driving over 285,000 miles and making over 42,000 stops on a daily basis. Thus far, with this initiative, our focus has been to introduce our operations through the use of Roadnet. Once we have reached full installation by year end, we will begin the arduous task of assessing all the opportunities that exist across our networks and fleet. Combined, this should generate operational efficiencies and incremental margin within our North American business. 
Now moving to our European operations. In Q2, our Europe segment had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 8% and acquisition growth of 57.5% primarily related to Rhiag, which were offset by a decrease of 3.7% related to foreign exchange rates. 
During Q2, ECP drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 9.6%. And for branches opened more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 7.8%. I am pleased with this growth given the extremely wet weather conditions in the quarter. According to the U.K. net office, June was the 11th wettest since 1910, which had a slight impact on road travel in the midst of a normal busy driving season. During the quarter, ECP opened 7 new branches, bringing our network to 206 branches. 
During Q2, collision part sales of ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 18.2%. Also during the quarter, ECP collision entered into a parts agreement with CRN, or the Car Repair Network, a nationwide network of over 170 repairers, that combined, are responsible for over 18,000 repairs per year. In addition to CRN, we successfully achieved approval status for the supply of parts to the largest U.K. repair group nationwide action and repair centers following a successful tender process. 
And lastly on ECP, I'd like to note that while the U.K. referendum to leave the EU has created some near-term uncertainty and negatively impacted its currency, we do expect that people will largely continue to drive their vehicles. As most of you are aware, the demand for the parts we sell in Europe are related to the total miles driven and the average age of cars in the road, neither of which should be directly impacted by the results of the referendum. And frankly, in tough economic times, the value proposition of alternative parts becomes more attractive. Nick will provide additional color on the referendum impact shortly. 
And now turning to our Sator business. During Q2, Sator had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 4.4%. Also as mentioned on our Q1 call, our investments in 2014 and 2015 continue to drive margin improvements at Sator with Q2 recording the highest gross and EBITDA margins achieved since acquiring the business in May of 2013. 
And now an update on Rhiag. Q2 was the first full quarter of ownership of Rhiag. Overall, Rhiag tracked in line with our expectation and is executing on its growth initiatives. Since we acquired Rhiag in March, it has added 11 new branch locations to the network. 
We had been very busy with the integration with our team's focus on the purchasing functions. As I speak, we are keenly focused on gathering the necessary data and putting in place the communication lines to achieve the targeted synergies for building a sustainable pan-European procurement function. As an example, we have learned that Rhiag has certain branded products that ECP will be able to distribute, allowing ECP to augment or replace some of its existing suppliers. Not only will this example reduce the number of vendors and the complexity associated with the current suppliers in the U.K, but it will also improve margins. 
With that said, we continue to believe that we are well along and on the right path to building a company that's unique that will have benefit from our scale and common ownership to create a leading position through all of Europe. 
Now on to our Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment continued its strong performance by posting year-over-year total revenue growth of 18.5% in the quarter, including the benefits of the Coast acquisition and strong organic revenue growth of 8%. This continued solid organic growth is largely due to the expansion of our Specialty delivery routes, the integration of the Coast business on to our existing delivery fleet, expanded warehouse service levels, a strong SAAR and enhanced inventory offerings. And lastly, Specialty continued their integration activities from the Coast acquisition by consolidating additional Coast distribution centers into our existing network. At the end of Q2, only 4 of the 17 original Coast warehouses were in operation. 
As previously mentioned, on April 21, 2016, the company closed its acquisition of PGW, a leading global distributor and manufacturer of automotive glass products. With this acquisition, we now have a new reporting segment that Nick will cover further. 
Regarding their operations, during the quarter, the PGW team secured a manufacturer renewal agreement for an existing OE platform with a new model launch and also, a 1-year renewal contract with a large North American MSO for their ARG business. 
In addition to the PGW acquisition during the second quarter of 2016, LKQ acquired a distributor of aftermarket automotive products in Belgium. 
At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more details and perspective on our financial results and our updated 2016 guidance."
4303924,374711702,1015678,"LKQ Corp., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","LKQ Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everybody on the call. I am delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter. And over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of ou",2776,"Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everybody on the call. I am delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter. And over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of our 4 segments during the second quarter before touching on the balance sheet and then addressing our revised guidance for 2016. 
The short version of our financial performance in Q2 of 2016 is that we had a terrific quarter, and taken as a whole, performed ahead of our expectations. While the revenue growth in North America was a bit behind expectations, the margins in this segment were very strong. In addition, the European operations performed well, the 2 big acquisitions were slightly above target, and we finally got a small boost from a sequential increase in scrap steel prices. 
To refresh everyone's memory, Rhiag closed in late March and was included for the full quarter, while PGW closed in late April and contributed for only 10 weeks. 
As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the second quarter of 2016 was $2.45 billion, representing a 33% increase over last year, that reflects a 36.8% increase in revenue from parts and services, partially offset by an 11.2% decrease in other revenue. The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 5.4% from organic, plus 32.8% from acquisitions for a constant currency growth of 38.2% before backing out the translation impact of FX, which was a 1.4% decline. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each business as I walk through the segment results. 
As noted on Page 11 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins declined 180 basis points to 37.6% due entirely to the impact of the acquisitions. You will recall that when we initially announced the transactions, we highlighted the fact that both Rhiag and PGW have a lower gross margins than our historical businesses. Excluding the 2 big acquisitions, gross margins were actually up by about 70 basis points during the quarter. 
While consolidated gross margins were down, consolidated operating expenses as a percent of revenue were also about 160 basis points below last year. Some of that reflects the impact of the different margin structure of the 2 acquisitions and some of it reflects improved efficiencies in the historical businesses. 
Segment EBITDA totaled $319 million for the quarter, reflecting a 37% increase from 2015. As a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 13%, a 30 basis points increase over the 12.7% recorded last year. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced an increase in restructuring cost primarily related to expenses connected with the integration of our Specialty acquisitions. 
Depreciation and amortization was up almost $23 million, most all of which related to the impact of the 2 big acquisitions. The same holds true for interest expense, which was up by about $12 million. 
With that, pretax income increased 16% over last year. 
Our effective tax rate during the second quarter was 34.75%, down from the 34.85% in 2015 and consistent with the annual guidance we provided in April.
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.46, which was up 18% compared to the $0.39 reported last year. Adjusted EPS, which is before restructuring charges, the loss on debt extinguishment, the hedging gain, intangible asset amortization and a noncash inventory step-up adjustment related to the PGW acquisition, was $0.55 a share versus $0.41, reflecting a 34% improvement. 
As mentioned, the impact of scrap was a bit of a tailwind in the quarter and actually helped earnings per share by about $0.02. Currency fluctuations negatively impacted earnings per share by about $0.01 during the second quarter. And we anticipate that currencies will have a bigger negative impact in the back half of the year given the devaluation of the pound sterling following the Brexit vote.
As highlighted on Page 13, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to varying growth rates of our different businesses and the impact of acquisitions. Since each of our segment has a different margin structure, this mix shift impacts the trend in consolidated margins. This became more accentuated now that we have closed both Rhiag and PGW, and you saw a shift in the second quarter metrics where in North American parts and services revenue accounted for less than 40% of the consolidated total. 
And with that, let's get on to the details of the operating segments. Revenue in our North American segment during the second quarter of 2016 increased to $1,081,000,000 or a 3.4% increase over 2015. This is the combination of a 5.6% growth rate in parts and services, offset by 11.4% decline in other revenue, the latter which was due primarily to the sale of our precious metals business at the end of Q2 of last year and lower prices received for other metals, such as aluminum, platinum, palladium and rhodium relative to Q2 of last year. The 5.6% growth in North American parts and services was the combination of 3.1% organic growth and 2.8% acquisition growth, offset by a 30 basis point FX decline due to the weakness of the Canadian dollar. 
There is no doubt that the impact of the mild winter had a bleedover impact on our Q2 revenue. According to CCC, repairable collision claims were down on a year-over-year basis in many of the big population Snowbelt states, including Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois. Collision parts simply they don't sell as well when accident frequency is down. As Rob mentioned, this was not consistent across North America as our central and Southeast regions, which had excellent organic growth in Q1, continued to report above-average organic growth in Q2.
Gross margins in North America during the second quarter were 44.1%, a 170 basis point increase over 2015. The benefits of the procurement initiatives started to manifest themselves in Q2 and the lower cost of aftermarket inventory added approximately 40 basis points of improvement to the gross margin of our overall North American operations. 
Salvage also experienced a slight increase in gross margins, while our self-service operations contributed a 110 basis point increase to North American gross margins, largely reflecting the sequential improvement in scrap steel pricing. You will note that scrap spiked in May, reaching over $150 per ton but has reversed course and were now back down into the low $100 range.
With respect to operating expenses in our North American segment, we gained about 30 basis points of margin compared to the comparable quarter of last year, reflecting improvements in both the wholesale and self-service operations. On the upside, we continue to experience improvements in both fuel and facility costs relative to last year, but on the downside, we lost a bit of margin related to freight expense. In total, EBITDA for the North American business during the second quarter was $164 million. And as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the North American segment was 15.2% in Q2 of this year, up 190 basis points from the 13.3% reported in the comparable period of the prior year. 
You will recall that in Q1, we indicated that we expected the benefit from our productivity initiatives to pick up as we move through the year. As just mentioned, we saw some benefit in our cost of goods sold related to the procurement savings of our aftermarket parts inventory. In addition, there are procurement benefits in many other expense categories across North America. The route optimization effort is now rolled out across 80% of the country, and we anticipate we will begin to see the positive impact of that program begin to accrue over the next few quarters. In total, we estimate that the aggregate benefit of the productivity initiatives during the second quarter was approximately $0.01 a share. 
Moving on to our European segment. Total revenue in the second quarter accelerated to $824 million, up from $510 million, a 62% increase. Organic growth for parts and services in Europe during the second quarter was 8%, reflecting the combination of 9.6% growth at ECP, 4.4% growth at Sator and 9.9% in Sweden. The impact of the acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 58% increase in revenue with most -- with the most significant amount reflecting the addition of Rhiag. So on a constant currency basis, European parts and services revenue was up 66%. 
These gains were offset by a 4% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, particularly relative to the pound sterling. As you can see on Page 19, the average rate during the quarter for the sterling was about 6% below last year and it fell an incremental 7% to about $1.33 at quarter end due to the Brexit vote. More recently, the sterling has been down further to about $1.30 to $1.31. The translation impact of this will absolutely weigh on a reported U.S. dollar results for the rest of the year, probably to the tune of $0.01 in each of the third and fourth quarters. 
Gross margins in Europe were 37.4%, a 50 basis point decline from the comparable period of 2015, largely reflecting the impact of Rhiag. Excluding the impact of Rhiag, gross margins in Europe increased 100 basis points as we continue to benefit from improved procurement in the U.K. and the internalization of the gross margin from our acquisitions in the Netherlands. 
As we mentioned when we announced the Rhiag acquisition back in December, given the 3-step distribution model in Italy and Switzerland, Rhiag has a lower gross margin structure than either ECP or Sator. The impact was not as significant as initially anticipated, however, and after mapping Rhiag's general ledger accounts to LKQ's chartered accounts and completing the conversion from IFRS to U.S. GAAP, Rhiag had gross margins of about 34.6% during the second quarter. With respect to operating expenses as a percent of revenue, we experienced a 60 basis point improvement on a consolidated European basis. We benefited from 170 basis point reduction in operating expense due to the addition of Rhiag, which has lower operating expenses as a percent of revenue than either ECP or Sator. We also saw about a 40 basis point improvement in SG&A expense as a percent of revenue primarily at ECP. Offsetting these gains was a 140 basis point increase in facility and warehouse expenses.
As you will recall, we started paying rents and related property cost on the new distribution facility in Tamworth, England in February. 
The incremental costs related to this project in Q2 were approximately GBP 2.2 million or about $3.2 million, which reflects a 40 basis point increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue for Europe. We were also impacted by new branches and hubs at ECP and an increase in warehouse personnel at Sator related to new product introductions. 
European EBITDA totaled $90 million, a 67% increase over last year, reflecting solid performance at ECP and Sator and the positive impact of Rhiag. Excluding the negative impact of FX rates, constant currency EBITDA growth in Europe was 71%. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA for the second quarter of 2016 was at 10.9% versus 10.6% last year, a 30 basis point improvement, even after taking into account the impact of the T2 project.
Turning to our Specialty segment. Revenue for the quarter totaled $337 million, a 19% increase over the comparable quarter of 2015. The organic growth rate of 8% was quite strong, while the impact of the Coast acquisition in August of 2015 added 11% to revenue growth.
Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the second quarter decreased about 160 basis points compared to last year, largely due to the impact of stocking 2 new Specialty distribution centers in Michigan and Washington State, which were not in operation at this time last year as well as increased customer volume rebates associated with the higher sales levels. 
Operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were up about 30 basis points. Facility expense increased due to certain costs related to the 2 new distribution centers mentioned a bit ago. On the plus side, we continued to see the SG&A leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing network as well as the benefit of the lower fuel prices. 
EBITDA for the Specialty segment was $42 million, up 4% from Q2 of 2015. And as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment decreased 170 basis points to 12.4% in 2016 compared to 14.1% last year. Remember, this is a highly seasonal business and you should assume these margins will moderate as we move through the back half of the year. 
On Page 22, you can see the impact of the acquisition of PGW. Revenue for the quarter was $210 million, which again reflects 10 weeks of activity. You should note, Q2 tends to be a very strong quarter for PGW. Gross margins were 18.4%, but this included a onetime noncash charge of $10 million reflecting the write-off of inventory. You may recall that on the Q1 call, I mentioned that under U.S. GAAP, we had to mark the closing date inventory of PGW off to the market value, and this increase would get amortized as a noncash expense as we turn the inventory. We anticipated an $8 million to $12 million charge, and it came right in the middle at $10 million. It doesn't affect our adjusted net income or adjusted EPS, but it was a onetime hit to gross margin, diluted net income and diluted EPS during the quarter. Excluding this onetime noncash item, the gross margin at PGW would have been 23.3%, which is generally consistent with the expectations we highlighted at the time the transaction was announced. EBITDA margins for PGW were 11.1%, slightly higher than the annual level mentioned when we announced the transaction, largely reflecting the seasonality of the business as Q2 tends to be relatively strong. 
Let's move on to capital allocation. As presented on Slide 23, you will note that our after-tax cash flow from operations during the first 6 months was approximately $355 million as we experienced strong cash earnings and only a moderate increase in working capital. During the first 6 months of 2016, we deployed a little more than $1.9 billion of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $102 million to fund the capital expenditures and almost $1.8 billion to fund the acquisitions. 
The acquisitions of Rhiag and PGW were financed by drawing down on our line of credit and the completion of a euro note offering back in April. We closed the quarter with approximately $273 million of cash, of which $196 million was held outside of the United States. And we had slightly more than $3.3 billion of total debt outstanding. So our net debt was approximately $3.1 billion. And on a pro forma basis, taking into account the impact of the acquisitions, our leverage ratio was about 2.8x latest 12-month EBITDA. At quarter end, total availability under our credit facility was approximately $1.1 billion, which we believe is sufficient to support the continued growth of our businesses. 
Finally, as you noted in the press release, we have provided updated guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2016. Again, Rhiag closed on March 18 and PGW on April 21, so we will record a tad more than 9 months and 8 months of their respective results in 2016. As it relates to the organic growth for parts and services, we slightly reduced the guidance for 2016 to 5.5% to 7.0%, reflecting the softness in the North American year-to-date results following the mild winter. Our range for adjusted EPS, which excludes the after-tax impact of intangible amortization, is now $1.79 to $1.87 per share with the midpoint of $1.83. The increase from the previous midpoint of $1.81 reflects the better-than-expected Q2 results, partially offset by anticipated headwinds from the currencies in the back half of the year, particularly the pound sterling, lower scrap steel prices than experienced in Q2, and the better appreciation for the seasonality of the 2 new acquisitions, particularly related to typical Q4 slowdowns. 
The new EPS guidance assumes the pound sterling and euro exchange rates of $1.30 and $1.10, respectively. And importantly, that scrap remains at current levels as well. Our assumed tax rate for 2016 remains constant at 34.75%. Our current guidance for cash flow from operations is up a bit to approximately $585 million to $635 million, and the guidance for capital spending is unchanged. 
At this point, I will return the call back over to Rob to wrap up."

On scrap, whereas we got $0.02 to the positive in the second quarter, that was unexpected surprise. As if you look at the chart in the deck, you saw that scrap prices during the month of May hit just north of $150 a ton. The average for the quarter was $1.38 (sic) [ $138 ], which is up from $91 in Q1. And we're back down to $115, right? And so if you look at the change last year from Q2 to Q3, we went from $140 a ton down to $123. And if you went to the Q3 script last year, that was $0.02 a share to the negative. So if you just replay that this year, there could be as much as $0.02. We're hoping it will be a little bit less just because we were on a consistent downward trend in scrap pricing last year. This year, it's only the 1 quarter tick up and then it looks like back down. So there's a chance it won't be quite a significant.

It's just under international reporting standards, right, you have different costs get reported in cost of goods sold as opposed to operating expense. So while the total doesn't change, it's just a shift higher gross margins and the offset is in operating expenses. We anticipated that Rhiag would be at like an 11% EBITDA margin. When we announced the transaction back in December, they were north of that. For the second quarter, there is seasonality to their business. As an example, there is a -- in their Italian business, there's 3 less working days in the back half of the year than the front half of the year. In the Czech Republic, there's 2 last days. And so the fourth quarter, which traditionally is a little bit softer in our European businesses, you're going to see that with Rhiag as well. So one key thing, and this is true with PGW as well is there have been no changes to the annual plans for either Rhiag or PGW. We are very confident that the accretion expectations that we set forth when we announced those transactions will absolutely occur. Again, there's a little bit of shift between the quarters with Q2 being a really good quarter for both those entities. And so the benefits will be a little bit less in Q3 and Q4.

But it seems like you're excited about and pleased how PGW performed in the last 2 months of the quarter since the end of April when you took it in your operations. Is it reasonable to assume by that, that you're seeing the parts and service business, kind of the traditional parts ex-glass, performed well in May and June, maybe better than what you saw in the first, call it, 4 months of the year? And I think it's hard to believe that the glass business could be doing really well and then the component part of the business not doing so well."

Again, we think our core North American business had a great quarter. I mean, the margins were up, gross margins were up, operating margins were up, profitability was up nicely. Yes, the organic growth was a little bit lower than, I think, was expected.

This morning, I will begin our review with a few high-level financial metrics followed by an update on our operating segments and some macro trends we witnessed in Q2. Nick will follow with a detailed overview of our financial performance. 
Turning to Slide 3. Q2 revenue reached a record $2.45 billion, an increase of 33.3% as compared to $1.84 billion in the second quarter of 2015. Net income for the second quarter of 2016 was $140.7 million, an increase of 17.6% as compared to $119.7 million for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, net income was $169.2 million, an increase of 34% as compared to the $126.3 million for the same period of 2015. 
Diluted earnings per share of $0.46 for Q2 increased 17.9% from $0.39 for the second quarter of 2015, while adjusted diluted EPS increased from $0.41 to $0.55, an increase of 34.1%. Nick will provide more specifics on these adjustments shortly. 
During the quarter, organic revenue growth for parts and services was a respectable 5.4%, despite facing tough year-over-year comps and a continuation of the challenging weather dynamics we faced in Q1 globally. 
Let's now turn to our North American operations. There is no doubt that the impact of the mild winter in Q1 continued into Q2 as collision claims were down in many states. According to CCC, total year-to-date collision claims were up only 2.3%. In addition, the U.S. market witnessed average temperatures well above historical levels, making year-to-date 2016 the third warmest on record with only 2012 and 2006 being warmer. Also, year-to-date precipitation was mixed across North America with key markets like Pennsylvania witnessing levels 17% below historical averages, while Colorado was 14% above. 
With that said, it's important to note that this impact was not consistent across North America. The geographic regions of Canada, the Northeast and the Midwest had declines in Q1 repairable claims and organic growth, and the metrics in these regions were soft again in Q2. Conversely, our Central and Southeast regions, which had nearly double-digit organic growth in Q1, continued that trend of solid organic growth in Q2. Despite the tough comp and the short-term challenges of weather and subsequent lower claims volume, North America delivered Q2 and year-to-date organic revenue growth for parts and services of 3.1% and 4%, respectively. 
During Q2, we purchased over 72,000 vehicles for dismantling by our North American wholesale operations, a 2.9% decrease over Q2 2015. Procurement costs at auction increased over Q2 2015 by 2.7%, but again, we continue to buy a slightly younger vehicle year-over-year. 
For our North American aftermarket business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 9.6% and 16.8%, respectively, year-over-year and in the quarter. In addition, our North American operations improved gross margins during the quarter, which included 40 basis points of improvement from the aftermarket procurement initiatives implemented during 2016. 
And lastly, during the quarter, we added a top 10 carrier to our KEYS IQ proprietary aftermarket parts program. This carrier was a solid win for our North American team given this carrier was using aftermarket parts only on a limited basis. We expect to have the entire program fully deployed by November 1, 2016. 
In our self-service retail business during Q2, we acquired over 138,000 lower-cost self-service and crush-only cars, which is a 5.3% increase over Q2 2015. Similar to Q1, we increased our self-service procurement to take advantage of the favorable pricing for the higher-quality vehicles in this line of business. Nick will provide more details on scrap shortly. 
Turning to our ongoing intelligent parts solution initiative with CCC. During Q2, the revenue and number of aftermarket purchase orders processed through the CCC platform grew 91% and 66%, respectively, year-over-year. Briefly, I want to provide an update on our sales force effectiveness and route optimization productivity initiatives discussed on the last call. 
During the quarter, our sales force effectiveness efforts focused on increasing the level of outbound calls for sales rep, which increased from 17.2 to 18 per day, a 4% increase sequentially from Q1 to Q2 2016. In addition, in June, we launched an add-on sales program to drive incremental sales per order with a specific group of SKUs. The early results of this launch are encouraging, with some of the SKUs in the program doubling in sales. Though the dollar increase in sales from this program are minimal, the intent is to instill discipline in our sales force to continuously focus on selling deeper into every customer and every order. 
Also during the quarter, we continue to make great strides with the implementation of Roadnet, the Tier 1 provider we selected for the technology component of our route optimization efforts. At the end of Q2, our current utilization rate with Roadnet reached 80%, accounting for over 3,400 vehicles, driving over 285,000 miles and making over 42,000 stops on a daily basis. Thus far, with this initiative, our focus has been to introduce our operations through the use of Roadnet. Once we have reached full installation by year end, we will begin the arduous task of assessing all the opportunities that exist across our networks and fleet. Combined, this should generate operational efficiencies and incremental margin within our North American business. 
Now moving to our European operations. In Q2, our Europe segment had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 8% and acquisition growth of 57.5% primarily related to Rhiag, which were offset by a decrease of 3.7% related to foreign exchange rates. 
During Q2, ECP drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 9.6%. And for branches opened more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 7.8%. I am pleased with this growth given the extremely wet weather conditions in the quarter. According to the U.K. Met Office, June was the 11th wettest since 1910, which had a slight impact on road travel in the midst of a normal busy driving season. During the quarter, ECP opened 7 new branches, bringing our network to 206 branches. 
During Q2, collision part sales of ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 18.2%. Also during the quarter, ECP collision entered into a parts agreement with CRN, or the Car Repair Network, a nationwide network of over 170 repairers, that combined, are responsible for over 18,000 repairs per year. In addition to CRN, we successfully achieved approval status for the supply of parts to the largest U.K. repair group, Nationwide Action Repair Centres [ph] , following a successful tender process. 
And lastly on ECP, I'd like to note that while the U.K. referendum to leave the EU has created some near-term uncertainty that negatively impacted its currency, we do expect that people will largely continue to drive their vehicles. As most of you are aware, the demand for the parts we sell in Europe are related to the total miles driven and the average age of cars on the road, neither of which should be directly impacted by the results of the referendum. And frankly, in tough economic times, the value proposition of alternative parts becomes more attractive. Nick will provide additional color on the referendum impact shortly. 
And now turning to our Sator business. During Q2, Sator had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 4.4%. Also as mentioned on our Q1 call, our investments in 2014 and 2015 continue to drive margin improvements at Sator, with Q2 recording the highest gross and EBITDA margins achieved since acquiring the business in May of 2013. 
And now an update on Rhiag. Q2 was the first full quarter of ownership of Rhiag. Overall, Rhiag tracked in line with our expectation and is executing on its growth initiatives. Since we acquired Rhiag in March, it has added 11 new branch locations to the network. 
We have been very busy with the integration, with our teams focused on the purchasing functions. As I speak, we are keenly focused on gathering the necessary data and putting in place the communication lines to achieve the targeted synergies for building a sustainable pan-European procurement function. As an example, we have learned that Rhiag has certain branded products that ECP will be able to distribute, allowing ECP to augment or replace some of its existing suppliers. Not only will this example reduce the number of vendors and the complexity associated with the current suppliers in the U.K, but it will also improve margins. 
With that said, we continue to believe that we are well along and on the right path to building a company that's unique, that will have benefit from our scale and common ownership to create a leading position through all of Europe. 
Now on to our Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment continued its strong performance by posting year-over-year total revenue growth of 18.5% in the quarter, including the benefits of the Coast acquisition and strong organic revenue growth of 8%. This continued solid organic growth is largely due to the expansion of our Specialty delivery routes, the integration of the Coast business on to our existing delivery fleet, expanded warehouse service levels, a strong SAAR and enhanced inventory offerings. And lastly, Specialty continued their integration activities from the Coast acquisition by consolidating additional Coast distribution centers into our existing network. At the end of Q2, only 4 of the 17 original Coast warehouses were in operation. 
As previously mentioned, on April 21, 2016, the company closed its acquisition of PGW, a leading global distributor and manufacturer of automotive glass products. With this acquisition, we now have a new reporting segment that Nick will cover further. 
Regarding their operations, during the quarter, the PGW team secured a manufacturer renewal agreement for an existing OE platform with a new model launch, and also a 1-year renewal contract with a large North American MSO for their ARG business. 
In addition to the PGW acquisition during the second quarter of 2016, LKQ acquired a distributor of aftermarket automotive products in Belgium. 
At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more details and perspective on our financial results and our updated 2016 guidance."
4303924,374711702,1015938,"LKQ Corp., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","LKQ Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everybody on the call. I am delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter.

I am delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter. And over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of our 4 segments during the second quarter before touching on the balance sheet and then addressing our revised guidance for 2016. 
The short version of our financial performance in Q2 of 2016 is that we had a terrific quarter, and taken as a whole, performed ahead of our expectations. While the revenue growth in North America was a bit behind expectations, the margins in this segment were very strong. In addition, the European operations performed well, the 2 big acquisitions were slightly above target, and we finally got a small boost from a sequential increase in scrap steel prices. 
To refresh everyone's memory, Rhiag closed in late March and was included for the full quarter, while PGW closed in late April and contributed for only 10 weeks. 
As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the second quarter of 2016 was $2.45 billion, representing a 33% increase over last year. That reflects a 36.8% increase in revenue from parts and services, partially offset by an 11.2% decrease in other revenue. The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 5.4% from organic, plus 32.8% from acquisitions for a constant currency growth of 38.2% before backing out the translation impact of FX, which was a 1.4% decline. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each business as I walk through the segment results. 
As noted on Page 11 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins declined 180 basis points to 37.6% due entirely to the impact of the acquisitions. You will recall that when we initially announced the transactions, we highlighted the fact that both Rhiag and PGW have a lower gross margins than our historical businesses. Excluding the 2 big acquisitions, gross margins were actually up by about 70 basis points during the quarter. 
While consolidated gross margins were down, consolidated operating expenses as a percent of revenue were also about 160 basis points below last year. Some of that reflects the impact of the different margin structure of the 2 acquisitions and some of it reflects improved efficiencies in the historical businesses. 
Segment EBITDA totaled $319 million for the quarter, reflecting a 37% increase from 2015. As a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 13%, a 30 basis points increase over the 12.7% recorded last year. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced an increase in restructuring cost primarily related to expenses connected with the integration of our Specialty acquisitions. 
Depreciation and amortization was up almost $23 million, most all of which related to the impact of the 2 big acquisitions. The same holds true for interest expense, which was up by about $12 million. 
With that, pretax income increased 16% over last year. 
Our effective tax rate during the second quarter was 34.75%, down from the 34.85% in 2015 and consistent with the annual guidance we provided in April.
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.46, which was up 18% compared to the $0.39 reported last year. Adjusted EPS, which is before restructuring charges, the loss on debt extinguishment, the hedging gain, intangible asset amortization and a noncash inventory step-up adjustment related to the PGW acquisition, was $0.55 a share versus $0.41, reflecting a 34% improvement. 
As mentioned, the impact of scrap was a bit of a tailwind in the quarter and actually helped earnings per share by about $0.02. Currency fluctuations negatively impacted earnings per share by about $0.01 during the second quarter. And we anticipate that currencies will have a bigger negative impact in the back half of the year given the devaluation of the pound sterling following the Brexit vote.
As highlighted on Page 13, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to varying growth rates of our different businesses and the impact of acquisitions. Since each of our segments has a different margin structure, this mix shift impacts the trend in consolidated margins. This became more accentuated now that we have closed both Rhiag and PGW, and you saw a shift in the second quarter metrics wherein North American parts and services revenue accounted for less than 40% of the consolidated total. 
And with that, let's get on to the details of the operating segments. Revenue in our North American segment during the second quarter of 2016 increased to $1,081,000,000 or a 3.4% increase over 2015. This is the combination of a 5.6% growth rate in parts and services, offset by 11.4% decline in other revenue, the latter of which was due primarily to the sale of our precious metals business at the end of Q2 of last year and lower prices received for other metals, such as aluminum, platinum, palladium and rhodium relative to Q2 of last year. The 5.6% growth in North American parts and services was the combination of 3.1% organic growth and 2.8% acquisition growth, offset by a 30 basis point FX decline due to the weakness of the Canadian dollar. 
There is no doubt that the impact of the mild winter had a bleedover impact on our Q2 revenue. According to CCC, repairable collision claims were down on a year-over-year basis in many of the big population Snowbelt states, including Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois. Collision parts simply don't sell as well when accident frequency is down. As Rob mentioned, this was not consistent across North America, as our Central and Southeast regions, which had excellent organic growth in Q1, continued to report above-average organic growth in Q2.
Gross margins in North America during the second quarter were 44.1%, a 170 basis point increase over 2015. The benefits of the procurement initiatives started to manifest themselves in Q2 and the lower cost of aftermarket inventory added approximately 40 basis points of improvement to the gross margin of our overall North American operations. 
Salvage also experienced a slight increase in gross margins, while our self-service operations contributed a 110 basis point increase to North American gross margins, largely reflecting the sequential improvement in scrap steel pricing. You will note that scrap spiked in May, reaching over $150 per ton, but has reversed course and were now back down into the low $100 range.
With respect to operating expenses in our North American segment, we gained about 30 basis points of margin compared to the comparable quarter of last year, reflecting improvements in both the wholesale and self-service operations. On the upside, we continued to experience improvements in both fuel and facility costs relative to last year, but on the downside, we lost a bit of margin related to freight expense. In total, EBITDA for the North American business during the second quarter was $164 million. And as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the North American segment was 15.2% in Q2 of this year, up 190 basis points from the 13.3% reported in the comparable period of the prior year. 
You will recall that in Q1, we indicated that we expected the benefit from our productivity initiatives to pick up as we move through the year. As just mentioned, we saw some benefit in our cost of goods sold related to the procurement savings of our aftermarket parts inventory. In addition, there are procurement benefits in many other expense categories across North America. The route optimization effort is now rolled out across 80% of the country, and we anticipate we will begin to see the positive impact of that program begin to accrue over the next few quarters. In total, we estimate that the aggregate benefit of the productivity initiatives during the second quarter was approximately $0.01 a share. 
Moving on to our European segment. Total revenue in the second quarter accelerated to $824 million, up from $510 million, a 62% increase. Organic growth for parts and services in Europe during the second quarter was 8%, reflecting the combination of 9.6% growth at ECP, 4.4% growth at Sator and 9.9% in Sweden. The impact of the acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 58% increase in revenue with most -- with the most significant amount reflecting the addition of Rhiag. So on a constant currency basis, European parts and services revenue was up 66%. 
These gains were offset by a 4% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, particularly relative to the pound sterling. As you can see on Page 19, the average rate during the quarter for the sterling was about 6% below last year and it fell an incremental 7% to about $1.33 at quarter end due to the Brexit vote. More recently, the sterling has been down further to about $1.30 to $1.31. The translation impact of this will absolutely weigh on a reported U.S. dollar results for the rest of the year, probably to the tune of $0.01 in each of the third and fourth quarters. 
Gross margins in Europe were 37.4%, a 50 basis point decline from the comparable period of 2015, largely reflecting the impact of Rhiag. Excluding the impact of Rhiag, gross margins in Europe increased 100 basis points as we continue to benefit from improved procurement in the U.K. and the internalization of the gross margin from our acquisitions in the Netherlands. 
As we mentioned when we announced the Rhiag acquisition back in December, given the 3-step distribution model in Italy and Switzerland, Rhiag has a lower gross margin structure than either ECP or Sator. The impact was not as significant as initially anticipated, however, and after mapping Rhiag's general ledger accounts to LKQ's chartered accounts and completing the conversion from IFRS to U.S. GAAP, Rhiag had gross margins of about 34.6% during the second quarter. With respect to operating expenses as a percent of revenue, we experienced a 60 basis point improvement on a consolidated European basis. We benefited from 170 basis point reduction in operating expense due to the addition of Rhiag, which has lower operating expenses as a percent of revenue than either ECP or Sator. We also saw about a 40 basis point improvement in SG&A expense as a percent of revenue primarily at ECP. Offsetting these gains was a 140 basis point increase in facility and warehouse expense.
As you will recall, we started paying rent and related property cost on the new distribution facility in Tamworth, England in February. 
The incremental costs related to this project in Q2 were approximately GBP 2.2 million or about $3.2 million, which reflects a 40 basis point increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue for Europe. We were also impacted by new branches and hubs at ECP and an increase in warehouse personnel at Sator related to new product introductions. 
European EBITDA totaled $90 million, a 67% increase over last year, reflecting solid performance at ECP and Sator and the positive impact of Rhiag. Excluding the negative impact of FX rates, constant currency EBITDA growth in Europe was 71%. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA for the second quarter of 2016 was 10.9% versus 10.6% last year, a 30 basis point improvement, even after taking into account the impact of the T2 project.
Turning to our Specialty segment. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $337 million, a 19% increase over the comparable quarter of 2015. The organic growth rate of 8% was quite strong, while the impact of the Coast acquisition in August of 2015 added 11% to revenue growth.
Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the second quarter decreased about 160 basis points compared to last year, largely due to the impact of stocking 2 new Specialty distribution centers in Michigan and Washington State which were not in operation at this time last year, as well as increased customer volume rebates associated with the higher sales levels. 
Operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were up about 30 basis points. Facility expense increased due to certain costs related to the 2 new distribution centers mentioned a bit ago. On the plus side, we continued to see the SG&A leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing network as well as the benefit of the lower fuel prices. 
EBITDA for the Specialty segment was $42 million, up 4% from Q2 of 2015. And as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment decreased 170 basis points to 12.4% in 2016 compared to 14.1% last year. Remember, this is a highly seasonal business and you should assume these margins will moderate as we move through the back half of the year. 
On Page 22, you can see the impact of the acquisition of PGW. Revenue for the quarter was $210 million, which again reflects 10 weeks of activity. You should note, Q2 tends to be a very strong quarter for PGW. Gross margins were 18.4%, but this included a onetime noncash charge of $10 million reflecting the write-off of inventory. You may recall that on the Q1 call, I mentioned that under U.S. GAAP, we had to mark the closing date inventory of PGW off to the market value, and this increase would get amortized as a noncash expense as we turn the inventory. We anticipated an $8 million to $12 million charge, and it came right in the middle at $10 million. It doesn't affect our adjusted net income or adjusted EPS, but it was a onetime hit to gross margin, diluted net income and diluted EPS during the quarter. Excluding this onetime noncash item, the gross margin at PGW would have been 23.3%, which is generally consistent with the expectations we highlighted at the time the transaction was announced. EBITDA margins for PGW were 11.1%, slightly higher than the annual level mentioned when we announced the transaction, largely reflecting the seasonality of the business, as Q2 tends to be relatively strong. 
Let's move on to capital allocation. As presented on Slide 23, you will note that our after-tax cash flow from operations during the first 6 months was approximately $355 million as we experienced strong cash earnings and only a moderate increase in working capital. During the first 6 months of 2016, we deployed a little more than $1.9 billion of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $102 million to fund the capital expenditures and almost $1.8 billion to fund the acquisitions. 
The acquisitions of Rhiag and PGW were financed by drawing down on our line of credit and the completion of a euro note offering back in April. We closed the quarter with approximately $273 million of cash, of which $196 million was held outside of the United States. And we had slightly more than $3.3 billion of total debt outstanding. So our net debt was approximately $3.1 billion. And on a pro forma basis, taking into account the impact of the acquisitions, our leverage ratio was about 2.8x latest 12-month EBITDA. At quarter end, total availability under our credit facility was approximately $1.1 billion, which we believe is sufficient to support the continued growth of our businesses. 
Finally, as you noted in the press release, we have provided updated guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2016. Again, Rhiag closed on March 18 and PGW on April 21, so we will record a tad more than 9 months and 8 months of their respective results in 2016. As it relates to the organic growth for parts and services, we slightly reduced the guidance for 2016 to 5.5% to 7.0%, reflecting the softness in the North American year-to-date results following the mild winter. Our range for adjusted EPS, which excludes the after-tax impact of intangible amortization, is now $1.79 to $1.87 per share with a midpoint of $1.83. The increase from the previous midpoint of $1.81 reflects the better-than-expected Q2 results, partially offset by anticipated headwinds from the currencies in the back half of the year, particularly the pound sterling, lower scrap steel prices than experienced in Q2, and the better appreciation for the seasonality of the 2 new acquisitions, particularly related to typical Q4 slowdowns. 
The new EPS guidance assumes the pound sterling and euro exchange rates of $1.30 and $1.10, respectively, and importantly, that scrap remains at current levels as well. Our assumed tax rate for 2016 remains constant at 34.75%. Our current guidance for cash flow from operations is up a bit to approximately $585 million to $635 million, and the guidance for capital spending is unchanged. 
At this point, I will return the call back over to Rob to wrap up."

On scrap, whereas we got $0.02 to the positive in the second quarter, that was an unexpected surprise. As if you look at the chart in the deck, you saw that scrap prices during the month of May hit just north of $150 a ton. The average for the quarter was $1.38 (sic) [ $138 ], which is up from $91 in Q1. And we're back down to $115, right? And so if you look at the change last year from Q2 to Q3, we went from $140 a ton down to $123. And if you went to the Q3 script last year, that was $0.02 a share to the negative. So if you just replay that this year, there could be as much as $0.02. We're hoping it will be a little bit less just because we were on a consistent downward trend in scrap pricing last year. This year, it's only the 1 quarter tick up and then it looks like back down. So there's a chance it won't be quite as significant.

When we announced the transaction back in December, they were north of that. For the second quarter, there is seasonality to their business. As an example, there is a -- in their Italian business, there's 3 less working days in the back half of the year than the front half of the year. In the Czech Republic, there's 2 less days. And so the fourth quarter, which traditionally is a little bit softer in our European businesses, you're going to see that with Rhiag as well. So one key thing, and this is true with PGW as well, is there have been no changes to the annual plans for either Rhiag or PGW. We are very confident that the accretion expectations that we set forth when we announced those transactions will absolutely occur.

This morning, I will begin our review with a few high-level financial metrics followed by an update on our operating segments and some macro trends we witnessed in Q2. Nick will follow with a detailed overview of our financial performance. 
Turning to Slide 3. Q2 revenue reached a record $2.45 billion, an increase of 33.3% as compared to $1.84 billion in the second quarter of 2015. Net income for the second quarter of 2016 was $140.7 million, an increase of 17.6% as compared to $119.7 million for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, net income was $169.2 million, an increase of 34% as compared to the $126.3 million for the same period of 2015. 
Diluted earnings per share of $0.46 for Q2 increased 17.9% from $0.39 for the second quarter of 2015, while adjusted diluted EPS increased from $0.41 to $0.55, an increase of 34.1%. Nick will provide more specifics on these adjustments shortly. 
During the quarter, organic revenue growth for parts and services was a respectable 5.4%, despite facing tough year-over-year comps and a continuation of the challenging weather dynamics we faced in Q1 globally. 
Let's now turn to our North American operations. There is no doubt that the impact of the mild winter in Q1 continued into Q2 as collision claims were down in many states. According to CCC, total year-to-date collision claims were up only 2.3%. In addition, the U.S. market witnessed average temperatures well above historical levels, making year-to-date 2016 the third warmest on record with only 2012 and 2006 being warmer. Also, year-to-date precipitation was mixed across North America with key markets like Pennsylvania witnessing levels 17% below historical averages, while Colorado was 14% above. 
With that said, it's important to note that this impact was not consistent across North America. The geographic regions of Canada, the Northeast and the Midwest had declines in Q1 repairable claims and organic growth, and the metrics in these regions were soft again in Q2. Conversely, our Central and Southeast regions, which had nearly double-digit organic growth in Q1, continued that trend of solid organic growth in Q2. Despite the tough comp and the short-term challenges of weather and subsequent lower claims volume, North America delivered Q2 and year-to-date organic revenue growth for parts and services of 3.1% and 4%, respectively. 
During Q2, we purchased over 72,000 vehicles for dismantling by our North American wholesale operations, a 2.9% decrease over Q2 2015. Procurement costs at auction increased over Q2 2015 by 2.7%, but again, we continue to buy a slightly younger vehicle year-over-year. 
For our North American aftermarket business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 9.6% and 16.8%, respectively, year-over-year and in the quarter. In addition, our North American operations improved gross margins during the quarter, which included 40 basis points of improvement from the aftermarket procurement initiatives implemented during 2016. 
And lastly, during the quarter, we added a top 10 carrier to our KEYS IQ proprietary aftermarket parts program. This carrier was a solid win for our North American team given this carrier was using aftermarket parts only on a limited basis. We expect to have the entire program fully deployed by November 1, 2016. 
In our self-service retail business during Q2, we acquired over 138,000 lower-cost self-service and crush-only cars, which is a 5.3% increase over Q2 2015. Similar to Q1, we increased our self-service procurement to take advantage of the favorable pricing for the higher-quality vehicles in this line of business. Nick will provide more details on scrap shortly. 
Turning to our ongoing intelligent parts solution initiative with CCC. During Q2, the revenue and number of aftermarket purchase orders processed through the CCC platform grew 91% and 66%, respectively, year-over-year. Briefly, I want to provide an update on our sales force effectiveness and route optimization productivity initiatives discussed on the last call. 
During the quarter, our sales force effectiveness efforts focused on increasing the level of outbound calls for sales rep, which increased from 17.2 to 18 per day, a 4% increase sequentially from Q1 to Q2 2016. In addition, in June, we launched an add-on sales program to drive incremental sales per order with a specific group of SKUs. The early results of this launch are encouraging, with some of the SKUs in the program doubling in sales. Though the dollar increase in sales from this program are minimal, the intent is to instill discipline in our sales force to continuously focus on selling deeper into every customer and every order. 
Also during the quarter, we continue to make great strides with the implementation of Roadnet, the Tier 1 provider we selected for the technology component of our route optimization efforts. At the end of Q2, our current utilization rate with Roadnet reached 80%, accounting for over 3,400 vehicles, driving over 285,000 miles and making over 42,000 stops on a daily basis. Thus far, with this initiative, our focus has been to introduce our operations through the use of Roadnet. Once we have reached full installation by year end, we will begin the arduous task of assessing all the opportunities that exist across our networks and fleet. Combined, this should generate operational efficiencies and incremental margin within our North American business. 
Now moving to our European operations. In Q2, our Europe segment had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 8% and acquisition growth of 57.5% primarily related to Rhiag, which were offset by a decrease of 3.7% related to foreign exchange rates. 
During Q2, ECP drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 9.6%. And for branches opened more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 7.8%. I am pleased with this growth given the extremely wet weather conditions in the quarter. According to the U.K. Met Office, June was the 11th wettest since 1910, which had a slight impact on road travel in the midst of a normal busy driving season. During the quarter, ECP opened 7 new branches, bringing our network to 206 branches. 
During Q2, collision part sales of ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 18.2%. Also during the quarter, ECP collision entered into a parts agreement with CRN, or the Car Repair Network, a nationwide network of over 170 repairers, that combined, are responsible for over 18,000 repairs per year. In addition to CRN, we successfully achieved approval status for the supply of parts to the largest U.K. repair group, Nationwide Action Repair Centres [ph] , following a successful tender process. 
And lastly on ECP, I'd like to note that while the U.K. referendum to leave the EU has created some near-term uncertainty that negatively impacted its currency, we do expect that people will largely continue to drive their vehicles. As most of you are aware, the demand for the parts we sell in Europe are related to the total miles driven and the average age of cars on the road, neither of which should be directly impacted by the results of the referendum. And frankly, in tough economic times, the value proposition of alternative parts becomes more attractive. Nick will provide additional color on the referendum impact shortly. 
And now turning to our Sator business. During Q2, Sator had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 4.4%. Also as mentioned on our Q1 call, our investments in 2014 and 2015 continue to drive margin improvements at Sator, with Q2 recording the highest gross and EBITDA margins achieved since acquiring the business in May of 2013. 
And now an update on Rhiag. Q2 was the first full quarter of ownership of Rhiag. Overall, Rhiag tracked in line with our expectation and is executing on its growth initiatives. Since we acquired Rhiag in March, it has added 11 new branch locations to the network. 
We have been very busy with the integration, with our teams focused on the purchasing functions. As I speak, we are keenly focused on gathering the necessary data and putting in place the communication lines to achieve the targeted synergies for building a sustainable pan-European procurement function. As an example, we have learned that Rhiag has certain branded products that ECP will be able to distribute, allowing ECP to augment or replace some of its existing suppliers. Not only will this example reduce the number of vendors and the complexity associated with the current suppliers in the U.K, but it will also improve margins. 
With that said, we continue to believe that we are well along and on the right path to building a company that's unique, that will have benefit from our scale and common ownership to create a leading position through all of Europe. 
Now on to our Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment continued its strong performance by posting year-over-year total revenue growth of 18.5% in the quarter, including the benefits of the Coast acquisition and strong organic revenue growth of 8%. This continued solid organic growth is largely due to the expansion of our Specialty delivery routes, the integration of the Coast business on to our existing delivery fleet, expanded warehouse service levels, a strong SAAR and enhanced inventory offerings. And lastly, Specialty continued their integration activities from the Coast acquisition by consolidating additional Coast distribution centers into our existing network. At the end of Q2, only 4 of the 17 original Coast warehouses were in operation. 
As previously mentioned, on April 21, 2016, the company closed its acquisition of PGW, a leading global distributor and manufacturer of automotive glass products. With this acquisition, we now have a new reporting segment that Nick will cover further. 
Regarding their operations, during the quarter, the PGW team secured a manufacturer renewal agreement for an existing OE platform with a new model launch, and also a 1-year renewal contract with a large North American MSO for their ARG business. 
In addition to the PGW acquisition during the second quarter of 2016, LKQ acquired a distributor of aftermarket automotive products in Belgium. 
At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more details and perspective on our financial results and our updated 2016 guidance."
4303924,374711702,1016595,"LKQ Corp., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","LKQ Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everybody on the call. I am delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter. And over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of ou",2775,"Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everybody on the call. I am delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter. And over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of our 4 segments during the second quarter before touching on the balance sheet and then addressing our revised guidance for 2016. 
The short version of our financial performance in Q2 of 2016 is that we had a terrific quarter, and taken as a whole, performed ahead of our expectations. While the revenue growth in North America was a bit behind expectations, the margins in this segment were very strong. In addition, the European operations performed well, the 2 big acquisitions were slightly above target, and we finally got a small boost from a sequential increase in scrap steel prices. 
To refresh everyone's memory, Rhiag closed in late March and was included for the full quarter, while PGW closed in late April and contributed for only 10 weeks. 
As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the second quarter of 2016 was $2.45 billion, representing a 33% increase over last year. That reflects a 36.8% increase in revenue from parts and services, partially offset by an 11.2% decrease in other revenue. The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 5.4% from organic, plus 32.8% from acquisitions for a constant currency growth of 38.2% before backing out the translation impact of FX, which was a 1.4% decline. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each business as I walk through the segment results. 
As noted on Page 11 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins declined 180 basis points to 37.6% due entirely to the impact of the acquisitions. You will recall that when we initially announced the transactions, we highlighted the fact that both Rhiag and PGW have a lower gross margins than our historical businesses. Excluding the 2 big acquisitions, gross margins were actually up by about 70 basis points during the quarter. 
While consolidated gross margins were down, consolidated operating expenses as a percent of revenue were also about 160 basis points below last year. Some of that reflects the impact of the different margin structure of the 2 acquisitions and some of it reflects improved efficiencies in the historical businesses. 
Segment EBITDA totaled $319 million for the quarter, reflecting a 37% increase from 2015. As a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 13%, a 30 basis points increase over the 12.7% recorded last year. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced an increase in restructuring cost primarily related to expenses connected with the integration of our Specialty acquisitions. 
Depreciation and amortization was up almost $23 million, most all of which related to the impact of the 2 big acquisitions. The same holds true for interest expense, which was up by about $12 million. 
With that, pretax income increased 16% over last year. 
Our effective tax rate during the second quarter was 34.75%, down from the 34.85% in 2015 and consistent with the annual guidance we provided in April.
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.46, which was up 18% compared to the $0.39 reported last year. Adjusted EPS, which is before restructuring charges, the loss on debt extinguishment, the hedging gain, intangible asset amortization and a noncash inventory step-up adjustment related to the PGW acquisition, was $0.55 a share versus $0.41, reflecting a 34% improvement. 
As mentioned, the impact of scrap was a bit of a tailwind in the quarter and actually helped earnings per share by about $0.02. Currency fluctuations negatively impacted earnings per share by about $0.01 during the second quarter. And we anticipate that currencies will have a bigger negative impact in the back half of the year given the devaluation of the pound sterling following the Brexit vote.
As highlighted on Page 13, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to varying growth rates of our different businesses and the impact of acquisitions. Since each of our segments has a different margin structure, this mix shift impacts the trend in consolidated margins. This became more accentuated now that we have closed both Rhiag and PGW, and you saw a shift in the second quarter metrics wherein North American parts and services revenue accounted for less than 40% of the consolidated total. 
And with that, let's get on to the details of the operating segments. Revenue in our North American segment during the second quarter of 2016 increased to $1,081,000,000 or a 3.4% increase over 2015. This is the combination of a 5.6% growth rate in parts and services, offset by 11.4% decline in other revenue, the latter of which was due primarily to the sale of our precious metals business at the end of Q2 of last year and lower prices received for other metals, such as aluminum, platinum, palladium and rhodium relative to Q2 of last year. The 5.6% growth in North American parts and services was the combination of 3.1% organic growth and 2.8% acquisition growth, offset by a 30 basis point FX decline due to the weakness of the Canadian dollar. 
There is no doubt that the impact of the mild winter had a bleedover impact on our Q2 revenue. According to CCC, repairable collision claims were down on a year-over-year basis in many of the big population Snowbelt states, including Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois. Collision parts simply don't sell as well when accident frequency is down. As Rob mentioned, this was not consistent across North America, as our Central and Southeast regions, which had excellent organic growth in Q1, continued to report above-average organic growth in Q2.
Gross margins in North America during the second quarter were 44.1%, a 170 basis point increase over 2015. The benefits of the procurement initiatives started to manifest themselves in Q2 and the lower cost of aftermarket inventory added approximately 40 basis points of improvement to the gross margin of our overall North American operations. 
Salvage also experienced a slight increase in gross margins, while our self-service operations contributed a 110 basis point increase to North American gross margins, largely reflecting the sequential improvement in scrap steel pricing. You will note that scrap spiked in May, reaching over $150 per ton, but has reversed course and were now back down into the low $100 range.
With respect to operating expenses in our North American segment, we gained about 30 basis points of margin compared to the comparable quarter of last year, reflecting improvements in both the wholesale and self-service operations. On the upside, we continued to experience improvements in both fuel and facility costs relative to last year, but on the downside, we lost a bit of margin related to freight expense. In total, EBITDA for the North American business during the second quarter was $164 million. And as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the North American segment was 15.2% in Q2 of this year, up 190 basis points from the 13.3% reported in the comparable period of the prior year. 
You will recall that in Q1, we indicated that we expected the benefit from our productivity initiatives to pick up as we move through the year. As just mentioned, we saw some benefit in our cost of goods sold related to the procurement savings of our aftermarket parts inventory. In addition, there are procurement benefits in many other expense categories across North America. The route optimization effort is now rolled out across 80% of the country, and we anticipate we will begin to see the positive impact of that program begin to accrue over the next few quarters. In total, we estimate that the aggregate benefit of the productivity initiatives during the second quarter was approximately $0.01 a share. 
Moving on to our European segment. Total revenue in the second quarter accelerated to $824 million, up from $510 million, a 62% increase. Organic growth for parts and services in Europe during the second quarter was 8%, reflecting the combination of 9.6% growth at ECP, 4.4% growth at Sator and 9.9% in Sweden. The impact of the acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 58% increase in revenue with most -- with the most significant amount reflecting the addition of Rhiag. So on a constant currency basis, European parts and services revenue was up 66%. 
These gains were offset by a 4% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, particularly relative to the pound sterling. As you can see on Page 19, the average rate during the quarter for the sterling was about 6% below last year and it fell an incremental 7% to about $1.33 at quarter end due to the Brexit vote. More recently, the sterling has been down further to about $1.30 to $1.31. The translation impact of this will absolutely weigh on a reported U.S. dollar results for the rest of the year, probably to the tune of $0.01 in each of the third and fourth quarters. 
Gross margins in Europe were 37.4%, a 50 basis point decline from the comparable period of 2015, largely reflecting the impact of Rhiag. Excluding the impact of Rhiag, gross margins in Europe increased 100 basis points as we continue to benefit from improved procurement in the U.K. and the internalization of the gross margin from our acquisitions in the Netherlands. 
As we mentioned when we announced the Rhiag acquisition back in December, given the 3-step distribution model in Italy and Switzerland, Rhiag has a lower gross margin structure than either ECP or Sator. The impact was not as significant as initially anticipated, however, and after mapping Rhiag's general ledger accounts to LKQ's chartered accounts and completing the conversion from IFRS to U.S. GAAP, Rhiag had gross margins of about 34.6% during the second quarter. With respect to operating expenses as a percent of revenue, we experienced a 60 basis point improvement on a consolidated European basis. We benefited from 170 basis point reduction in operating expense due to the addition of Rhiag, which has lower operating expenses as a percent of revenue than either ECP or Sator. We also saw about a 40 basis point improvement in SG&A expense as a percent of revenue primarily at ECP. Offsetting these gains was a 140 basis point increase in facility and warehouse expense.
As you will recall, we started paying rent and related property cost on the new distribution facility in Tamworth, England in February. 
The incremental costs related to this project in Q2 were approximately GBP 2.2 million or about $3.2 million, which reflects a 40 basis point increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue for Europe. We were also impacted by new branches and hubs at ECP and an increase in warehouse personnel at Sator related to new product introductions. 
European EBITDA totaled $90 million, a 67% increase over last year, reflecting solid performance at ECP and Sator and the positive impact of Rhiag. Excluding the negative impact of FX rates, constant currency EBITDA growth in Europe was 71%. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA for the second quarter of 2016 was 10.9% versus 10.6% last year, a 30 basis point improvement, even after taking into account the impact of the T2 project.
Turning to our Specialty segment. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $337 million, a 19% increase over the comparable quarter of 2015. The organic growth rate of 8% was quite strong, while the impact of the Coast acquisition in August of 2015 added 11% to revenue growth.
Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the second quarter decreased about 160 basis points compared to last year, largely due to the impact of stocking 2 new Specialty distribution centers in Michigan and Washington State which were not in operation at this time last year, as well as increased customer volume rebates associated with the higher sales levels. 
Operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were up about 30 basis points. Facility expense increased due to certain costs related to the 2 new distribution centers mentioned a bit ago. On the plus side, we continued to see the SG&A leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing network as well as the benefit of the lower fuel prices. 
EBITDA for the Specialty segment was $42 million, up 4% from Q2 of 2015. And as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment decreased 170 basis points to 12.4% in 2016 compared to 14.1% last year. Remember, this is a highly seasonal business and you should assume these margins will moderate as we move through the back half of the year. 
On Page 22, you can see the impact of the acquisition of PGW. Revenue for the quarter was $210 million, which again reflects 10 weeks of activity. You should note, Q2 tends to be a very strong quarter for PGW. Gross margins were 18.4%, but this included a onetime noncash charge of $10 million reflecting the write-off of inventory. You may recall that on the Q1 call, I mentioned that under U.S. GAAP, we had to mark the closing date inventory of PGW off to the market value, and this increase would get amortized as a noncash expense as we turn the inventory. We anticipated an $8 million to $12 million charge, and it came right in the middle at $10 million. It doesn't affect our adjusted net income or adjusted EPS, but it was a onetime hit to gross margin, diluted net income and diluted EPS during the quarter. Excluding this onetime noncash item, the gross margin at PGW would have been 23.3%, which is generally consistent with the expectations we highlighted at the time the transaction was announced. EBITDA margins for PGW were 11.1%, slightly higher than the annual level mentioned when we announced the transaction, largely reflecting the seasonality of the business, as Q2 tends to be relatively strong. 
Let's move on to capital allocation. As presented on Slide 23, you will note that our after-tax cash flow from operations during the first 6 months was approximately $355 million as we experienced strong cash earnings and only a moderate increase in working capital. During the first 6 months of 2016, we deployed a little more than $1.9 billion of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $102 million to fund the capital expenditures and almost $1.8 billion to fund the acquisitions. 
The acquisitions of Rhiag and PGW were financed by drawing down on our line of credit and the completion of a euro note offering back in April. We closed the quarter with approximately $273 million of cash, of which $196 million was held outside of the United States. And we had slightly more than $3.3 billion of total debt outstanding. So our net debt was approximately $3.1 billion. And on a pro forma basis, taking into account the impact of the acquisitions, our leverage ratio was about 2.8x latest 12-month EBITDA. At quarter end, total availability under our credit facility was approximately $1.1 billion, which we believe is sufficient to support the continued growth of our businesses. 
Finally, as you noted in the press release, we have provided updated guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2016. Again, Rhiag closed on March 18 and PGW on April 21, so we will record a tad more than 9 months and 8 months of their respective results in 2016. As it relates to the organic growth for parts and services, we slightly reduced the guidance for 2016 to 5.5% to 7.0%, reflecting the softness in the North American year-to-date results following the mild winter. Our range for adjusted EPS, which excludes the after-tax impact of intangible amortization, is now $1.79 to $1.87 per share with a midpoint of $1.83. The increase from the previous midpoint of $1.81 reflects the better-than-expected Q2 results, partially offset by anticipated headwinds from the currencies in the back half of the year, particularly the pound sterling, lower scrap steel prices than experienced in Q2, and the better appreciation for the seasonality of the 2 new acquisitions, particularly related to typical Q4 slowdowns. 
The new EPS guidance assumes the pound sterling and euro exchange rates of $1.30 and $1.10, respectively, and importantly, that scrap remains at current levels as well. Our assumed tax rate for 2016 remains constant at 34.75%. Our current guidance for cash flow from operations is up a bit to approximately $585 million to $635 million, and the guidance for capital spending is unchanged. 
At this point, I will return the call back over to Rob to wrap up."

We were very strong in the South and the Central regions. And the Rust Belt -- the winter belt was very, very light. And it really matched up almost identical with what CCC gave us for claims. One other thing that CCC pointed out to us was pretty interesting. A later-model car is being repaired now, which is a little bit of a headwind at first because, obviously, newer cars will get new parts. There aren't a lot of used parts for the stream yet as well as aftermarket parts for that matter. So we are expecting, when that sweet spot moves our way, we are expecting to see more growth in our -- for those type of products because there'll just be much more demand.

On scrap, whereas we got $0.02 to the positive in the second quarter, that was an unexpected surprise. As if you look at the chart in the deck, you saw that scrap prices during the month of May hit just north of $150 a ton. The average for the quarter was $1.38 (sic) [ $138 ], which is up from $91 in Q1. And we're back down to $115, right? And so if you look at the change last year from Q2 to Q3, we went from $140 a ton down to $123. And if you went to the Q3 script last year, that was $0.02 a share to the negative. So if you just replay that this year, there could be as much as $0.02. We're hoping it will be a little bit less just because we were on a consistent downward trend in scrap pricing last year. This year, it's only the 1 quarter tick up and then it looks like back down. So there's a chance it won't be quite as significant.

It's just under international reporting standards, right, you have different costs get reported in cost of goods sold as opposed to operating expense. So while the total doesn't change, it's just a shift, higher gross margins and the offset is in operating expenses. We anticipated that Rhiag would be at like an 11% EBITDA margin. When we announced the transaction back in December, they were north of that. For the second quarter, there is seasonality to their business. As an example, there is a -- in their Italian business, there's 3 less working days in the back half of the year than the front half of the year. In the Czech Republic, there's 2 less days. And so the fourth quarter, which traditionally is a little bit softer in our European businesses, you're going to see that with Rhiag as well. So one key thing, and this is true with PGW as well, is there have been no changes to the annual plans for either Rhiag or PGW. We are very confident that the accretion expectations that we set forth when we announced those transactions will absolutely occur. Again, there's a little bit of shift between the quarters with Q2 being a really good quarter for both those entities. And so the benefits will be a little bit less in Q3 and Q4.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us on the call today. This morning, I will begin our review with a few high-level financial metrics followed by an update on our operating segments and some macro trends we witnessed in Q3.

This morning, I will begin our review with a few high-level financial metrics followed by an update on our operating segments and some macro trends we witnessed in Q3. Nick will follow with a detailed overview of our financial performance. 
Turning to Slide 3. Q3 revenue reached $2.39 billion, an increase of 30.3% as compared to $1.83 billion in the third quarter of 2015. Net income for the third quarter of 2016 was $122.7 million, an increase of 21.1% as compared to $101.3 million for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, net income was $139.3 million, an increase of 26.8% as compared to $109.9 million for the same period of 2015. 
Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.40, an increase of 21.2% as compared to the $0.33 for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share was $0.45 in the third quarter of 2016, reflecting a 25% increase over $0.36 for the same period of 2015. 
During the quarter, we continue to witness the lingering effects of a mild winter and the headwinds of certain trends in the North American carparks. Despite these dynamics, the company delivered organic revenue growth for parts and services of 3.7%, an [indiscernible] performance compared to many companies in the global auto industry that were confronted with similar challenges and subsequently witnessed negative growth in the quarter. 
Turning to our North American organic revenue growth. During the quarter, organic revenue growth for parts and services was 2.1%, which is down from the first half of the year and below our expectations. Clearly, the macro trends in North America such as miles driven and the size of the carparks continue to trend in our favor. But in order to grow our business, the number of collisions need to grow that will then increase the demand for our collision parts. According to CCC, collision and liability-related auto claims for the first 9 months of 2016 were up only 2.4% nationally, not far from the 2.3% increase witnessed for the first 6 months of 2016. Further in that point, when looking at state levels claim data from CCC, we continue to experience large regional variations. The Northeast and Midwest regions face soft conditions, both experiencing year-over-year declines in repairable claims in certain key states. These 2 regions combined represent over 30% of our North American revenue. 
In addition, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, miles driven in the U.S. were up 3.4% in August, a measure that also witnessed significant regional differences. During August, miles driven in the Northeast and North Central regions were up only 1.2% and 2.1%, respectively. 
Lastly, though difficult to quantify, we believe the surge in the SAAR rate over the last 3 years is initially a headwind as new vehicles tend to get new collision parts. The search also impacts our engine and transmission sales because these type of mechanical parts are covered under manufacturer's warranty. We also believe that the increase in vehicles in operation of model years 11 years and older has played a role in driving total loss rates above historical levels. Regardless of these short-term headwinds, we continue to believe that the carpark is shifting in the right direction towards our collision sweet spot of vehicles 3 to 10 model years old. In fact, the number of vehicles in that sweet spot is expected to increase by a few percentage points in 2017. 
And now turning to operations. During Q3, we purchased 70,000 vehicles for [indiscernible] by our North American wholesale operations, a 1.4% decrease over Q3 2015. Procurement costs at auctions decreased over Q3 2015 by 1.9%. 
For our North American aftermarket business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 12% and 17%, respectively, year-over-year in the quarter. In our self-service retail business, during Q3, we acquired 132,000 lower-cost, self-service and crush-only cars, which is a 3.1% increase over Q3 2015. Similar to the first half of the year, we increased our self-service procurement during Q3 to take advantage of the favorable pricing for higher-quality vehicles in this line of business. 
And lastly, I am pleased with the benefits we are witnessing with our productivity initiatives. During the quarter, North America realized 60 [ph] basis points of gross margin improvement from the aftermarket procurement savings alone. And now that we are fully installed with Roadnet, our route optimization technology, we are optimistic about its potential savings. Today, 95% of our delivery routes are actively using Roadnet, and we are already witnessing some initial cost savings for stop across 49,000 daily deliveries with 3,300 trucks. During this presentation, Nick will discuss the financial impact of these initiatives in the coming quarters. 
Now moving to our European operations. In Q3, our Europe segment had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.7% and acquisition growth of 54.6% primarily related to Rhiag, which were offset by a decrease of 10.6% related to foreign exchange rates. During Q3, ECP drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.9%. And for branches opened more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 5.3%. During the quarter, ECP opened 3 new branches, bringing our network to 209 branches.  During Q3, collision part sales of ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 13.2%. 
Turning to Sator. During Q3, Sator had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 5.1%. This organic revenue growth was primarily driven by the ongoing 3-step conversion and integration efforts we have put in place. 
Now on to Rhiag. Rhiag tracked in line with our expectations during the quarter. Importantly, it is mentioned on the last call, we continue to aggressively gather the necessary data and communication plan amongst our European businesses to create a targeted and sustainable pan-European procurement function. To highlight the opportunity, Sator had an existing agreement on a particular brand and product categories that Rhiag is also buying, but at a 10% higher cost. By leveraging the Sator agreement, Rhiag has budgeted its savings of EUR 200,000 annually and, again, on 1 product. 
Rhiag continues to execute on its growth initiatives and expand its footprint. During the quarter, the Rhiag team opened 8 branches in Eastern Europe. Given the growth opportunities in the market, I am happy to announce that we have an additional 14 branches scheduled for Q4. 
Now on to our Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment posted a year-over-year total revenue growth of 9.9% in the quarter, including the benefits of The Coast acquisition, and organic revenue growth of 3.7%. We believe the modest organic growth was related to the overall Specialty market facing an unfavorable mix shift as certain key product areas witnessed model year changes. Those are still relatively high. We also faced a slight reduction in the year-over-year SAAR rate during the quarter. 
Lastly, Specialty finalized the integration activities from The Coast acquisition by consolidating all of The Coast distribution and centers and sales processing into our existing network. 
And now an update on PGW. During the quarter, the PGW team secured another manufacturing renewal agreement for an existing OE platform with a new model launch. On PGW's aftermarket business, the team continues to receive industry accolades as the supplier of choice. These accolades were validated this quarter by signing an agreement with a major customer to precure an incrementally higher volume of windshields and sidelights in 2017. 
Turning to Corporate Development. In early October 2016, we acquired substantially all the business assets of Andrew Page Limited, a distributor of automotive parts in the United Kingdom. As part of this transaction, we acquired 102 Andrew Page branch locations. Andrew Page has a proud history of being a value-added supplier to the automotive repair industry in the U.K. With this acquisition, we believe that the transaction will benefit Andrew Page's customers with an extended range of products and the continuation of the exceptional level of service that their employees have historically provided. As we did expect, the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority or CMA commenced a review of the acquisition to assess whether the transaction would unreasonably lessen competition in the U.K. market. During the CMA's review, we are not allowed to integrate the business subject to certain exceptions to allow us to support key operations and there's always a risk that they may ask us to divest some or all of the business. Accordingly, until the CMA approves the transaction, we will not be able to achieve any of the projected synergies afforded by the integration of the combined businesses. We do anticipate the acquired business will continue to be modestly unprofitable during the review process. 
In addition to the Andrew Page announcement, during the third quarter of 2016, we acquired a distributor of automotive products in the Netherlands; a distributor of recreational vehicle products and accessories in the United Kingdom; a distributor of aftermarket automotive products in Ireland; and a heavy-duty truck salvage yard in Minnesota. Our acquisition strategy has always been to acquire the best assets we can with high-quality management teams and use of those strength to lever the growth of the business. As we look across our key segments, the pipeline is healthy with tremendous opportunities to grow our existing market share in key markets, expand the depth of our product lines and enter new geographic markets and, in particular, throughout Europe. 
At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more detail and perspective on our financial results and our updated 2016 guidance."

I'm delighted to run you through the financial summary in the quarter and, over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of our",2518,"Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everybody on the call. I'm delighted to run you through the financial summary in the quarter and, over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of our 4 segments during the third quarter before touching on the balance sheet and addressing our revised guidance for 2016. The third quarter of 2016, when taken as a whole, was an excellent quarter with revenue, segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS up 30%, 32% and 25%, respectively, when compared to the third quarter of last year. While the revenue growth in North America was a bit behind expectations, the margins in this segment were very strong. In addition, the European operations continue to perform well and the 2 big acquisitions generally performed on target. 
As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2016 increased 30% over last year. That reflects a 33.2% increase in revenue from parking services, partially offset by a 9.4% decrease in other revenue. The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 3.7% from organic plus 32.6% from acquisitions for a constant currency growth of 36.4% before backing out the translation impact of FX, which was a 3.2% decline. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each business as I walk through the segment results. 
As noted on Page 11 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins declined 190 basis points to 37.0% due primarily to the impact of acquisitions. You will recall that both Rhiag and PGW have lower gross margins than our historical businesses. Excluding the 2 big acquisitions, gross margins were actually up about 60 basis points. 
While the consolidated gross margins were down, consolidated operating expenses as a percent of revenue were also down about 200 basis points lower than last year. Some of that reflects the impact of the different margin structure of the 2 acquisitions and some of it reflects improved efficiencies in the historical businesses. 
Segment EBITDA totaled $274 million for the quarter, reflecting a 32% increase from 2015. And as a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 11.5%, a 20 basis point improvement over the 11.3% recorded last year. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced a $3.8 million increase in restructuring cost related to the integration of our acquisitions. 
Depreciation and amortization was up about $26 million, mostly related to the addition of Rhiag in PGW. The same holds true for interest expense, which was up about $12 million. And with that, pretax income increased 16% in the quarter relative to last year. 
Our effective tax rate during the quarter was 31.7%, down from the 33.9% recorded in 2015. This lower rate reflects an ongoing rate of 34.75% and a $5 million benefit associated with the adoption of ASU 2016-09, which addresses tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. All companies need to adopt this new accounting standard by the first quarter of 2017 and we have elected to adopt early. We have excluded this benefit from our adjusted EPS calculation in order to provide an apples-to-apples comparison. 
Diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.40, which was up 21% compared to last year. Adjusted EPS, again excluding restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization and a discrete tax benefit just mentioned, was $0.45 versus $0.36, reflecting a 25% improvement. Scrap had a small negative impact on earnings per share for the quarter, about half a penny, and currency fluctuations negatively impacted EPS growth by about $0.01 as well. 
As highlighted on Page 13, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to the impact of acquisitions. Since each of our segments has a different margin structure, this revenue mix shift impacts the trend in consolidated margins. This has become more accentuated with our ownership of both Rhiag and PGW, and you saw a shift in the third quarter metrics wherein North American parts and services revenue accounted for less than 40% of total consolidated revenue. 
And with that, let's get into the details on the segments. Total revenue in our North American segment during the third quarter of 2016 increased to $1,047,000,000 or about 1% over 2015. This is the combination of a 2.3% growth rate in parts and services, offset by a 9.5% decline in other revenue, the latter of which was due primarily to lower volumes and, to a lesser extent, lower prices received for a variety of metal. When looking at the North American growth, it's important to recognize that there were variations across the platform. As Rob mentioned, there were geographic differences with the central and west regions performing much better than the Northeast and Midwest regions. 
Recycling grew at faster rates than aftermarket. And even with an aftermarket, certain parts types by the core Keystone vendors, hoods and lights grew faster than some other products related to cooling or aluminum wheels. So there were positive strength and spots of weakness. 
Gross margins in North America during the third quarter of 2016 were 43.8%, a 160 basis points increase over last year. Approximately 90 basis points of the improvement relates to the aftermarket operations and the benefit of the procurement initiatives accounted for approximately 60 basis points of the 90 basis point improvement. Our salvage and self-service operations contributed 70 basis points of increase to the North American gross margins. You will note that while scrap averaged $118 a ton during Q3, in October, scrap has rolled back down to slightly below $100 a ton. 
With respect to operating expenses in our North American segment, we lost about 50 basis points of margin compared to the comparable quarter of 2015. On the upside, we continue to experience improvements in both fuel and facilities costs relative to last year. On the downside, we lost a bit of margin in personnel costs and freight expense. In total, EBITDA for the North American business during the third quarter of 2016 was $141 million. As a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the segment was 13.5% in Q3 of 2016, an increase of 110 basis points from the 12.4% reported in the comparable period of last year. 
Last call, we indicated that we expected the benefit of our productivity initiatives to pick up as we move throughout the year. As just mentioned, we saw some benefit in our cost of goods sold related to the procurement savings in connection with our aftermarket parts inventory. In addition, there are procurement benefits and other expense categories across North America. In total, we estimate the aggregate benefit of the productivity initiatives during the third quarter was approximately $8.6 million, up from the $5 million reported in Q2, or a little bit less than $0.02 a share. 
Moving on to our European segment. The total revenue in the third quarter accelerated to $770 million from $511 million, a 51% increase. Organic growth for parts and services in Europe during the third quarter was 6.7%, reflecting the combination of 6.9% growth at ECP and 5.1% growth at Sator. The impact of the acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 55% increase in revenue with the most significant amount reflecting the addition of Rhiag. So on a constant currency basis, European parts and services revenue was up 61%. These constant currency increases were offset by an 11% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, particularly relative to the pound sterling. As you can see on Page 19, the average rate during the quarter was about 15% below last year and the sterling was at $1.30 at quarter end. More recently, the sterling has fallen a further 7%, down to $1.22, and the euro is also down about 3% to $1.09. The translation impact of these latest drops will lay on our reported U.S. dollar results for the rest of the year, probably to the tune of about $0.01 in the fourth quarter. 
Gross margins in Europe were 36.2%, a 210 basis point decline from the comparable period of last year, largely reflecting the impact of Rhiag. As mentioned in prior calls, Rhiag has a lower gross margin structure than either ECP or Sator. During Q3, Rhiag had a gross margin of about 33.5%, which reduced the consolidated European gross margin by about 150 basis points. Excluding the impact of Rhiag, gross margins decreased 60 basis points primarily due to ECP, which experienced an increase in customer rebates and the impact of some of the incremental cost of the new distribution facility in Tamworth rolling through cost of goods sold. 
With respect to operating expenses as a percent of revenue, we experienced a 150 basis points improvement on a consolidated European basis. We benefited from a 240 basis point reduction in operating expenses due to the addition of Rhiag, which has lower operating expenses as a percent of revenue than ECP or Sator. Offsetting these gains was an 80 basis point increase in facility and warehouse expense, reflecting some of the cost of the Tamworth facility as well as new branches and hubs at ECP. In addition, we lost about 30 basis points of margin in the U.K. related to the impact of translation losses on inventory purchases, which are denominated in a foreign currency. 
With respect to the Tamworth project, the incremental costs related to this project in the third quarter were approximately GBP 2 million or about $2.6 million. Again, some of this was recorded in cost of goods sold and some in SG&A. In total, it reflects a 30 basis point impact on European margins. 
European EBITDA totaled $73 million, a 38% increase over last year, reflecting a solid performance at ECP and Sator and the positive impact of Rhiag. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA margins in the third quarter were 9.4% versus 10.3% last year, a 90 basis point decline, again 30 basis points of which relates to the Tamworth project. 
Turning to our Specialty segment. Revenue for the third quarter totaled $313 million, a 10% increase over the comparable quarter of last year. The organic growth rate was 3.7%, while the impact of the acquisition of Coast in August of 2015 added 6.2% to revenue growth. In the last couple of calls, we indicated that the high level of organic growth in Specialty was not sustainable and overall, we were happy with the third quarter growth rate. 
Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the third quarter were flat compared to last year as the impact of stocking 2 new Specialty distribution centers in Michigan and Washington state, which were not in operation at this time last year, was offset by an increase in the advertising credits. 
Operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were down about 100 basis points. Facility expense increased to certain costs related to the 2 new distribution centers just mentioned. But on the plus side, we continue to see SG&A leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing network as well as the benefit of the lower fuel prices. 
EBITDA for Specialty was $32 million in the quarter, up 24% from the third quarter of last year. And as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment increased 120 basis points to 10.4% in 2016 compared to 9.2% last year. Remember, this is a highly seasonal business and you should assume these margins will decline as we move through the historically soft Q4 period. 
On Page 22, you can see the impact of the acquisition of PGW. Revenue for the quarter was $259 million, while gross margins in Q3 were 22.6%, which is very consistent with the expectations we highlighted at the time the transaction was announced. EBITDA margins for PGW were 10.7% in the third quarter. 
Let's move on to capital allocation. As presented on Slide 23, you will note that our after-tax cash flow from operations during the first 9 months was approximately $524 million as we experienced strong cash earnings and only a moderate increase in working capital. During the first 9 months of 2016, we deployed a little bit more than $1.9 billion of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $153 million to fund capital expenditures and about $1.8 billion to acquire businesses. We closed the quarter with approximately $272 million of cash, of which $226 million was held outside of the U.S. And we had roughly $3.3 billion of total debt outstanding. So our net debt was approximately $3 billion. And on a pro forma basis, taking into account the impact of acquisitions, our net leverage was a little bit less than 2.7x latest 12 months EBITDA. At quarter end, the total availability under our credit facility was approximately $1.2 billion, which we believe is more than sufficient to support the continued growth of our business.  
Finally, as noted in our press release, we have provided updated guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2016. As relates to the organic growth for parts and services, we reduced the organic growth guidance for full year 2016 to 4.5% to 5%, reflecting the 5.1% rate for the first 9 months and an expectation that we don't anticipate any major movements during the fourth quarter. For those trying to back into the Q4 growth, the range implies a 2.6 to 4.6 growth rate. But it is important to note that there is 1 less business day in Q4 of 2016 than Q4 of 2015, and while that may sound trivial, it's 1.5% fewer business day compared to last year. Customers don't buy more on other days to make up the difference, so the calendars simply puts us in a 1.5% [ph] hold to start. In addition, the hurricane earlier this month closed some of our operations and some of our customers' operations in Florida and the Carolinas for a couple of days. 
Our range for adjusted EPS, which excludes the after-tax impact of intangible amortization and the tax benefit of adopting ASU 2016-09, is $1.78 to $1.84 per share with a midpoint of $1.81. As in the past, we have narrowed the range to reflect the fact that we are 9 months through the year. The new range reflects the fact that Q3 results were right on track, and the outlook for the core business for the rest of the year is largely unchanged, except for the anticipated headwinds from currencies, lower scrap prices and the dilutive impact of owning Andrew Page as a completely independent company without the ability to integrate operations. To be clear, the new EPS guidance assumes pound sterling and euro exchange rates of $1.22 and $1.09, respectively, and importantly, that scrap remains at current levels as well. 
Our assumed tax rate for 2016 remains at 34.75%, excluding the benefit of adopting the new accounting pronouncement. 
Our current guidance for cash flow from operations also narrowed a bit to approximately $575 million to $600 million, and the guidance for capital spending is unchanged at $200 million to $225 million. 
At this point in time, I'll turn the call back over to Rob to wrap up"

As a company, we are always focused on financial performance, but we are equally focused on facing change head on and rapidly adapting in order to continuously deliver positive results for our stockholders, employees and most importantly, our customers. There is no question that weather impacted various lines of business and many markets for our company thus far in 2016, a similar scenario to what we witnessed in 2012. We firmly believe that like 2012, this impact is temporary and that the macro trends continue to present opportunities for all of our segments. Yet we don't rest on our laurels and simply blame softness in our business or uncontrollable circumstances. Rather, during those periods, we strive to maintain our historical growth rates and our leading positions by focusing on what we can control such as the margin improvements we recognized in this quarter. It is clear as headwinds present themselves, our team of nearly 41,000 employees globally actively adjust to market conditions to effectively and profitably manage their businesses, not only for today, but to position us well for the future. This focus allowed us again to deliver double-digit EPS growth in the midst of a challenging environment. So a big thank you for the LKQ team.

This morning, I will begin our review with a few high-level financial metrics, followed by an update on our operating segments and some macro trends we witnessed in Q3. Nick will follow with a detailed overview of our financial performance. 
Turning to Slide 3. Q3 revenue reached $2.39 billion, an increase of 30.3%, as compared to $1.83 billion in the third quarter of 2015. Net income for the third quarter of 2016 was $122.7 million, an increase of 21.1%, as compared to $101.3 million for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, net income was $139.3 million, an increase of 26.8%, as compared to $109.9 million for the same period of 2015. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.40, an increase of 21.2%, as compared to the $0.33 for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share was $0.45 in the third quarter of 2016, reflecting a 25% increase over $0.36 for the same period of 2015. 
During the quarter, we continued to witness the lingering effects of a mild winter and the headwinds of certain trends in the North American car park. Despite these dynamics, the company delivered organic revenue growth for parts and services of 3.7%, an enviable performance compared to many companies in the global auto industry that were confronted with similar challenges and subsequently witnessed negative growth in the quarter. 
Turning to our North American organic revenue growth. During the quarter, organic revenue growth for parts and services was 2.1%, which is down from the first half of the year and below our expectations. Clearly, the macro trends in North America, such as miles driven and the size of the car park, continued to trend in our favor. But in order to grow our business, the number of collisions need to grow that will then increase the demand for our collision parts. 
According to CCC, collision and liability-related auto claims for the first 9 months of 2016 were up only 2.4% nationally, not far from the 2.3% increase witnessed for the first 6 months of 2016. Furthering that point, when looking at state-level claims data from CCC, we continue to experience large regional variations. The Northeast and Midwest regions faced soft conditions, both experiencing year-over-year declines in repairable claims in certain key states. These 2 regions combined represent over 30% of our North American revenue. In addition, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, miles driven in the U.S. were up 3.4% in August, a measure that also witnessed significant regional differences. During August, miles driven in the Northeast and North Central regions were up only 1.2% and 2.1%, respectively. 
Lastly, though difficult to quantify, we believe the surge in the SAAR rate over the last 3 years is initially a headwind as new vehicles tend to get new collision parts. This surge also impacts our engine and transmission sales because these type of mechanical parts are covered under manufacturers' warranty. We also believe that the increase in vehicles in operation of model years 11 years and older has played a role in driving total loss rates above historical levels. Regardless of these short-term headwinds, we continue to believe that the car park is shifting in the right direction towards our collision sweet spot of vehicles 3 to 10 model years old. In fact, the number of vehicles in that sweet spot is expected to increase by a few percentage points in 2017. 
And now turning to operations. During Q3, we purchased 70,000 vehicles for dismantling by our North American wholesale operations, a 1.4% decrease over Q3 2015. Procurement costs at auctions decreased over Q3 2015 by 1.9%. For our North American aftermarket business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 12% and 17%, respectively, year-over-year in the quarter. In our self-service retail business, during Q3, we acquired 132,000 lower-cost, self-service and crush-only cars, which is a 3.1% increase over Q3 2015. Similar to the first half of the year, we increased our self-service procurement during Q3 to take advantage of the favorable pricing for higher-quality vehicles in this line of business. 
And lastly, I am pleased with the benefits we are witnessing with our productivity initiatives. During the quarter, North America realized 60 basis points of gross margin improvement from the aftermarket procurement savings alone. And now that we are fully installed with Roadnet, our route optimization technology, we are optimistic about its potential savings. Today, 95% of our delivery routes are actively using Roadnet, and we are already witnessing some initial cost savings per stop across 49,000 daily deliveries with 3,300 trucks. During his presentation, Nick will discuss the financial impact of these initiatives in the coming quarters. 
Now moving to our European operations. In Q3, our Europe segment had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.7% and acquisition growth of 54.6% primarily related to the Rhiag, which were offset by a decrease of 10.6% related to foreign exchange rates. During Q3, ECP drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.9%. And for branches open more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 5.3%. During the quarter, ECP opened 3 new branches, bringing our network to 209 branches. During Q3, collision part sales of ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 13.2%. 
Turning to Sator. During Q3, Sator had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 5.1%. This organic revenue growth was primarily driven by the ongoing 3-step conversion and integration efforts we have put in place. 
Now on to Rhiag. Rhiag tracked in line with our expectations during the quarter. Importantly and as mentioned on the last call, we continue to aggressively gather the necessary data and communication plan amongst our European businesses to create a targeted and sustainable pan-European procurement function. To highlight the opportunity, Sator had an existing agreement on a particular brand and product category that Rhiag is also buying but at a 10% higher cost. By leveraging the Sator agreement, Rhiag has budgeted a savings of EUR 200,000 annually and again on 1 product. Rhiag continues to execute on its growth initiatives and expand its footprint. During the quarter, the Rhiag team opened 8 branches in Eastern Europe. Given the growth opportunities in the market, I am happy to announce that we have an additional 14 branches scheduled for Q4. 
Now on to our Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment posted a year-over-year total revenue growth of 9.9% in the quarter, including the benefits of the Coast acquisition, an organic revenue growth of 3.7%. We believe the modest organic growth was related to the overall Specialty market facing an unfavorable mix shift as certain key product areas witnessed model year changes. Though still relatively high, we also faced a slight reduction in the year-over-year SAAR rate during the quarter. Lastly, Specialty finalized the integration activities from the Coast acquisition by consolidating all of The Coast Distribution centers and sales processing into our existing network. 
And now an update on PGW. During the quarter, the PGW team secured another manufacturing renewal agreement for an existing OE platform with a new model launch. On PGW's aftermarket business, the team continues to receive industry accolades as the supplier of choice. These accolades were validated this quarter by signing an agreement with a major customer to procure an incrementally higher volume of windshields and sidelights in 2017. 
Turning to corporate development. In early October 2016, we acquired substantially all the business assets of Andrew Page Limited, a distributor of automotive parts in the United Kingdom. As part of this transaction, we acquired 102 Andrew Page branch locations. Andrew Page has a proud history of being a value-added supplier to the automotive repair industry in the U.K. With this acquisition, we believe that the transaction will benefit Andrew Page's customers with an extended range of products and a continuation of the exceptional level of service that their employees have historically provided. 
As we did expect, the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority or CMA commenced a review of the acquisition to assess whether the transaction would unreasonably lessen competition in the U.K. market. During the CMA's review, we are not allowed to integrate the business subject to certain exceptions to allow us to support key operations. And there's always a risk that they may ask us to divest some or all of the business. Accordingly, until the CMA approves the transaction, we will not be able to achieve any of the projected synergies afforded by the integration of the combined businesses. We do anticipate the acquired business will continue to be modestly unprofitable during the review process. 
In addition to the Andrew Page announcement, during the third quarter of 2016, we acquired a distributor of automotive products in the Netherlands; a distributor of recreational vehicle products and accessories in the United Kingdom; a distributor of aftermarket automotive products in Ireland; and a heavy-duty truck salvage yard in Minnesota. Our acquisition strategy has always been to acquire the best assets we can with high-quality management teams and use those strengths to lever the growth of the business. As we look across our key segments, the pipeline is healthy with tremendous opportunities to grow our existing market share in key markets, expand the depth of our product lines and enter new geographic markets and, in particular, throughout Europe. 
At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more detail and perspective on our financial results and our updated 2016 guidance."

I'm delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter. And over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of our 4 segments during the third quarter before touching on the balance sheet and addressing our revised guidance for 2016. 
The third quarter of 2016, when taken as a whole, was an excellent quarter with revenue, segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS up 30%, 32% and 25%, respectively, when compared to the third quarter of last year. While the revenue growth in North America was a bit behind expectations, the margins in this segment were very strong. In addition, the European operations continued to perform well and the 2 big acquisitions generally performed on target. 
As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2016 increased 30% over last year. That reflects a 33.2% increase in revenue from parts and services, partially offset by a 9.4% decrease in other revenue. The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 3.7% from organic plus 32.6% from acquisitions for constant currency growth of 36.4% before backing out the translation impact of FX, which was a 3.2% decline. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each business as I walk through the segment results. 
As noted on Page 11 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins declined 190 basis points to 37.0% due primarily to the impact of the acquisitions. You will recall that both Rhiag and PGW have lower gross margins than our historical businesses. Excluding the 2 big acquisitions, gross margins were actually up about 60 basis points. While the consolidated gross margins were down, consolidated operating expenses as a percent of revenue were also down about 200 basis points lower than last year. Some of that reflects the impact of the different margin structure of the 2 acquisitions and some of it reflects improved efficiencies in the historical businesses. 
Segment EBITDA totaled $274 million for the quarter, reflecting a 32% increase from 2015. And as a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 11.5%, a 20 basis point improvement over the 11.3% recorded last year. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced a $3.8 million increase in restructuring costs related to the integration of our acquisitions. Depreciation and amortization was up about $26 million, mostly related to the addition of Rhiag and PGW. The same holds true for interest expense, which was up about $12 million. And with that, pretax income increased 16% in the quarter relative to last year. 
Our effective tax rate during the quarter was 31.7%, down from the 33.9% recorded in 2015. This lower rate reflects an ongoing rate of 34.75% and a $5 million benefit associated with the adoption of ASU 2016-09, which addresses tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. All companies need to adopt this new accounting standard by the first quarter of 2017 and we elected to adopt early. We have excluded this benefit from our adjusted EPS calculation in order to provide an apples-to-apples comparison. 
Diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.40, which was up 21% compared to last year. Adjusted EPS, again excluding restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization and the discrete tax benefit just mentioned, was $0.45 versus $0.36, reflecting a 25% improvement. Scrap had a small negative impact on earnings per share for the quarter, about $0.005, and currency fluctuations negatively impacted EPS growth by about $0.01 as well. 
As highlighted on Page 13, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to the impact of acquisitions. Since each of our segments has a different margin structure, this revenue mix shift impacts the trend in consolidated margins. This has become more accentuated with our ownership of both Rhiag and PGW. And you saw a shift in the third quarter metrics wherein North American parts and services revenue accounted for less than 40% of total consolidated revenue. 
And with that, let's get into the details on the segments. Total revenue in our North American segment during the third quarter of 2016 increased to $1,047,000,000 or about 1% over 2015. This is the combination of a 2.3% growth rate in parts and services, offset by a 9.5% decline in other revenue, the latter of which was due primarily to lower volumes and to a lesser extent, lower prices received for a variety of metals. 
When looking at the North American growth, it's important to recognize that there were variations across the platform. As Rob mentioned, there were geographic differences with the Central and West regions performing much better than the Northeast and Midwest regions. Recycling grew at faster rates than aftermarket. And even with an aftermarket, certain parts types, like the core Keystone fenders, hoods and lights, grew faster than some other products related to cooling or aluminum wheels. So there was positive strength and spots of weakness. 
Gross margins in North America during the third quarter of 2016 were 43.8%, a 160 basis point increase over last year. Approximately 90 basis points of the improvement relates to the aftermarket operations. And the benefits of the procurement initiatives accounted for approximately 60 basis points of the 90 basis point improvement. Our salvage and self-service operations contributed 70 basis points of increase to the North American gross margins. You will note that while scrap averaged $118 a ton during Q3, in October, scrap has rolled back down to slightly below $100 a ton. 
With respect to operating expenses in our North American segment, we lost about 50 basis points of margin compared to the comparable quarter of 2015. On the upside, we continue to experience improvements in both fuel and facilities costs relative to last year. On the downside, we lost a bit of margin in personnel cost and freight expense. In total, EBITDA for the North American business during the third quarter of 2016 was $141 million. As a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the segment was 13.5% in Q3 of 2016, an increase of 110 basis points from the 12.4% reported in the comparable period of last year. 
Last call, we indicated that we expected the benefit of our productivity initiatives to pick up as we move throughout the year. As just mentioned, we saw some benefits in our cost of goods sold related to the procurement savings in connection with our aftermarket parts inventory. In addition, there are procurement benefits in other expense categories across North America. In total, we estimate the aggregate benefit of the productivity initiatives during the third quarter was approximately $8.6 million, up from the $5 million reported in Q2 or a little bit less than $0.02 a share. 
Moving on to our European segment. The total revenue in the third quarter accelerated to $770 million from $511 million, a 51% increase. Organic growth for parts and services in Europe during the third quarter was 6.7%, reflecting the combination of 6.9% growth at ECP and 5.1% growth at Sator. The impact of the acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 55% increase in revenue with the most significant amount reflecting the addition of Rhiag. So on a constant currency basis, European parts and services revenue was up 61%. These constant currency increases were offset by an 11% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, particularly relative to the pound sterling. 
As you can see on Page 19, the average rate during the quarter was about 15% below last year and the sterling was at $1.30 at quarter-end. More recently, the sterling has fallen a further 7%, down to $1.22, and the euro is also down about 3% to $1.09. The translation impact of these latest drops will weigh on our reported U.S. dollar results for the rest of the year probably to the tune of about $0.01 in the fourth quarter. 
Gross margins in Europe were 36.2%, a 210 basis point decline from the comparable period of last year, largely reflecting the impact of Rhiag. As mentioned in prior calls, Rhiag has a lower gross margin structure than either ECP or Sator. During Q3, Rhiag had a gross margin of about 33.5%, which reduced the consolidated European gross margin by about 150 basis points. Excluding the impact of Rhiag, gross margins decreased 60 basis points primarily due to ECP, which experienced an increase in customer rebates and the impact of some of the incremental cost of the new distribution facility in Tamworth rolling through cost of goods sold. 
With respect to operating expenses as a percent of revenue, we experienced a 150 basis point improvement on a consolidated European basis. We benefited from a 240 basis point reduction in operating expenses due to the addition of Rhiag, which has lower operating expenses as a percent of revenue than ECP or Sator. Offsetting these gains was an 80 basis point increase in facility and warehouse expense, reflecting some of the cost of the Tamworth facility as well as new branches and hubs at ECP. In addition, we lost about 30 basis points of margin in the U.K. related to the impact of translation losses on inventory purchases, which are denominated in a foreign currency. 
With respect to the Tamworth project, the incremental costs related to this project in the third quarter were approximately GBP 2 million or about $2.6 million. Again, some of this was recorded in cost of goods sold and some in SG&A. In total, it reflects a 30 basis point impact on European margins. 
European EBITDA totaled $73 million, a 38% increase over last year, reflecting a solid performance at ECP and Sator and the positive impact of Rhiag. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA margins in the third quarter were 9.4% versus 10.3% last year, a 90 basis point decline, again 30 basis points of which relate to the Tamworth project. 
Turning to our Specialty segment. Revenue for the third quarter totaled $313 million, a 10% increase over the comparable quarter of last year. The organic growth rate was 3.7% while the impact of the acquisition of Coast in August of 2015 added 6.2% to revenue growth. In the last couple of calls, we indicated that the high level of organic growth in Specialty was not sustainable. And overall, we were happy with the third quarter growth rate. Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the third quarter were flat compared to last year as the impact of stocking 2 new Specialty distribution centers in Michigan and Washington state, which were not in operation at this time last year, was offset by an increase in the advertising credits. 
Operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were down about 100 basis points. Facility expense increased to certain costs related to the 2 new distribution centers just mentioned. But on the plus side, we continued to see SG&A leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing network as well as the benefit of the lower fuel prices. EBITDA for Specialty was $32 million in the quarter, up 24% from the third quarter of last year. And as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment increased 120 basis points to 10.4% in 2016 compared to 9.2% last year. Remember, this is a highly seasonal business, and you should assume these margins will decline as we move through the historically soft Q4 period. 
On Page 22, you can see the impact of the acquisition of PGW. Revenue for the quarter was $259 million while gross margins in Q3 were 22.6%, which is very consistent with the expectations we highlighted at the time the transaction was announced. EBITDA margins for PGW were 10.7% in the third quarter. 
Let's move on to capital allocation. As presented on Slide 23, you will note that our after-tax cash flow from operations during the first 9 months was approximately $524 million as we experienced strong cash earnings and only a moderate increase in working capital. During the first 9 months of 2016, we deployed a little bit more than $1.9 billion of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $153 million to fund capital expenditures and about $1.8 billion to acquire businesses. We closed the quarter with approximately $272 million of cash, of which $226 million was held outside of the U.S. And we have roughly $3.3 billion of total debt outstanding. So our net debt was approximately $3 billion. And on a pro forma basis, taking into account the impact of the acquisitions, our net leverage was a little bit less than 2.7x latest 12 months EBITDA. At quarter-end, the total availability under our credit facility was approximately $1.2 billion, which we believe is more than sufficient to support the continued growth of our business.  
Finally, as noted in our press release, we have provided updated guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2016. As relates to the organic growth for parts and services, we reduced the organic growth guidance for full year 2016 to 4.5% to 5%, reflecting the 5.1% rate for the first 9 months and an expectation that we don't anticipate any major movements during the fourth quarter. For those trying to back into the Q4 growth, the range implies a 2.6% to 4.6% growth rate. But it is important to note that there is 1 less business day in Q4 of 2016 than Q4 of 2015. And while that may sound trivial, it's 1.5% fewer business day compared to last year. Customers don't buy more on other days to make up the difference, so the calendar simply puts us in a 1.5% hole at the start. In addition, the hurricane earlier this month closed some of our operations and some of our customers' operations in Florida and the Carolinas for a couple of days. 
Our range for adjusted EPS, which excludes the after-tax impact of intangible amortization and the tax benefit of adopting ASU 2016-09, is $1.78 to $1.84 per share with a midpoint of $1.81. As in the past, we have narrowed the range to reflect the fact that we are 9 months through the year. The new range reflects the fact that Q3 results were right on track and the outlook for the core business for the rest of the year is largely unchanged, except for the anticipated headwinds from currencies, lower scrap prices and the dilutive impact of owning Andrew Page as a completely independent company without the ability to integrate operations. To be clear, the new EPS guidance assumes pound sterling and euro exchange rates of $1.22 and $1.09, respectively, and importantly, that scrap remains at current levels as well. 
Our assumed tax rate for 2016 remains at 34.75%, excluding the benefit of adopting the new accounting pronouncement. Our current guidance for cash flow from operations also narrowed a bit to approximately $575 million to $600 million. And the guidance for capital spending is unchanged at $200 million to $225 million. 
At this point in time, I'll turn the call back over to Rob to wrap up."

As a company, we are always focused on financial performance, but we are equally focused on facing change head-on and rapidly adapting in order to continuously deliver positive results for our stockholders, employees and most importantly, our customers. There is no question that weather impacted various lines of business and many markets for our company thus far in 2016, a similar scenario to what we witnessed in 2012. We firmly believe that like 2012, this impact is temporary and that the macro trends continue to present opportunities for all of our segments. 
Yet we don't rest on our laurels and simply blame softness in our business on uncontrollable circumstances. Rather, during those periods, we strive to maintain our historical growth rates and our leading positions by focusing on what we can control, such as the margin improvements we recognized in this quarter. It is clear, as headwinds present themselves, our team of nearly 41,000 employees globally actively adjust to market conditions to effectively and profitably manage their businesses, not only for today but to position us well for the future. This focus allowed us again to deliver double-digit EPS growth in the midst of a challenging environment. So a big thank you to the LKQ team. 
And with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call for the questions."

This morning, I will begin our review with a few high-level financial metrics, followed by an update on our operating segments and some macro trends we witnessed in Q3. Nick will follow with a detailed overview of our financial performance. 
Turning to Slide 3. Q3 revenue reached $2.39 billion, an increase of 30.3%, as compared to $1.83 billion in the third quarter of 2015. Net income for the third quarter of 2016 was $122.7 million, an increase of 21.1%, as compared to $101.3 million for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, net income was $139.3 million, an increase of 26.8%, as compared to $109.9 million for the same period of 2015. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.40, an increase of 21.2%, as compared to the $0.33 for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share was $0.45 in the third quarter of 2016, reflecting a 25% increase over $0.36 for the same period of 2015. 
During the quarter, we continued to witness the lingering effects of a mild winter and the headwinds of certain trends in the North American car park. Despite these dynamics, the company delivered organic revenue growth for parts and services of 3.7%, an enviable performance compared to many companies in the global auto industry that were confronted with similar challenges and subsequently witnessed negative growth in the quarter. 
Turning to our North American organic revenue growth. During the quarter, organic revenue growth for parts and services was 2.1%, which is down from the first half of the year and below our expectations. Clearly, the macro trends in North America, such as miles driven and the size of the car park, continued to trend in our favor. But in order to grow our business, the number of collisions need to grow that will then increase the demand for our collision parts. 
According to CCC, collision and liability-related auto claims for the first 9 months of 2016 were up only 2.4% nationally, not far from the 2.3% increase witnessed for the first 6 months of 2016. Furthering that point, when looking at state-level claims data from CCC, we continue to experience large regional variations. The Northeast and Midwest regions faced soft conditions, both experiencing year-over-year declines in repairable claims in certain key states. These 2 regions combined represent over 30% of our North American revenue. In addition, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, miles driven in the U.S. were up 3.4% in August, a measure that also witnessed significant regional differences. During August, miles driven in the Northeast and North Central regions were up only 1.2% and 2.1%, respectively. 
Lastly, though difficult to quantify, we believe the surge in the SAAR rate over the last 3 years is initially a headwind as new vehicles tend to get new collision parts. This surge also impacts our engine and transmission sales because these type of mechanical parts are covered under manufacturers' warranty. We also believe that the increase in vehicles in operation of model years 11 years and older has played a role in driving total loss rates above historical levels. Regardless of these short-term headwinds, we continue to believe that the car park is shifting in the right direction towards our collision sweet spot of vehicles 3 to 10 model years old. In fact, the number of vehicles in that sweet spot is expected to increase by a few percentage points in 2017. 
And now turning to operations. During Q3, we purchased 70,000 vehicles for dismantling by our North American wholesale operations, a 1.4% decrease over Q3 2015. Procurement costs at auctions decreased over Q3 2015 by 1.9%. For our North American aftermarket business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 12% and 17%, respectively, year-over-year in the quarter. In our self-service retail business, during Q3, we acquired 132,000 lower-cost, self-service and crush-only cars, which is a 3.1% increase over Q3 2015. Similar to the first half of the year, we increased our self-service procurement during Q3 to take advantage of the favorable pricing for higher-quality vehicles in this line of business. 
And lastly, I am pleased with the benefits we are witnessing with our productivity initiatives. During the quarter, North America realized 60 basis points of gross margin improvement from the aftermarket procurement savings alone. And now that we are fully installed with Roadnet, our route optimization technology, we are optimistic about its potential savings. Today, 95% of our delivery routes are actively using Roadnet, and we are already witnessing some initial cost savings per stop across 49,000 daily deliveries with 3,300 trucks. During his presentation, Nick will discuss the financial impact of these initiatives in the coming quarters. 
Now moving to our European operations. In Q3, our Europe segment had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.7% and acquisition growth of 54.6% primarily related to the Rhiag, which were offset by a decrease of 10.6% related to foreign exchange rates. During Q3, ECP drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.9%. And for branches open more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 5.3%. During the quarter, ECP opened 3 new branches, bringing our network to 209 branches. During Q3, collision part sales of ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 13.2%. 
Turning to Sator. During Q3, Sator had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 5.1%. This organic revenue growth was primarily driven by the ongoing 3-step conversion and integration efforts we have put in place. 
Now on to Rhiag. Rhiag tracked in line with our expectations during the quarter. Importantly and as mentioned on the last call, we continue to aggressively gather the necessary data and communication plan amongst our European businesses to create a targeted and sustainable pan-European procurement function. To highlight the opportunity, Sator had an existing agreement on a particular brand and product category that Rhiag is also buying but at a 10% higher cost. By leveraging the Sator agreement, Rhiag has budgeted a savings of EUR 200,000 annually and again on 1 product. Rhiag continues to execute on its growth initiatives and expand its footprint. During the quarter, the Rhiag team opened 8 branches in Eastern Europe. Given the growth opportunities in the market, I am happy to announce that we have an additional 14 branches scheduled for Q4. 
Now on to our Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment posted a year-over-year total revenue growth of 9.9% in the quarter, including the benefits of the Coast acquisition, an organic revenue growth of 3.7%. We believe the modest organic growth was related to the overall Specialty market facing an unfavorable mix shift as certain key product areas witnessed model year changes. Though still relatively high, we also faced a slight reduction in the year-over-year SAAR rate during the quarter. Lastly, Specialty finalized the integration activities from the Coast acquisition by consolidating all of The Coast Distribution centers and sales processing into our existing network. 
And now an update on PGW. During the quarter, the PGW team secured another manufacturing renewal agreement for an existing OE platform with a new model launch. On PGW's aftermarket business, the team continues to receive industry accolades as the supplier of choice. These accolades were validated this quarter by signing an agreement with a major customer to procure an incrementally higher volume of windshields and sidelights in 2017. 
Turning to corporate development. In early October 2016, we acquired substantially all the business assets of Andrew Page Limited, a distributor of automotive parts in the United Kingdom. As part of this transaction, we acquired 102 Andrew Page branch locations. Andrew Page has a proud history of being a value-added supplier to the automotive repair industry in the U.K. With this acquisition, we believe that the transaction will benefit Andrew Page's customers with an extended range of products and a continuation of the exceptional level of service that their employees have historically provided. 
As we did expect, the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority or CMA commenced a review of the acquisition to assess whether the transaction would unreasonably lessen competition in the U.K. market. During the CMA's review, we are not allowed to integrate the business subject to certain exceptions to allow us to support key operations. And there's always a risk that they may ask us to divest some or all of the business. Accordingly, until the CMA approves the transaction, we will not be able to achieve any of the projected synergies afforded by the integration of the combined businesses. We do anticipate the acquired business will continue to be modestly unprofitable during the review process. 
In addition to the Andrew Page announcement, during the third quarter of 2016, we acquired a distributor of automotive products in the Netherlands; a distributor of recreational vehicle products and accessories in the United Kingdom; a distributor of aftermarket automotive products in Ireland; and a heavy-duty truck salvage yard in Minnesota. Our acquisition strategy has always been to acquire the best assets we can with high-quality management teams and use those strengths to lever the growth of the business. As we look across our key segments, the pipeline is healthy with tremendous opportunities to grow our existing market share in key markets, expand the depth of our product lines and enter new geographic markets and, in particular, throughout Europe. 
At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more detail and perspective on our financial results and our updated 2016 guidance."

I'm delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter. And over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of our",2516,"Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everybody on the call. I'm delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter. And over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of our 4 segments during the third quarter before touching on the balance sheet and addressing our revised guidance for 2016. 
The third quarter of 2016, when taken as a whole, was an excellent quarter with revenue, segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS up 30%, 32% and 25%, respectively, when compared to the third quarter of last year. While the revenue growth in North America was a bit behind expectations, the margins in this segment were very strong. In addition, the European operations continued to perform well and the 2 big acquisitions generally performed on target. 
As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2016 increased 30% over last year. That reflects a 33.2% increase in revenue from parts and services, partially offset by a 9.4% decrease in other revenue. The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 3.7% from organic plus 32.6% from acquisitions for constant currency growth of 36.4% before backing out the translation impact of FX, which was a 3.2% decline. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each business as I walk through the segment results. 
As noted on Page 11 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins declined 190 basis points to 37.0% due primarily to the impact of the acquisitions. You will recall that both Rhiag and PGW have lower gross margins than our historical businesses. Excluding the 2 big acquisitions, gross margins were actually up about 60 basis points. While the consolidated gross margins were down, consolidated operating expenses as a percent of revenue were also down about 200 basis points lower than last year. Some of that reflects the impact of the different margin structure of the 2 acquisitions and some of it reflects improved efficiencies in the historical businesses. 
Segment EBITDA totaled $274 million for the quarter, reflecting a 32% increase from 2015. And as a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 11.5%, a 20 basis point improvement over the 11.3% recorded last year. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced a $3.8 million increase in restructuring costs related to the integration of our acquisitions. Depreciation and amortization was up about $26 million, mostly related to the addition of Rhiag and PGW. The same holds true for interest expense, which was up about $12 million. And with that, pretax income increased 16% in the quarter relative to last year. 
Our effective tax rate during the quarter was 31.7%, down from the 33.9% recorded in 2015. This lower rate reflects an ongoing rate of 34.75% and a $5 million benefit associated with the adoption of ASU 2016-09, which addresses tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. All companies need to adopt this new accounting standard by the first quarter of 2017 and we elected to adopt early. We have excluded this benefit from our adjusted EPS calculation in order to provide an apples-to-apples comparison. 
Diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.40, which was up 21% compared to last year. Adjusted EPS, again excluding restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization and the discrete tax benefit just mentioned, was $0.45 versus $0.36, reflecting a 25% improvement. Scrap had a small negative impact on earnings per share for the quarter, about $0.005, and currency fluctuations negatively impacted EPS growth by about $0.01 as well. 
As highlighted on Page 13, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to the impact of acquisitions. Since each of our segments has a different margin structure, this revenue mix shift impacts the trend in consolidated margins. This has become more accentuated with our ownership of both Rhiag and PGW. And you saw a shift in the third quarter metrics wherein North American parts and services revenue accounted for less than 40% of total consolidated revenue. 
And with that, let's get into the details on the segments. Total revenue in our North American segment during the third quarter of 2016 increased to $1,047,000,000 or about 1% over 2015. This is the combination of a 2.3% growth rate in parts and services, offset by a 9.5% decline in other revenue, the latter of which was due primarily to lower volumes and to a lesser extent, lower prices received for a variety of metals. 
When looking at the North American growth, it's important to recognize that there were variations across the platform. As Rob mentioned, there were geographic differences with the Central and West regions performing much better than the Northeast and Midwest regions. Recycling grew at a faster rate than aftermarket. And even within aftermarket, certain parts types, like the core Keystone fenders, hoods and lights, grew faster than some other products related to cooling or aluminum wheels. So there were spots of strength and spots of weakness. 
Gross margins in North America during the third quarter of 2016 were 43.8%, a 160 basis point increase over last year. Approximately 90 basis points of the improvement relates to the aftermarket operations. And the benefits of the procurement initiatives accounted for approximately 50 basis points of the 90 basis point improvement. Our salvage and self-service operations contributed 70 basis points of increase to the North American gross margins. You will note that while scrap averaged $118 a ton during Q3, in October, scrap has rolled back down to slightly below $100 a ton. 
With respect to operating expenses in our North American segment, we lost about 50 basis points of margin compared to the comparable quarter of 2015. On the upside, we continue to experience improvements in both fuel and facilities costs relative to last year. On the downside, we lost a bit of margin in personnel cost and freight expense. In total, EBITDA for the North American business during the third quarter of 2016 was $141 million. As a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the segment was 13.5% in Q3 of 2016, an increase of 110 basis points from the 12.4% reported in the comparable period of last year. 
Last call, we indicated that we expected the benefit of our productivity initiatives to pick up as we move throughout the year. As just mentioned, we saw some benefits in our cost of goods sold related to the procurement savings in connection with our aftermarket parts inventory. In addition, there are procurement benefits in other expense categories across North America. In total, we estimate the aggregate benefit of the productivity initiatives during the third quarter was approximately $8.6 million, up from the $5 million reported in Q2 or a little bit less than $0.02 a share. 
Moving on to our European segment. The total revenue in the third quarter accelerated to $770 million from $511 million, a 51% increase. Organic growth for parts and services in Europe during the third quarter was 6.7%, reflecting the combination of 6.9% growth at ECP and 5.1% growth at Sator. The impact of the acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 55% increase in revenue with the most significant amount reflecting the addition of Rhiag. So on a constant currency basis, European parts and services revenue was up 61%. These constant currency increases were offset by an 11% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, particularly relative to the pound sterling. 
As you can see on Page 19, the average rate during the quarter was about 15% below last year and the sterling was at $1.30 at quarter-end. More recently, the sterling has fallen a further 7%, down to $1.22, and the euro is also down about 3% to $1.09. The translation impact of these latest drops will weigh on our reported U.S. dollar results for the rest of the year probably to the tune of about $0.01 in the fourth quarter. 
Gross margins in Europe were 36.2%, a 210 basis point decline from the comparable period of last year, largely reflecting the impact of Rhiag. As mentioned in prior calls, Rhiag has a lower gross margin structure than either ECP or Sator. During Q3, Rhiag had a gross margin of about 33.5%, which reduced the consolidated European gross margin by about 150 basis points. Excluding the impact of Rhiag, gross margins decreased 60 basis points primarily due to ECP, which experienced an increase in customer rebates and the impact of some of the incremental cost of the new distribution facility in Tamworth rolling through cost of goods sold. 
With respect to operating expenses as a percent of revenue, we experienced a 150 basis point improvement on a consolidated European basis. We benefited from a 240 basis point reduction in operating expenses due to the addition of Rhiag, which has lower operating expenses as a percent of revenue than ECP or Sator. Offsetting these gains was an 80 basis point increase in facility and warehouse expense, reflecting some of the cost of the Tamworth facility as well as new branches and hubs at ECP. In addition, we lost about 30 basis points of margin in the U.K. related to the impact of translation losses on inventory purchases, which are denominated in a foreign currency. 
With respect to the Tamworth project, the incremental costs related to this project in the third quarter were approximately GBP 2 million or about $2.6 million. Again, some of this was recorded in cost of goods sold and some in SG&A. In total, it reflects a 30 basis point impact on European margins. 
European EBITDA totaled $73 million, a 38% increase over last year, reflecting a solid performance at ECP and Sator and the positive impact of Rhiag. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA margins in the third quarter were 9.4% versus 10.3% last year, a 90 basis point decline, again 30 basis points of which relate to the Tamworth project. 
Turning to our Specialty segment. Revenue for the third quarter totaled $313 million, a 10% increase over the comparable quarter of last year. The organic growth rate was 3.7% while the impact of the acquisition of Coast in August of 2015 added 6.2% to revenue growth. In the last couple of calls, we indicated that the high level of organic growth in Specialty was not sustainable. And overall, we were happy with the third quarter growth rate. Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the third quarter were flat compared to last year as the impact of stocking 2 new Specialty distribution centers in Michigan and Washington state, which were not in operation at this time last year, was offset by an increase in the advertising credits. 
Operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were down about 100 basis points. Facility expense increased to certain costs related to the 2 new distribution centers just mentioned. But on the plus side, we continued to see SG&A leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing network as well as the benefit of the lower fuel prices. EBITDA for Specialty was $32 million in the quarter, up 24% from the third quarter of last year. And as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment increased 120 basis points to 10.4% in 2016 compared to 9.2% last year. Remember, this is a highly seasonal business, and you should assume these margins will decline as we move through the historically soft Q4 period. 
On Page 22, you can see the impact of the acquisition of PGW. Revenue for the quarter was $259 million while gross margins in Q3 were 22.6%, which is very consistent with the expectations we highlighted at the time the transaction was announced. EBITDA margins for PGW were 10.7% in the third quarter. 
Let's move on to capital allocation. As presented on Slide 23, you will note that our after-tax cash flow from operations during the first 9 months was approximately $524 million as we experienced strong cash earnings and only a moderate increase in working capital. During the first 9 months of 2016, we deployed a little bit more than $1.9 billion of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $153 million to fund capital expenditures and about $1.8 billion to acquire businesses. We closed the quarter with approximately $272 million of cash, of which $226 million was held outside of the U.S. And we had roughly $3.3 billion of total debt outstanding. So our net debt was approximately $3 billion. And on a pro forma basis, taking into account the impact of the acquisitions, our net leverage was a little bit less than 2.7x latest 12 months EBITDA. At quarter-end, the total availability under our credit facility was approximately $1.2 billion, which we believe is more than sufficient to support the continued growth of our business.  
Finally, as noted in our press release, we have provided updated guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2016. As relates to the organic growth for parts and services, we reduced the organic growth guidance for full year 2016 to 4.5% to 5%, reflecting the 5.1% rate for the first 9 months and an expectation that we don't anticipate any major movements during the fourth quarter. For those trying to back into the Q4 growth, the range implies a 2.6% to 4.6% growth rate. But it is important to note that there is 1 less business day in Q4 of 2016 than Q4 of 2015. And while that may sound trivial, it's 1.5% fewer business day compared to last year. Customers don't buy more on other days to make up the difference, so the calendar simply puts us in a 1.5% hole at the start. In addition, the hurricane earlier this month closed some of our operations and some of our customers' operations in Florida and the Carolinas for a couple of days. 
Our range for adjusted EPS, which excludes the after-tax impact of intangible amortization and the tax benefit of adopting ASU 2016-09, is $1.78 to $1.84 per share with a midpoint of $1.81. As in the past, we have narrowed the range to reflect the fact that we are 9 months through the year. The new range reflects the fact that Q3 results were right on track and the outlook for the core business for the rest of the year is largely unchanged, except for the anticipated headwinds from currencies, lower scrap prices and the dilutive impact of owning Andrew Page as a completely independent company without the ability to integrate operations. To be clear, the new EPS guidance assumes pound sterling and euro exchange rates of $1.22 and $1.09, respectively, and importantly, that scrap remains at current levels as well. 
Our assumed tax rate for 2016 remains at 34.75%, excluding the benefit of adopting the new accounting pronouncement. Our current guidance for cash flow from operations also narrowed a bit to approximately $575 million to $600 million. And the guidance for capital spending is unchanged at $200 million to $225 million. 
At this point in time, I'll turn the call back over to Rob to wrap up."

As a company, we are always focused on financial performance, but we are equally focused on facing change head-on and rapidly adapting in order to continuously deliver positive results for our stockholders, employees and most importantly, our customers. There is no question that weather impacted various lines of business and many markets for our company thus far in 2016, a similar scenario to what we witnessed in 2012. We firmly believe that like 2012, this impact is temporary and that the macro trends continue to present opportunities for all of our segments. 
Yet we don't rest on our laurels and simply blame softness in our business on uncontrollable circumstances. Rather, during those periods, we strive to maintain our historical growth rates and our leading positions by focusing on what we can control, such as the margin improvements we recognized in this quarter. It is clear, as headwinds present themselves, our team of nearly 41,000 employees globally actively adjust to market conditions to effectively and profitably manage their businesses, not only for today but to position us well for the future. This focus allowed us again to deliver double-digit EPS growth in the midst of a challenging environment. So a big thank you to the LKQ team.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us on the call today. This morning, I will begin our review with a few high-level financial metrics, followed by an update on our operating segments and some macro trends we witnessed in Q3. Nick wil",1611,"Thank you, Joe. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on the call today. This morning, I will begin our review with a few high-level financial metrics, followed by an update on our operating segments and some macro trends we witnessed in Q3. Nick will follow with a detailed overview of our financial performance. 
Turning to Slide 3. Q3 revenue reached $2.39 billion, an increase of 30.3%, as compared to $1.83 billion in the third quarter of 2015. Net income for the third quarter of 2016 was $122.7 million, an increase of 21.1%, as compared to $101.3 million for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, net income was $139.3 million, an increase of 26.8%, as compared to $109.9 million for the same period of 2015. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.40, an increase of 21.2%, as compared to the $0.33 for the same period of 2015. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share was $0.45 in the third quarter of 2016, reflecting a 25% increase over $0.36 for the same period of 2015. 
During the quarter, we continued to witness the lingering effects of a mild winter and the headwinds of certain trends in the North American car park. Despite these dynamics, the company delivered organic revenue growth for parts and services of 3.7%, an enviable performance compared to many companies in the global auto industry that were confronted with similar challenges and subsequently witnessed negative growth in the quarter. 
Turning to our North American organic revenue growth. During the quarter, organic revenue growth for parts and services was 2.1%, which is down from the first half of the year and below our expectations. Clearly, the macro trends in North America, such as miles driven and the size of the car park, continued to trend in our favor. But in order to grow our business, the number of collisions need to grow that will then increase the demand for our collision parts. 
According to CCC, collision and liability-related auto claims for the first 9 months of 2016 were up only 2.4% nationally, not far from the 2.3% increase witnessed for the first 6 months of 2016. Furthering that point, when looking at state-level claims data from CCC, we continue to experience large regional variations. The Northeast and Midwest regions faced soft conditions, both experiencing year-over-year declines in repairable claims in certain key states. These 2 regions combined represent over 30% of our North American revenue. In addition, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, miles driven in the U.S. were up 3.4% in August, a measure that also witnessed significant regional differences. During August, miles driven in the Northeast and North Central regions were up only 1.2% and 2.1%, respectively. 
Lastly, though difficult to quantify, we believe the surge in the SAAR rate over the last 3 years is initially a headwind as new vehicles tend to get new collision parts. This surge also impacts our engine and transmission sales because these type of mechanical parts are covered under manufacturers' warranty. We also believe that the increase in vehicles in operation of model years 11 years and older has played a role in driving total loss rates above historical levels. Regardless of these short-term headwinds, we continue to believe that the car park is shifting in the right direction towards our collision sweet spot of vehicles 3 to 10 model years old. In fact, the number of vehicles in that sweet spot is expected to increase by a few percentage points in 2017. 
And now turning to operations. During Q3, we purchased 70,000 vehicles for dismantling by our North American wholesale operations, a 1.4% decrease over Q3 2015. Procurement costs at auctions decreased over Q3 2015 by 1.9%. For our North American aftermarket business, we continue to see improvements in our total collision SKU offerings as well as the total number of certified parts available, each growing 12% and 17%, respectively, year-over-year in the quarter. In our self-service retail business, during Q3, we acquired 132,000 lower-cost, self-service and crush-only cars, which is a 3.1% increase over Q3 2015. Similar to the first half of the year, we increased our self-service procurement during Q3 to take advantage of the favorable pricing for higher-quality vehicles in this line of business. 
And lastly, I am pleased with the benefits we are witnessing with our productivity initiatives. During the quarter, North America realized 60 basis points of gross margin improvement from the aftermarket procurement savings alone. And now that we are fully installed with Roadnet, our route optimization technology, we are optimistic about its potential savings. Today, 95% of our delivery routes are actively using Roadnet, and we are already witnessing some initial cost savings per stop across 49,000 daily deliveries with 3,300 trucks. During his presentation, Nick will discuss the financial impact of these initiatives in the coming quarters. 
Now moving to our European operations. In Q3, our Europe segment had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.7% and acquisition growth of 54.6% primarily related to the Rhiag, which were offset by a decrease of 10.6% related to foreign exchange rates. During Q3, ECP drove organic revenue growth for parts and services of 6.9%. And for branches open more than 12 months, ECP's organic revenue growth was 5.3%. During the quarter, ECP opened 3 new branches, bringing our network to 209 branches. During Q3, collision part sales of ECP had year-over-year revenue growth of 13.2%. 
Turning to Sator. During Q3, Sator had organic revenue growth for parts and services of 5.1%. This organic revenue growth was primarily driven by the ongoing 3-step conversion and integration efforts we have put in place. 
Now on to Rhiag. Rhiag tracked in line with our expectations during the quarter. Importantly and as mentioned on the last call, we continue to aggressively gather the necessary data and communication plan amongst our European businesses to create a targeted and sustainable pan-European procurement function. To highlight the opportunity, Sator had an existing agreement on a particular brand and product category that Rhiag is also buying but at a 10% higher cost. By leveraging the Sator agreement, Rhiag has budgeted a savings of EUR 200,000 annually and again on 1 product. Rhiag continues to execute on its growth initiatives and expand its footprint. During the quarter, the Rhiag team opened 8 branches in Eastern Europe. Given the growth opportunities in the market, I am happy to announce that we have an additional 14 branches scheduled for Q4. 
Now on to our Specialty segment. Our Specialty segment posted a year-over-year total revenue growth of 9.9% in the quarter, including the benefits of the Coast acquisition, an organic revenue growth of 3.7%. We believe the modest organic growth was related to the overall Specialty market facing an unfavorable mix shift as certain key product areas witnessed model year changes. Though still relatively high, we also faced a slight reduction in the year-over-year SAAR rate during the quarter. Lastly, Specialty finalized the integration activities from the Coast acquisition by consolidating all of The Coast Distribution centers and sales processing into our existing network. 
And now an update on PGW. During the quarter, the PGW team secured another manufacturing renewal agreement for an existing OE platform with a new model launch. On PGW's aftermarket business, the team continues to receive industry accolades as the supplier of choice. These accolades were validated this quarter by signing an agreement with a major customer to procure an incrementally higher volume of windshields and sidelights in 2017. 
Turning to corporate development. In early October 2016, we acquired substantially all the business assets of Andrew Page Limited, a distributor of automotive parts in the United Kingdom. As part of this transaction, we acquired 102 Andrew Page branch locations. Andrew Page has a proud history of being a value-added supplier to the automotive repair industry in the U.K. With this acquisition, we believe that the transaction will benefit Andrew Page's customers with an extended range of products and a continuation of the exceptional level of service that their employees have historically provided. 
As we did expect, the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority or CMA commenced a review of the acquisition to assess whether the transaction would unreasonably lessen competition in the U.K. market. During the CMA's review, we are not allowed to integrate the business subject to certain exceptions to allow us to support key operations. And there's always a risk that they may ask us to divest some or all of the business. Accordingly, until the CMA approves the transaction, we will not be able to achieve any of the projected synergies afforded by the integration of the combined businesses. We do anticipate the acquired business will continue to be modestly unprofitable during the review process. 
In addition to the Andrew Page announcement, during the third quarter of 2016, we acquired a distributor of automotive products in the Netherlands; a distributor of recreational vehicle products and accessories in the United Kingdom; a distributor of aftermarket automotive products in Ireland; and a heavy-duty truck salvage yard in Minnesota. Our acquisition strategy has always been to acquire the best assets we can with high-quality management teams and use those strengths to lever the growth of the business. As we look across our key segments, the pipeline is healthy with tremendous opportunities to grow our existing market share in key markets, expand the depth of our product lines and enter new geographic markets and, in particular, throughout Europe. 
At this time, I'd like to ask Nick to provide more detail and perspective on our financial results and our updated 2016 guidance."

I'm delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter. And over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of our",2516,"Thanks, Rob, and good morning to everybody on the call. I'm delighted to run you through the financial summary for the quarter. And over the next few minutes, I will address the consolidated results of our company and review the performance of each of our 4 segments during the third quarter before touching on the balance sheet and addressing our revised guidance for 2016. 
The third quarter of 2016, when taken as a whole, was an excellent quarter with revenue, segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS up 30%, 32% and 25%, respectively, when compared to the third quarter of last year. While the revenue growth in North America was a bit behind expectations, the margins in this segment were very strong. In addition, the European operations continued to perform well and the 2 big acquisitions generally performed on target. 
As Rob mentioned, consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2016 increased 30% over last year. That reflects a 33.2% increase in revenue from parts and services, partially offset by a 9.4% decrease in other revenue. The components of the parts and services revenue growth include approximately 3.7% from organic plus 32.6% from acquisitions for constant currency growth of 36.4% before backing out the translation impact of FX, which was a 3.2% decline. I will provide a bit more detail on the organic growth of each business as I walk through the segment results. 
As noted on Page 11 of the presentation, consolidated gross margins declined 190 basis points to 37.0% due primarily to the impact of the acquisitions. You will recall that both Rhiag and PGW have lower gross margins than our historical businesses. Excluding the 2 big acquisitions, gross margins were actually up about 60 basis points. While the consolidated gross margins were down, consolidated operating expenses as a percent of revenue were also down about 200 basis points lower than last year. Some of that reflects the impact of the different margin structure of the 2 acquisitions and some of it reflects improved efficiencies in the historical businesses. 
Segment EBITDA totaled $274 million for the quarter, reflecting a 32% increase from 2015. And as a percent of revenue, segment EBITDA was 11.5%, a 20 basis point improvement over the 11.3% recorded last year. On a year-over-year basis, we experienced a $3.8 million increase in restructuring costs related to the integration of our acquisitions. Depreciation and amortization was up about $26 million, mostly related to the addition of Rhiag and PGW. The same holds true for interest expense, which was up about $12 million. And with that, pretax income increased 16% in the quarter relative to last year. 
Our effective tax rate during the quarter was 31.7%, down from the 33.9% recorded in 2015. This lower rate reflects an ongoing rate of 34.75% and a $5 million benefit associated with the adoption of ASU 2016-09, which addresses tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation. All companies need to adopt this new accounting standard by the first quarter of 2017 and we elected to adopt early. We have excluded this benefit from our adjusted EPS calculation in order to provide an apples-to-apples comparison. 
Diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.40, which was up 21% compared to last year. Adjusted EPS, again excluding restructuring charges, intangible asset amortization and the discrete tax benefit just mentioned, was $0.45 versus $0.36, reflecting a 25% improvement. Scrap had a small negative impact on earnings per share for the quarter, about $0.005, and currency fluctuations negatively impacted EPS growth by about $0.01 as well. 
As highlighted on Page 13, the composition of our revenue continues to change due to the impact of acquisitions. Since each of our segments has a different margin structure, this revenue mix shift impacts the trend in consolidated margins. This has become more accentuated with our ownership of both Rhiag and PGW. And you saw a shift in the third quarter metrics wherein North American parts and services revenue accounted for less than 40% of total consolidated revenue. 
And with that, let's get into the details on the segments. Total revenue in our North American segment during the third quarter of 2016 increased to $1,047,000,000 or about 1% over 2015. This is the combination of a 2.3% growth rate in parts and services, offset by a 9.5% decline in other revenue, the latter of which was due primarily to lower volumes and to a lesser extent, lower prices received for a variety of metals. 
When looking at the North American growth, it's important to recognize that there were variations across the platform. As Rob mentioned, there were geographic differences with the Central and West regions performing much better than the Northeast and Midwest regions. Recycling grew at a faster rate than aftermarket. And even within aftermarket, certain parts types, like the core Keystone fenders, hoods and lights, grew faster than some other products related to cooling or aluminum wheels. So there were spots of strength and spots of weakness. 
Gross margins in North America during the third quarter of 2016 were 43.8%, a 160 basis point increase over last year. Approximately 90 basis points of the improvement relates to the aftermarket operations. And the benefits of the procurement initiatives accounted for approximately 50 basis points of the 90 basis point improvement. Our salvage and self-service operations contributed 70 basis points of increase to the North American gross margins. You will note that while scrap averaged $118 a ton during Q3, in October, scrap has rolled back down to slightly below $100 a ton. 
With respect to operating expenses in our North American segment, we lost about 50 basis points of margin compared to the comparable quarter of 2015. On the upside, we continue to experience improvements in both fuel and facilities costs relative to last year. On the downside, we lost a bit of margin in personnel cost and freight expense. In total, EBITDA for the North American business during the third quarter of 2016 was $141 million. As a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the segment was 13.5% in Q3 of 2016, an increase of 110 basis points from the 12.4% reported in the comparable period of last year. 
Last call, we indicated that we expected the benefit of our productivity initiatives to pick up as we move throughout the year. As just mentioned, we saw some benefits in our cost of goods sold related to the procurement savings in connection with our aftermarket parts inventory. In addition, there are procurement benefits in other expense categories across North America. In total, we estimate the aggregate benefit of the productivity initiatives during the third quarter was approximately $8.6 million, up from the $5 million reported in Q2 or a little bit less than $0.02 a share. 
Moving on to our European segment. The total revenue in the third quarter accelerated to $770 million from $511 million, a 51% increase. Organic growth for parts and services in Europe during the third quarter was 6.7%, reflecting the combination of 6.9% growth at ECP and 5.1% growth at Sator. The impact of the acquisitions in Europe resulted in an additional 55% increase in revenue with the most significant amount reflecting the addition of Rhiag. So on a constant currency basis, European parts and services revenue was up 61%. These constant currency increases were offset by an 11% decline due to the translation impact of the strong dollar, particularly relative to the pound sterling. 
As you can see on Page 19, the average rate during the quarter was about 15% below last year and the sterling was at $1.30 at quarter-end. More recently, the sterling has fallen a further 7%, down to $1.22, and the euro is also down about 3% to $1.09. The translation impact of these latest drops will weigh on our reported U.S. dollar results for the rest of the year probably to the tune of about $0.01 in the fourth quarter. 
Gross margins in Europe were 36.2%, a 210 basis point decline from the comparable period of last year, largely reflecting the impact of Rhiag. As mentioned in prior calls, Rhiag has a lower gross margin structure than either ECP or Sator. During Q3, Rhiag had a gross margin of about 33.5%, which reduced the consolidated European gross margin by about 150 basis points. Excluding the impact of Rhiag, gross margins decreased 60 basis points primarily due to ECP, which experienced an increase in customer rebates and the impact of some of the incremental cost of the new distribution facility in Tamworth rolling through cost of goods sold. 
With respect to operating expenses as a percent of revenue, we experienced a 150 basis point improvement on a consolidated European basis. We benefited from a 240 basis point reduction in operating expenses due to the addition of Rhiag, which has lower operating expenses as a percent of revenue than ECP or Sator. Offsetting these gains was an 80 basis point increase in facility and warehouse expense, reflecting some of the cost of the Tamworth facility as well as new branches and hubs at ECP. In addition, we lost about 30 basis points of margin in the U.K. related to the impact of translation losses on inventory purchases, which are denominated in a foreign currency. 
With respect to the Tamworth project, the incremental costs related to this project in the third quarter were approximately GBP 2 million or about $2.6 million. Again, some of this was recorded in cost of goods sold and some in SG&A. In total, it reflects a 30 basis point impact on European margins. 
European EBITDA totaled $73 million, a 38% increase over last year, reflecting a solid performance at ECP and Sator and the positive impact of Rhiag. As a percent of revenue, European EBITDA margins in the third quarter were 9.4% versus 10.3% last year, a 90 basis point decline, again 30 basis points of which relate to the Tamworth project. 
Turning to our Specialty segment. Revenue for the third quarter totaled $313 million, a 10% increase over the comparable quarter of last year. The organic growth rate was 3.7% while the impact of the acquisition of Coast in August of 2015 added 6.2% to revenue growth. In the last couple of calls, we indicated that the high level of organic growth in Specialty was not sustainable. And overall, we were happy with the third quarter growth rate. Gross margins in our Specialty segment for the third quarter were flat compared to last year as the impact of stocking 2 new Specialty distribution centers in Michigan and Washington state, which were not in operation at this time last year, was offset by an increase in the advertising credits. 
Operating expenses as a percent of revenue in Specialty were down about 100 basis points. Facility expense increased to certain costs related to the 2 new distribution centers just mentioned. But on the plus side, we continued to see SG&A leverage from integrating the acquisitions into our existing network as well as the benefit of the lower fuel prices. EBITDA for Specialty was $32 million in the quarter, up 24% from the third quarter of last year. And as a percent of revenue, EBITDA for the Specialty segment increased 120 basis points to 10.4% in 2016 compared to 9.2% last year. Remember, this is a highly seasonal business, and you should assume these margins will decline as we move through the historically soft Q4 period. 
On Page 22, you can see the impact of the acquisition of PGW. Revenue for the quarter was $259 million while gross margins in Q3 were 22.6%, which is very consistent with the expectations we highlighted at the time the transaction was announced. EBITDA margins for PGW were 10.7% in the third quarter. 
Let's move on to capital allocation. As presented on Slide 23, you will note that our after-tax cash flow from operations during the first 9 months was approximately $524 million as we experienced strong cash earnings and only a moderate increase in working capital. During the first 9 months of 2016, we deployed a little bit more than $1.9 billion of capital to support the growth of our businesses, including $153 million to fund capital expenditures and about $1.8 billion to acquire businesses. We closed the quarter with approximately $272 million of cash, of which $226 million was held outside of the U.S. And we had roughly $3.3 billion of total debt outstanding. So our net debt was approximately $3 billion. And on a pro forma basis, taking into account the impact of the acquisitions, our net leverage was a little bit less than 2.7x latest 12 months EBITDA. At quarter-end, the total availability under our credit facility was approximately $1.2 billion, which we believe is more than sufficient to support the continued growth of our business.  
Finally, as noted in our press release, we have provided updated guidance on some of our key financial metrics for 2016. As relates to the organic growth for parts and services, we reduced the organic growth guidance for full year 2016 to 4.5% to 5%, reflecting the 5.1% rate for the first 9 months and an expectation that we don't anticipate any major movements during the fourth quarter. For those trying to back into the Q4 growth, the range implies a 2.6% to 4.6% growth rate. But it is important to note that there is 1 less business day in Q4 of 2016 than Q4 of 2015. And while that may sound trivial, it's 1.5% fewer business day compared to last year. Customers don't buy more on other days to make up the difference, so the calendar simply puts us in a 1.5% hole at the start. In addition, the hurricane earlier this month closed some of our operations and some of our customers' operations in Florida and the Carolinas for a couple of days. 
Our range for adjusted EPS, which excludes the after-tax impact of intangible amortization and the tax benefit of adopting ASU 2016-09, is $1.78 to $1.84 per share with a midpoint of $1.81. As in the past, we have narrowed the range to reflect the fact that we are 9 months through the year. The new range reflects the fact that Q3 results were right on track and the outlook for the core business for the rest of the year is largely unchanged, except for the anticipated headwinds from currencies, lower scrap prices and the dilutive impact of owning Andrew Page as a completely independent company without the ability to integrate operations. To be clear, the new EPS guidance assumes pound sterling and euro exchange rates of $1.22 and $1.09, respectively, and importantly, that scrap remains at current levels as well. 
Our assumed tax rate for 2016 remains at 34.75%, excluding the benefit of adopting the new accounting pronouncement. Our current guidance for cash flow from operations also narrowed a bit to approximately $575 million to $600 million. And the guidance for capital spending is unchanged at $200 million to $225 million. 
At this point in time, I'll turn the call back over to Rob to wrap up."

As a company, we are always focused on financial performance, but we are equally focused on facing change head-on and rapidly adapting in order to continuously deliver positive results for our stockholders, employees and most importantly, our customers. There is no question that weather impacted various lines of business and many markets for our company thus far in 2016, a similar scenario to what we witnessed in 2012. We firmly believe that like 2012, this impact is temporary and that the macro trends continue to present opportunities for all of our segments. 
Yet we don't rest on our laurels and simply blame softness in our business on uncontrollable circumstances. Rather, during those periods, we strive to maintain our historical growth rates and our leading positions by focusing on what we can control, such as the margin improvements we recognized in this quarter. It is clear, as headwinds present themselves, our team of nearly 41,000 employees globally actively adjust to market conditions to effectively and profitably manage their businesses, not only for today but to position us well for the future. This focus allowed us again to deliver double-digit EPS growth in the midst of a challenging environment. So a big thank you to the LKQ team.
