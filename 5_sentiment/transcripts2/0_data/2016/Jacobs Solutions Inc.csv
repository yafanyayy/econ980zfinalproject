We welcome everyone to Jacobs' 2016 first quarter earnings call. I will be joined on the call today by Steve Demetriou, our President and CEO.
As you know, our earnings announcement and Form 10-Q were released this morning and we will be posting a copy of a slide presentation to our website, which we will reference in our prepared remarks. 
Before starting, I would like to refer you to our forward-looking statement, which is summarized on Slide 2. Any statements that we make today that are not based on historical fact are forward-looking statements. Although such statements are based on our current estimates and expectations and currently available competitive, financial and economic data, forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and you should not place undue reliance on such statements as actual results may differ materially. There are a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause Jacobs' actual results to differ materially from what may be contained, adjusted or implied by our forward-looking statements. For a description of some of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that may occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, see our most recent earnings release and quarterly report on Form 10-Q as well as our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended October 2, 2015, including Item 1A, risk factors, Item 3, legal proceedings and Item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as well as our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
So let's get into the call officially. Let's turn to Slide 3 for a quick review of the agenda for today's call. Steve will begin with the highlight of our first quarter, followed by an update on the business and recent key initiatives. He will also provide some commentary on end market conditions for our 4 lines of business as well as highlight some recent high-profile project awards. I will then provide a more in-depth discussion on our financial metrics including our backlog and current restructuring efforts. I will continue with some comments on our revenue to operating profit split and some comments on capital allocation. Steve will then finish by highlighting certain initiatives we are undertaking in our project delivery and sales centers of excellence, and we will then conclude with some closing comments. Finally, we will open it up for some questions. 
With that, let me pass it over to Steve Demetriou, our President and CEO. Steve?"

Welcome to our fiscal year 2016 first quarter earnings call. On Slide 4, and before I summarize the numbers, I want to mention how I continue to be impressed with our Jacobs BeyondZero commitment, and I'm extremely pleased that our first",2471,"Thank you, Kevin. Welcome to our fiscal year 2016 first quarter earnings call. On Slide 4, and before I summarize the numbers, I want to mention how I continue to be impressed with our Jacobs BeyondZero commitment, and I'm extremely pleased that our first quarter's safety performance continued to trend positively. Not only is this important from a standpoint of culture of caring for our employees, but it's equally appreciated by our customers who similarly prioritize safety excellence. 
So now on to our first quarter business performance. And as we previously projected in last quarter's earnings call, we faced a challenging global economic environment at the start of our fiscal year. Adverse market conditions, particularly in oil and mining, continue to have a significant impact on our businesses. However, demonstrating the strength of our diverse portfolio, growth markets such as aerospace and technology and pharmabio helped us mitigate some of the pressures from our more challenged sectors. Our revenue from the quarter was $2.85 billion and our backlog at quarter end was down 3% versus last quarter at $18.2 billion, what I consider to be a solid performance within the context of current market condition.
I'm very pleased with how the global Jacobs organization has proactively responded to the challenging global market conditions in terms of rightsizing our cost structure and focusing on project delivery excellence. The previously announced companywide restructuring initiative helped reduce first quarter G&A cost by 13% versus last year, and project execution performance trended in the right direction. As a result, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.78 including an approximate $0.09 per share of discrete tax benefit in line with expectations. Our balance sheet remains strong and should further strengthen as our heightened focus on working capital starts to take hold over the next several quarters.
Turning to Slide 5, I'd like to comment on several of our key improvement initiatives. In the first quarter, we continued to successfully implement both the cost restructuring and organizational realignment that were launched last fiscal year. With regard to the restructuring, we continue to identify additional cost reductions and believe we have opportunities to further streamline and achieve more efficiencies as we progress through this year. As it relates to the new line of business organization, I'm very pleased with the quality and speed of implementation by the Jacobs leadership team and the excitement and [indiscernible] of all our employees across the globe. We've been progressing on a number of companywide priorities including strengthening of leadership accountability, improving project delivery and launching a strategic review of Jacobs. However, most importantly, a top priority is getting back to winning business and growing the company.
With regard to the strategy efforts, we're conducting an economic review of our entire portfolio. While this will feed into the next phase of the strategic plan development, we will immediately utilize the facts and insight to set near-term profit improvement goals for the company and each line of business. The strategic plan initiative we ultimately developed will be focus on how to profitably grow Jacobs. We will present this at our Analyst Day in the fourth quarter.
And before turning to the next slide, I'd like to mention that beginning with next quarter's results, we'll report our segments consistent and aligned with our new lines of business. During our Investor Day last quarter, we presented a backlog for the new structure on a preliminary basis. As we implemented a companywide realignment across more than 60,000 employees and more than 30 countries, we're updating our financial systems to align with the new lines of business. With that, I'll now turn to Slide 6 and provide a more in-depth discussion on each of our 4 business lines. 
I'll begin with our petroleum and chemicals business. Backlog for the group currently stands at $6.2 billion, which is marginally lower than last quarter due mainly to the severe downturn in the upstream petroleum side of the business. As you all know, this line of business continues to face very challenging global market conditions. The significant decline in oil prices has had a major impact on many of our customers' cash flows and capital spend, especially in the upstream side of the oil and gas market. For example, a recent Wood Mackenzie report indicated that nearly $400 billion in global spend on new oil and gas projects has been shelved since the crude price [indiscernible]. In addition the amount of deferred capital in this industry has increased from $200 billion to $380 billion since June. Three years ago, very few would've imagined $30 crude oil today and there's a lot of uncertainty in the oil and gas markets.
With crude inventories at record highs, the [indiscernible] sanctions were moved, the supply demand and balance is widening and we are preparing for the overhang to continue. We've been able to partially mitigate these severe headwinds as a result of our industry-leading position in the resilient Middle East market as well as a strong focus on sustaining capital and maintenance across the oil and gas sector. 
The refining segment remains solid for Jacobs. The U.S. market is being supported by exports and lower fuel costs are encouraging demand. New emissions rules in the U.S. are increasing investment in appellation capacity, which is an area of strength for Jacobs. Refining demand in developing countries is also expected to increase at more than 3% and our Europe projects are continuing to be driven by regulatory and environmental process safety opportunities.
We're also seeing our plans to diversify into value-added specialty products while also focusing on energy efficiency and yield improvement of existing assets. However, most of the major integrated petrochemical companies have announced staffing and budget cuts impacting our demand with these clients. All in all, we remain steady in the petrochemical sector.
And in this petroleum and chemicals business line, I'm very pleased with some of the major recent wins including a very significant EPCM global partnership agreement with BASF. An EPCM service contract with Nippon Shokubai for a super absorbent polymer plant in Belgium and an EPCM services agreement for one of the world's largest oil companies. 
So now turning to Slide 7 and before discussing our industrial business, I'd like to recap this week's announcements regarding a change on our leadership team. I've asked Andy Kramer, president of our industrial group, to move into a new executive advisory role to provide leadership on several priority initiatives continuing to report to me. Robert Pragada who was previously an executive at Jacobs and more recently CEO of the Brock Group, a leading specialty trade contractor, started this week as the new president of our industrial line of business. To capitalize on Bob's strong experience in construction, he will also lead our field services units in North America and the U.K. I'm excited to welcome Bob back to Jacobs. While at Jacobs from 2006 to 2014, Bob was highly respected by our employees and customers as a strong leader with an impressive track record in sales and operations.
Our industrial group's backlog is at $2.4 billion, down slightly from last quarter. The industrial line of business includes life sciences, specialty chemicals and manufacturing and mining and minerals. I do want to mention that backlog presented does not yet include the incremental field services that Bob Pragada will be responsible for and will shift over to his business line when we report results next quarter.
Firstly, our life sciences group us delivering exciting growth as evidenced by major project awards throughout the past year from Biogen, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Genzyme. As a leading EPCM and commissioning qualification and validation project delivery firm in biopharma, we are well positioned to profitably grow in this sector. Our footprint resource base and technical expertise spans multiple geographies including the high-growth Europe and Asia regions. Our objective is to remain the employer and supplier of choice, expand our industry-leading service offerings and to continue to support our clients' investments into exciting new products.
Meanwhile, we're seeing steady demand in specialty chemicals and manufacturing with signs of improvement in several areas. This business unit includes pulp and paper, consumer products and inorganic chemicals. Domestic demand in pulp and paper remains flat, but we are expanding internationally. Consumer goods is a relatively untapped opportunity for Jacobs. We're building key client alliances to selectively grow in this market. We're also seeing improving market conditions for our Comprimo sulfur business that's being driven by recent environmental legislation in several countries. 
The fertilizer market continues to attract investment, driving new opportunities for our Chemetics and phosphate technology businesses. Our mining and minerals group continues to be impacted by weak commodity prices. Major spending has been severely curtailed in response to the weak metal price environment and current oversupply. The supply demand imbalance will correct over time but we're not planning for a recovery in 2016. We continue to proudly mitigate this by increasing our focus on sustaining capital projects and [indiscernible]. I'm also impressed with our team's performance as we are winning more than our fair share of the few large metals mining projects in South America, Africa and Asia Pacific. Also a positive for Jacobs is the ongoing investment in fertilizer projects, particularly phosphate mines and related chemical plants especially in Africa, North America and the Middle East.
In the industrial business line, we were recently awarded an EPCM contract from Biogen for a new state-of-the-art facility at Switzerland. This came on the [indiscernible] of other major awards for our life sciences group. Noteworthy, we recently won a sustaining capital projects contract with Alcoa of Australia. 
So now turning to Slide 8. Our buildings and infrastructure backlog remains steady at $4.7 billion. This line of business for Jacobs is quite diverse and spans a variety of markets including health care, education, aviation, water, rail, highways and power. On the building side, we continue to see growth in the U.S. and U.K. at the state and regional level. In education, K-12 projects in high-growth cities are particularly bright spots. The Affordable Care Act is also continuing to impact the U.S. health care industry and higher use of plant and outpatient telemedicine facilities is driving a step change in the market. We're on the forefront of this plant and helping our client to depth for the use of advanced planning and modular technique. Mission-critical markets are also positive and continue to grow and develop globally. In the commercial building industry, we're continuing to focus on several key customer relationships, where we are leveraging our oil and gas, chemical and pharmabio expertise to expand our offerings in cross-company synergies. One example of this is our ongoing involvement with one of our major integrated petroleum clients on several of their offices and building projects globally.
Meanwhile, we're seeing positive global growth in our infrastructure business, particularly in aviation, highways and rail. Australian and Asian transportation sectors are noteworthy growth spots, driven by population growth and economic stimulus. Rail is certainly growing and we're seeing a mixture of high-speed rail as well as passenger and class 1 freight being developed in multiple regions. We are well positioned in the U.S. for upcoming [indiscernible] initiatives to expand light rail and continue to be the largest provider of rail design to network rail in the U.K. We're also continuing to position our resources for global aviation opportunities given that air-traffic projections are forecast to grow over the next decade in most regions. An example of the positive change at Jacobs is our successful leveraging of capabilities from the U.S. to support ongoing work with the Brisbane airport expansion in Australia.
With regard to some recent awards, in addition to the network rail win in the U.K., our buildings and infrastructure group won a major U.S. Military program that we hope to announce in the next few months and we've been awarded a significant architectural engineering design project on an airport transportation program in Europe.
Also as recently announced, we acquired JL Patterson and Associates. JL Patterson brings additional consulting and professional services engineering capability in rail planning, environmental permitting, design and construction management. The acquisition enhance Jacobs' rail services capabilities on the West Coast and positions the company in the top tier of rail professional service providers in North America. So in summary, we believe our global buildings and infrastructure business has high potential growth opportunities and we're well positioned to leverage our expertise in several exciting markets.
Moving to Slide 9. Our aerospace and technology business is experiencing positive momentum. Backlog stands at $4.9 billion and excludes over $250 million in contracts that were awarded to us in the first quarter but not yet posted in our bookings due to elevated levels of protest. We're seeing positive dynamics associated with Federal government funding in both the U.S. and the U.K. after recent budget agreement. This provides greater certainty and stability for the programs that we support. However, as I mentioned, in this market, the procurement cycles are being extended and more awards protested. Relating to this, our military range operations and maintenance strategic growth initiatives are starting to pay dividends as the investments we have made over the past couple of years resulted in the award of multiple new contracts to Jacobs during the summer. While those awards have been protested, something that is fairly normal in today's U.S. Federal contracting environment, we're confident of a favorable outcome.
Meanwhile, our cyber security, counterterrorism and intelligence-related markets remain strong. Strategic investments such as our 2014 FMS acquisition are continuing to show benefits and we're building strengths and capabilities to support additional growth in this market. We have a strong pipeline for advanced test and evaluation facilities with both the. U.S. government and the commercial automotive industry. 
We're also seeing opportunities in the traditional environmental services sector. Of particular note is an emerging market driven by new regulations pertaining to the management of pulp combustion residuals. This is expected to be a multibillion dollar per year market and our differentiating experience with some of the major players positions as well. We're also experiencing positive trends in the nuclear sector associated with new build primarily in the U.K. and continue to pursue selective growth opportunities in this sector.
Recent key wins such as the 10-year facility support services contracts at NASA's Ames Research Center and engineering services and skills augmentation contract option with NASA at Marshal Flight Center and the EPCM spend nuclear handle project at the Idaho National Laboratory show the diversity and strength of this business. The aerospace and technology group has a good balance between discrete and long-term project work, and we expect to announce several additional wins that will bolster this group in the near future. 
I'll now pass to Kevin to present more details on our financials."
282159,321880609,925537,"Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Jacobs Solutions Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. I'm now turning to Slide 11 as you follow along. As a we've previously highlighted in our last earnings call, we were projecting a tough first half of the year.

As a we've previously highlighted in our last earnings call, we were projecting a tough first half of the year. As a result, on a GAAP basis, revenue was $2.85 billion, as Steve noted, which is down 11% from a year ago. On a constant currency basis, revenues were down 7%. Gross margin dollars were $441 million. Importantly, and consistent with our expectations outlined in our last earnings call, our professional services gross margin percentage should pack up in the quarter to levels above our full year gross margin percentage of last year. This improvement was somewhat mitigated by the mix impact associated with lower margin field services and a greater percentage of our business in Q1.
As noted by Steve, tough comps controls drove our D&A down by more than $48 million versus the year ago. This was down over 13% and speaks to the aggressive measures we have taken and will continue to take to reduce costs in light of the current economic environment. As a result, adjusted operating profit was in line with our expectations at $128 million for the quarter. Although our adjusted EPS of $0.78 was up 1% versus a year ago, it is important to note that the figure does include a discrete tax benefit of $0.09 in the quarter. To the positive, excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements versus last year, adjusted EPS could've increased to $0.80, up 4% versus the year ago period.
Our backlog stands at $18.2 billion and our book-to-bill on a trailing 12 basis was 0.92. I will provide a little bit more color on these figures in a minute. Finally, operating working capital was $886 million. Cash was at $444 million and net debt was at $181 million. Our balance sheet as a result continues to remain strong, while repurchasing approximately 1 million shares during the quarter in line with our expected execution of our recently announced 3-year share buyback program. 
So moving to Slide 12, let me provide some further color on our backlog. Again, backlog currently stands at a combined $18.2 billion. This is down slightly from our last earnings call and 5% from a record high of $19.1 billion a year ago. The decrease from a year ago was driven by a combination of workoff [ph] from existing projects, a softer sales quarter this year versus the near record quarter a year ago and a significant negative foreign exchange impact versus the year ago period of almost $500 million. From last quarter alone, the foreign exchange impact was over $100 million. Excluding the impact of the foreign exchange movements versus last quarter and versus a year ago, our backlog was down less than 3% from last quarter and only through 2% from our record high in Q1 a year ago. 
With regard to our professional engineering services backlog, this now stands at $11.4 billion, a slight reduction of 2% from last quarter and, of course, some of that was due to our foreign exchange dynamic. Our field services backlog was down by 4% versus last quarter but it is, in fact, up significantly from a year ago. Our backlog at the end of the quarter again exemplifies the benefits of our diversity where certain of our lines of business that target customers and stronger end markets has held steady and helped mitigate some of the pressures from reduced CapEx spending by oil and gas and mining customers.
So let me turn to Slide 13, where I would like to give you an update on the restructuring effort that was announced last year in July. As previously communicated, the focus of our restructuring has been to simplify Jacobs globally and to enhance our cost effectiveness. We believe our efforts will ultimately provide Jacobs with the ability to deliver satisfactory profit levels regardless of the economic environment in which we are operating. While many of the original restructuring efforts are at various stages of implementation, a recently announced reorganization is now supporting the identification of additional savings opportunities as we evaluate actions that could benefit the business longer term. Our efforts continue to be focused on a fixed cost infrastructure primarily in labor and real estate. Given the incremental opportunities identified as part of the reorganization, we are now forecasting the total one-time cost of our restructuring effort that was initiated in 2015 to approach $250 million with annualized savings between $180 million and $200 million. This compares actually to our original savings estimate of a year ago when we announced the program of $130 million to $150 [ph] million in annualized savings. Importantly, the cash portion of our cost and savings noted above approximate 55%  and 85%, respectively, resulting in a cash payback of the program of less than one year.
So turning to Slide 14, we showed this at our earnings -- at our Investor Day last quarter. You'll see our preliminary revenue and operating profit mix for the quarter. As you know, we are one of the most diversified E&C companies in the world. Our revenue and profit mix continues to evolve, indicating the strength of that diversity. For Q1, you will note that the petroleum and chemicals line of business represented the largest percentage of our total revenues. However, our buildings and infrastructure and aerospace and technology businesses combined represented more than 50% of the total overall profitability of the company. Importantly, these businesses are not impacted by the current headwinds seen in our oil and gas and mining and minerals end markets.
Of course, some of the differences and profitability of across our lines of business, and specifically for our petroleum and chemicals business, is that somehow is the larger portion of our field services work. As you know, field service tends to have lower margin levels given its higher percentage -- excuse me of pass-through revenues. 
I want to note that these pie charts represent estimates at this point in time and our new segment reporting will become effective at our Q2 reporting period even though we are now beginning to manage the business consistent with our new organizational structure. As a result, our final reported information would somewhat change given the finalization of our segments and segment reporting including the determination of field services within each line of business. Regardless, a power of our diversified portfolio is proving advantageous. While we see certain of our businesses facing incremental pressures, particularly from reduced CapEx in the oil and gas and mining sectors, other parts of the portfolio are expected to help to mitigate some of those pressures providing late greater levels of stability and our growing sales and profits.
So before handing it back over to Steve, I also want to provide an update on capital allocation on Slide 15. As highlighted last quarter, we spent $422 million in share buybacks during fiscal year 2015 and fully utilized the 2014 share buyback authorization of $500 million. During Q4 of 2015, we announced a new $500 million share buyback authorization with a term of 3 years. During Q1, we began executing against that program in a measured approach consistent with our guidance. We remain confident in our ability to generate sustainable, long-term cash flow, and we continue to believe our share buyback program is an appropriate use of cash given the company's long-term value creation outlook. A strong cash flow dynamic supports our ability to return capital to our shareholders while still providing flexibility to support our growth aspirations longer term. Finally, as evidenced by working capital and accounts receivable performance improvement targets now being part of our annual incentive program, we also believe we can improve our cash flow this year and longer term which will further support our facility going forward. 
So with that, let me hand it back over to Steve for some additional comments."
282159,321880609,925537,"Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Jacobs Solutions Inc.","Executives","Great. Thank you, Kevin.

As part of our reorganization, we established a global sales center of excellence. This is a critical step that enables us to transition from the previously centralized sales approach to a simplified organization and better integrates overall business accountability within each line of business, with the ultimate objective of driving sales to a much higher level of performance. Team near-term objectives by the sales centers of excellence include ensuring that we attract, retain and develop the highest caliber sales team for sustained competitive advantage and also to drive increasing sales effectiveness with a focus on innovation and best practices that result in clear value to our clients and significant profitable growth. While it's early days, we're seeing strong ownership and buy-in from our global salesforce who are now fully integrated in the lines of business and we believe this positions us well to get back on a solid growth path. More in the coming quarters on specific progress.
Turning to Slide 18. As I mentioned last quarter, further strengthening project delivery is a top priority of Jacobs. Our new project delivery center of excellence is up and running and playing a more prominent role in the successful management delivery of our projects. This is driving increased focus and accountability across the organization. We're also implementing a number of specific project delivery related initiatives to improve performance including upgraded tools and better standardization across global offices. The initiatives will both strengthen our project performance and reduce our operating cost. Each line of business has appointed a project delivery leader who's accountable to ensure adherence to best practices and procedures. These initiatives are designed to have both an immediate and a long-term impact.
So turning to the last slide, and to summarize, we continue to hold to our previous fiscal year 2016 guidance. While our first quarter results met expectations, we continue to believe that the first half will be impacted by the difficult market conditions. And as a result, we expect our underlying second quarter results versus a year ago to be similarly challenged as was our first quarter results. The economic dynamics of commodities such as oil and mining will continue to impact our business. However, we remain cautiously optimistic on the second half of the year as cost-saving benefits ramp up and our market strategies play out in certain businesses. We're already reaping benefits from the restructuring and newly established organization and we expect it will yield additional improvements as we move through fiscal year 2016.
We're seeing a clear energy building across Jacobs. With senior leadership solidified, our focus is now on winning business and successfully delivering projects for our customers. Our value proposition and focus on key client relationships, market and portfolio diversification, smart use of cash and fostering great talent are all helping to get Jacobs back on track to grow profitably. To support our business, greater clarity on strategic growth is needed and so we're underway with our strategic review. We believe the initiatives we have undertaken and those we continue to implement are aligned with shareholders' interest and will ensure we are well positioned to drive long-term profitable growth. 
So with that, I'd like to thank you for listening and we'll now open it up for questions. Operator?"

We did refer to a major chemical prospect and we did announce that with that BASF project recently and so we're going to see the benefits of that now start as we start earning some of that benefit. And we do have some really interesting prospects that we hope to lay out here over the next several quarters that contribute to the backlog. I mentioned that $250 million aerospace and technology wins that we have not put in the backlog because we want to finish up the protest activity but we're very confident that, that will hit the books here in 2016. So we can't give any sort of specifics on where the backlog is going other than we're pretty excited about our prospects. And as I mentioned, it's all hands on to start getting back to growth."

But all in all, when we look at to start to really analyze and we'll have more information that we can share starting in the second quarter when we report line of business results, we're pretty pleased with how margins are holding up. We're maximizing our high-value execution center in India and a lot of our customers are locking in on that. So we can have a win-win with our customers on sharing the benefit of work share between multiple offices including India. A lot of -- if I look at aerospace and technology for example, a lot of the new business that are winning is higher-margin, long-term business and it's replacing lower margin business that's falling off the books.

Clearly, we're seeing positive momentum in the infrastructure side, some specific initiatives being driven by the fact that the Federal spending outlook is more positive than, say, it was a year ago. And with the recent budget approval, we're seeing more certainty especially at the state regional level around our infrastructure side. Some of it's very regional. We're seeing strong demand in Texas, West Coast, Florida, for example, in the infrastructure side. When we look at the whole market, mission-critical is something we're pretty excited about and strong and believe we have excellent growth. And part of it, though, is the timing. We were impacted in the first quarter in mission-critical and it was just simply our customers making some decisions on timing that were different than our expectations, but we expect to play it out as the year unfolds. So we're pretty diverse in building an infrastructure as I outlined and so there's lots of activity. This is clearly a business that there's a lot of small wins that add up to what we believe is something that could be very positive as we unfold our strategy. The infrastructure comment around the Middle East, I would say, is not positive. Yes, there's a concern that in the Middle East, as oil prices have dropped, there could be some delays in infrastructure spending.

As prices have collapsed, there's a lot of production, and so we're seeing a lot of sustaining capital and maintenance and safety, environmental across the globe. And we are one of the major players in that sector and it is a big piece of our business, and so that's enabling us to hold up in a very difficult environment. Specifically, refining, we're doing a great job on the independent refiners who are benefiting from the lower crude oil and our spending may be a higher rate as compared to the integrated players and we've got some good wins in that sector. And I think our new focus with the line of business in petroleum and chemicals is demonstrating some early success in that arena. And on the chemicals side, as a lot of these ethylene initiatives and cracker initiatives are going up, there's going to a lot of byproduct activity in specialty chemicals and derivatives, ethylene oxide, ethylene glycol, et cetera, and that's where -- that's in our sweet spot and we're pretty positive about what's going to unfold there as it relates to chemicals.

And then you add on top of that, in the past, we were somewhat overdependent on key large players in those sectors. In the past year or so, there's been a big push to diversify and spread our wings across that industry. And so we are gaining a lot of new customers that we haven't had in the past.

So the line of business reorganization has been implemented and so they're -- we're up and running now managing under these 4 lines of businesses and going extremely well. A lot of excitement coming out especially as now, for the first time, we have these for business presidents able to have a clearer picture of how these sectors roll up globally and the opportunities to drive efficiency and across this market strategies that, among several other things, that we believe are going to lead to improved profits and growth over the long term. And so I would say, generally, it's been impressive on the speed and execution. Everybody's locked in on it and I think it's going to help us form our strategy now over the next several months as we undergo strategic review on each of the lines of businesses. And each of them are dissecting their portfolio and seeing some very interesting things that hopefully we can impact in the short term. So I would say, we're not trying to overly hype it, it's hard for me to think of any negative lessons learned and that, generally, everybody has -- is building momentum. And the main reason that it's moving so quickly and building momentum is, as I came into the company, as I mentioned before, this isn't something that I decided that from my past was the right way to run the company. It was just an overwhelming set of inputs to us that we need to move in this direction that we're -- we have tremendous opportunity that we can focus in, integrated and hold accountable global lines of businesses. And so I think that's a main reason why I'm pretty positive about the way it unfolds."

And so even in this difficult environment, it feels like there's good opportunity out there, but clearly, pressures that we have to manage through and the changeover in our backlog for example that is working off some old business as we get out there and execute the type of things that I'm talking about. And so I think it's uncertain. We're not banking on oil prices going up or mining prices going up. When they do, we're going to be positioned extremely well because of our more efficient and even more efficient cost structure in the future. And so we're excited about when that happens, we'll be position well. But as we talk now in the near term, it's all about going after opportunities that are in front of us and it feels like those opportunities should also allow us to see some modest growth as we execute them over the near term."

First thing is we do expect our cash flow to improve over the balance of the year versus first quarter. And the first quarter typically, it's not always the case because depending upon what the end balance sheet data is, there can be fluctuations by quarter. Generally speaking, Q1 tends to be one of our softer cash flow quarters. And so I fundamentally do believe that there will be improvements over the balance of the year. I did make a comment in the prepared remarks that we expect to start to generate some improvements in our working capital efforts and we do believe that will translate into improvements in cash flow over the balance of the year. So I think that that's the focus area for us on the balance of 2016 [ph]. And clearly, if we make progress there, we fundamentally believe those are sustainable going forward, which translates into our ability to be able to improve cash flows longer term.

As you know, our earnings announcement and Form 10-Q were released this morning, and we will be posting a copy of the slide presentation to our website, which we will reference in our prepared remarks.
Before starting, I would like to refer you to our forward-looking statement, which is summarized on Slide 2. Any statements that we make today that are not based on historical fact are forward-looking statements. Although such statements are based on our current estimates and expectations and currently available competitive, financial and economic data, forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements as actual results may differ materially. There are a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause Jacobs' actual results to differ materially from what may be contained, projected or implied by our forward-looking statements. For a description of some of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that may occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, see our most recent earnings release and quarterly report on Form 10-Q as well as our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended October 2, 2015, including Item 1A - Risk Factors, Item 3 - Legal Proceedings and Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as well as our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
So let's get into the call officially. Let's turn to Slide 3 for a quick review of the agenda for today's call. Steve will begin with the highlight of our first quarter, followed by an update on the business and recent key initiatives. He will also provide some commentary on end market conditions for our 4 lines of business as well as highlight some recent high-profile project awards. I will then provide a more in-depth discussion on our financial metrics, including our backlog and current restructuring efforts. I will continue with some comments on our revenue to operating profit split and some comments on capital allocation. Steve will then finish by highlighting certain initiatives we are undertaking in our project delivery and sales centers of excellence, and we will then conclude with some closing comments. Finally, we will open it up for some questions.
With that, let me pass it over to Steve Demetriou, our President and CEO. Steve?"

Welcome to our fiscal year 2016 first quarter earnings call. On Slide 4, and before I summarize the numbers, I want to mention how I continue to be impressed with our Jacobs BeyondZero commitment, and I'm extremely pleased that our first",2466,"Thank you, Kevin. Welcome to our fiscal year 2016 first quarter earnings call. On Slide 4, and before I summarize the numbers, I want to mention how I continue to be impressed with our Jacobs BeyondZero commitment, and I'm extremely pleased that our first quarter safety performance continue to trend positively. Not only is this important from a standpoint of culture of caring for our employees, but it's equally appreciated by our customers who similarly prioritize safety excellence.
So now on to our first quarter business performance. And as we previously projected in last quarter's earnings call, we faced a challenging global economic environment at the start of our fiscal year. Adverse market conditions, particularly in oil and mining, continue to have a significant impact on our businesses. However, demonstrating the strength of our diverse portfolio, growth markets such as aerospace and technology and pharmabio helped us mitigate some of the pressures from our more challenged sectors. Our revenue from the quarter was $2.85 billion and our backlog at quarter end was down 3% versus last quarter at $18.2 billion, what I consider to be a solid performance within the context of current market condition.
I'm very pleased with how the global Jacobs organization has proactively responded to the challenging global market conditions in terms of rightsizing our cost structure and focusing on project delivery excellence. The previously announced company-wide restructuring initiative helped reduce first quarter G&A cost by 13% versus last year and project execution performance trended in the right direction. As a result, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.78, including an approximate $0.09 per share of discrete tax benefit, in line with expectations. Our balance sheet remains strong and should further strengthen as our heightened focus on working capital starts to take hold over the next several quarters.
Turning to Slide 5, I'd like to comment on several of our key improvement initiatives. In the first quarter, we continue to successfully implement both the cost restructuring and organizational realignment that were launched last fiscal year. With regard to the restructuring, we continue to identify additional cost reductions and believe we have opportunities to further streamline and achieve more efficiencies as we progress through this year. As it relates to the new line of business organization, I'm very pleased with the quality and speed of implementation by the Jacobs leadership team and the excitement and buy-in of all our employees across the globe. We've been progressing on a number of company-wide priorities, including strengthening of leadership accountability, improving project delivery and launching a strategic review of Jacobs. However, most importantly, a top priority is getting back to winning business and growing the company.
With regard to the strategy efforts, we're conducting an economic review of our entire portfolio. While this will feed into the next phase of the strategic plan development, we will immediately utilize the facts and insight to set near term profit improvement goals for the company and each line of business. The strategic plan initiative we ultimately developed will be focused on how to profitably grow Jacobs. We will present this at an Analyst Day in the fourth quarter.
And before turning to the next slide, I'd like to mention that beginning with next quarter's results, we'll report our segments consistent and aligned with our new lines of business. During our Investor Day last quarter, we presented backlog for the new structure on a preliminary basis. As we implement the company-wide realignment across more than 60,000 employees in more than 30 countries, we're updating our financial systems to align with the new lines of business. With that, I'll now turn to Slide 6 and provide a more in-depth discussion on each of our 4 business lines.
I'll begin with our Petroleum & Chemicals business. Backlog for the group currently stands at $6.2 billion, which is marginally lower than last quarter due mainly to the severe downturn in the upstream petroleum side of the business. As you all know, this line of business continues to face very challenging global market conditions. The significant decline in oil prices has had a major impact on many of our customers' cash flows and capital spend, especially in the upstream side of the oil and gas market. For example, a recent Wood Mackenzie report indicated that nearly $400 billion in global spend on new oil and gas projects has been shelved since the crude price collapsed. In addition, the amount of deferred capital in this industry has increased from $200 billion to $380 billion since June. A few years ago, very few would have imagined $30 crude oil today, and there's a lot of uncertainty in the oil and gas market.
With crude inventories at record highs, the Iranian sanctions removed, the supply/demand imbalance is widening and we are preparing for the overhang to continue. We've been able to partially mitigate these severe headwinds as a result of our industry-leading position in the resilient Middle East market as well as a strong focus on sustaining capital and maintenance across the oil and gas sector.
The refining segment remains solid for Jacobs. The U.S. market is being supported by exports and lower fuel costs are encouraging demand. New emissions rules in the U.S. are increasing investment in alkylation capacity, which is an area of strength for Jacobs. Refining demand in developing countries is also expected to increase at more than 3% and our Europe projects are continuing to be driven by regulatory, environmental and process safety opportunities.
We're also seeing our clients diversify into value-added specialty products while also focusing on energy efficiency and yield improvement of existing assets. However, most of the major integrated petrochemical companies have announced staffing and budget cuts, impacting our demand with these clients. All in all, we remain steady in the petrochemical sector.
And in this Petroleum & Chemicals business line, I'm very pleased with some of the major recent wins, including a very significant EPCM global partnership agreement with BASF, an EPCM service contract with Nippon Shokubai for a superabsorbent polymer plant in Belgium and an EPCM services agreement for one of the world's largest oil companies.
So now turning to Slide 7 and before discussing our Industrial business, I'd like to recap this week's announcement regarding a change on our leadership team. I have asked Andy Kremer, President of our Industrial Group, to move into a new Executive Advisor role to provide leadership on several priority initiatives, continuing to report to me. Robert Pragada who was previously an executive at Jacobs and more recently CEO of The Brock Group, a leading specialty trade contractor, started this week as the new President of our Industrial line of business. To capitalize on Bob's strong experience in construction, he'll also lead our field services units in North America and the U.K. I'm excited to welcome Bob back to Jacobs. While at Jacobs from 2006 to 2014, Bob was highly respected by our employees and customers as a strong leader with an impressive track record in sales and operations.
Our Industrial group's backlog is at $2.4 billion, down slightly from last quarter. The Industrial line of business includes life sciences, specialty chemicals and manufacturing and mining and minerals. I do want to mention that backlog presented does not yet include the incremental field services that Bob Pragada will be responsible for and will shift over to his business line when we report results next quarter.
Firstly, our life sciences group us delivering exciting growth as evidenced by major project awards throughout the past year from Biogen, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Genzyme. As a leading EPCM in commissioning, qualification and validation project delivery firm in biopharma, we are well positioned to profitably grow in this sector. Our footprint resource base and technical expertise spans multiple geographies, including the high-growth Europe and Asia regions. Our objective is to remain the employer and supplier of choice, expand our industry-leading service offerings and to continue to support our clients' investments into exciting new products.
Meanwhile, we're seeing steady demand in specialty chemicals and manufacturing with signs of improvement in several areas. This business unit includes pulp and paper, consumer products and inorganic chemicals. Domestic demand in pulp and paper remains flat, but we are expanding internationally. Consumer goods is a relatively untapped opportunity for Jacobs. We're building key client alliances to selectively grow in this market. We're also seeing improving market conditions for our Comprimo sulfur business that's being driven by recent environmental legislation in several countries. The fertilizer market continues to attract investment, driving new opportunities for our Chemetics and phosphate technology businesses.
Our mining and minerals group continues to be impacted by weak commodity prices. Major spending has been severely curtailed in response to the weak metal price environment and current oversupply. The supply/demand imbalance will correct over time, but we're not planning for a recovery in 2016. We continue to partly mitigate this by increasing our focus on sustaining capital projects and maintenance. I'm also impressed with our team's performance as we are winning more than our fair share of the few large metals mining projects in South America, Africa and Asia Pacific. Also a positive for Jacobs is the ongoing investment in fertilizer projects, particularly phosphate mines and related chemical plants especially in Africa, North America and the Middle East.
In the Industrial business line, we were recently awarded an EPCM contract from Biogen for a new state-of-the-art facility at Switzerland. This came on the back of other major awards for our life sciences group. Noteworthy, we recently won a sustaining capital projects contract with Alcoa of Australia.
So now turning to Slide 8. Our Buildings & Infrastructure backlog remains steady at $4.7 billion. This line of business for Jacobs is quite diverse and spans a variety of markets, including health care, education, aviation, water, rail, highways and power. On the building side, we continue to see growth in the U.S. and U.K. at the state and regional level. In education, K-12 projects in high-growth cities are a particularly bright spot. The Affordable Care Act is also continuing to impact the U.S. health care industry and higher use of clinic and outpatient telemedicine facilities is driving a step change in the market. We're on the forefront of this trend and are helping our clients adapt for the use of advanced planning and modular technique. Mission-critical markets are also positive and continue to grow and develop globally. In the commercial building industry, we're continuing to focus on several key customer relationships, where we are leveraging our oil and gas, chemical and pharmabio expertise to expand our offerings in cross-company synergies. One example of this is our ongoing involvement with one of our major integrated petroleum clients on several of their offices and building projects globally.
Meanwhile, we're seeing positive global growth in our infrastructure business, particularly in aviation, highways and rail. Australian and Asian transportation sectors are noteworthy growth spots, driven by population growth and economic stimulus. Rail is certainly growing and we're seeing a mixture of high-speed rail as well as passenger and Class I freight being developed in multiple regions. We are well positioned in the U.S. for upcoming ballot initiatives to expand light rail and continue to be the largest provider of rail design to network rail in the U.K. We're also continuing to position our resources for global aviation opportunities given that air-traffic projections are forecast to grow over the next decade in most regions. An example of the positive change at Jacobs is our successful leveraging of capabilities from the U.S. to support ongoing work with the Brisbane Airport expansion in Australia.
With regard to some recent awards, in addition to the network rail win in the U.K., our Buildings & Infrastructure group won a major U.S. military program that we hope to announce in the next few months, and we've been awarded a significant architectural engineering design project on an airport transportation program in Europe.
Also as recently announced, we acquired J.L. Patterson & Associates. J.L. Patterson brings additional consulting and professional services engineering capability in rail planning, environmental permitting, design and construction management. The acquisition enhances Jacobs' rail services capability on the West Coast and positions the company in the top tier of rail professional service providers in North America. So in summary, we believe our global Buildings & Infrastructure business has high potential growth opportunities and we're well positioned to leverage our expertise in several exciting markets.
Moving to Slide 9. Our Aerospace & Technology business is experiencing positive momentum. Backlog stands at $4.9 billion and excludes over $250 million in contracts that were awarded to us in the first quarter, but not yet posted in our bookings due to elevated levels of protest. We're seeing positive dynamics associated with federal government funding in both the U.S. and the U.K. after recent budget agreement. This provides greater certainty and stability for the programs that we support. However, as I mentioned, in this market, the procurement cycles are being extended and more awards protested. Relating to this, our military range operations and maintenance strategic growth initiative is starting to pay dividends as the investments we have made over the past couple of years resulted in the award of multiple new contracts to Jacobs during December. While those awards have been protested, something that is fairly normal in today's U.S. federal contracting environment, we're confident of a favorable outcome.
Meanwhile, our cybersecurity, counterterrorism and intelligence-related markets remain strong. Strategic investments such as our 2014 FNS acquisition are continuing to show benefits, and we're building strengths and capabilities to support additional growth in this market. We have a strong pipeline for advanced test and evaluation facilities with both the U.S. government and the commercial automotive industry.
We're also seeing opportunities in the traditional environmental services sector. Of particular note is an emerging market driven by new regulations pertaining to the management of coal combustion residuals. This is expected to be a multibillion dollar per year market and our differentiating experience with some of the major players positions us well. We're also experiencing positive trends in the nuclear sector associated with new build primarily in the U.K. and continue to pursue selective growth opportunities in this sector.
Recent key wins such as the 10-year facility support services contracts at NASA's Ames Research Center and engineering services and skills augmentation contract option with NASA at Marshall Flight Center and the EPCM spent nuclear handling project at the Idaho National Laboratory show the diversity and strength of this business. The Aerospace & Technology group has a good balance between discrete and long-term project work, and we expect to announce several additional wins that will bolster this group in the near future.
I'll now pass to Kevin to present more details on our financials."
282159,321880609,925780,"Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Jacobs Solutions Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. I'm now turning to Slide 11 as you follow along. As we've previously highlighted in our last earnings call, we were projecting a tough first half of the year. As a result, on a GAAP basis, revenue was $2.85 billion, as Steve noted, which is",1308,"Thanks, Steve. I'm now turning to Slide 11 as you follow along. As we've previously highlighted in our last earnings call, we were projecting a tough first half of the year. As a result, on a GAAP basis, revenue was $2.85 billion, as Steve noted, which is down 11% from a year ago. On a constant currency basis, revenues were down 7%. Gross margin dollars were $441 million. Importantly, and consistent with our expectations outlined in our last earnings call, our professional services gross margin percentage ticked back up in the quarter to levels above the full year gross margin percentage of last year. This improvement was somewhat mitigated by the mix impact associated with lower margin field services and greater percentage of our business in Q1.
As noted by Steve, tough cost controls drove our G&A down by more than $48 million versus the year ago. This was down over 13% and speaks to the aggressive measures we have taken and will continue to take to reduce costs in light of the current economic environment. As a result, adjusted operating profit was in line with our expectations at $128 million for the quarter. While our adjusted EPS of $0.78 was up 1% versus a year ago, it is important to note that the figure does include a discrete tax benefit of $0.09 in the quarter. To the positive, excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements versus last year, adjusted EPS would have increased to $0.80, up 4% versus the year-ago period.
Our backlog stands at $18.2 billion and our book-to-bill on a trailing 12 basis was 0.92. I will provide a little bit more color on these figures in a minute. Finally, operating working capital was $886 million. Cash was at $444 million and net debt was at $181 million. Our balance sheet as a result continues to remain strong, while repurchasing approximately 1 million shares during the quarter in line with our expected execution of our recently announced 3-year share buyback program.
So moving to Slide 12, let me provide some further color on our backlog. Again, backlog currently stands at a combined $18.2 billion. This is down slightly from our last earnings call and 5% from our record high of $19.1 billion a year ago. The decrease from a year ago was driven by a combination of work off from existing projects, a softer sales quarter this year versus the near record quarter year ago and a significant negative foreign exchange impact versus the year-ago period of almost $500 million. From last quarter alone, the foreign exchange impact was over $100 million. Excluding the impact of the foreign exchange movements versus last quarter and versus year ago, our backlog was down less than 3% from last quarter and only 2% from our record high in Q1 year ago.
With regard to our professional engineering services backlog, this now stands at $11.4 billion, a slight reduction of 2% from last quarter and, of course, some of that was due to our foreign exchange dynamic. Our field services backlog was down by 4% versus last quarter but it is, in fact, up significantly from a year ago. Our backlog at the end of the quarter again exemplifies the benefits of our diversity, where certain of our lines of business that target customers in stronger end markets has held steady and helped mitigate some of the pressures from reduced CapEx spending by oil and gas and mining customers.
So let me turn to Slide 13, where I would like to give you an update on the restructuring effort that was announced last year in July. As previously communicated, the focus of our restructuring has been to simplify Jacobs globally and to enhance our cost effectiveness. We believe our efforts will ultimately provide Jacobs with the ability to deliver satisfactory profit levels regardless of the economic environment in which we are operating. While many of the original restructuring efforts are at various stages of implementation, a recently announced reorganization is now supporting the identification of additional savings opportunities as we evaluate actions that could benefit the business longer term. Our efforts continue to be focused on our fixed cost infrastructure, primarily in labor and real estate. Given the incremental opportunities identified as part of the reorganization, we are now forecasting the total onetime cost of our restructuring effort that was initiated in 2015 to approach $250 million, with annualized savings between $180 million and $200 million. This compares actually to our original savings estimate of year ago when we announced the program of $130 million to $160 million in annualized savings. Importantly, the cash portion of our costs and savings noted above approximate 55% and 85%, respectively, resulting in a cash payback of the program of less than 1 year.
So turning to Slide 14, we showed this at our earnings -- or at our Investor Day last quarter. You will see our preliminary revenue and operating profit mix for the quarter. As you know, we are one of the most diversified E&C companies in the world. Our revenue and profit mix continues to evolve, indicating the strength of that diversity. For Q1, you will note that the Petroleum & Chemicals line of business represented the largest percentage of our total revenues. However, our Buildings & Infrastructure and Aerospace & Technology businesses combined represented more than 50% of the total overall profitability of the company. Importantly, these businesses are not impacted by the current headwinds seen in our oil and gas and mining and minerals end markets.
Of course, some of the differences in profitability across our lines of business, and specifically for our Petroleum & Chemicals business is that somehow is a larger portion of our field services work. As you know, field service tends to have lower margin levels given its higher percentage -- excuse me of pass-through revenues.
I want to note that these pie charts represent estimates at this point in time and our new segment reporting will become effective at our Q2 reporting period even though we are now beginning to manage the business consistent with our new organizational structure. As a result, our final reported information will somewhat change given the finalization of our segments and segment reporting, including the determination of field services within each line of business. Regardless, the power of our diversified portfolio is proving advantageous. While we see certain of our businesses facing incremental pressures, particularly from reduced CapEx in the oil and gas and mining sectors, other parts of the portfolio are expected to help mitigate some of those pressures, providing greater levels of stability and/or growing sales and profits.
So before handing it back over to Steve, I also want to provide an update on capital allocation on Slide 15. As highlighted last quarter, we spent $422 million in share buybacks during fiscal year 2015 and fully utilized the 2014 share buyback authorization of $500 million. During Q4 of 2015, we announced a new $500 million share buyback authorization with a term of 3 years. During Q1, we began executing against that program in a measured approach consistent with our guidance. We remain confident in our ability to generate sustainable, long-term cash flow, and we continue to believe our share buyback program is an appropriate use of cash given the company's long-term value creation outlook. A strong cash flow dynamic supports our ability to return capital to our shareholders while still providing flexibility to support our growth aspirations longer term. Finally, as evidenced by working capital and accounts receivable performance improvement targets now being part of our annual incentive program, we also believe we can improve our cash flow this year and longer term, which will further support our flexibility going forward.
So with that, let me hand it back over to Steve for some additional comments."
282159,321880609,925780,"Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Jacobs Solutions Inc.","Executives","Great. Thank you, Kevin.

As part of our reorganization, we established a global sales center of excellence. This is a critical step that enables us to transition from the previously centralized sales approach to a simplified organization and better integrates overall business accountability within each line of business, with the ultimate objective of driving sales to a much higher level of performance. Key near-term objectives by the sales center of excellence include: ensuring that we attract, retain and develop the highest caliber sales team for sustained competitive advantage and also to drive increasing sales effectiveness with a focus on innovation and best practices that result in clear value to our clients and significant profitable growth. While it's early days, we're seeing strong ownership and buy-in from our global sales force who are now fully integrated in the lines of business, and we believe this positions us well to get back on a solid growth path. More in the coming quarters on specific progress.
Turning to Slide 18. As I mentioned last quarter, further strengthening project delivery is a top priority at Jacobs. Our new project delivery center of excellence is up and running and playing a more prominent role in the successful management delivery of our projects. This is driving increased focus and accountability across the organization. We're also implementing a number of specific project delivery-related initiatives to improve performance, including upgraded tools and better standardization across global offices. The initiatives will both strengthen our project performance and reduce our operating cost. Each line of business has appointed a project delivery leader who's accountable to ensure adherence to best practices and procedures. These initiatives are designed to have both an immediate and a long-term impact.
So turning to the last slide, and to summarize, we continue to hold to our previous fiscal year 2016 guidance. While our first quarter results met expectations, we continue to believe that the first half will be impacted by the difficult market conditions. And as a result, we expect our underlying second quarter results versus a year ago to be similarly challenged as was our first quarter results. The economic dynamics of commodities such as oil and mining will continue to impact our business. However, we remain cautiously optimistic on the second half of the year as cost-saving benefits ramp up and our market strategies play out in certain businesses. We're already reaping benefits from the restructuring and newly established organization, and we expect it will yield additional improvements as we move through fiscal year 2016.
We're seeing a clear energy building across Jacobs. With senior leadership solidified, our focus is now on winning business and successfully delivering projects for our customers. Our value proposition and focus on key client relationships, market and portfolio diversification, smart use of cash and fostering great talent are all helping to get Jacobs back on track to grow profitably. To support our business, greater clarity on strategic growth is needed and so we're underway with our strategic review. We believe the initiatives we have undertaken and those we continue to implement are aligned with shareholders' interest and will ensure we are well positioned to drive long-term profitable growth.
So with that, I'd like to thank you for listening and we'll now open it up for questions. Operator?"

Does that imply you expect like the core business relative to where you were last quarter or the underlying fundamentals have declined $0.25? If so, which businesses are driving it?

But I do think as we look to continue to drive cost out of the business, certainly, the fact that we're able to deliver incremental cost does imply that, certainly, there is incremental potential pressure in certain of our businesses because of the continuing pressure on some of the commodity prices. So we think and believe that we are able to -- be able to offset some of that with our incremental investments in terms of the ability to drive our reduction in SG&A."

And there's a lot of moving parts to that, and mix is a big piece of what happened at Jacobs because of our diverse portfolio. But all in all, when we look at -- start to really analyze and we'll have more information that we can share starting in the second quarter when we report line of business results, we're pretty pleased with how margins are holding up. We're maximizing our high-value execution center in India and a lot of our customers locking in on that so we can have a win-win with our customers on sharing the benefit of work share between multiple offices, including India. We -- a lot of -- if I look at Aerospace & Technology, for example, a lot of the new business that they're winning is higher-margin, long-term business and it's replacing lower margin business that's falling off the books.

And we think that's now stabilizing at the bottom and don't view that we're going to see a material change now driven by the mining and minerals because it's come down so much. And in fact, the -- as I mentioned in my remarks, of the few projects, major projects that are out there, we're actually expecting to win the majority of those. And so that will start positively impacting our Industrial group's backlog. And as you mentioned, we're excited about the life sciences. That's clearly been a offset to what I just talked about, to be able to hold up the Industrial backlog where it is. And so I believe as we start looking forward in Industrial, we're going to see, at some point, a positive turn in the backlog."

Yes, our business in the U.S. is both buildings and infrastructure. Clearly, we're seeing positive momentum in the infrastructure side, some specific initiatives being driven by the fact that the federal spending outlook is more positive than, say, it was a year ago. And with the recent budget approval, we're seeing more certainty especially at the state, regional level around our infrastructure side. Some of it's very regional. We're seeing strong demand in Texas, West Coast, Florida, for example, in the infrastructure side. When we look at the whole market, mission-critical is something we're pretty excited about and strong and believe we have excellent growth. And part of it, though, is the timing. We were impacted in the first quarter in mission-critical and it was just simply our customers making some decisions on timing that were different than our expectations, but we expect to play it out as the year unfolds. So we're pretty diverse in Building & Infrastructure as I outlined and so there's lots of activity. This is clearly a business that there's a lot of small wins that add up to what we believe is something that could be very positive as we unfold our strategy. The infrastructure comment around the Middle East, I would say, is not positive. Yes, there's a concern that in the Middle East, as oil prices have dropped that there could be some delays in infrastructure spending. But we're starting from such a small level that, generally, we see that as a positive over the near term in the Middle East."

As I mentioned, first of all, a very strong piece of our global Petroleum & Chemicals business is sustaining capital and maintenance, and the team has done an excellent job on really focusing in on that starting several quarters ago, and we're getting a lot of wins. And one thing that's happening in both the oil and gas and mining side is that there is still pretty strong production, even in the mining side, as prices have collapsed, there's a lot of production. And so we're seeing a lot of sustaining capital and maintenance and safety, environmental across the globe. And we are one of the major players in that sector and it is a big piece of our business. And so that's enabling us to hold up in a very difficult environment. Specifically, refining, we're doing a great job on the independent refiners who are benefiting from the lower crude oil and are spending at maybe a higher rate as compared to the integrated players, and we've got some good wins in that sector. And I think our new focus with the line of business in Petroleum & Chemicals is demonstrating some early success in that arena. And on the chemicals side, as a lot of these ethylene initiatives and cracker initiatives are going up, there's going to be a lot of byproduct activity in specialty chemicals and derivatives, ethylene oxide, ethylene glycol, et cetera. And that's where -- that's in our sweet spot and we're pretty positive about what's going to unfold there as it relates to chemicals. So yes, the downstream has been a good offset for us in a very difficult upstream environment."

Again, I'll -- what -- I'm trying to be repetitive here, but when I look at the backlog and analyze it, the big hard-hit areas, major spending in the mining and upstream oil and gas for the most part has played out in our backlog because in today's backlog, there's very little represented there in those 2 hard-hit sectors other than our sustaining capital and maintenance position, which we think we could even grow in a difficult environment because that's where those sectors are spending. And then you add on top of that, that in the past we were somewhat overdependent on key large players in those sectors. In the past year or so, there's been a big push to diversify and spread our wings across that industry. And so we are gaining a lot of new customers that we haven't had in the past. And as I mentioned with the downstream focus and the size that we participate in maybe as compared to some of our competitors, where we tend to be in more of the smaller, midsized range and not overly dependent on cancellations or deferrals of big large projects. We feel like although visibility is not very clear because of the uncertainty of what's going to happen in the industry, but based on the recent activity, at least we haven't seen signs that we're missing something from a lag effect or a lot of the recent announcements, but we'll see."

One is a real good focus of understanding where we're differentiated, where we can make money and shedding some low-value businesses and therefore, getting an upgraded mix in our sales activity. And it really is starting to play out as we analyze each and every one of the 4 lines of businesses. And as I mentioned before, the Aerospace & Technology, which is probably our most differentiated business, yes, there's a lot of protest, but a lot of that is just the nature of the way relationships have changed in that industry over the last several years. And we believe that our reputation, our differentiated offering, our capability, experience that we're actually going to be able to see general improvement in margins there and grow. Clearly, in places like the Petroleum & Chemicals, that's where there is the highest level of challenge on pricing, as you would expect.

And you can see the SG&A figures for Q1 were obviously quite good versus year ago, so you can see that, that's continuing to build. We are taking actions in Q2, further actions. So the run rate ultimately that we will realize of the number that we're talking about in terms of the savings right now will not fully be seen in 2016 because some of that's going to be done, let's call it, midyear by the end of Q2.

Let me just kind of frame the answer around how we're responding to that uncertainty because we don't know, right? And we're not experts on being able to predict the oil markets or what's going to happen to copper prices or iron ore. But what -- agai",264,"Yes. Let me just kind of frame the answer around how we're responding to that uncertainty because we don't know, right? And we're not experts on being able to predict the oil markets or what's going to happen to copper prices or iron ore. But what -- again, what excites me is, as we have everyone now focused, more transparency, more rigor, more accountability, we -- as big as we are and as diverse as we are, there's a huge opportunity of growth just based on, in many of the cases, we're starting with small shares and yet were very strong in where we have those small share of businesses. And so even in this difficult environment, it feels like there is good opportunity out there. But clearly, pressures that we have to manage through and the changeover in our backlog, for example, that is working off some old business as we get out there and execute the type of things that I'm talking about. And so I think it's uncertain. We're not banking on oil prices going up or mining prices going up. When they do, we're going to be positioned extremely well because of our more efficient and even more efficient cost structure in the future. And so we're excited about when that happens, we'll be positioned well. But as we talk now in the near term, it's all about going after opportunities that are in front of us. And it feels like those opportunities should also allow us to see some modest growth as we execute them over the near term."

First thing is, we do expect our cash flow to improve over the balance of the year versus first quarter. And the first quarter, typically, it's not always the case because depending upon what the end balance sheet data is, there can be fluctuations by quarter. But generally speaking, Q1 tends to be one of our softer cash flow quarters. And so I fundamentally do believe there will be improvements over the balance of the year. I did make the comment in the prepared remarks that we expect to start to generate some improvements in our working capital efforts and we do believe that will translate into improvements in cash flow over the balance of the year. So I think that, that's the focus area for us on the balance of 2016. And clearly, if we make progress there, we fundamentally believe those are sustainable going forward, which translates into our ability to be able to improve cash flows longer term. I don't know that I want to get into much more details than that, but I do feel as if the team is focused. The lines of businesses are actually accelerating in supporting an incremental focus against the effort. And so I do believe that we're going to be able to see some progress there."

As you know, our earnings announcement and Form 10-Q were released this morning, and we will be posting a copy of the slide presentation to our website, which we will reference in our prepared remarks.
Before starting, I would like to refer you to our forward-looking statement, which is summarized on Slide 2. Any statements that we make today that are not based on historical fact are forward-looking statements. Although such statements are based on our current estimates and expectations and currently available competitive, financial and economic data, forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements as actual results may differ materially. There are a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause Jacobs' actual results to differ materially from what may be contained, projected or implied by our forward-looking statements. For a description of some of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that may occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, see our most recent earnings release and quarterly report on Form 10-Q as well as our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended October 2, 2015, including Item 1A - Risk Factors, Item 3 - Legal Proceedings and Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as well as our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
So let's get into the call, officially. Let's turn to Slide 3 for a quick review of the agenda for today's call. Steve will begin with a highlight of our first quarter, followed by an update on the business and recent key initiatives. He will also provide some commentary on end market conditions for our 4 lines of business as well as highlight some recent high-profile project awards. I will then provide a more in-depth discussion on our financial metrics, including our backlog and current restructuring efforts. I will continue with some comments on our revenue to operating profit split and some comments on capital allocation. Steve will then finish by highlighting certain initiatives we are undertaking in our project delivery and sales centers of excellence, and we will then conclude with some closing comments. Finally, we will open it up for some questions.
With that, let me pass it over to Steve Demetriou, our President and CEO. Steve?"

Welcome to our fiscal year 2016 first quarter earnings call. On Slide 4, and before I summarize the numbers, I want to mention how I continue to be impressed with our Jacobs BeyondZero commitment, and I'm extremely pleased that our first",2464,"Thank you, Kevin. Welcome to our fiscal year 2016 first quarter earnings call. On Slide 4, and before I summarize the numbers, I want to mention how I continue to be impressed with our Jacobs BeyondZero commitment, and I'm extremely pleased that our first quarter safety performance continued to trend positively. Not only is this important from a standpoint of culture of caring for our employees, but it's equally appreciated by our customers who similarly prioritize safety excellence.
So now on to our first quarter business performance. And as we previously projected in last quarter's earnings call, we faced a challenging global economic environment at the start of our fiscal year. Adverse market conditions, particularly in oil and mining, continue to have a significant impact on our businesses. However, demonstrating the strength of our diverse portfolio, growth markets such as aerospace and technology and pharmabio helped us mitigate some of the pressures from our more challenged sectors. Our revenue from the quarter was $2.85 billion and our backlog at quarter end was down 3% versus last quarter at $18.2 billion, what I consider to be a solid performance within the context of current market condition.
I'm very pleased with how the global Jacobs organization has proactively responded to the challenging global market conditions in terms of rightsizing our cost structure and focusing on project delivery excellence. The previously announced company-wide restructuring initiative helped reduce first quarter G&A cost by 13% versus last year and project execution performance trended in the right direction. As a result, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.78, including an approximate $0.09 per share discrete tax benefit, in line with expectations. Our balance sheet remains strong and should further strengthen as our heightened focus on working capital starts to take hold over the next several quarters.
Turning to Slide 5, I'd like to comment on several of our key improvement initiatives. In the first quarter, we continue to successfully implement both the cost restructuring and organizational realignment that were launched last fiscal year. With regard to the restructuring, we continue to identify additional cost reductions and believe we have opportunities to further streamline and achieve more efficiencies as we progress through this year. As it relates to the new line of business organization, I'm very pleased with the quality and speed of implementation by the Jacobs leadership team and the excitement and buy-in of all our employees across the globe. We've been progressing on a number of company-wide priorities, including strengthening of leadership accountability, improving project delivery and launching a strategic review of Jacobs. However, most importantly, a top priority is getting back to winning business and growing the company.
With regard to the strategy efforts, we're conducting an economic review of our entire portfolio. While this will feed into the next phase of the strategic plan development, we will immediately utilize the facts and insight to set near-term profit improvement goals for the company and each line of business. The strategic plan initiative we ultimately develop will be focused on how to profitably grow Jacobs. We will present this at an Analyst Day in the fourth quarter.
And before turning to the next slide, I'd like to mention that beginning with next quarter's results, we'll report our segments consistent and aligned with our new lines of business. During our Investor Day last quarter, we presented backlog for the new structure on a preliminary basis. As we implement the company-wide realignment across more than 60,000 employees in more than 30 countries, we're updating our financial systems to align with the new lines of business. With that, I'll now turn to Slide 6 and provide a more in-depth discussion on each of our 4 business lines.
I'll begin with our Petroleum & Chemicals business. Backlog for the group currently stands at $6.2 billion, which is marginally lower than last quarter due mainly to the severe downturn in the upstream petroleum side of the business. As you all know, this line of business continues to face very challenging global market conditions. The significant decline in oil prices has had a major impact on many of our customers' cash flows and capital spend, especially in the upstream side of the oil and gas market. For example, a recent Wood Mackenzie report indicated that nearly $400 billion in global spend on new oil and gas projects has been shelved since the crude price collapse. In addition, the amount of deferred capital in this industry has increased from $200 billion to $380 billion since June. A few years ago, very few would have imagined $30 crude oil today, and there's a lot of uncertainty in the oil and gas markets.
With crude inventories at record highs, the Iranian sanctions removed, the supply/demand imbalance is widening and we are preparing for the overhang to continue. We've been able to partially mitigate these severe headwinds as a result of our industry-leading position in the resilient Middle East market as well as a strong focus on sustaining capital and maintenance across the oil and gas sector.
The refining segment remains solid for Jacobs. The U.S. market is being supported by exports and lower fuel costs are encouraging demand. New emissions rules in the U.S. are increasing investment in alkylation capacity, which is an area of strength for Jacobs. Refining demand in developing countries is also expected to increase at more than 3% and our Europe projects are continuing to be driven by regulatory, environmental and process safety opportunities.
We're also seeing our clients diversify into value-added specialty products while also focusing on energy efficiency and yield improvement of existing assets. However, most of the major integrated petrochemical companies have announced staffing and budget cuts, impacting our demand with these clients. All in all, we remain steady in the petrochemical sector.
And in this Petroleum & Chemicals business line, I'm very pleased with some of the major recent wins, including a very significant EPCM global partnership agreement with BASF, an EPCM service contract with Nippon Shokubai for a superabsorbent polymer plant in Belgium and an EPCM services agreement for one of the world's largest oil companies.
So now turning to Slide 7 and before discussing our Industrial business, I'd like to recap this week's announcements regarding a change on our leadership team. I have asked Andy Kremer, President of our Industrial Group, to move into a new Executive Adviser role to provide leadership on several priority initiatives, continuing to report to me. Robert Pragada who was previously an executive at Jacobs and more recently CEO of The Brock Group, a leading specialty trade contractor, started this week as the new President of our Industrial line of business. To capitalize on Bob's strong experience in construction, he'll also lead our field services units in North America and the U.K. I'm excited to welcome Bob back to Jacobs. While at Jacobs from 2006 to 2014, Bob was highly respected by our employees and customers as a strong leader with an impressive track record in sales and operations.
Our Industrial group's backlog is at $2.4 billion, down slightly from last quarter. The Industrial line of business includes life sciences, specialty chemicals and manufacturing and mining and minerals. I do want to mention that backlog presented does not yet include the incremental field services that Bob Pragada will be responsible for and will shift over to his business line when we report results next quarter.
Firstly, our life sciences group is delivering exciting growth as evidenced by major project awards throughout the past year from Biogen, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Genzyme. As a leading EPCM in commissioning, qualification and validation project delivery firm in biopharma, we are well positioned to profitably grow in this sector. Our footprint resource base and technical expertise spans multiple geographies, including the high-growth Europe and Asia regions. Our objective is to remain the employer and supplier of choice, expand our industry-leading service offerings and to continue to support our clients' investments into exciting new products.
Meanwhile, we're seeing steady demand in specialty chemicals and manufacturing with signs of improvement in several areas. This business unit includes pulp and paper, consumer products and inorganic chemicals. Domestic demand in pulp and paper remains flat, but we are expanding internationally. Consumer goods is a relatively untapped opportunity for Jacobs. We're building key client alliances to selectively grow in this market. We're also seeing improving market conditions for our Comprimo sulfur business that's being driven by recent environmental legislation in several countries. The fertilizer market continues to attract investment, driving new opportunities for our Chemetics and phosphate technology businesses.
Our mining and minerals group continues to be impacted by weak commodity prices. Major spending has been severely curtailed in response to the weak metal price environment and current oversupply. The supply-demand imbalance will correct over time, but we're not planning for a recovery in 2016. We continue to partly mitigate this by increasing our focus on sustaining capital projects and maintenance. I'm also impressed with our team's performance as we are winning more than our fair share of the few large metals mining projects in South America, Africa and Asia Pacific. Also a positive for Jacobs is the ongoing investment in fertilizer projects, particularly phosphate mines and related chemical plants, especially in Africa, North America and the Middle East.
In the Industrial business line, we were recently awarded an EPCM contract from Biogen for a new state-of-the-art facility in Switzerland. This came on the back of other major awards for our life sciences group. Noteworthy, we recently won a sustaining capital projects contract with Alcoa of Australia.
So now turning to Slide 8. Our Buildings & Infrastructure backlog remains steady at $4.7 billion. This line of business for Jacobs is quite diverse and spans a variety of markets, including health care, education, aviation, water, rail, highways and power. On the building side, we continue to see growth in the U.S. and U.K. at the state and regional level. In education, K-12 projects in high-growth cities are a particularly bright spot. The Affordable Care Act is also continuing to impact the U.S. health care industry and higher use of clinic and outpatient telemedicine facilities is driving a step change in the market. We're on the forefront of this trend and are helping our clients adapt through the use of advanced planning and modular techniques. Mission-critical markets are also positive and continue to grow and develop globally. In the commercial building industry, we're continuing to focus on several key customer relationships, where we are leveraging our oil and gas, chemical and pharmabio expertise to expand our offerings in cross-company synergies. One example of this is our ongoing involvement with one of our major integrated petroleum clients on several of their offices and building projects globally.
Meanwhile, we're seeing positive global growth in our infrastructure business, particularly in aviation, highways and rail. Australian and Asian transportation sectors are noteworthy growth spots, driven by population growth and economic stimulus. Rail is certainly growing and we're seeing a mixture of high-speed rail as well as passenger and Class I freight being developed in multiple regions. We are well positioned in the U.S. for upcoming ballot initiatives to expand light rail and continue to be the largest provider of rail design to network rail in the U.K. We're also continuing to position our resources for global aviation opportunities given that air-traffic projections are forecast to grow over the next decade in most regions. An example of the positive change at Jacobs is our successful leveraging of capabilities from the U.S. to support ongoing work with the Brisbane Airport expansion in Australia.
With regard to some recent awards, in addition to the network rail win in the U.K., our Buildings & Infrastructure group won a major U.S. military program that we hope to announce in the next few months, and we've been awarded a significant architectural engineering design project on an airport transportation program in Europe.
Also as recently announced, we acquired J.L. Patterson & Associates. J.L. Patterson brings additional consulting and professional services engineering capability in rail planning, environmental permitting, design and construction management. The acquisition enhances Jacobs' rail services capability on the West Coast and positions the company in the top tier of rail professional service providers in North America. So in summary, we believe our global Buildings & Infrastructure business has high potential growth opportunities and we're well positioned to leverage our expertise in several exciting markets.
Moving to Slide 9. Our Aerospace & Technology business is experiencing positive momentum. Backlog stands at $4.9 billion and excludes over $250 million in contracts that were awarded to us in the first quarter, but not yet posted in our bookings due to elevated levels of protest. We're seeing positive dynamics associated with federal government funding in both the U.S. and the U.K. after recent budget agreement. This provides greater certainty and stability for the programs that we support. However, as I mentioned, in this market, the procurement cycles are being extended and more awards protested. Relating to this, our military range operations and maintenance strategic growth initiative is starting to pay dividends as the investments we have made over the past couple of years resulted in the award of multiple new contracts to Jacobs during December. While those awards have been protested, something that is fairly normal in today's U.S. federal contracting environment, we're confident of a favorable outcome.
Meanwhile, our cybersecurity, counterterrorism and intelligence-related markets remain strong. Strategic investments such as our 2014 FNS acquisition are continuing to show benefits, and we're building strengths and capabilities to support additional growth in this market. We have a strong pipeline for advanced test and evaluation facilities with both the U.S. government and the commercial automotive industry.
We're also seeing opportunities in the traditional environmental services sector. Of particular note is an emerging market driven by new regulations pertaining to the management of coal combustion residuals. This is expected to be a multibillion dollar per year market and our differentiating experience with some of the major players positions us well. We're also experiencing positive trends in the nuclear sector associated with new builds, primarily in the U.K., and continue to pursue selective growth opportunities in this sector.
Recent key wins such as the 10-year facility support services contracts at NASA's Ames Research Center, an engineering services and skills augmentation contract option with NASA at Marshall Flight Center and the EPCM spent nuclear handling project at the Idaho National Laboratory show the diversity and strength of this business. The Aerospace & Technology group has a good balance between discrete and long-term project work, and we expect to announce several additional wins that will bolster this group in the near future.
I'll now pass to Kevin to present more details on our financials."

I'm now turning to Slide 11 as you follow along. As we previously highlighted in our last earnings call, we were projecting a tough first half of the year. As a result, on a GAAP basis, revenue was $2.85 billion, as Steve noted, which is do",1309,"Thanks, Steve. I'm now turning to Slide 11 as you follow along. As we previously highlighted in our last earnings call, we were projecting a tough first half of the year. As a result, on a GAAP basis, revenue was $2.85 billion, as Steve noted, which is down 11% from a year ago. On a constant currency basis, revenues were down 7%. Gross margin dollars were $441 million. Importantly, and consistent with our expectations outlined in our last earnings call, our professional services gross margin percentage ticked back up in the quarter to levels above the full year gross margin percentage of last year. This improvement was somewhat mitigated by the mix impact associated with lower margin field services and greater percentage of our business in Q1.
As noted by Steve, tough cost controls drove our G&A down by more than $48 million versus a year ago. This was down over 13% and speaks to the aggressive measures we have taken and will continue to take to reduce costs in light of the current economic environment. As a result, adjusted operating profit was in line with our expectations at $128 million for the quarter. While our adjusted EPS of $0.78 was up 1% versus a year ago, it is important to note that the figure does include a discrete tax benefit of $0.09 in the quarter. To the positive, excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements versus last year, adjusted EPS would have increased to $0.80, up 4% versus the year-ago period.
Our backlog stands at $18.2 billion and our book-to-bill on a trailing 12 basis was 0.92. I will provide a little bit more color on these figures in a minute. Finally, operating working capital was $886 million. Cash was at $444 million and net debt was at $181 million. Our balance sheet as a result continues to remain strong, while repurchasing approximately 1 million shares during the quarter in line with our expected execution of our recently announced 3-year share buyback program.
So moving to Slide 12, let me provide some further color on our backlog. Again, backlog currently stands at a combined $18.2 billion. This is down slightly from our last earnings call and 5% from our record high of $19.1 billion a year ago. The decrease from a year ago was driven by a combination of work off from existing projects, a softer sales quarter this year versus the near record quarter year ago and a significant negative foreign exchange impact versus the year-ago period of almost $500 million. From last quarter alone, the foreign exchange impact was over $100 million. Excluding the impact of the foreign exchange movements versus last quarter and versus year ago, our backlog was down less than 3% from last quarter and only 2% from our record high in Q1 year ago.
With regard to our professional engineering services backlog, this now stands at $11.4 billion, a slight reduction of 2% from last quarter and, of course, some of that was due to our foreign exchange dynamic. Our field services backlog was down by 4% versus last quarter but it is, in fact, up significantly from a year ago. Our backlog at the end of the quarter again exemplifies the benefits of our diversity, where certain of our lines of business that target customers in stronger end markets have held steady and helped mitigate some of the pressures from reduced CapEx spending by oil and gas and mining customers.
So let me turn to Slide 13, where I would like to give you an update on the restructuring effort that was announced last year in July. As previously communicated, the focus of our restructuring has been to simplify Jacobs globally and to enhance our cost effectiveness. We believe our efforts will ultimately provide Jacobs with the ability to deliver satisfactory profit levels regardless of the economic environment in which we are operating. While many of the original restructuring efforts are at various stages of implementation, a recently announced reorganization is now supporting the identification of additional savings opportunities as we evaluate actions that could benefit the business longer term. Our efforts continue to be focused on our fixed cost infrastructure, primarily in labor and real estate. Given the incremental opportunities identified as part of the reorganization, we are now forecasting the total onetime cost of our restructuring effort that was initiated in 2015 to approach $250 million, with annualized savings between $180 million and $200 million. This compares actually to our original savings estimate of year ago when we announced the program of $130 million to $160 million in annualized savings. Importantly, the cash portion of our costs and savings noted above approximate 55% and 85%, respectively, resulting in a cash payback of the program of less than 1 year.
So turning to Slide 14, we showed this at our earnings -- or at our Investor Day last quarter. You will see our preliminary revenue and operating profit mix for the quarter. As you know, we are one of the most diversified E&C companies in the world. Our revenue and profit mix continues to evolve, indicating the strength of that diversity. For Q1, you will note that the Petroleum & Chemicals line of business represented the largest percentage of our total revenues. However, our Buildings & Infrastructure and Aerospace & Technology businesses combined represented more than 50% of the total overall profitability of the company. Importantly, these businesses are not impacted by the current headwinds seen in our oil and gas and mining and minerals end markets.
Of course, some of the differences in profitability across our lines of business, and specifically for our Petroleum & Chemicals business is that somehow is a larger portion of our field services work. As you know, field service tends to have lower margin levels given its higher percentage -- excuse me, of pass-through revenues.
I want to note that these pie charts represent estimates at this point in time and our new segment reporting will become effective at our Q2 reporting period even though we are now beginning to manage the business consistent with our new organizational structure. As a result, our final reported information will somewhat change given the finalization of our segments and segment reporting, including the determination of field services within each line of business. Regardless, the power of our diversified portfolio is proving advantageous. While we see certain of our businesses facing incremental pressures, particularly from reduced CapEx in the oil and gas and mining sectors, other parts of the portfolio are expected to help to mitigate some of those pressures, providing greater levels of stability and/or growing sales and profits.
So before handing it back over to Steve, I also want to provide an update on capital allocation on Slide 15. As highlighted last quarter, we spent $422 million in share buybacks during fiscal year 2015 and fully utilized the 2014 share buyback authorization of $500 million. During Q4 of 2015, we announced a new $500 million share buyback authorization with a term of 3 years. During Q1, we began executing against that program in a measured approach consistent with our guidance. We remain confident in our ability to generate sustainable, long-term cash flow, and we continue to believe our share buyback program is an appropriate use of cash given the company's long-term value creation outlook. A strong cash flow dynamic supports our ability to return capital to our shareholders while still providing flexibility to support our growth aspirations longer term. Finally, as evidenced by working capital and accounts receivable performance improvement targets now being part of our annual incentive program, we also believe we can improve our cash flow this year and longer term, which will further support our flexibility going forward.
So with that, let me hand it back over to Steve for some additional comments."
282159,321880609,926023,"Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Jacobs Solutions Inc.","Executives","Great. Thank you, Kevin.

As part of our reorganization, we established a global sales center of excellence. This is a critical step that enables us to transition from the previously centralized sales approach to a simplified organization and better integrates overall business accountability within each line of business, with the ultimate objective of driving sales to a much higher level of performance. Key near-term objectives by the sales center of excellence include: ensuring that we attract, retain and develop the highest caliber sales team for sustained competitive advantage; and also to drive increasing sales effectiveness with a focus on innovation and best practices that result in clear value to our clients and significant profitable growth. While it's early days, we're seeing strong ownership and buy-in from our global sales force who are now fully integrated in the lines of business, and we believe this positions us well to get back on a solid growth path. More in the coming quarters on specific progress.
Turning to Slide 18. As I mentioned last quarter, further strengthening project delivery is a top priority at Jacobs. Our new project delivery center of excellence is off and running and playing a more prominent role in the successful management delivery of our projects. This is driving increased focus and accountability across the organization. We're also implementing a number of specific project delivery-related initiatives to improve performance, including upgraded tools and better standardization across global offices. The initiatives will both strengthen our project performance and reduce our operating cost. Each line of business has appointed a project delivery leader who's accountable to ensure adherence to best practices and procedures. These initiatives are designed to have both an immediate and a long-term impact.
So turning to the last slide, and to summarize, we continue to hold to our previous fiscal year 2016 guidance. While our first quarter results met expectations, we continue to believe that the first half will be impacted by the difficult market conditions. And as a result, we expect our underlying second quarter results versus a year ago to be similarly challenged as was our first quarter results. The economic dynamics of commodities such as oil and mining will continue to impact our business. However, we remain cautiously optimistic on the second half of the year as cost-saving benefits ramp up and our market strategies play out in certain businesses. We're already reaping benefits from the restructuring and newly established organization, and we expect it will yield additional improvements as we move through fiscal year 2016.
We're seeing a clear energy building across Jacobs. With senior leadership solidified, our focus is now on winning business and successfully delivering projects for our customers. Our value proposition and focus on key client relationships, market and portfolio diversification, smart use of cash and fostering great talent are all helping to get Jacobs back on track to grow profitably. To support our business, greater clarity on strategic growth is needed and so we're underway with our strategic review. We believe the initiatives we have undertaken and those we continue to implement are aligned with shareholders' interest and will ensure we are well positioned to drive long-term profitable growth.
So with that, I'd like to thank you for listening and we'll now open it up for questions. Operator?"

I guess it depends on the timing. But I guess how do we think about that? Does that imply you expect like the core business relative to where you were last quarter or the underlying fundamentals have declined $0.25? If so, which businesses are driving it?

But I do think as we look to continue to drive cost out of the business, certainly, the fact that we're able to deliver incremental cost does imply that, certainly, there is incremental potential pressure in certain of our businesses because of the continuing pressure on some of the commodity prices. So we think and believe that we are able to -- be able to offset some of that with our incremental investments in terms of the ability to drive our reduction in SG&A."

But all in all, when we look at -- start to really analyze and we'll have more information that we can share starting in the second quarter when we report line of business results, we're pretty pleased with how margins are holding up. We're maximizing our high-value execution center in India and a lot of our customers are locking in on that so we can have a win-win with our customers on sharing the benefit of workshare between multiple offices, including India. We -- a lot of -- if I look at Aerospace & Technology, for example, a lot of the new business that they're winning is higher-margin, long-term business and it's replacing lower margin business that's falling off the books.

We're seeing strong demand in Texas, West Coast, Florida, for example, in the infrastructure side. When we look at the whole market, mission-critical is something we're pretty excited about and strong and believe we have excellent growth. And part of it, though, is the timing. We were impacted in the first quarter in mission-critical and it was just simply our customers making some decisions on timing that were different than our expectations, but we expect to play it out as the year unfolds.

The infrastructure comment around the Middle East, I would say, is net positive. Yes, there's a concern that in the Middle East, as oil prices have dropped that there could be some delays in infrastructure spending. But we're starting from such a small level that, generally, we see that as a positive over the near term in the Middle East."

As I mentioned, first of all, a very strong piece of our global Petroleum & Chemicals business is sustaining capital and maintenance, and the team has done an excellent job on really focusing in on that starting several quarters ago, and we're getting a lot of wins. And one thing that's happening in both the oil and gas and mining side is that there is still pretty strong production, even in the mining side, as prices have collapsed, there's a lot of production. And so we're seeing a lot of sustaining capital and maintenance and safety, environmental across the globe. And we are one of the major players in that sector and it is a big piece of our business. And so that's enabling us to hold up in a very difficult environment. Specifically, refining, we're doing a great job on the independent refiners who are benefiting from the lower crude oil and are spending at maybe a higher rate as compared to the integrated players, and we've got some good wins in that sector. And I think our new focus with the line of business in Petroleum & Chemicals is demonstrating some early success in that arena. And on the chemicals side, as a lot of these ethylene initiatives and cracker initiatives are going up, there's going to be a lot of byproduct activity in specialty chemicals and derivatives, ethylene oxide, ethylene glycol, et cetera. And that's where -- that's in our sweet spot and we're pretty positive about what's going to unfold there as it relates to chemicals. So yes, the downstream has been a good offset for us in a very difficult upstream environment."

And then you add on top of that, that in the past we were somewhat over-dependent on key large players in those sectors. In the past year or so, there's been a big push to diversify and spread our wings across that industry. And so we are gaining a lot of new customers that we haven't had in the past. And as I mentioned with the downstream focus, in the size that we participate in maybe as compared to some of our competitors, where we tend to be in more of the small or midsized range and not overly dependent on cancellations or deferrals of big large projects. We feel like, although visibility is not very clear because of the uncertainty of what's going to happen in the industry, that based on the recent activity, at least we haven't seen signs that we're missing something from a lag effect or a lot of the recent announcements, but we'll see."

One is a real good focus of understanding where we're differentiated, where we can make money and shedding some low-value businesses and therefore, getting an upgraded mix in our sales activity. And it really is starting to play out as we analyze each and every one of the 4 lines of businesses. And as I mentioned before, the Aerospace & Technology, which is probably our most differentiated business, yes, there's a lot of protest, but a lot of that is just the nature of the way relationships have changed in that industry over the last several years. And we believe that our reputation, our differentiated offering, our capability, experience that we're actually going to be able to see general improvement in margins there and grow. Clearly, in places like the Petroleum & Chemicals, that's where there is the highest level of challenge on pricing, as you would expect. But I think a combination of our cost improvements, including our variable cost and then the work that we're doing with our customers to look at ways to drive down cost, including the India workshare as I mentioned, all in all is helping our mix and margins.

But clearly, pressures that we have to manage through and a changeover in our backlog, for example, that is working off some old business as we get out there and execute the type of things that I'm talking about.

First thing is, we do expect our cash flow to improve over the balance of the year versus first quarter. And the first quarter, typically -- it's not always the case because depending upon what the end balance sheet data is, there can be fluctuations by quarter. But generally speaking, Q1 tends to be one of our softer cash flow quarters. And so I fundamentally do believe there will be improvements over the balance of the year. I did make the comment in the prepared remarks that we expect to start to generate some improvements in our working capital efforts and we do believe that will translate into improvements in cash flow over the balance of the year. So I think that that's the focus area for us on the balance of 2016. And clearly, if we make progress there, we fundamentally believe those are sustainable going forward, which translates into our ability to be able to improve cash flows longer term. I don't know that I want to get into much more details than that, but I do feel as if the team is focused. The lines of businesses are actually accelerating in supporting an incremental focus against the effort. And so I do believe that we're going to be able to see some progress there."

Okay, as you know, turning to Slide 2, our earnings announcement and Form 10-Q were released this morning, and we will be posting a copy of this slide presentation to our website, which we will reference in our prepared remarks. 
Before starting, I would like to refer you to our forward-looking statements. Any statements that we make today that are not based on historical fact are forward-looking statements. Although such statements are based on our current estimates and expectations and currently available competitive financial and economic data, forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements as actual results may differ materially. There are a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that cause Jacobs' actual results to differ materially from what may be contained, projected or implied by our forward-looking statements. For a description of some of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that may occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, see our most recent earnings release and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as well as our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended October 2, 2015, including Item 1, business; Item 1A, risk factors; Item 3, Legal Proceedings; and Item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as well as other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. 
So please now turn to Slide 3 for a quick review of the agenda for today's call. Steve will begin with some comments on our BeyondZero safety culture here at Jacobs followed by a summary of our second quarter financial results. He will include summary comments on the portfolio of our 4 lines of business or LOBs and also provide some commentary on end market conditions for each. I will then provide a more in-depth discussion on our financial metrics, backlog and financials for our new lines of business, segment reporting. I will continue with some comments on our current restructuring efforts and capital allocation. Steve will then discuss some next steps for the company, focusing on our project delivery initiatives, strategic review and some closing comments. We will then open it up for some questions. 
With that, I'll pass it now over to Steve Demetriou, our President and CEO."

I'm on Slide 4, and before we dive into the results, I'd like to discuss our industry-leading BeyondZero safety culture. At all Jacobs offices and customer job sites, ther",2430,"Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to our Fiscal Year 2016 Second Quarter Earnings Call. I'm on Slide 4, and before we dive into the results, I'd like to discuss our industry-leading BeyondZero safety culture. At all Jacobs offices and customer job sites, there's an unquestionable commitment to a safety first behavior. And our culture of caring is not just what we do but it's who we are. Through our relentless drive to improve safety performance, we have seen a number of incidents trend down over the last several years. In the first 6 months of this fiscal year, our overall injury rate, as measured by industry standard TRIR, total recordable incident rate was at 0.24, considered top quartile performance and highly valued by our customers. This week, Jacobs is involved in the industrywide global safety week, during which, our employees are engaged with customers and local communities on improving safety awareness, focusing on 5 topics: safe driving, energy risks, positive metal health, travel security and safety innovation. 
We recently appointed Katrina [indiscernible], a Jacobs veteran of 28 years as our new head of global safety, and I have no doubt she'll continue to strengthen Jacobs' position as an industry safety leader. And importantly for shareholders, we recognize that companies that have sustainable best-in-class safety performance typically achieve superior operating and financial results. So at Jacobs, we believe safety is also a leading indicator and a key management metric which supports business performance and accountability. 
Moving to Slide 5. I'll summarize our second quarter business performance. We continue to experience very challenging global economic conditions, particularly in petroleum and mining sectors. However, demonstrating the strength of our diverse portfolio, a more positive market such as aerospace and technology, pharmabio and buildings and infrastructure helped us mitigate these more challenged sectors. 
Our revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion and our backlog ended at $18.2 billion, holding stable versus the previous quarter. A relentless focus on rightsizing our cost structure and driving efficiencies continued to benefit Jacobs. Through the first 6 months of this fiscal year, we have delivered $70 million of adjusted G&A cost savings to the bottom line, a 10% cost reduction versus last year. Our strong focus on upgrading and standardized project delivery tools, process and capabilities is showing early signs of success. In the second quarter, improved project performance was a key contributor to a sequential increase in our total professional services gross margin. 
Our bottom line results were solid with adjusted earnings for the second quarter at $0.75 per share. And I'm also pleased with the cash flow performance which helped us end the quarter with a strengthened in balance sheet, and we look forward to further improvements heightened focus on working capital takes hold in the second half. 
I'm now on Slide 6. And as we announced at the beginning of last quarter, we're now managing the company by 4 global lines of businesses. These are petroleum and chemicals, which is comprised of upstream refining and petrochemicals; buildings and infrastructure; aerospace and technology, which covers our national public government business, primarily supporting U.S. and U.K. government agencies in the areas of defense, space, nuclear and technology; and industrial, which is comprised of mining and minerals, food, beverage and consumer goods, specialty chemicals, life sciences and field services. 
The chart on this slide show the breakdowns of revenues and adjusted segment operating profit by each line of business excluding non-allocated corporate expense. Kevin will cover more financial details on the LOB shortly, but here, we provide insight into the different economics of each business which provides a greater sense of profitability versus the top line. We believe a new financial disclosure will provide valuable insight from the diversity of our portfolio. For example, it's important to note that over 70% of our LOB profits year-to-date were driven by businesses that are not directly impacted by the hard-hit oil and mining industries. 
The stability of our aerospace and technology, buildings and infrastructure and certain industrial businesses form a strong foundation to drive profitable growth. And even within the petroleum and chemical line of business, end market diversity has helped Jacobs remain resilient in a challenging macroeconomic and provides long-term opportunities to achieve profitable growth with oil and gas -- when oil and gas market dynamics improve. 
I'll cover our petroleum and chemicals group on Slide 7. Crude oil prices fell below $30 per barrel earlier in the quarter and have rebounded to over $40 most recently. However, much of this increase does not appear to be based on supply demand dynamics. Price volatility is expected to continue and there's significant uncertainty in which direction oil prices will move. The most pressured segment is clearly the upstream side of our business, where it's all about cash preservation. For many of our upstream clients, it's a wait-and-see spending strategy, and any capital being spent is primarily going to projects that drive cost out, ensure regulatory compliance and outsourcing plant maintenance programs, all areas of strength for Jacobs. Although our global petroleum and chemicals backlog is down from last year, mainly due to the heavily hit upstream sector, especially in the Canadian oil sands, this line of business started to stabilize over the last several months. We are pleased that the second quarter held flat versus first quarter, demonstrating the success our team has had in focusing our markets where capital is being spent. This includes the midstream side of the industry, where we're winning businesses and pipelines, terminals and storage as our clients strive for more distribution flexibility and access to cheaper feedstock. 
The refining sector remains profitable, although margins have narrowed in recent months. We're seeing continued opportunities in global refining with a focus on maintenance turnaround activity of sustaining capital projects as well as compliance-mandated initiatives. One example of a recent success is a confidential client win for a significant 5-year sustaining services contract. We're also involved in early stages of a few large scale refinery expansions and grassroot capacity projects across the globe, and we're seeing increased opportunities in process safety, an area where we can offer clients industry-leading capability. 
Recent momentum in the petrochemical sector is also helping us to mitigate headwinds. Our strategy of geographically expanding chemicals is paying dividends as we're winning new framework agreements with several of the key global players. Many of our clients are adapting their facilities to capitalize on lower-cost gas feedstock, creating several opportunities for us to win plant revamp projects. Two recent examples of strategic client wins include a major engineering and procurement contract to support Monsanto's planned expansion in Louisiana and also our cracker revamp project in Europe. We have also won a significant number of front-end engineering design projects in the first 6 months of this fiscal year, up versus 2015, providing Jacobs a great opportunity to convert these to larger-scale projects in the near future. So across our global footprint, our petrochemical pipeline is getting stronger.
Moving to Slide 8. As announced in February, [indiscernible] rejoined Jacobs as President of Global Industrial. Consistent with his new responsibilities, we have added the field services business unit to the industrial line of business, which is reflected in the backlog reporting showing here for all periods. 
Our mining clients are facing one of the most challenging commodity recessions of our generation, and similar to the oil and gas situation, it's all about preserving capital, reducing spending and deferring projects for as long as possible. We believe we hit the bottom in mining and have stabilized business, especially in Asia and the Americas, with a successful focus on sustaining capital programs. We're also well positioned for a few larger capital projects that make [indiscernible] in the mining industry and hope to announce a significant strategic win in the near term. Although our global mining backlog plummeted from 2015, our total industrial backlog is up approximately $1 billion from last year due to our strong growth in life sciences and held flat through the first 6 months of the current fiscal year. 
Our life sciences segment continues to benefit from a strong wave of new product approvals. For example, the number of new molecular entities that were approved last year were the most since 1996, and we see the strength continuing. As a result, the biopharmaceutical majors are heavily investing in new capacity. We have success winning many of the first wave of next-generation projects including the large-cap programs for Biogen VMS and [indiscernible] one orders. The second wave is now in its initial stage, with planned investments by many of the leading global biopharmaceutical players, and we expect to continue to win a large share of these opportunities due to our industry-leading technical expertise and strong project delivery track record.
In our specialty chemicals and manufacturing sector, we're experiencing modest growth in the phosphate fertilizer market, which is driven by continued population increases in agricultural demand. Our team is doing an excellent job in following our customers to emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia and Indonesia and expanding from our traditional technology licensing model the full design supply contract. 
In our field services business unit, we've had a number of growth opportunities in construction and maintenance as our clients continue to focus on near-term capital project optimization and longer-term sustaining CapEx gains. Our diversity in services uniquely positions us to be a critical partner to drive best-in-class results for our clients. 
Moving to Slide 9. Our buildings and infrastructure group saw a slight uptick in backlog with just over $4.8 billion. This global line of business covers a number of sectors. Beginning with buildings, we continue to maintain our strong global brand, particularly in the federal space. We were recently awarded major contracts with the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, General Service Administration and the National Guard. The health care industry continues to grow due to an aging population and new medical technologies, and we're well positioned as evidenced by recent hospital project wins in San Francisco, Sydney -- and Sydney -- Cincinnati and Sydney. The corporate commercial building market is expanding for us. We recently won a major EPCM contract for 2 manufacturing centers in the defense industry. We've also been awarded several national building contracts including Vanguard, Sanofi, Amgen and SAP. Very exciting is also an opportunity to provide planning design and program management for a major education city in Australia. This represents a wave of future-connected resilient sustainable smart cities of the future. In mission-critical, cloud computing, the Internet of Things and a switch to software and apps is driving an expansion of data centers globally. We were impacted in the last few quarters by a temporary spending decline by our largest client due to our strategic schedule change. However, we expect to resume growth there soon. Infrastructure markets are also growing steadily. 
In the highway sector, our largest infrastructure market globally, we see continued opportunity to grow. The passage of the U.S. Highway Bill is providing increased spending confidence and represents growth in high mobility areas such as the West Coast, Texas Southeast and Virginia mid-Atlantic. We are working on the largest integrated transport and revitalization project in Australia and we were recently awarded a highly upgrade project in Adelaide. And in the U.K. where we're a top provider of planning and design, we were recently awarded 3 significant contracts for Highway England. 
The global rail market is also steadily growing as exemplified by the Los Angeles metropolitan area positioning for a new $130 billion transportation revenue package. Recent major awards include a metro rail project in the Middle East, construction management for a large Metrorail Project in Seattle and a multi-year CM contract for Clark in San Francisco. 
Finally, we see increased investment in global aviation, where we're a leading planning asset management company and a top design firm. We recently were awarded an important design in New York and were selected to assist the American U.S. Airways rebranding through 80 airports across the U.S. 
Our aerospace and technology line of business is summarized on Slide 10. We're pleased with the underlying backlog trends in this business. Although year-over-year backlog declined, lower margin revenue burn has been replaced by new higher value strategic sales, which is reflected in the strong second quarter operating profit performance. Also, as we previously reported, the backlog excludes approximately $250 million of recently awarded protested contracts, which, by the way, is 3x the protest level of last year. We're confident, however, that most of this debate backlog will be confirmed in the near future. 
Another positive trend is that Jacobs has won all our major contract rebids through the first half of this fiscal year, which contrast with a 2015 industry benchmark only a 25% incumbent win rate. Our recently announced U.S. Army Aberdeen test center and NASA Ames research aerospace testing and facilities contracts are significant examples of this rebid success. 
Our U.S. government work, particularly with homeland security and intelligence-related markets, remains strong. Significant commercial investment in mission-critical and advanced investment design facilities continues, and our pipeline of opportunities in this area is increasing. As announced last month, we acquired the VanDyke technology group, a 180-person firm, which enhances our capabilities in a fast-growing cyber security and intelligence-related market. We expect to significantly leverage the acquired capabilities globally across Jacobs public and private sector clients. 
The U.S. environmental market sector represents excellent growth potential for Jacobs. Most notably, we recently finalized a framework agreement with BP, a core client of Jacobs, for environmental remediation. In addition, we've leveraged our strong environmental experience to win a significant construction service contract for the Tennessee Valley Authority. In the U.K. the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority funding is projected to be around $20 billion over the next 5 years. A large portion of the spend will be at Sellafield and prioritized around high hazard risk mitigation where we are positioned well as an incumbent. The final sanctioning of the [indiscernible] Point C nuclear newbuild project which represents a long-term upside for Jacobs has been delayed but is expected in the relatively near future. 
In defense we reached an agreement with the U.K. Ministry of Defense to extend the financially significant maintenance and operations contract for the Atomic Weapons Establishment, known as AWE with a contract term through 2025. Also promising for us is the U.K.'s decision to invest in naval shipyards, the F-35 fighter jet and other platforms providing an improved opportunity pipeline for Jacobs. 
I'll now pass to Kevin to present more details on our financial results."

And I'm now turning to Slide 12. As we've previously communicated in our last earnings call, we were expecting some continued short-term challenges on revenue, and as expected, revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, which is down just over 4% from a year ago. Our backlog stands at $18.2 billion, as Steve already highlighted, flat versus Q1 in a relatively challenging environment. We actually feel good about that stability. In addition, our book to bill on a trailing 12 basis was 0.94, slightly up from the last quarter. Gross margin dollars for the quarter were $444 million, resulting in an improved gross margin profile versus Q1, up 50 basis points to 16%. Importantly, this improvement was driven by our professional services gross margins, which was at the highest level since 2014, an indication of our improving execution. This has allowed the company to more than offset some of the pricing pressures that exist in certain of our more challenged end markets. Benefits associated with our restructuring continue to gain momentum resulting in our adjusted G&A being down $22 million versus the year ago quarter. 
As Steve talked to, on a year-to-date basis, our adjusted G&A costs have now fallen over 10% versus the year ago period, a clear indication of solid execution against our restructuring program. As a result, adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $122 million, down modestly from our Q1 level. Adjusted EPS was $0.75 for the quarter. This includes a net positive impact of $0.03 from several items including the successful resolution of an international tax litigation, a one-time benefit to noncontrolling interest related to certain work performed with one of our partially owned subsidiaries, a cost associated with the litigation settlement and the negative impact of the customer bankruptcy. 
Finally, operating working capital improved during the quarter, resulting in our net debt position at Q1 of $181 million, turning to actually, a positive net cash position of $27 million in Q2, the first, net cash positive position that Jacobs has seen since the first quarter of 2013. This was driven by an improved free cash flow of over $200 million during the quarter, and importantly, the improvement in our net cash position is after having spent an additional $30 million in share repurchases during the second quarter.
Moving on to Slide 13. I would like to provide some brief commentary on our total backlog. Our backlog currently stands at a combined $18.2 billion, recently noted, which is flat from the Q1 figures. We are pleased with this performance as our stability in backlog versus the last quarter was seen across the portfolio including the petroleum and chemicals business. With regard to our professional and field services backlog mix for the quarter -- through the quarter, professional services how stands at $11.4 billion and field service at $6.9 billion, both stable figures versus our Q1 figures. Our backlog at the end of the quarter again exemplifies the benefits of our diversity. We're certain of our lines of businesses that target customers at stronger end markets has held steady and helped mitigate some of the pressures from reduced CapEx spending by oil and gas and mining customers.
So turning to Slide 14. I would like to spend a bit of time discussing our new segment reporting. For our SEC guidelines, we have aligned our segment reporting with how we now manage the business. To simplify our discussion, and since this is our first time reporting our segment information, I've noted here on the slide our 6-month results. I believe the 6-month results are indicative of the overall trends in our business, and I will provide some additional color on the quarterly numbers as appropriate in my following comments. 
You will note that 3 of the 4 LOBs have actually shown relatively stable adjusted operating profit performance over the first half of 2016, resulting in an improved margin profile in the first 6 months versus the year ago period for our LOB segments. Our petroleum and chemicals operating profit margin, up 60 basis points to 3.5%, has shown resiliency in the year-to-date performance and actually held operating profit levels relatively flat in a tough environment. In fact, petroleum and chemicals adjusted profit levels increased in Q2 2016 versus the year ago period as our aggressive restructuring efforts resulted in cost reductions which allowed for us to offset the drop in revenues year-over-year. 
Industrial profit is down versus the year ago period, driven by the challenge in mining and minerals end market and the margin benefits last year that were associated with large mining project closeout benefits. The business was also impacted negatively during Q2 this year by a litigation settlement and a customer bankruptcy. Going forward, the elimination of these items and the growing momentum in our life sciences unit bodes well for improving profitability in the second half of 2016. 
Regarding aerospace and technology, revenue declined [indiscernible] lower margin business has impacted the top line versus the 6-month year-to-date figures of 2015. However, this business still delivered flat adjusted operating profit for the fiscal year first half, improving operating margins actually to 7.7%, up 50 basis points versus the year ago period. The LOB also realized operating profit growth in the second quarter versus the year ago period.
Lastly, C&I revenue, while decreasing over the 6 months, we are optimistic about its ability to grow and deliver profitable growth going forward. Substantial benefits associated with our restructuring effort through the LOB's improvement in adjusted operating profit over the first half of the year. This resulted in operating margin rising to 7.3% or 70 basis points up versus the year ago period. 
As we look ahead, we'd like to make up the LOB diversity as long-term market dynamics in our buildings and infrastructure, aerospace and technology and industrial, specifically life sciences businesses, position the company well for growth. And with petroleum and chemicals, we believe this line of business provides long-term opportunities to profitably grow when oil and gas market dynamics ultimately improve. 
Finally, a few comments about our corporate-related costs. These non-allocated corporate costs consist of [indiscernible] elements that some are inherently predictable such as routine G&A expenses related to the corporation as a whole, acquisition-related expenses, primarily amortization of intangible assets and other routine costs and expenses. It also includes other items that are inherently less predictable including adjustments to employees fringe benefit programs around medical, pensions and other employee benefits, certain litigation cost including defense and settlement expenditures and margin adjustments on projects now related to LOB performance. These non-allocated corporate costs rose by approximately $90 million over the first half of 2016 versus the year ago period.  Increased legal defense costs, fringe-related true ups and expenses related to our strategy represent the majority and the bulk of the increase in cost. We believe that especially as it relates to the more predictable elements of this line item that we now present in our segment reporting, we will be able to reduce these non-allocated corporate costs longer term. 
So before turning to make some additional comment on our restructuring, a few words about our segment reporting efforts. I really would like to call of the extraordinary efforts of the finance and accounting team here at Jacobs. I am thrilled that they were more than up to the formidable challenge to meet the [indiscernible] time table we set when we put in place -- once we put in place the decision to transition to an LOB management structure. I know that the board, and certainly myself, would like to personally thank them.
So I'd like to turn now to Slide 13 where I would like to provide an update on the restructuring effort that was announced in July of last year. As we have discussed in past quarters, the primary focus of our restructuring effort has been to simplify Jacobs globally and to ensure we have a lean cost-effective structure. We've been very successful with our restructuring efforts and these are already benefiting our financials as evidenced by the significant reduction in G&A over the last 12 months. These actions support the company's ability to deliver satisfactory profit levels regardless of the economic environment in which we are operating, and we look forward to continued benefits in the second half of this fiscal year and the full year impact in next fiscal year 2017. 
Our restructuring efforts are now nearing completion. Our primary focus continues to be on reducing our fixed cost infrastructure, primarily in labor and real estate. Given the incremental opportunities identified as part of the reorganization that we announced late last year, calendar year, we're now forecasting the total one-time cost of our restructuring effort to be $330 million to $350 million through the end of Q3 approximately, with final expected gross savings of $240 million to $270 million. Importantly, the cash portion of both our cost and savings result in a cash payback of less than 1 year relative to this effort. 
Steve will discuss further in his closing comments coming up but our cost reduction efforts become more cost-effective are not over as we close the books on this specific restructuring effort. Our initiatives today that targeted reducing costs [indiscernible] this realities of great market conditions while on the next phase we will see further cost synergies that are aligned with our strategic agenda and our ability to support a strategic growth agenda that is profitable. 
Finally, turning to Slide 16, a few comments on our share buyback status. We continue to execute for our previous guidance resulting in $30 million of repurchases in Q2 and increasing our year-to-date figure through the first 6 months of 2016 to $72 million, representing approximately 1.8 million shares in repurchase. The previous guidance remains in place at this point in time that we will spend in a relatively consistent manner over the 3-year term of the program. Again, we continue to work for our strategic review and our plan is to provide an update in our use of cash and capital structure in our Investor Day later this year. 
With that, let me had it back over to Steve."

Turning to Slide 18, and as we discussed during the last several earnings calls, strengthening our project delivery performance is a top Jacobs priority. Our specific goals include providing our clients increased value with industry best quality and execution while our shareholders benefit from increased Jacobs project profitability. To achieve this, we're driving several initiatives including upgrading project tools, streamlining our procedures and strengthening our global strategic sourcing. We're also defining top quartile benchmarks, driving innovation and engaging all leaders to achieve best practices. 
We're beginning to see measurable improvement our project write-downs have been reduced by 21% versus last year and our low-cost high-value India execution center has increased significantly. We're also receiving positive feedback from our customers. Our client approved Value Plus project savings currently stand at $4.7 billion through the first 6 months, and client satisfaction is running at greater than 92%. This is a long-term transformation and much of the improvement is ahead. Many initiatives are underway, and we expect full rollout in fiscal year 2017. I'm excited for our employees when it comes to project delivery excellence. We're committing resources and investment that will unleash our people to excel a high level that they desire to be proud about the work we deliver for our clients. 
Moving to Slide 19. As previously discussed, we believe that developing and executing a profitable global strategy is necessary for Jacobs to deliver mid- and long-term industry-leading shareholder value. Demonstrating our commitment to this, Al [indiscernible] who has led large global functions and processes utilizing strategic planning to achieve success, has joined Jacobs to lead our global strategy efforts. 
Late last year, we commenced our strategic review. The first phase of this involved a deep dive on where we make money, by office, by customer, by our different project delivery models and many other analytical [indiscernible]. Our business leaders are now combining this data with a strategic lens to further optimize our global office footprint with the goal of better serving our clients and extracting further cost synergies. When we roll out our strategy later this year, we will provide an update on the new and additional 2017 cost savings. To be clear, as we now approach the successful completion of the restructuring initiative, which was tied to rightsizing Jacobs to the challenged market conditions, the next phase of strategic cost optimization will be more aligned with our strategic growth agenda. 
We're now moving into assessing current end markets and geographies along with potential new growth opportunities. Additionally, we'll evaluate those industries and businesses that do not earn an adequate return and make decisions on how to manage these to create shareholder value. Our goal is to have an overarching Jacobs strategy that provides a blueprint focused on profitable growth and additional cost efficiency opportunities, which leads to an improved return profile for the Jacobs portfolio longer term. Our strategy blueprint will also provide clarity on other key elements such as capital deployment and risk profile. We're targeting to review this with our board in July, and soon after, we'll provide a strategic review to the investment community. 
On the last slide, while our second quarter and first half generally met our expectations, we continue to be pressured by the challenging global environment. The economic dynamics of commodity prices such as oil and mining will continue to impact our business, although our portfolio diversity remains a strength. Our cost savings initiatives should benefit the company as they continue to ramp up and our market strategies play out in certain businesses. We expect both of these initiatives will yield additional improvements as we move through the second half of fiscal year 2016. Our first half performance gave us increased confidence that we'll meet our objectives for the year. Consequently, we're narrowing our fiscal year 2016 EPS guidance to $2.90 to $3.20. 
With that, I'd like to thank you for listening and I will now open it up for question. Austin?"

The profitability associated with some of your business is very interesting. And I guess based on some of the hires that you've also just announced, is it fair to say, when you actually provide your color on your long-term strategy, that there could be something more transformational here with Jacobs?

Look, the dynamic of the restructuring, certainly, there was Phase 1 that we did before we initiated our realignment into the LOB structure, right? And so as the LOB structure came into play, and as you recall, this was announced in our first quarter, I believe, and officially and formally in the first quarter of this year, and the teams have been forming and ultimately coming up with an idea what the new structure looks like to help support their growth agendas. And so that has been a big driver to incremental benefits associated with the restructuring as you now see it. Specifically, as it relates to what's in the forecast for 2016, the reality is if you look at where we are right now in terms of our total cost to date, I think we're somewhere in the neighborhood of -- in the middle 250 figure number roughly. And so given that we still got close to $100 million ago, that means that as we're executing now, the benefits of that really won't happen in a material way on a full annualized basis until we enter into fiscal year 2017. So certainly, some of it is occurring this year. It certainly is helping as it relates to our ability to perform against our original expectations.

And globally, when we comment about those feeds, numerous feeds, first of all, they're up significantly from last year, the number of wins on the FEED side, which are really the smaller portion of potential larger opportunities because where we've seen in the past is once we get into the FEED, when there's a higher profitability that we're going to be able to convert that to more work. Whether it's fully EPC or EPCM opportunity, it provides a significant pipeline to grow with those existing clients. So we're optimistic about that. We're also -- we have shifted very specifically beyond focusing on a set of core clients to spreading our wings and going after more of the pie and more of the market, and that's going very well and we've announced some recent larger framework agreements with the multinational customers that historically we haven't been as strong in, and so I'd say we're extending our reach. And then also there's several factors around the cracker world as far as our participation in some of the [indiscernible] work around some of these large projects but also more importantly derivatives. So there's a lot of derivative opportunities that people are growing know that a lot of the front-end capacities put into the market, and that's an area where we're extremely strong.

So your comparability figures are a little bit more challenged in the first half of '15 to 2016 than they would normally be. So as I think about how the comparability will look going forward, very much, much more favorable. And as I outlined in the call, in terms of our prepared remarks, we do expect, especially, since we would eliminate some of the one-time items that we saw in the Industrial business in Q2 of 2016, by default, we expect the momentum in our life sciences business to start to pick up going forward in that particular business.

And so we continue to see opportunity at Jacobs to drive improvement, efficiency across the company in a meaningful way in many different areas of our spend. The restructuring was clearly heavily focused on adjusting our headcount to the marketplace with some office initiatives. I think as we're now moving into the more strategic phase of our cost optimization, we're broadening that -- all of our spend across Jacobs, and our initial assessment and the strategy show sed significant opportunity over the next several years. So the reason why we're talking about that and doing that is we're not satisfied with the margins in this business, and we believe that there should be margin growth in all terms. So I would just say that our strategy expectation is for margin improvement over the next several years, and that's what we're going to go after with both the efficiency and mix of business that we're going after. And I'll just end that by seeing, what you should expect that is when some of the commodity businesses cycle back up with all this work we're doing on cost improvement we should see eventually stronger margins in those businesses as well."

I think that VanDyke was just a perfect example of how [indiscernible] bolt-on acquisition that was initiated led by our aerospace and technology team, and we're starting to have more discussion internally across all 4 lines of businesses on strategically profitable, in fact, high-value M&A opportunities are starting to come in for discussion."

Okay. As you know, turning to Slide 2, our earnings announcement and Form 10-Q were released this morning, and we'll be posting a copy of this slide presentation to our website, which we will reference in our prepared remarks.
Before starting, I would like to refer you to our forward-looking statements. Any statements that we make today that are not based on historical fact are forward-looking statements. Although such statements are based on our current estimates and expectations and currently available competitive, financial and economic data, forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements as actual results may differ materially. There are a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that cause Jacobs' actual results to differ materially from what may be contained, projected or implied by our forward-looking statements. For a description of some of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that may occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, see our most recent earnings release and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as well as our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended October 2, 2015, including Item 1, business; Item 1A, risk factors; Item 3, Legal Proceedings; and Item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as well as other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
So please now turn to Slide 3 for a quick review of the agenda for today's call. Steve will begin with some comments on our BeyondZero safety culture here at Jacobs followed by a summary of our second quarter financial results. He will include summary comments on the portfolio of our 4 lines of business, or LOBs, and also provide some commentary on end market conditions for each. I will then provide a more in-depth discussion on our financial metrics, backlog and financials for our new lines of business, segment reporting. I will continue with some comments on our current restructuring efforts and capital allocation. Steve will then discuss some next steps for the company, focusing on our project delivery initiatives, strategic review and some closing comments. We will then open it up for some questions.
With that, I'll pass it now over to Steve Demetriou, our President and CEO."

At all Jacobs offices and customer job sites, the",2445,"Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to our Fiscal Year 2016 Second Quarter Earnings Call.
I'm on Slide 4, and before we dive into the results, I'd like to discuss our industry-leading BeyondZero safety culture. At all Jacobs offices and customer job sites, there's an unquestionable commitment to a safety-first behavior. And our culture of caring is not just what we do, but it's who we are. Through our relentless drive to improve safety performance, we have seen a number of incidents trend down over the last several years. In the first 6 months of this fiscal year, our overall injury rate, as measured by industry standard TRIR, total recordable incident rate, was at 0.24, considered top quartile performance and highly valued by our customers. This week, Jacobs is involved in the industry-wide global safety week, during which our employees are engaged with customers and local communities on improving safety awareness, focusing on 5 topics: safe driving, energy risks, positive mental health, travel security and safety innovation.
We recently appointed Catriona Schmolke, a Jacobs veteran of 28 years, as our new Head of Global Safety, and I have no doubt she'll continue to strengthen Jacobs' position as an industry safety leader. And importantly for shareholders, we recognize that companies that have sustainable best-in-class safety performance typically achieve superior operating and financial results. So at Jacobs, we believe safety is also a leading indicator and a key management metric which supports business performance and accountability.
Moving to Slide 5. I'll summarize our second quarter business performance. We continue to experience very challenging global economic conditions, particularly in petroleum and mining sectors. However, demonstrating the strength of our diverse portfolio, a more positive market, such as Aerospace & Technology, pharmabio and Buildings & Infrastructure, helped us mitigate these more challenged sectors.
Our revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion and our backlog ended at $18.2 billion, holding stable versus the previous quarter. A relentless focus on rightsizing our cost structure and driving efficiencies continued to benefit Jacobs. Through the first 6 months of this fiscal year, we have delivered $70 million of adjusted G&A cost savings to the bottom line, a 10% cost reduction versus last year. Our strong focus on upgrading and standardized project delivery tools, process and some capabilities is showing early signs of success. In the second quarter, improved project performance was a key contributor to a sequential increase in our total professional services gross margin.\
Our bottom line results were solid, with adjusted earnings for the second quarter at $0.75 per share. And I'm also pleased with the cash flow performance which helped us end the quarter with a strengthened balance sheet, and we look forward to further improvements as our heightened focus on working capital takes hold in the second half.
I'm now on Slide 6. And as we announced at the beginning of last quarter, we're now managing the company by 4 global lines of businesses. These are Petroleum & Chemicals, which is comprised of upstream refining and petrochemicals; Buildings & Infrastructure; Aerospace & Technology, which covers our national public government business, primarily supporting U.S. and U.K. government agencies in the areas of defense, space, nuclear and technology; and Industrial, which is comprised of mining and minerals, food, beverage and consumer goods, specialty chemicals, life sciences and field services.
The charts on this slide show the breakdowns of revenues and adjusted segment operating profit by each line of business, excluding non-allocated corporate expenses. Kevin will cover more financial details on the LOB shortly, but here, we provide insight into the different economics of each business, which provides a greater sense of profitability versus the top line. We believe a new financial disclosure will provide valuable insight on the diversity of our portfolio. For example, it's important to note that over 70% of our LOB profits year-to-date were driven by businesses that are not directly impacted by the hard-hit oil and mining industries.
The stability of our Aerospace & Technology, Buildings & Infrastructure and certain Industrial businesses form a strong foundation to drive profitable growth. And even within the petroleum and chemical line of business, end market diversity has helped Jacobs remain resilient in a challenging macroeconomic and provides long-term opportunities to achieve profitable growth with oil and gas -- when oil and gas market dynamics improve.
I'll cover our Petroleum & Chemicals group on Slide 7. Crude oil prices fell below $30 per barrel earlier in the quarter and have rebounded to over $40 most recently. However, much of this increase does not appear to be based on supply/demand dynamics. Price volatility is expected to continue, and there's significant uncertainty in which direction oil prices will move. The most pressured segment is clearly the upstream side of our business, where it's all about cash preservation. For many of our upstream clients, it's a wait-and-see spending strategy, and any capital being spent is primarily going to projects that drive cost out, ensure regulatory compliance and outsourcing plant maintenance programs, all areas of strength for Jacobs. Although our global Petroleum & Chemicals backlog is down from last year mainly due to the heavily hit upstream sector, especially in the Canadian oil sands, this line of business started to stabilize over the last several months. We are pleased that the second quarter held flat versus first quarter, demonstrating the success our team has had in focusing on markets where capital is being spent. This includes the midstream side of the industry, where we're winning business in pipelines, terminals and storage as our clients strive for more distribution flexibility and access to cheaper feedstock.
The refining sector remains profitable, although margins have narrowed in recent months. We're seeing continued opportunities in global refining, with a focus on maintenance turnaround activity of sustaining capital projects as well as compliance-mandated initiatives. One example of a recent success is a confidential client win for a significant 5-year sustaining services contract. We're also involved in the early stages of a few large scale refinery expansions and grassroot capacity projects across the globe, and we're seeing increased opportunities in process safety, an area where we can offer clients industry-leading capability.
Recent momentum in the petrochemical sector is also helping us to mitigate headwinds. Our strategy to geographically expanding chemicals is paying dividends as we're winning new framework agreements with several of the key global players. Many of our clients are adapting their facilities to capitalize on lower-cost gas feedstock, creating several opportunities for us to win plant revamp projects. Two recent examples of strategic client wins include a major engineering and procurement contract to support Monsanto's planned expansion in Louisiana and also our cracker revamp project in Europe. We have also won a significant number of front-end engineering design projects in the first 6 months of this fiscal year, up versus 2015, providing Jacobs a great opportunity to convert these to larger-scope projects in the near future. So across our global footprint, our petrochemical project pipeline is getting stronger.
Moving to Slide 8. As announced in February, Bob Pragada rejoined Jacobs as President of Global Industrial. Consistent with his new responsibilities, we have added the field services business unit to the Industrial line of business, which is reflected in the backlog reporting showing here for all periods.
Our mining clients are facing one of the most challenging commodity recessions of our generation, and similar to the oil and gas situation, it's all about preserving capital, reducing spending and deferring projects for as long as possible. We believe we've hit the bottom in mining and have stabilized the business, especially in Asia and the Americas, with a successful focus on sustaining capital programs. We're also well-positioned for a few larger capital projects that may get sanctioned in the mining industry and hope to announce a significant strategic win in the near term. Although our global mining backlog plummeted from 2015, our total Industrial backlog is up approximately $1 billion from last year due to our strong growth in life sciences and held flat through the first 6 months of the current fiscal year.
Our life sciences segment continues to benefit from a strong wave of new product approvals. For example, the number of new molecular entities that were approved last year were the most since 1996, and we see the strength continuing. As a result, the biopharmaceutical majors are heavily investing in new capacity. We had success, winning many of the first wave of next-generation projects, including the large-cap programs for Biogen, VMS and Novo Nordisk. The second wave is now in its initial stage, with planned investments by many of the leading global biopharmaceutical players, and we expect to continue to win a large share of these opportunities due to our industry-leading technical expertise and strong project delivery track record.
In our specialty chemicals and manufacturing sector, we're experiencing modest growth in the phosphate fertilizer market, which is driven by continued population increases and agricultural demand. Our team is doing an excellent job in following our customers to emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia and Indonesia and expanding from our traditional technology licensing model to full design/supply contract.
In our field services business unit, we've had a number of growth opportunities in construction and maintenance as our clients continue to focus on near-term capital project optimization and longer-term sustaining CapEx gains. Our diversity in services uniquely positions us to be a critical partner to drive best-in-class results for our clients.
Moving to Slide 9. Our Buildings & Infrastructure group saw a slight uptick in backlog with just over $4.8 billion. This global line of business covers a number of sectors. Beginning with Buildings, we continue to maintain our strong global brand, particularly in the federal space. We were recently awarded major contracts with the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, General Service Administration and the National Guard. The health care industry continues to grow due to an aging population and new medical technologies, and we're well-positioned as evidenced by recent hospital project wins in San Francisco, Sydney -- and Sydney -- Cincinnati and Sydney. The corporate commercial building market is expanding for us. We recently won a major EPCM contract for 2 manufacturing centers in the defense industry. We've also been awarded several national building contracts including Vanguard, Sanofi, Amgen and SAP [ph], very exciting. There's also an opportunity to provide planning design and program management for a major education city in Australia. This represents a wave of future connected, resilient, sustainable, smart cities of the future. In mission-critical, cloud computing, the Internet of Things and a switch to software and apps is driving an expansion of data centers globally. We were impacted in the last few quarters by a temporary spending decline by our largest client due to a strategic schedule change. However, we expect to resume growth there soon.
Infrastructure markets are also growing steadily. In the highway sector, our largest infrastructure market globally, we see continued opportunity to grow. The passage of the U.S. highways [sic] [ highway ] bill is providing increased spending confidence and represents growth in high mobility areas such as the West Coast, Texas Southeast and Virginia mid-Atlantic. We are working on the largest integrated transport and revitalization project in Australia, and we were recently awarded a highway upgrade project in Adelaide. And in the U.K. where we're a top provider in planning and design, we were recently awarded 3 significant contracts for Highway [sic] [ Highways ] England.
The global rail market is also steadily growing as exemplified by the Los Angeles metropolitan area positioning for a new $130 billion transportation revenue package. Recent major awards include a metro rail project in the Middle East, construction management for a large metro rail project in Seattle and a multi-year CM contract for BART in San Francisco.
Finally, we see increased investment in global aviation, where we're a leading planning asset management company in a top design firm. We recently were awarded an airport design in New York and were selected to assist the American U.S. Airways rebranding through 80 airports across the U.S.
Our Aerospace & Technology line of business is summarized on Slide 10. We're pleased with the underlying backlog trends in this business. Although year-over-year backlog declined, lower margin revenue burn has been replaced by new higher value strategic sales, which is reflected in the strong second quarter operating profit performance. Also, as we previously reported, the backlog excludes approximately $250 million of ""recently awarded but protested"" contracts, which, by the way, is 3x the protest level of last year. We're confident, however, that most of this delayed backlog will be confirmed in the near future.
Another positive trend is that Jacobs has won all our major contract rebids through the first half of this fiscal year, which contrast with a 2015 industry benchmark of only a 25% incumbent win rate. Our recently announced U.S. Army Aberdeen Test Center and NASA Ames Research aerospace testing and facilities contracts are significant examples of this rebid success.
Our U.S. government work, particularly with homeland security in intelligence-related markets, remains strong. Significant commercial investment in mission-critical and advanced investment design facilities continues, and our pipeline of opportunities in this area is increasing. As announced last month, we acquired the Van Dyke Technology Group, a 180-person firm, which enhances our capabilities in the fast-growing cyber security and intelligence-related market. We expect to significantly leverage the acquired capabilities globally across Jacobs' public and private sector clients.
The U.S. environmental market sector represents excellent growth potential for Jacobs. Most notably, we recently finalized a framework agreement with BP, a core client of Jacobs, for environmental remediation. In addition, we've leveraged our strong environmental experience to win a significant construction service contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority. In the U.K. the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority funding is projected to be around $20 billion over the next 5 years. A large portion of the spend will be at Sellafield and prioritized around high-hazard risk mitigation, where we are positioned well as an incumbent. The final sanctioning of the Hinkley Point C nuclear new build project, which represents a long-term upside for Jacobs, has been delayed but is expected in the relatively near future.
In defense, we reached an agreement with the U.K. Ministry of Defence to extend the financially significant maintenance and operations contract for the Atomic Weapons Establishment, known as AWE, with a contract term through 2025. Also promising for us is the U.K.'s decision to invest in naval shipyards, the F-35 fighter jet and other platforms, providing an improved opportunity pipeline for Jacobs.
I'll now pass to Kevin to present more details on our financial results."
282159,331122163,974316,"Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Jacobs Solutions Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve.And I'm now turning to Slide 12.As we've previously communicated in our last earnings call, we were expecting some continued short-term challenges on revenue, and as expected, revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, which is down just",1715,"Thanks, Steve.
And I'm now turning to Slide 12.
As we've previously communicated in our last earnings call, we were expecting some continued short-term challenges on revenue, and as expected, revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, which is down just over 4% from a year ago. Our backlog stands at $18.2 billion, as Steve already highlighted, flat versus Q1 in a relatively challenging environment. We actually feel good about that stability. In addition, our book-to-bill on a trailing 12 basis was 0.94, slightly up from the last quarter. Gross margin dollars for the quarter were $444 million, resulting in an improved gross margin profile versus Q1, up 50 basis points to 16%. Importantly, this improvement was driven by our professional services gross margins, which was at the highest level since 2014, an indication of our improving execution. This has allowed the company to more than offset some of the pricing pressures that exist in certain of our more challenged end markets. Benefits associated with our restructuring continue to gain momentum, resulting in our adjusted G&A being down $22 million versus the year ago quarter.
As Steve talked to, on a year-to-date basis, our adjusted G&A costs have now fallen over 10% versus the year ago period, a clear indication of solid execution against our restructuring program. As a result, adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $122 million, down modestly from our Q1 level. Adjusted EPS was $0.75 for the quarter. This includes a net positive impact of $0.03 from several items, including the successful resolution of an international tax litigation, a one-time benefit to noncontrolling interest related to certain work performed with one of our partially owned subsidiaries, the costs associated with the litigation settlement and the negative impact of a customer bankruptcy.
Finally, operating working capital improved during the quarter, resulting in our net debt position at Q1 of $181 million, turning to actually a positive net cash position of $27 million in Q2, the first net cash positive position that Jacobs has seen since the fourth quarter of 2013. This was driven by an improved free cash flow of over $200 million during the quarter, and importantly, the improvement in our net cash position is after having spent an additional $30 million in share repurchases during the second quarter.
Moving on to Slide 13. I would like to provide some brief commentary on our total backlog. Our backlog currently stands at the combined $18.2 billion recently noted, which is flat from the Q1 figures. We are pleased with this performance as our stability in backlog versus the last quarter was seen across the portfolio, including the Petroleum & Chemicals business. With regard to our professional and field services backlog mix for the quarter -- through the quarter, professional services now stands at $11.4 billion and field service at $6.9 billion, both stable figures versus our Q1 figures. Our backlog at the end of the quarter again exemplifies the benefits of our diversity. We're certain of our lines of businesses that target customers, and stronger end markets has held steady and helped mitigate some of the pressures from reduced CapEx spending by oil and gas and mining customers.
So turning to Slide 14. I would like to spend a bit of time discussing our new segment reporting. For our SEC guidelines, we have aligned our segment reporting with how we now manage the business. To simplify our discussion, and since this is our first time reporting our segment information, I've noted here on the slide our 6-month results. I believe these 6-month results are indicative of the overall trends in our business, and I will provide some additional color on the quarterly numbers as appropriate in my following comments.
You will note that 3 of the 4 LOBs have actually shown relatively stable adjusted operating profit performance over the first half of 2016, resulting in an improved margin profile in the first 6 months versus the year ago period for our LOB segments. Our Petroleum & Chemicals operating profit margin, up 60 basis points to 3.5%, has shown resiliency in their year-to-date performance and actually held operating profit levels relatively flat in a tough environment. In fact, Petroleum & Chemicals adjusted profit levels increased in Q2 2016 versus the year ago period as our aggressive restructuring efforts resulted in cost reductions, which allowed for us to offset the drop in revenues year-over-year.
Industrial profit is down versus the year ago period, driven by the challenge in mining and minerals end market and the margin benefits last year that were associated with large mining project closeout benefits. The business was also impacted negatively during Q2 this year by a litigation settlement and a customer bankruptcy. Going forward, the elimination of these items and the growing momentum in our life sciences unit bodes well for improving profitability in the second half of 2016.
Regarding Aerospace & Technology, revenues declined and lower margin business has impacted the top line versus the 6-month year-to-date figures of 2015. However, this business still delivered flat adjusted operating profit for the fiscal year first half, improving operating margins actually to 7.7%, up 50 basis points versus the year ago period. The LOB also realized operating profit growth during the second quarter versus the year ago period.
Lastly, B&I revenue, while decreasing over the 6 months, we are optimistic about its ability to grow and deliver profitable growth going forward. Substantial benefits associated with our restructuring effort drove the LOB's improvement in adjusted operating profit over the first half of the year. This resulted in operating margin rising to 7.3% or 70 basis points up versus the year ago period.
As we look ahead, we like the make up of the LOB diversity as long-term market dynamics in our Buildings & Infrastructure, Aerospace & Technology and Industrial, specifically life sciences businesses, position the company well for growth. And with Petroleum & Chemicals, we believe this line of business provides long-term opportunities to profitably grow when oil and gas market dynamics ultimately improve.
Finally, a few comments about our corporate-related costs. These non-allocated corporate costs consist of cost elements that some are inherently predictable, such as routine G&A expenses related to the corporation as a whole, acquisition-related expenses, primarily amortization of intangible assets, and other routine costs and expenses. But also includes other items that are inherently less predictable, including adjustments to employees' fringe benefit programs around medical, pensions and other employee benefits, certain litigation costs, including defense and settlement expenditures, and margin adjustments on projects now related to LOB performance. These non-allocated corporate costs rose by approximately $19 million over the first half of 2016 versus the year ago period. Increased legal defense costs, fringe-rate true ups and expenses related to our strategy work represent a majority and the bulk of the increase in costs. We believe that especially as it relates to the more predictable elements of this line item that we now present in our segment reporting, we will be able to reduce these non-allocated corporate costs longer term.
So before turning to make some additional comments on our restructuring, a few words about our segment reporting efforts. I really would like to call out the extraordinary efforts of the finance and accounting team here at Jacobs. I am thrilled that they were more than up to the formidable challenge to meet the aggressive time table we set when we put in place -- once we'd put in place the decision to transition to an LOB management structure. I know that the board, and certainly myself, would like to personally thank them.
So I'd like to turn now to Slide 13 [sic] [ Slide 15 ], where I would like to provide an update on the restructuring effort that was announced in July of last year. As we have discussed in past quarters, the primary focus of our restructuring efforts has been to simplify Jacobs globally and to ensure we have a lean cost-effective structure. We have been very successful with our restructuring efforts, and these are already benefiting our financials as evidenced by the significant reduction in G&A over the last 12 months. These actions support the company's ability to deliver satisfactory profit levels regardless of the economic environment in which we are operating, and we look forward to continued benefits in the second half of this fiscal year and the full year impact in next fiscal year 2017.
Our restructuring efforts are now nearing completion. Our primary focus continues to be on reducing our fixed cost infrastructure, primarily in labor and real estate. Given the incremental opportunities identified as part of the reorganization that we announced late last year, calendar year, we are now forecasting the total one-time cost of our restructuring effort to be $330 million to $350 million through the end of Q3 approximately, with final expected gross savings of $240 million to $270 million. Importantly, the cash portion of both our costs and savings result in a cash payback of less than 1 year relative to this effort.
Steve will discuss -- excuse me. Steve will discuss further in his closing comments coming up, but our cost reduction efforts to become more cost-effective are not over as we close the books on this specific restructuring effort. Our initiatives to date have targeted reducing costs to match this -- realities of current market conditions, while on the next phase, we will seek further cost synergies that are aligned with our strategic agenda and our ability to support a strategic growth agenda that is profitable.
Finally, turning to Slide 16, a few comments on our share buyback status. We continue to execute for our previous guidance, resulting in $30 million of repurchases in Q2 and increasing our year-to-date figure through the first 6 months of 2016 to $72 million, representing approximately 1.8 million shares being repurchased. The previous guidance remains in place at this point in time that we will spend in a relatively consistent manner over the 3-year term of the program. Again, we continue to work through our strategic review, and our plan is to provide an update in our use of cash and capital structure in our Investor Day later this year.
With that, let me hand it back over to Steve."

Turning to Slide 18. And as we discussed during the last several earnings calls, strengthening our project delivery performance is a top Jacobs priority. Our specific goals, including providing our clients increased value with industry best quality and execution while our shareholders benefit from increased Jacobs project profitability. To achieve this, we're driving several initiatives, including upgrading project tools, streamlining our procedures and strengthening our global strategic sourcing. We're also defining top quartile benchmarks, driving innovation and engaging all leaders to achieve best practices.
We're beginning to see measurable improvement our project write-downs have been reduced by 21% versus last year, and our low-cost high-value India execution center work has increased significantly. We're also receiving positive feedback from our customers. Our client-approved Value Plus project savings currently stand at $4.7 billion through the first 6 months, and client satisfaction is running at greater than 92%. This is a long-term transformation, and much of the improvement is ahead. Many initiatives are underway, and we expect full rollout in fiscal year 2017. I'm excited for our employees when it comes to project delivery excellence. We're committing resources and investment that will unleash our people to excel a high level that they desire to be proud about the work we deliver for our clients.
Moving to Slide 19. As previously discussed, we believe that developing and executing a profitable global strategy is necessary for Jacobs to deliver mid- and long-term industry-leading shareholder value. Demonstrating our commitment to this, Alan Dick, who has led large global functions and businesses, utilizing strategic planning to achieve success, has joined Jacobs to lead our global strategy efforts.
Late last year, we commenced our strategic review. The first phase of this involved a deep dive on where we make money, by office, by customer, by our different project delivery models and many other analytical slices. Our business leaders are now combining this data with a strategic lens to further optimize our global office footprint, with the goal of better serving our clients and extracting further cost synergies. When we roll out our strategy later this year, we will provide an update on the new and additional 2017 cost savings. To be clear, as we now approach the successful completion of the restructuring initiative, which was tied to rightsizing Jacobs to the challenged market conditions, the next phase of strategic cost optimization will be more aligned with our strategic growth agenda.
We're now moving into assessing current end markets and geographies along with potential new growth opportunities. Additionally, we'll evaluate those industries and businesses that do not earn an adequate return and make decisions on how to manage these to create shareholder value. Our goal is to have an overarching Jacobs strategy that provides the blueprint focused on profitable growth and additional cost efficiency opportunities, which leads to an improved return profile for the Jacobs portfolio longer term. Our strategy blueprint will also provide clarity on other key elements such as capital deployment and risk profile. We're targeting to review this with our board in July, and soon after, we'll provide a strategic review to the investment community.
So the last slide, while our second quarter and first half generally met our expectations, we continue to be pressured by a challenging global environment. The economic dynamics of commodity prices such as oil and mining will continue to impact our business, although our portfolio diversity remains a strength. Our cost savings initiatives should benefit the company as they continue to ramp up and our market strategies play out in certain businesses. We expect both of these initiatives will yield additional improvements as we move through the second half of fiscal year 2016. Our first half performance gave us increased confidence that we'll meet our objectives for the year. Consequently, we're narrowing our fiscal year 2016 EPS guidance to $2.90 to $3.20.
With that, I'd like to thank you for listening and will now open it up for questions. Austin?"

Kevin, is there any way that you can help me understand the savings that is implied for the full year guidance now and in the back half of the year versus your expectations before? Because you keep increasing your costs and your savings -- the restructuring, and I guess, it sounds like there's more to go after that. I guess I'm just trying to understand for 2016, how much of your earnings are being held by the savings and sort of how much in terms of a deterioration of your organic business -- how much is that when I think about your 2016 guidance, if that makes any sense? And then I guess my other question, just sort of more strategically, Steve, it was helpful to provide the margins by line of business. The profitability associated with some of your business is very interesting. And I guess, based on some of the hires that you've also just announced, is it fair to say, when you actually provide your color on your long-term strategy, that there could be something more transformational here with Jacobs? Could we see -- is there a bigger opportunity for divestitures of some of your businesses? Or do you feel like a lot can be accomplished through internal self help?

And so, there's a lot going on. We'll obviously look first and foremost of how do we organically go after that and inorganic could also -- M&A could also play into that. And I did comment, we are going to look at underperforming markets and sectors equally as strong, and that could lead to some decisions, potential divestitures as well. But it's premature to talk about what that will look like. Is it going to be several different small to midsized initiatives that add up to something big? Or is it going to involve some transformational steps? I would say everything is on the table, and we'll have a lot more to talk about later this year."

Look, the dynamic of the restructuring, certainly, there was phase 1 that we did before we initiated our realignment into the LOB structure, right? And so as the LOB structure came into play, and as you recall, this was announced in our first quarter, I believe, and officially and formally in the first quarter of this year, and the teams have been forming and ultimately coming up with an idea what the new structure looks like to help support their growth agendas. And so that has been a big driver to incremental benefits associated with the restructuring as you now see it. Specifically, as it relates to what's in the forecast for 2016, the reality is if you look at where we are right now in terms of our total cost to date, I think we're somewhere in the neighborhood of in the middle 250 figure -- numbers roughly. And so given that we still got close to $100 million ago, that means that as we're executing now, the benefits of that really won't happen, in a material way, on a full annualized basis until we enter into fiscal year 2017. So certainly, some of it is occurring this year. It certainly is helping as it relates to our ability to perform against our original expectations. And I would say that our guidance that Steve has provided is prudent as it relates to the current economic uncertainties that we're facing."

And globally, when we comment about those FEED, numerous FEED means, first of all, they're up significantly from last year, the number of wins on the FEED side, which are really the smaller portion of potential larger opportunities because where we've seen in the past is once we get into the FEED, when there's a higher probability that we're going to be able to convert that to more work, whether it's a full EPC or EPCM opportunity, it provides a significant pipeline to grow with those existing clients. So we're optimistic about that. We're also -- we have shifted very specifically beyond focusing on a set of core clients to spreading our wings and going after more of the pie and more of the market, and that's going very well, and we've announced some recent large framework agreements with some multinational customers that historically we haven't been as strong in, and so I'd say, we're extending our reach. And then also, there's several factors around the cracker world as far as our participation in some of the [indiscernible] work around some of these large projects,but also more importantly, derivatives. So there's a lot of derivative opportunities that people are going know that a lot of the front-end capacities put into the market, and that's an area where we're extremely strong.

I will say one of the focal points for Jacobs, as we continue to look at how to strategically adjust to address the market opportunities, is we're looking more today than maybe we have in the past around selective larger projects where we're capable of strong project delivery capability.

I think that there's 2 things going on in the numbers associated with the Industrial business. There are some unique benefits that were realized in the first half of 2015 and there are some unique negatives that we saw in the first half of 2016. So your comparability figures are a little bit more challenged in the first half of '15 to 2016 than they would normally be. So as I think about how the comparability will look going forward, very much, much more favorable. And as I outlined in the call, in terms of our prepared remarks, we do expect, especially, since we will eliminate some of the onetime items that we saw in the Industrial business in Q2 of 2016, by default, we expect the momentum in our life sciences business to start to pick up going forward in that particular business. So I do think we're going to be seeing a much more favorable picture going forward."

And so we continue to see opportunity at Jacobs to drive improvement, efficiency across the company in a meaningful way in many different areas of our spend. The restructuring was clearly heavily focused on adjusting our headcount to the marketplace with some office initiatives. I think as we're now moving into the more strategic phase of our cost optimization, we're broadening that -- all of our spend across Jacobs, and our initial assessment in the strategy work shows some significant opportunity over the next several years. So the reason why we're talking about that and doing that is we're not satisfied with the margins in this business, and we believe that there should be margin growth in all terms. So I would just say that our strategy expectation is for margin improvement over the next several years, and that's what we're going to go after with both the efficiency and mix of business that we're going after. And I'll just end that by seeing, what you should expect that is when some of the commodity businesses' cycle back up, with all this work we're doing on cost improvement, we should see eventually stronger margins in those businesses as well."

Okay. As you know, turning to Slide 2, our earnings announcement and Form 10-Q were released this morning, and we'll be posting a copy of this slide presentation to our website, which we will reference in our prepared remarks.
Before starting, I would like to refer you to our forward-looking statements. Any statements that we make today that are not based on historical fact are forward-looking statements. Although such statements are based on our current estimates and expectations and currently available competitive, financial and economic data, forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements as actual results may differ materially. 
There are a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that cause Jacobs' actual results to differ materially from what may be contained, projected or implied by our forward-looking statements. For a description of some of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that may occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, see our most recent earnings release and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as well as our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended October 2, 2015, including Item 1, business; Item 1A, risk factors; Item 3, Legal Proceedings; and Item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as well as other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
So please now turn to Slide 3 for a quick review of the agenda for today's call. Steve will begin with some comments on our BeyondZero safety culture here at Jacobs followed by a summary of our second quarter financial results. He will include summary comments on the portfolio of our 4 lines of business, or LOBs, and also provide some commentary on end market conditions for each. I will then provide a more in-depth discussion on our financial metrics, backlog and financials for our new lines of business, segment reporting. I will continue with some comments on our current restructuring efforts and capital allocation. Steve will then discuss some next steps for the company, focusing on our project delivery initiatives, strategic review and some closing comments. We will then open it up for some questions.
With that, I'll pass it now over to Steve Demetriou, our President and CEO."

At all Jacobs offices and customer job sites, the",2436,"Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to our Fiscal Year 2016 Second Quarter Earnings Call.
I'm on Slide 4, and before we dive into the results, I'd like to discuss our industry-leading BeyondZero safety culture. At all Jacobs offices and customer job sites, there's an unquestionable commitment to a safety-first behavior. And our culture of caring is not just what we do, but it's who we are. Through our relentless drive to improve safety performance, we have seen a number of incidents trend down over the last several years. In the first 6 months of this fiscal year, our overall injury rate, as measured by industry standard TRIR, total recordable incident rate, was at 0.24, considered top quartile performance and highly valued by our customers. This week, Jacobs is involved in the industry-wide global Safety Week, during which our employees are engaged with customers and local communities on improving safety awareness, focusing on 5 topics: safe driving, energy risks, positive mental health, travel security and safety innovation.
We recently appointed Catriona Schmolke, a Jacobs veteran of 28 years, as our new Head of Global Safety, and I have no doubt she'll continue to strengthen Jacobs' position as an industry safety leader. And importantly for shareholders, we recognize that companies that have sustainable best-in-class safety performance typically achieve superior operating and financial results. So at Jacobs, we believe safety is also a leading indicator and a key management metric which supports business performance and accountability.
Moving to Slide 5. I'll summarize our second quarter business performance. We continue to experience very challenging global economic conditions, particularly in petroleum and mining sectors. However, demonstrating the strength of our diverse portfolio, a more positive market, such as Aerospace & Technology, pharmabio and Buildings & Infrastructure, helped us mitigate these more challenged sectors.
Our revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion and our backlog ended at $18.2 billion, holding stable versus the previous quarter. A relentless focus on rightsizing our cost structure and driving efficiencies continued to benefit Jacobs. Through the first 6 months of this fiscal year, we have delivered $70 million of adjusted G&A cost savings to the bottom line, a 10% cost reduction versus last year. Our strong focus on upgrading and standardized project delivery tools, process and some capabilities is showing early signs of success. In the second quarter, improved project performance was a key contributor to a sequential increase in our total professional services gross margin.\
Our bottom line results were solid, with adjusted earnings for the second quarter at $0.75 per share. And I'm also pleased with the cash flow performance which helped us end the quarter with a strengthened balance sheet, and we look forward to further improvements as our heightened focus on working capital takes hold in the second half.
I'm now on Slide 6. And as we announced at the beginning of last quarter, we're now managing the company by 4 global lines of businesses. These are Petroleum & Chemicals, which is comprised of upstream refining and petrochemicals; Buildings & Infrastructure; Aerospace & Technology, which covers our national public government business, primarily supporting U.S. and U.K. government agencies in the areas of defense, space, nuclear and technology; and Industrial, which is comprised of mining and minerals, food, beverage and consumer goods, specialty chemicals, life sciences and field services.
The charts on this slide show the breakdowns of revenues and adjusted segment operating profit by each line of business, excluding non-allocated corporate expenses. Kevin will cover more financial details on the LOB shortly, but here, we provide insight into the differing economics of each business, which provides a greater sense of profitability versus the top line. We believe a new financial disclosure will provide valuable insight on the diversity of our portfolio. For example, it's important to note that over 70% of our LOB profits year-to-date were driven by businesses that are not directly impacted by the hard-hit oil and mining industries.
The stability of our Aerospace & Technology, Buildings & Infrastructure and certain Industrial businesses form a strong foundation to drive profitable growth. And even within the petroleum and chemicals line of business, end market diversity has helped Jacobs remain resilient in a challenging macroeconomic and provides long-term opportunities to achieve profitable growth with oil and gas -- when oil and gas market dynamics improve.
I'll cover our Petroleum & Chemicals group on Slide 7. Crude oil prices fell below $30 per barrel earlier in the quarter and have rebounded to over $40 most recently. However, much of this increase does not appear to be based on supply/demand dynamics. Price volatility is expected to continue, and there's significant uncertainty in which direction oil prices will move. The most pressured segment is clearly the upstream side of our business, where it's all about cash preservation. For many of our upstream clients, it's a wait-and-see spending strategy, and any capital being spent is primarily going to projects that drive cost out, ensure regulatory compliance and outsourcing plant maintenance programs, all areas of strength for Jacobs. Although our global Petroleum & Chemicals backlog is down from last year mainly due to the heavily hit upstream sector, especially in the Canadian oil sands, this line of business started to stabilize over the last several months. We are pleased that the second quarter held flat versus first quarter, demonstrating the success our team has had in focusing on markets where capital is being spent. This includes the midstream side of the industry, where we're winning business in pipelines, terminals and storage as our clients strive for more distribution flexibility and access to cheaper feedstock.
The refining sector remains profitable, although margins have narrowed in recent months. We're seeing continued opportunities in global refining, with a focus on maintenance, turnaround activity of sustaining capital projects as well as compliance-mandated initiatives. One example of a recent success is a confidential client win for a significant 5-year sustaining services contract. We're also involved in the early stages of a few large scale refinery expansions and grassroot capacity projects across the globe, and we're seeing increased opportunities in process safety, an area where we can offer clients industry-leading capability.
Recent momentum in the petrochemical sector is also helping us to mitigate headwinds. Our strategy to geographically expand in chemicals is paying dividends as we're winning new framework agreements with several of the key global players. Many of our clients are adapting their facilities to capitalize on lower-cost gas feedstock, creating several opportunities for us to win plant revamp projects. Two recent examples of strategic client wins include a major engineering and procurement contract to support Monsanto's planned expansion in Louisiana and also our cracker revamp project in Europe. We have also won a significant number of front-end engineering design projects in the first 6 months of this fiscal year, up versus 2015, providing Jacobs a great opportunity to convert these to larger-scope projects in the near future. So across our global footprint, our petrochemical project pipeline is getting stronger.
Moving to Slide 8. As announced in February, Bob Pragada rejoined Jacobs as President of Global Industrial. Consistent with his new responsibilities, we have added the field services business unit to the Industrial line of business, which is reflected in the backlog reporting showing here for all periods.
Our mining clients are facing one of the most challenging commodity recessions of our generation, and similar to the oil and gas situation, it's all about preserving capital, reducing spending and deferring projects for as long as possible. We believe we've hit the bottom in mining and have stabilized the business, especially in Asia and the Americas, with a successful focus on sustaining capital programs. We're also well-positioned for a few larger capital projects that may get sanctioned in the mining industry and hope to announce a significant strategic win in the near term. Although our global mining backlog plummeted from 2015, our total Industrial backlog is up approximately $1 billion from last year due to our strong growth in life sciences and held flat through the first 6 months of the current fiscal year.
Our life sciences segment continues to benefit from a strong wave of new product approvals. For example, the number of new molecular entities that were approved last year were the most since 1996, and we see the strength continuing. As a result, the biopharmaceutical majors are heavily investing in new capacity. We had success, winning many of the first wave of next-generation projects, including the large-cap programs for Biogen, VMS and Novo Nordisk. The second wave is now in its initial stage, with planned investments by many of the leading global biopharmaceutical players, and we expect to continue to win a large share of these opportunities due to our industry-leading technical expertise and strong project delivery track record.
In our specialty chemicals and manufacturing sector, we're experiencing modest growth in the phosphate fertilizer market, which is driven by continued population increases and agricultural demand. Our team is doing an excellent job in following our customers to emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia and Indonesia and expanding from our traditional technology licensing model to full design/supply contract.
In our field services business unit, we've had a number of growth opportunities in construction and maintenance as our clients continue to focus on near-term capital project optimization and longer-term sustaining CapEx gains. Our diversity in services uniquely positions us to be a critical partner to drive best-in-class results for our clients.
Moving to Slide 9. Our Buildings & Infrastructure group saw a slight uptick in backlog to just over $4.8 billion. This global line of business covers a number of sectors. Beginning with Buildings, we continue to maintain our strong global brand, particularly in the federal space. We were recently awarded major contracts with the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, General Service Administration and the National Guard. 
The health care industry continues to grow due to an aging population and new medical technology, and we're well-positioned as evidenced by recent hospital project wins in San Francisco, Sydney -- and Sydney -- Cincinnati and Sydney. The corporate commercial building market is expanding for us. We recently won a major EPCM contract for 2 manufacturing centers in the defense industry. We've also been awarded several national building contracts including Vanguard, Sanofi, Amgen and SAP. Very exciting is also an opportunity to provide planning design and program management for a major education city in Australia. This represents a wave of future connected, resilient, sustainable, smart cities of the future. 
In mission-critical, cloud computing, the Internet of Things and a switch to software and apps is driving an expansion of data centers globally. We were impacted in the last few quarters by a temporary spending decline by our largest client due to a strategic schedule change. However, we expect to resume growth there soon.
Infrastructure markets are also growing steadily. In the highway sector, our largest infrastructure market globally, we see continued opportunity to grow. The passage of the U.S. highways bill is providing increased spending confidence and represents growth in high mobility areas such as the West Coast, Texas Southeast and Virginia Mid-Atlantic. We are working on the largest integrated transport and revitalization project in Australia, and we were recently awarded a highway upgrade project in Adelaide. And in the U.K. where we're a top provider in planning and design, we were recently awarded 3 significant contracts for Highway [sic] (Highways) England.
The global rail market is also steadily growing as exemplified by the Los Angeles metropolitan area positioning for a new $130 billion transportation revenue package. Recent major awards include a metro rail project in the Middle East, construction management for a large metro rail project in Seattle and a multi-year CM contract for BART in San Francisco.
Finally, we see increased investment in global aviation, where we're a leading planning asset management company in a top design firm. We recently were awarded an airport design in New York and were selected to assist the American/U.S. Airways rebranding through 80 airports across the U.S.
Our Aerospace & Technology line of business is summarized on Slide 10. We're pleased with the underlying backlog trends in this business. Although year-over-year backlog declined, lower margin revenue burn has been replaced by new higher value strategic sales, which is reflected in the strong second quarter operating profit performance. Also, as we previously reported, the backlog excludes approximately $250 million of ""recently awarded but protested"" contracts, which, by the way, is 3x the protest level of last year. We're confident, however, that most of this delayed backlog will be confirmed in the near future.
Another positive trend is that Jacobs has won all our major contract rebids through the first half of this fiscal year, which contrasts with a 2015 industry benchmark of only a 25% incumbent win rate. Our recently announced U.S. Army Aberdeen Test Center and NASA Ames Research aerospace testing and facilities contracts are significant examples of this rebid success.
Our U.S. government work, particularly with Homeland Security and intelligence-related markets, remains strong. Significant commercial investment in mission-critical and advanced investment design facilities continues, and our pipeline of opportunities in this area is increasing. As announced last month, we acquired the Van Dyke Technology Group, a 180-person firm, which enhances our capabilities in the fast-growing cyber-security and intelligence-related market. We expect to significantly leverage the acquired capabilities globally across Jacobs' public and private sector clients.
The U.S. environmental market sector represents excellent growth potential for Jacobs. Most notably, we recently finalized a framework agreement with BP, a core client of Jacobs, for environmental remediation. In addition, we've leveraged our strong environmental experience to win a significant construction service contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority. In the U.K. the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority funding is projected to be around $20 billion over the next 5 years. A large portion of the spend will be at Sellafield and prioritized around high-hazard risk mitigation, where we are positioned well as an incumbent. The final sanctioning of the Hinkley Point C nuclear newbuild project, which represents a long-term upside for Jacobs, has been delayed but is expected in the relatively near future.
In defense, we reached an agreement with the U.K. Ministry of Defence to extend the financially significant maintenance and operations contract for the Atomic Weapons Establishment, known as AWE, with a contract term through 2025. Also promising for us is the U.K.'s decision to invest in naval shipyards, the F-35 fighter jet and other platforms, providing an improved opportunity pipeline for Jacobs.
I'll now pass to Kevin to present more details on our financial results."
282159,331122163,974725,"Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Jacobs Solutions Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve.And I'm now turning to Slide 12.As we've previously communicated in our last earnings call, we were expecting some continued short-term challenges on revenue, and as expected, revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, which is down just",1708,"Thanks, Steve.
And I'm now turning to Slide 12.
As we've previously communicated in our last earnings call, we were expecting some continued short-term challenges on revenue, and as expected, revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, which is down just over 4% from a year ago. Our backlog stands at $18.2 billion, as Steve already highlighted, flat versus Q1 in a relatively challenging environment. We actually feel good about that stability. In addition, our book-to-bill on a trailing 12 basis was 0.94, slightly up from the last quarter. Gross margin dollars for the quarter were $444 million, resulting in an improved gross margin profile versus Q1, up 50 basis points to 16%. Importantly, this improvement was driven by our professional services gross margins, which was at the highest level since 2014, an indication of our improving execution. This has allowed the company to more than offset some of the pricing pressures that exist in certain of our more challenged end markets. Benefits associated with our restructuring continue to gain momentum, resulting in our adjusted G&A being down $22 million versus the year ago quarter.
As Steve talked to, on a year-to-date basis, our adjusted G&A costs have now fallen over 10% versus the year ago period, a clear indication of solid execution against our restructuring program. As a result, adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $122 million, down modestly from our Q1 level. Adjusted EPS was $0.75 for the quarter. This includes a net positive impact of $0.03 from several items, including the successful resolution of an international tax litigation, a one-time benefit to noncontrolling interest related to certain work performed with one of our partially owned subsidiaries, the costs associated with the litigation settlement and the negative impact of a customer bankruptcy.
Finally, operating working capital improved during the quarter, resulting in our net debt position at Q1 of $181 million, turning to actually a positive net cash position of $27 million in Q2, the first net cash positive position that Jacobs has seen since the fourth quarter of 2013. This was driven by an improved free cash flow of over $200 million during the quarter, and importantly, the improvement in our net cash position is after having spent an additional $30 million in share repurchases during the second quarter.
Moving on to Slide 13. I would like to provide some brief commentary on our total backlog. Our backlog currently stands at the combined $18.2 billion recently noted, which is flat from the Q1 figures. We are pleased with this performance as our stability in backlog versus the last quarter was seen across the portfolio, including the Petroleum & Chemicals business. With regard to our professional and field services backlog mix for the quarter -- through the quarter, professional services now stands at $11.4 billion and field service at $6.9 billion, both stable figures versus our Q1 figures. Our backlog at the end of the quarter again exemplifies the benefits of our diversity where certain of our lines of businesses that target customers, and stronger end markets has held steady and helped mitigate some of the pressures from reduced CapEx spending by oil and gas and mining customers.
So turning to Slide 14. I would like to spend a bit of time discussing our new segment reporting. For our SEC guidelines, we have aligned our segment reporting with how we now manage the business. To simplify our discussion, and since this is our first time reporting our segment information, I've noted here on the slide our 6-month results. I believe these 6-month results are indicative of the overall trends in our business, and I will provide some additional color on the quarterly numbers as appropriate in my following comments.
You will note that 3 of the 4 LOBs have actually shown relatively stable adjusted operating profit performance over the first half of 2016, resulting in an improved margin profile in the first 6 months versus the year ago period for our LOB segments. Our Petroleum & Chemicals operating profit margin, up 60 basis points to 3.5%, has shown resiliency in their year-to-date performance and actually held operating profit levels relatively flat in a tough environment. In fact, Petroleum & Chemicals adjusted profit levels increased in Q2 2016 versus the year ago period as our aggressive restructuring efforts resulted in cost reductions, which allowed for us to offset the drop in revenues year-over-year.
Industrial profit is down versus the year ago period, driven by the challenge in mining and minerals end market and the margin benefits last year that were associated with large mining project closeout benefits. The business was also impacted negatively during Q2 this year by a litigation settlement and a customer bankruptcy. Going forward, the elimination of these items and the growing momentum in our life sciences unit bodes well for improving profitability in the second half of 2016.
Regarding Aerospace & Technology, revenue declines and lower margin business has impacted the top line versus the 6-month year-to-date figures of 2015. However, this business still delivered flat adjusted operating profit for the fiscal year first half, improving operating margins actually to 7.7%, up 50 basis points versus the year ago period. The LOB also realized operating profit growth during the second quarter versus the year ago period.
Lastly, B&I revenue, while decreasing over the 6 months, we are optimistic about its ability to grow and deliver profitable growth going forward. Substantial benefits associated with our restructuring effort drove the LOB's improvement in adjusted operating profit over the first half of the year. This resulted in operating margin rising to 7.3% or 70 basis points up versus the year ago period.
As we look ahead, we like the makeup of the LOB diversity as long-term market dynamics in our Buildings & Infrastructure, Aerospace & Technology and Industrial, specifically life sciences businesses, position the company well for growth. And with Petroleum & Chemicals, we believe this line of business provides long-term opportunities to profitably grow when oil and gas market dynamics ultimately improve.
Finally, a few comments about our corporate-related costs. These non-allocated corporate costs consist of cost elements that some are inherently predictable, such as routine G&A expenses related to the corporation as a whole, acquisition-related expenses, primarily amortization of intangible assets, and other routine costs and expenses. But also includes other items that are inherently less predictable, including adjustments to employees' fringe benefit programs around medical, pensions and other employee benefits, certain litigation costs, including defense and settlement expenditures, and margin adjustments on projects not related to LOB performance. These non-allocated corporate costs rose by approximately $19 million over the first half of 2016 versus the year ago period. Increased legal defense costs, fringe-rate true ups and expenses related to our strategy work represent a majority and the bulk of the increase in costs. We believe that especially as it relates to the more predictable elements of this line item that we now present in our segment reporting, we will be able to reduce these non-allocated corporate costs longer term.
So before turning to make some additional comments on our restructuring, a few words about our segment reporting efforts. I really would like to call out the extraordinary efforts of the finance and accounting team here at Jacobs. I am thrilled that they were more than up to the formidable challenge to meet the aggressive time table we set when we put in place -- once we'd put in place the decision to transition to an LOB management structure. I know that the board, and certainly myself, would like to personally thank them.
So I'd like to turn now to Slide 15, where I would like to provide an update on the restructuring effort that was announced in July of last year. As we have discussed in past quarters, the primary focus of our restructuring efforts has been to simplify Jacobs globally and to ensure we have a lean cost-effective structure. We have been very successful with our restructuring efforts, and these are already benefiting our financials as evidenced by the significant reduction in G&A over the last 12 months. These actions support the company's ability to deliver satisfactory profit levels regardless of the economic environment in which we are operating, and we look forward to continued benefits in the second half of this fiscal year and the full year impact in next fiscal year 2017.
Our restructuring efforts are now nearing completion. Our primary focus continues to be on reducing our fixed cost infrastructure, primarily in labor and real estate. Given the incremental opportunities identified as part of the reorganization that we announced late last year, calendar year, we are now forecasting the total one-time cost of our restructuring effort to be $330 million to $350 million through the end of Q3 approximately, with final expected gross savings of $240 million to $270 million. Importantly, the cash portion of both our costs and savings result in a cash payback of less than 1 year relative to this effort.
Steve will discuss -- excuse me. Steve will discuss further in his closing comments coming up, but our cost reduction efforts to become more cost-effective are not over as we close the books on this specific restructuring effort. Our initiatives to date have targeted reducing costs to match the realities of current market conditions, while on the next phase, we will seek further cost synergies that are aligned with our strategic agenda and our ability to support a strategic growth agenda that is profitable.
Finally, turning to Slide 16, a few comments on our share buyback status. We continue to execute per our previous guidance, resulting in $30 million of repurchases in Q2 and increasing our year-to-date figure through the first 6 months of 2016 to $72 million, representing approximately 1.8 million shares being repurchased. The previous guidance remains in place at this point in time that we will spend in a relatively consistent manner over the 3-year term of the program. Again, we continue to work through our strategic review, and our plan is to provide an update in our use of cash and capital structure in our Investor Day later this year.
With that, let me hand it back over to Steve."

Turning to Slide 18. And as we discussed during the last several earnings calls, strengthening our project delivery performance is a top Jacobs priority. Our specific goals, including providing our clients increased value with industry best quality and execution while our shareholders benefit from increased Jacobs project profitability. To achieve this, we're driving several initiatives, including upgrading project tools, streamlining our procedures and strengthening our global strategic sourcing. We're also defining top quartile benchmarks, driving innovation and engaging all leaders to achieve best practices.
We're beginning to see measurable improvement. Our project write-downs have been reduced by 21% versus last year, and our low-cost high-value India execution center work has increased significantly. We're also receiving positive feedback from our customers. Our client-approved Value Plus project savings currently stand at $4.7 billion through the first 6 months, and client satisfaction is running at greater than 92%. This is a long-term transformation, and much of the improvement is ahead. Many initiatives are underway, and we expect full rollout in fiscal year 2017. I'm excited for our employees when it comes to project delivery excellence. We're committing resources and investment that will unleash our people to excel a high level that they desire to be proud about the work we deliver for our clients.
Moving to Slide 19. As previously discussed, we believe that developing and executing a profitable global strategy is necessary for Jacobs to deliver mid- and long-term industry-leading shareholder value. Demonstrating our commitment to this, Alan Dick, who has led large global functions and businesses, utilizing strategic planning to achieve success, has joined Jacobs to lead our global strategy efforts.
Late last year, we commenced our strategic review. The first phase of this involved a deep dive on where we make money, by office, by customer, by our different project delivery models and many other analytical slices. Our business leaders are now combining this data with a strategic lens to further optimize our global office footprint, with the goal of better serving our clients and extracting further cost synergies. When we roll out our strategy later this year, we will provide an update on the new and additional 2017 cost savings. To be clear, as we now approach the successful completion of the restructuring initiative, which was tied to rightsizing Jacobs to the challenged market conditions, the next phase of strategic cost optimization will be more aligned with our strategic growth agenda.
We're now moving into assessing current end markets and geographies along with potential new growth opportunities. Additionally, we'll evaluate those industries and businesses that do not earn an adequate return and make decisions on how to manage these to create shareholder value. Our goal is to have an overarching Jacobs strategy that provides the blueprint focused on profitable growth and additional cost efficiency opportunities, which leads to an improved return profile for the Jacobs portfolio longer term. Our strategy blueprint will also provide clarity on other key elements such as capital deployment and risk profile. We're targeting to review this with our board in July, and soon after, we'll provide a strategic review to the investment community.
So the last slide, while our second quarter and first half generally met our expectations, we continue to be pressured by a challenging global environment. The economic dynamics of commodity prices such as oil and mining will continue to impact our business, although our portfolio diversity remains a strength. Our cost savings initiatives should benefit the company as they continue to ramp up and our market strategies play out in certain businesses. We expect both of these initiatives will yield additional improvements as we move through the second half of fiscal year 2016. Our first half performance gave us increased confidence that we'll meet our objectives for the year. Consequently, we're narrowing our fiscal year 2016 EPS guidance to $2.90 to $3.20.
With that, I'd like to thank you for listening and will now open it up for questions. Austin?"

Kevin, is there any way that you can help me understand the savings that is implied for the full year guidance now and in the back half of the year versus your expectations before? Because you keep increasing your costs and your savings -- the restructuring, and I guess, it sounds like there's more to go after that. I guess I'm just trying to understand for 2016, how much of your earnings are being helped by the savings and sort of how much in terms of a deterioration of your organic business -- how much is that when I think about your 2016 guidance, if that makes any sense? And then I guess my other question, just sort of more strategically, Steve, it was helpful to provide the margins by line of business. The profitability associated with some of your business is very interesting. And I guess, based on some of the hires that you've also just announced, is it fair to say, when you actually provide your color on your long-term strategy, that there could be something more transformational here with Jacobs? Could we see -- is there a bigger opportunity for divestitures of some of your businesses? Or do you feel like a lot can be accomplished through internal self-help?

And so, there's a lot going on. We'll obviously look first and foremost of how do we organically go after that and inorganic could also -- M&A could also play into that. And I did comment, we are going to look at underperforming markets and sectors equally as strong, and that could lead to some decisions, potential divestitures as well. But it's premature to talk about what that will look like. Is it going to be several different small to midsized initiatives that add up to something big? Or is it going to involve some transformational steps? I would say everything is on the table, and we'll have a lot more to talk about later this year."

Look, the dynamic of the restructuring, certainly, there was phase 1 that we did before we initiated our realignment into the LOB structure, right? And so as the LOB structure came into play, and as you recall, this was announced in our first quarter, I believe, and officially and formally in the first quarter of this year, and the teams have been forming and ultimately coming up with an idea what the new structure looks like to help support their growth agendas. And so that has been a big driver to incremental benefits associated with the restructuring as you now see it. Specifically, as it relates to what's in the forecast for 2016, the reality is if you look at where we are right now in terms of our total cost to date, I think we're somewhere in the neighborhood of in the middle $250 million figure -- numbers roughly. And so given that we still got close to $100 million to go, that means that as we're executing now, the benefits of that really won't happen, in a material way, on a full annualized basis until we enter into fiscal year 2017. So certainly, some of it is occurring this year. It certainly is helping as it relates to our ability to perform against our original expectations. And I would say that our guidance that Steve has provided is prudent as it relates to the current economic uncertainties that we're facing."

North America, specifically, is clearly sort of our best-performing pipeline, if you will. And globally, when we comment about those FEED, numerous FEED wins, first of all, they're up significantly from last year, the number of wins on the FEED side, which are really the smaller portion of potential larger opportunities because where we've seen in the past is once we get into the FEED, win, there's a higher probability that we're going to be able to convert that to more work, whether it's a full EPC or EPCM opportunity, it provides a significant pipeline to grow with those existing clients. So we're optimistic about that. We're also -- we have shifted very specifically beyond focusing on a set of core clients to spreading our wings and going after more of the pie and more of the market. And that's going very well, and we've announced some recent large framework agreements with some multinational customers that historically we haven't been as strong in. And so I'd say, we're extending our reach. And then also, there's several factors around the cracker world as far as our participation in some of the peripheral work around some of these large projects, but also more importantly, derivatives. So there's a lot of derivative opportunities that people are doing now that a lot of the front-end capacity's put into the market, and that's an area where we're extremely strong. And so those are examples of different opportunities that are making us more bullish about chemicals versus some of the other petroleum, and oil and gas markets."

I will say one of the focal points for Jacobs, as we continue to look at how to strategically adjust to address the market opportunities, is we're looking more today than maybe we have in the past around selective larger projects where we're capable of strong project delivery capability.

And as I outlined in the call, in terms of our prepared remarks, we do expect, especially, since we will eliminate some of the onetime items that we saw in the Industrial business in Q2 of 2016, by default, we expect the momentum in our life sciences businesses to start to pick up going forward in that particular business. So I do think we're going to be seeing a much more favorable picture going forward."

And so we continue to see opportunity at Jacobs to drive improvement, efficiency across the company in a meaningful way in many different areas of our spend. The restructuring was clearly heavily focused on adjusting our headcount to the marketplace with some office initiatives. I think as we're now moving into the more strategic phase of our cost optimization, we're broadening that -- all of our spend across Jacobs, and our initial assessment in the strategy work shows some significant opportunity over the next several years. So the reason why we're talking about that and doing that is we're not satisfied with the margins in this business, and we believe that there should be margin growth in all terms. So I would just say that our strategy expectation is for margin improvement over the next several years, and that's what we're going to go after with both the efficiency and mix of business that we're going after. And I'll just end that by seeing, what you should expect then is when some of the commodity businesses cycle back up, with all this work we're doing on cost improvement, we should see eventually stronger margins in those businesses as well."

Okay. As you know, turning to Slide 2, our earnings announcement and Form 10-Q were released this morning, and we'll be posting a copy of this slide presentation to our website, which we will reference in our prepared remarks.
Before starting, I would like to refer you to our forward-looking statements. Any statements that we make today that are not based on historical fact are forward-looking statements. Although such statements are based on our current estimates and expectations and currently available competitive, financial and economic data, forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements as actual results may differ materially. 
There are a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that cause Jacobs' actual results to differ materially from what may be contained, projected or implied by our forward-looking statements. For a description of some of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that may occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, see our most recent earnings release and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as well as our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended October 2, 2015, including Item 1, business; Item 1A, risk factors; Item 3, Legal Proceedings; and Item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as well as other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
So please now turn to Slide 3 for a quick review of the agenda for today's call. Steve will begin with some comments on our BeyondZero safety culture here at Jacobs followed by a summary of our second quarter financial results. He will include summary comments on the portfolio of our 4 lines of business, or LOBs, and also provide some commentary on end market conditions for each. I will then provide a more in-depth discussion on our financial metrics, backlog and financials for our new lines of business, segment reporting. I will continue with some comments on our current restructuring efforts and capital allocation. Steve will then discuss some next steps for the company, focusing on our project delivery initiatives, strategic review and some closing comments. We will then open it up for some questions.
With that, I'll pass it now over to Steve Demetriou, our President and CEO."

At all Jacobs offices and customer job sites, the",2436,"Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to our Fiscal Year 2016 Second Quarter Earnings Call.
I'm on Slide 4, and before we dive into the results, I'd like to discuss our industry-leading BeyondZero safety culture. At all Jacobs offices and customer job sites, there's an unquestionable commitment to a safety-first behavior. And our culture of caring is not just what we do, but it's who we are. Through our relentless drive to improve safety performance, we have seen a number of incidents trend down over the last several years. In the first 6 months of this fiscal year, our overall injury rate, as measured by industry standard TRIR, total recordable incident rate, was at 0.24, considered top quartile performance and highly valued by our customers. This week, Jacobs is involved in the industry-wide global Safety Week, during which our employees are engaged with customers and local communities on improving safety awareness, focusing on 5 topics: safe driving, energy risks, positive mental health, travel security and safety innovation.
We recently appointed Catriona Schmolke, a Jacobs veteran of 28 years, as our new Head of Global Safety, and I have no doubt she'll continue to strengthen Jacobs' position as an industry safety leader. And importantly for shareholders, we recognize that companies that have sustainable best-in-class safety performance typically achieve superior operating and financial results. So at Jacobs, we believe safety is also a leading indicator and a key management metric which supports business performance and accountability.
Moving to Slide 5. I'll summarize our second quarter business performance. We continue to experience very challenging global economic conditions, particularly in petroleum and mining sectors. However, demonstrating the strength of our diverse portfolio, a more positive market, such as Aerospace & Technology, pharmabio and Buildings & Infrastructure, helped us mitigate these more challenged sectors.
Our revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion and our backlog ended at $18.2 billion, holding stable versus the previous quarter. A relentless focus on rightsizing our cost structure and driving efficiencies continued to benefit Jacobs. Through the first 6 months of this fiscal year, we have delivered $70 million of adjusted G&A cost savings to the bottom line, a 10% cost reduction versus last year. Our strong focus on upgrading and standardized project delivery tools, process and some capabilities is showing early signs of success. In the second quarter, improved project performance was a key contributor to a sequential increase in our total professional services gross margin.\
Our bottom line results were solid, with adjusted earnings for the second quarter at $0.75 per share. And I'm also pleased with the cash flow performance which helped us end the quarter with a strengthened balance sheet, and we look forward to further improvements as our heightened focus on working capital takes hold in the second half.
I'm now on Slide 6. And as we announced at the beginning of last quarter, we're now managing the company by 4 global lines of businesses. These are Petroleum & Chemicals, which is comprised of upstream refining and petrochemicals; Buildings & Infrastructure; Aerospace & Technology, which covers our national public government business, primarily supporting U.S. and U.K. government agencies in the areas of defense, space, nuclear and technology; and Industrial, which is comprised of mining and minerals, food, beverage and consumer goods, specialty chemicals, life sciences and field services.
The charts on this slide show the breakdowns of revenues and adjusted segment operating profit by each line of business, excluding non-allocated corporate expenses. Kevin will cover more financial details on the LOB shortly, but here, we provide insight into the differing economics of each business, which provides a greater sense of profitability versus the top line. We believe a new financial disclosure will provide valuable insight on the diversity of our portfolio. For example, it's important to note that over 70% of our LOB profits year-to-date were driven by businesses that are not directly impacted by the hard-hit oil and mining industries.
The stability of our Aerospace & Technology, Buildings & Infrastructure and certain Industrial businesses form a strong foundation to drive profitable growth. And even within the petroleum and chemicals line of business, end market diversity has helped Jacobs remain resilient in a challenging macroeconomic and provides long-term opportunities to achieve profitable growth with oil and gas -- when oil and gas market dynamics improve.
I'll cover our Petroleum & Chemicals group on Slide 7. Crude oil prices fell below $30 per barrel earlier in the quarter and have rebounded to over $40 most recently. However, much of this increase does not appear to be based on supply/demand dynamics. Price volatility is expected to continue, and there's significant uncertainty in which direction oil prices will move. The most pressured segment is clearly the upstream side of our business, where it's all about cash preservation. For many of our upstream clients, it's a wait-and-see spending strategy, and any capital being spent is primarily going to projects that drive cost out, ensure regulatory compliance and outsourcing plant maintenance programs, all areas of strength for Jacobs. Although our global Petroleum & Chemicals backlog is down from last year mainly due to the heavily hit upstream sector, especially in the Canadian oil sands, this line of business started to stabilize over the last several months. We are pleased that the second quarter held flat versus first quarter, demonstrating the success our team has had in focusing on markets where capital is being spent. This includes the midstream side of the industry, where we're winning business in pipelines, terminals and storage as our clients strive for more distribution flexibility and access to cheaper feedstock.
The refining sector remains profitable, although margins have narrowed in recent months. We're seeing continued opportunities in global refining, with a focus on maintenance, turnaround activity of sustaining capital projects as well as compliance-mandated initiatives. One example of a recent success is a confidential client win for a significant 5-year sustaining services contract. We're also involved in the early stages of a few large scale refinery expansions and grassroot capacity projects across the globe, and we're seeing increased opportunities in process safety, an area where we can offer clients industry-leading capability.
Recent momentum in the petrochemical sector is also helping us to mitigate headwinds. Our strategy to geographically expand in chemicals is paying dividends as we're winning new framework agreements with several of the key global players. Many of our clients are adapting their facilities to capitalize on lower-cost gas feedstock, creating several opportunities for us to win plant revamp projects. Two recent examples of strategic client wins include a major engineering and procurement contract to support Monsanto's planned expansion in Louisiana and also our cracker revamp project in Europe. We have also won a significant number of front-end engineering design projects in the first 6 months of this fiscal year, up versus 2015, providing Jacobs a great opportunity to convert these to larger-scope projects in the near future. So across our global footprint, our petrochemical project pipeline is getting stronger.
Moving to Slide 8. As announced in February, Bob Pragada rejoined Jacobs as President of Global Industrial. Consistent with his new responsibilities, we have added the field services business unit to the Industrial line of business, which is reflected in the backlog reporting showing here for all periods.
Our mining clients are facing one of the most challenging commodity recessions of our generation, and similar to the oil and gas situation, it's all about preserving capital, reducing spending and deferring projects for as long as possible. We believe we've hit the bottom in mining and have stabilized the business, especially in Asia and the Americas, with a successful focus on sustaining capital programs. We're also well-positioned for a few larger capital projects that may get sanctioned in the mining industry and hope to announce a significant strategic win in the near term. Although our global mining backlog plummeted from 2015, our total Industrial backlog is up approximately $1 billion from last year due to our strong growth in life sciences and held flat through the first 6 months of the current fiscal year.
Our life sciences segment continues to benefit from a strong wave of new product approvals. For example, the number of new molecular entities that were approved last year were the most since 1996, and we see the strength continuing. As a result, the biopharmaceutical majors are heavily investing in new capacity. We had success, winning many of the first wave of next-generation projects, including the large-cap programs for Biogen, VMS and Novo Nordisk. The second wave is now in its initial stage, with planned investments by many of the leading global biopharmaceutical players, and we expect to continue to win a large share of these opportunities due to our industry-leading technical expertise and strong project delivery track record.
In our specialty chemicals and manufacturing sector, we're experiencing modest growth in the phosphate fertilizer market, which is driven by continued population increases and agricultural demand. Our team is doing an excellent job in following our customers to emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia and Indonesia and expanding from our traditional technology licensing model to full design/supply contract.
In our field services business unit, we've had a number of growth opportunities in construction and maintenance as our clients continue to focus on near-term capital project optimization and longer-term sustaining CapEx gains. Our diversity in services uniquely positions us to be a critical partner to drive best-in-class results for our clients.
Moving to Slide 9. Our Buildings & Infrastructure group saw a slight uptick in backlog to just over $4.8 billion. This global line of business covers a number of sectors. Beginning with Buildings, we continue to maintain our strong global brand, particularly in the federal space. We were recently awarded major contracts with the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, General Service Administration and the National Guard. 
The health care industry continues to grow due to an aging population and new medical technology, and we're well-positioned as evidenced by recent hospital project wins in San Francisco, Sydney -- and Sydney -- Cincinnati and Sydney. The corporate commercial building market is expanding for us. We recently won a major EPCM contract for 2 manufacturing centers in the defense industry. We've also been awarded several national building contracts including Vanguard, Sanofi, Amgen and SAP. Very exciting is also an opportunity to provide planning design and program management for a major education city in Australia. This represents a wave of future connected, resilient, sustainable, smart cities of the future. 
In mission-critical, cloud computing, the Internet of Things and a switch to software and apps is driving an expansion of data centers globally. We were impacted in the last few quarters by a temporary spending decline by our largest client due to a strategic schedule change. However, we expect to resume growth there soon.
Infrastructure markets are also growing steadily. In the highway sector, our largest infrastructure market globally, we see continued opportunity to grow. The passage of the U.S. highways bill is providing increased spending confidence and represents growth in high mobility areas such as the West Coast, Texas Southeast and Virginia Mid-Atlantic. We are working on the largest integrated transport and revitalization project in Australia, and we were recently awarded a highway upgrade project in Adelaide. And in the U.K. where we're a top provider in planning and design, we were recently awarded 3 significant contracts for Highway (sic) [Highways] England.
The global rail market is also steadily growing as exemplified by the Los Angeles metropolitan area positioning for a new $130 billion transportation revenue package. Recent major awards include a metro rail project in the Middle East, construction management for a large metro rail project in Seattle and a multi-year CM contract for BART in San Francisco.
Finally, we see increased investment in global aviation, where we're a leading planning asset management company in a top design firm. We recently were awarded an airport design in New York and were selected to assist the American/U.S. Airways rebranding through 80 airports across the U.S.
Our Aerospace & Technology line of business is summarized on Slide 10. We're pleased with the underlying backlog trends in this business. Although year-over-year backlog declined, lower margin revenue burn has been replaced by new higher value strategic sales, which is reflected in the strong second quarter operating profit performance. Also, as we previously reported, the backlog excludes approximately $250 million of ""recently awarded but protested"" contracts, which, by the way, is 3x the protest level of last year. We're confident, however, that most of this delayed backlog will be confirmed in the near future.
Another positive trend is that Jacobs has won all our major contract rebids through the first half of this fiscal year, which contrasts with a 2015 industry benchmark of only a 25% incumbent win rate. Our recently announced U.S. Army Aberdeen Test Center and NASA Ames Research aerospace testing and facilities contracts are significant examples of this rebid success.
Our U.S. government work, particularly with Homeland Security and intelligence-related markets, remains strong. Significant commercial investment in mission-critical and advanced investment design facilities continues, and our pipeline of opportunities in this area is increasing. As announced last month, we acquired the Van Dyke Technology Group, a 180-person firm, which enhances our capabilities in the fast-growing cyber-security and intelligence-related market. We expect to significantly leverage the acquired capabilities globally across Jacobs' public and private sector clients.
The U.S. environmental market sector represents excellent growth potential for Jacobs. Most notably, we recently finalized a framework agreement with BP, a core client of Jacobs, for environmental remediation. In addition, we've leveraged our strong environmental experience to win a significant construction service contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority. In the U.K. the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority funding is projected to be around $20 billion over the next 5 years. A large portion of the spend will be at Sellafield and prioritized around high-hazard risk mitigation, where we are positioned well as an incumbent. The final sanctioning of the Hinkley Point C nuclear newbuild project, which represents a long-term upside for Jacobs, has been delayed but is expected in the relatively near future.
In defense, we reached an agreement with the U.K. Ministry of Defence to extend the financially significant maintenance and operations contract for the Atomic Weapons Establishment, known as AWE, with a contract term through 2025. Also promising for us is the U.K.'s decision to invest in naval shipyards, the F-35 fighter jet and other platforms, providing an improved opportunity pipeline for Jacobs.
I'll now pass to Kevin to present more details on our financial results."
282159,331122163,974781,"Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Jacobs Solutions Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve.And I'm now turning to Slide 12.As we've previously communicated in our last earnings call, we were expecting some continued short-term challenges on revenue, and as expected, revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, which is down just",1708,"Thanks, Steve.
And I'm now turning to Slide 12.
As we've previously communicated in our last earnings call, we were expecting some continued short-term challenges on revenue, and as expected, revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, which is down just over 4% from a year ago. Our backlog stands at $18.2 billion, as Steve already highlighted, flat versus Q1 in a relatively challenging environment. We actually feel good about that stability. In addition, our book-to-bill on a trailing 12 basis was 0.94, slightly up from the last quarter. Gross margin dollars for the quarter were $444 million, resulting in an improved gross margin profile versus Q1, up 50 basis points to 16%. Importantly, this improvement was driven by our professional services gross margins, which was at the highest level since 2014, an indication of our improving execution. This has allowed the company to more than offset some of the pricing pressures that exist in certain of our more challenged end markets. Benefits associated with our restructuring continue to gain momentum, resulting in our adjusted G&A being down $22 million versus the year ago quarter.
As Steve talked to, on a year-to-date basis, our adjusted G&A costs have now fallen over 10% versus the year ago period, a clear indication of solid execution against our restructuring program. As a result, adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $122 million, down modestly from our Q1 level. Adjusted EPS was $0.75 for the quarter. This includes a net positive impact of $0.03 from several items, including the successful resolution of an international tax litigation, a one-time benefit to noncontrolling interest related to certain work performed with one of our partially owned subsidiaries, the costs associated with the litigation settlement and the negative impact of a customer bankruptcy.
Finally, operating working capital improved during the quarter, resulting in our net debt position at Q1 of $181 million, turning to actually a positive net cash position of $27 million in Q2, the first net cash positive position that Jacobs has seen since the fourth quarter of 2013. This was driven by an improved free cash flow of over $200 million during the quarter, and importantly, the improvement in our net cash position is after having spent an additional $30 million in share repurchases during the second quarter.
Moving on to Slide 13. I would like to provide some brief commentary on our total backlog. Our backlog currently stands at the combined $18.2 billion recently noted, which is flat from the Q1 figures. We are pleased with this performance as our stability in backlog versus the last quarter was seen across the portfolio, including the Petroleum & Chemicals business. With regard to our professional and field services backlog mix for the quarter -- through the quarter, professional services now stands at $11.4 billion and field service at $6.9 billion, both stable figures versus our Q1 figures. Our backlog at the end of the quarter again exemplifies the benefits of our diversity where certain of our lines of businesses that target customers, and stronger end markets has held steady and helped mitigate some of the pressures from reduced CapEx spending by oil and gas and mining customers.
So turning to Slide 14. I would like to spend a bit of time discussing our new segment reporting. For our SEC guidelines, we have aligned our segment reporting with how we now manage the business. To simplify our discussion, and since this is our first time reporting our segment information, I've noted here on the slide our 6-month results. I believe these 6-month results are indicative of the overall trends in our business, and I will provide some additional color on the quarterly numbers as appropriate in my following comments.
You will note that 3 of the 4 LOBs have actually shown relatively stable adjusted operating profit performance over the first half of 2016, resulting in an improved margin profile in the first 6 months versus the year ago period for our LOB segments. Our Petroleum & Chemicals operating profit margin, up 60 basis points to 3.5%, has shown resiliency in their year-to-date performance and actually held operating profit levels relatively flat in a tough environment. In fact, Petroleum & Chemicals adjusted profit levels increased in Q2 2016 versus the year ago period as our aggressive restructuring efforts resulted in cost reductions, which allowed for us to offset the drop in revenues year-over-year.
Industrial profit is down versus the year ago period, driven by the challenge in mining and minerals end market and the margin benefits last year that were associated with large mining project closeout benefits. The business was also impacted negatively during Q2 this year by a litigation settlement and a customer bankruptcy. Going forward, the elimination of these items and the growing momentum in our life sciences unit bodes well for improving profitability in the second half of 2016.
Regarding Aerospace & Technology, revenue declines and lower margin business has impacted the top line versus the 6-month year-to-date figures of 2015. However, this business still delivered flat adjusted operating profit for the fiscal year first half, improving operating margins actually to 7.7%, up 50 basis points versus the year ago period. The LOB also realized operating profit growth during the second quarter versus the year ago period.
Lastly, B&I revenue, while decreasing over the 6 months, we are optimistic about its ability to grow and deliver profitable growth going forward. Substantial benefits associated with our restructuring effort drove the LOB's improvement in adjusted operating profit over the first half of the year. This resulted in operating margin rising to 7.3% or 70 basis points up versus the year ago period.
As we look ahead, we like the makeup of the LOB diversity as long-term market dynamics in our Buildings & Infrastructure, Aerospace & Technology and Industrial, specifically life sciences businesses, position the company well for growth. And with Petroleum & Chemicals, we believe this line of business provides long-term opportunities to profitably grow when oil and gas market dynamics ultimately improve.
Finally, a few comments about our corporate-related costs. These non-allocated corporate costs consist of cost elements that some are inherently predictable, such as routine G&A expenses related to the corporation as a whole, acquisition-related expenses, primarily amortization of intangible assets, and other routine costs and expenses. But also includes other items that are inherently less predictable, including adjustments to employees' fringe benefit programs around medical, pensions and other employee benefits, certain litigation costs, including defense and settlement expenditures, and margin adjustments on projects not related to LOB performance. These non-allocated corporate costs rose by approximately $19 million over the first half of 2016 versus the year ago period. Increased legal defense costs, fringe-rate true ups and expenses related to our strategy work represent a majority and the bulk of the increase in costs. We believe that especially as it relates to the more predictable elements of this line item that we now present in our segment reporting, we will be able to reduce these non-allocated corporate costs longer term.
So before turning to make some additional comments on our restructuring, a few words about our segment reporting efforts. I really would like to call out the extraordinary efforts of the finance and accounting team here at Jacobs. I am thrilled that they were more than up to the formidable challenge to meet the aggressive time table we set when we put in place -- once we'd put in place the decision to transition to an LOB management structure. I know that the board, and certainly myself, would like to personally thank them.
So I'd like to turn now to Slide 15, where I would like to provide an update on the restructuring effort that was announced in July of last year. As we have discussed in past quarters, the primary focus of our restructuring efforts has been to simplify Jacobs globally and to ensure we have a lean cost-effective structure. We have been very successful with our restructuring efforts, and these are already benefiting our financials as evidenced by the significant reduction in G&A over the last 12 months. These actions support the company's ability to deliver satisfactory profit levels regardless of the economic environment in which we are operating, and we look forward to continued benefits in the second half of this fiscal year and the full year impact in next fiscal year 2017.
Our restructuring efforts are now nearing completion. Our primary focus continues to be on reducing our fixed cost infrastructure, primarily in labor and real estate. Given the incremental opportunities identified as part of the reorganization that we announced late last year, calendar year, we are now forecasting the total one-time cost of our restructuring effort to be $330 million to $350 million through the end of Q3 approximately, with final expected gross savings of $240 million to $270 million. Importantly, the cash portion of both our costs and savings result in a cash payback of less than 1 year relative to this effort.
Steve will discuss -- excuse me. Steve will discuss further in his closing comments coming up, but our cost reduction efforts to become more cost-effective are not over as we close the books on this specific restructuring effort. Our initiatives to date have targeted reducing costs to match the realities of current market conditions, while on the next phase, we will seek further cost synergies that are aligned with our strategic agenda and our ability to support a strategic growth agenda that is profitable.
Finally, turning to Slide 16, a few comments on our share buyback status. We continue to execute per our previous guidance, resulting in $30 million of repurchases in Q2 and increasing our year-to-date figure through the first 6 months of 2016 to $72 million, representing approximately 1.8 million shares being repurchased. The previous guidance remains in place at this point in time that we will spend in a relatively consistent manner over the 3-year term of the program. Again, we continue to work through our strategic review, and our plan is to provide an update in our use of cash and capital structure in our Investor Day later this year.
With that, let me hand it back over to Steve."

Turning to Slide 18. And as we discussed during the last several earnings calls, strengthening our project delivery performance is a top Jacobs priority. Our specific goals, including providing our clients increased value with industry best quality and execution while our shareholders benefit from increased Jacobs project profitability. To achieve this, we're driving several initiatives, including upgrading project tools, streamlining our procedures and strengthening our global strategic sourcing. We're also defining top quartile benchmarks, driving innovation and engaging all leaders to achieve best practices.
We're beginning to see measurable improvement. Our project write-downs have been reduced by 21% versus last year, and our low-cost high-value India execution center work has increased significantly. We're also receiving positive feedback from our customers. Our client-approved Value Plus project savings currently stand at $4.7 billion through the first 6 months, and client satisfaction is running at greater than 92%. This is a long-term transformation, and much of the improvement is ahead. Many initiatives are underway, and we expect full rollout in fiscal year 2017. I'm excited for our employees when it comes to project delivery excellence. We're committing resources and investment that will unleash our people to excel a high level that they desire to be proud about the work we deliver for our clients.
Moving to Slide 19. As previously discussed, we believe that developing and executing a profitable global strategy is necessary for Jacobs to deliver mid- and long-term industry-leading shareholder value. Demonstrating our commitment to this, Alan Dick, who has led large global functions and businesses, utilizing strategic planning to achieve success, has joined Jacobs to lead our global strategy efforts.
Late last year, we commenced our strategic review. The first phase of this involved a deep dive on where we make money, by office, by customer, by our different project delivery models and many other analytical slices. Our business leaders are now combining this data with a strategic lens to further optimize our global office footprint, with the goal of better serving our clients and extracting further cost synergies. When we roll out our strategy later this year, we will provide an update on the new and additional 2017 cost savings. To be clear, as we now approach the successful completion of the restructuring initiative, which was tied to rightsizing Jacobs to the challenged market conditions, the next phase of strategic cost optimization will be more aligned with our strategic growth agenda.
We're now moving into assessing current end markets and geographies along with potential new growth opportunities. Additionally, we'll evaluate those industries and businesses that do not earn an adequate return and make decisions on how to manage these to create shareholder value. Our goal is to have an overarching Jacobs strategy that provides the blueprint focused on profitable growth and additional cost efficiency opportunities, which leads to an improved return profile for the Jacobs portfolio longer term. Our strategy blueprint will also provide clarity on other key elements such as capital deployment and risk profile. We're targeting to review this with our board in July, and soon after, we'll provide a strategic review to the investment community.
So the last slide, while our second quarter and first half generally met our expectations, we continue to be pressured by a challenging global environment. The economic dynamics of commodity prices such as oil and mining will continue to impact our business, although our portfolio diversity remains a strength. Our cost savings initiatives should benefit the company as they continue to ramp up and our market strategies play out in certain businesses. We expect both of these initiatives will yield additional improvements as we move through the second half of fiscal year 2016. Our first half performance gave us increased confidence that we'll meet our objectives for the year. Consequently, we're narrowing our fiscal year 2016 EPS guidance to $2.90 to $3.20.
With that, I'd like to thank you for listening and will now open it up for questions. Austin?"

Kevin, is there any way that you can help me understand the savings that is implied for the full year guidance now and in the back half of the year versus your expectations before? Because you keep increasing your costs and your savings -- the restructuring, and I guess, it sounds like there's more to go after that. I guess I'm just trying to understand for 2016, how much of your earnings are being helped by the savings and sort of how much in terms of a deterioration of your organic business -- how much is that when I think about your 2016 guidance, if that makes any sense? And then I guess my other question, just sort of more strategically, Steve, it was helpful to provide the margins by line of business. The profitability associated with some of your business is very interesting. And I guess, based on some of the hires that you've also just announced, is it fair to say, when you actually provide your color on your long-term strategy, that there could be something more transformational here with Jacobs? Could we see -- is there a bigger opportunity for divestitures of some of your businesses? Or do you feel like a lot can be accomplished through internal self-help?

And so, there's a lot going on. We'll obviously look first and foremost of how do we organically go after that and inorganic could also -- M&A could also play into that. And I did comment, we are going to look at underperforming markets and sectors equally as strong, and that could lead to some decisions, potential divestitures as well. But it's premature to talk about what that will look like. Is it going to be several different small to midsized initiatives that add up to something big? Or is it going to involve some transformational steps? I would say everything is on the table, and we'll have a lot more to talk about later this year."

Look, the dynamic of the restructuring, certainly, there was phase 1 that we did before we initiated our realignment into the LOB structure, right? And so as the LOB structure came into play, and as you recall, this was announced in our first quarter, I believe, and officially and formally in the first quarter of this year, and the teams have been forming and ultimately coming up with an idea what the new structure looks like to help support their growth agendas. And so that has been a big driver to incremental benefits associated with the restructuring as you now see it. Specifically, as it relates to what's in the forecast for 2016, the reality is if you look at where we are right now in terms of our total cost to date, I think we're somewhere in the neighborhood of in the middle $250 million figure -- numbers roughly. And so given that we still got close to $100 million to go, that means that as we're executing now, the benefits of that really won't happen, in a material way, on a full annualized basis until we enter into fiscal year 2017. So certainly, some of it is occurring this year. It certainly is helping as it relates to our ability to perform against our original expectations. And I would say that our guidance that Steve has provided is prudent as it relates to the current economic uncertainties that we're facing."

North America, specifically, is clearly sort of our best-performing pipeline, if you will. And globally, when we comment about those FEED, numerous FEED wins, first of all, they're up significantly from last year, the number of wins on the FEED side, which are really the smaller portion of potential larger opportunities because where we've seen in the past is once we get into the FEED, win, there's a higher probability that we're going to be able to convert that to more work, whether it's a full EPC or EPCM opportunity, it provides a significant pipeline to grow with those existing clients. So we're optimistic about that. We're also -- we have shifted very specifically beyond focusing on a set of core clients to spreading our wings and going after more of the pie and more of the market. And that's going very well, and we've announced some recent large framework agreements with some multinational customers that historically we haven't been as strong in. And so I'd say, we're extending our reach. And then also, there's several factors around the cracker world as far as our participation in some of the peripheral work around some of these large projects, but also more importantly, derivatives. So there's a lot of derivative opportunities that people are doing now that a lot of the front-end capacity's put into the market, and that's an area where we're extremely strong. And so those are examples of different opportunities that are making us more bullish about chemicals versus some of the other petroleum, and oil and gas markets."

I will say one of the focal points for Jacobs, as we continue to look at how to strategically adjust to address the market opportunities, is we're looking more today than maybe we have in the past around selective larger projects where we're capable of strong project delivery capability.

And so we continue to see opportunity at Jacobs to drive improvement, efficiency across the company in a meaningful way in many different areas of our spend. The restructuring was clearly heavily focused on adjusting our headcount to the marketplace with some office initiatives. I think as we're now moving into the more strategic phase of our cost optimization, we're broadening that -- all of our spend across Jacobs, and our initial assessment in the strategy work shows some significant opportunity over the next several years. So the reason why we're talking about that and doing that is we're not satisfied with the margins in this business, and we believe that there should be margin growth in all terms. So I would just say that our strategy expectation is for margin improvement over the next several years, and that's what we're going to go after with both the efficiency and mix of business that we're going after. And I'll just end that by seeing, what you should expect then is when some of the commodity businesses cycle back up, with all this work we're doing on cost improvement, we should see eventually stronger margins in those businesses as well."

Okay. As you know, turning to Slide 2, our earnings announcement and Form 10-Q were released this morning, and we'll be posting a copy of this slide presentation to our website, which we will reference in our prepared remarks.
Before starting, I would like to refer you to our forward-looking statements. Any statements that we make today that are not based on historical fact are forward-looking statements. Although such statements are based on our current estimates and expectations and currently available competitive, financial and economic data, forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements as actual results may differ materially. 
There are a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that cause Jacobs' actual results to differ materially from what may be contained, projected or implied by our forward-looking statements. For a description of some of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that may occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, see our most recent earnings release and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as well as our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended October 2, 2015, including Item 1, business; Item 1A, risk factors; Item 3, Legal Proceedings; and Item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as well as other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
So please now turn to Slide 3 for a quick review of the agenda for today's call. Steve will begin with some comments on our BeyondZero safety culture here at Jacobs followed by a summary of our second quarter financial results. He will include summary comments on the portfolio of our 4 lines of business, or LOBs, and also provide some commentary on end market conditions for each. I will then provide a more in-depth discussion on our financial metrics, backlog and financials for our new lines of business, segment reporting. I will continue with some comments on our current restructuring efforts and capital allocation. Steve will then discuss some next steps for the company, focusing on our project delivery initiatives, strategic review and some closing comments. We will then open it up for some questions.
With that, I'll pass it now over to Steve Demetriou, our President and CEO."

At all Jacobs offices and customer job sites, the",2436,"Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to our Fiscal Year 2016 Second Quarter Earnings Call.
I'm on Slide 4, and before we dive into the results, I'd like to discuss our industry-leading BeyondZero safety culture. At all Jacobs offices and customer job sites, there's an unquestionable commitment to a safety-first behavior. And our culture of caring is not just what we do, but it's who we are. Through our relentless drive to improve safety performance, we have seen a number of incidents trend down over the last several years. In the first 6 months of this fiscal year, our overall injury rate, as measured by industry standard TRIR, total recordable incident rate, was at 0.24, considered top quartile performance and highly valued by our customers. This week, Jacobs is involved in the industry-wide global Safety Week, during which our employees are engaged with customers and local communities on improving safety awareness, focusing on 5 topics: safe driving, energy risks, positive mental health, travel security and safety innovation.
We recently appointed Catriona Schmolke, a Jacobs veteran of 28 years, as our new Head of Global Safety, and I have no doubt she'll continue to strengthen Jacobs' position as an industry safety leader. And importantly for shareholders, we recognize that companies that have sustainable best-in-class safety performance typically achieve superior operating and financial results. So at Jacobs, we believe safety is also a leading indicator and a key management metric which supports business performance and accountability.
Moving to Slide 5. I'll summarize our second quarter business performance. We continue to experience very challenging global economic conditions, particularly in petroleum and mining sectors. However, demonstrating the strength of our diverse portfolio, a more positive market, such as Aerospace & Technology, pharmabio and Buildings & Infrastructure, helped us mitigate these more challenged sectors.
Our revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion and our backlog ended at $18.2 billion, holding stable versus the previous quarter. A relentless focus on rightsizing our cost structure and driving efficiencies continued to benefit Jacobs. Through the first 6 months of this fiscal year, we have delivered $70 million of adjusted G&A cost savings to the bottom line, a 10% cost reduction versus last year. Our strong focus on upgrading and standardized project delivery tools, process and some capabilities is showing early signs of success. In the second quarter, improved project performance was a key contributor to a sequential increase in our total professional services gross margin.\
Our bottom line results were solid, with adjusted earnings for the second quarter at $0.75 per share. And I'm also pleased with the cash flow performance which helped us end the quarter with a strengthened balance sheet, and we look forward to further improvements as our heightened focus on working capital takes hold in the second half.
I'm now on Slide 6. And as we announced at the beginning of last quarter, we're now managing the company by 4 global lines of businesses. These are Petroleum & Chemicals, which is comprised of upstream refining and petrochemicals; Buildings & Infrastructure; Aerospace & Technology, which covers our national public government business, primarily supporting U.S. and U.K. government agencies in the areas of defense, space, nuclear and technology; and Industrial, which is comprised of mining and minerals, food, beverage and consumer goods, specialty chemicals, life sciences and field services.
The charts on this slide show the breakdowns of revenues and adjusted segment operating profit by each line of business, excluding non-allocated corporate expenses. Kevin will cover more financial details on the LOB shortly, but here, we provide insight into the differing economics of each business, which provides a greater sense of profitability versus the top line. We believe a new financial disclosure will provide valuable insight on the diversity of our portfolio. For example, it's important to note that over 70% of our LOB profits year-to-date were driven by businesses that are not directly impacted by the hard-hit oil and mining industries.
The stability of our Aerospace & Technology, Buildings & Infrastructure and certain Industrial businesses form a strong foundation to drive profitable growth. And even within the petroleum and chemicals line of business, end market diversity has helped Jacobs remain resilient in a challenging macroeconomic and provides long-term opportunities to achieve profitable growth with oil and gas -- when oil and gas market dynamics improve.
I'll cover our Petroleum & Chemicals group on Slide 7. Crude oil prices fell below $30 per barrel earlier in the quarter and have rebounded to over $40 most recently. However, much of this increase does not appear to be based on supply/demand dynamics. Price volatility is expected to continue, and there's significant uncertainty in which direction oil prices will move. The most pressured segment is clearly the upstream side of our business, where it's all about cash preservation. For many of our upstream clients, it's a wait-and-see spending strategy, and any capital being spent is primarily going to projects that drive cost out, ensure regulatory compliance and outsourcing plant maintenance programs, all areas of strength for Jacobs. Although our global Petroleum & Chemicals backlog is down from last year mainly due to the heavily hit upstream sector, especially in the Canadian oil sands, this line of business started to stabilize over the last several months. We are pleased that the second quarter held flat versus first quarter, demonstrating the success our team has had in focusing on markets where capital is being spent. This includes the midstream side of the industry, where we're winning business in pipelines, terminals and storage as our clients strive for more distribution flexibility and access to cheaper feedstock.
The refining sector remains profitable, although margins have narrowed in recent months. We're seeing continued opportunities in global refining, with a focus on maintenance, turnaround activity of sustaining capital projects as well as compliance-mandated initiatives. One example of a recent success is a confidential client win for a significant 5-year sustaining services contract. We're also involved in the early stages of a few large scale refinery expansions and grassroot capacity projects across the globe, and we're seeing increased opportunities in process safety, an area where we can offer clients industry-leading capability.
Recent momentum in the petrochemical sector is also helping us to mitigate headwinds. Our strategy to geographically expand in chemicals is paying dividends as we're winning new framework agreements with several of the key global players. Many of our clients are adapting their facilities to capitalize on lower-cost gas feedstock, creating several opportunities for us to win plant revamp projects. Two recent examples of strategic client wins include a major engineering and procurement contract to support Monsanto's planned expansion in Louisiana and also our cracker revamp project in Europe. We have also won a significant number of front-end engineering design projects in the first 6 months of this fiscal year, up versus 2015, providing Jacobs a great opportunity to convert these to larger-scope projects in the near future. So across our global footprint, our petrochemical project pipeline is getting stronger.
Moving to Slide 8. As announced in February, Bob Pragada rejoined Jacobs as President of Global Industrial. Consistent with his new responsibilities, we have added the field services business unit to the Industrial line of business, which is reflected in the backlog reporting showing here for all periods.
Our mining clients are facing one of the most challenging commodity recessions of our generation, and similar to the oil and gas situation, it's all about preserving capital, reducing spending and deferring projects for as long as possible. We believe we've hit the bottom in mining and have stabilized the business, especially in Asia and the Americas, with a successful focus on sustaining capital programs. We're also well-positioned for a few larger capital projects that may get sanctioned in the mining industry and hope to announce a significant strategic win in the near term. Although our global mining backlog plummeted from 2015, our total Industrial backlog is up approximately $1 billion from last year due to our strong growth in life sciences and held flat through the first 6 months of the current fiscal year.
Our life sciences segment continues to benefit from a strong wave of new product approvals. For example, the number of new molecular entities that were approved last year were the most since 1996, and we see the strength continuing. As a result, the biopharmaceutical majors are heavily investing in new capacity. We had success, winning many of the first wave of next-generation projects, including the large-cap programs for Biogen, VMS and Novo Nordisk. The second wave is now in its initial stage, with planned investments by many of the leading global biopharmaceutical players, and we expect to continue to win a large share of these opportunities due to our industry-leading technical expertise and strong project delivery track record.
In our specialty chemicals and manufacturing sector, we're experiencing modest growth in the phosphate fertilizer market, which is driven by continued population increases and agricultural demand. Our team is doing an excellent job in following our customers to emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia and Indonesia and expanding from our traditional technology licensing model to full design/supply contract.
In our field services business unit, we've had a number of growth opportunities in construction and maintenance as our clients continue to focus on near-term capital project optimization and longer-term sustaining CapEx gains. Our diversity in services uniquely positions us to be a critical partner to drive best-in-class results for our clients.
Moving to Slide 9. Our Buildings & Infrastructure group saw a slight uptick in backlog to just over $4.8 billion. This global line of business covers a number of sectors. Beginning with Buildings, we continue to maintain our strong global brand, particularly in the federal space. We were recently awarded major contracts with the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, General Service Administration and the National Guard. 
The health care industry continues to grow due to an aging population and new medical technology, and we're well-positioned as evidenced by recent hospital project wins in San Francisco, Sydney -- and Sydney -- Cincinnati and Sydney. The corporate commercial building market is expanding for us. We recently won a major EPCM contract for 2 manufacturing centers in the defense industry. We've also been awarded several national building contracts including Vanguard, Sanofi, Amgen and SAP. Very exciting is also an opportunity to provide planning design and program management for a major education city in Australia. This represents a wave of future connected, resilient, sustainable, smart cities of the future. 
In mission-critical, cloud computing, the Internet of Things and a switch to software and apps is driving an expansion of data centers globally. We were impacted in the last few quarters by a temporary spending decline by our largest client due to a strategic schedule change. However, we expect to resume growth there soon.
Infrastructure markets are also growing steadily. In the highway sector, our largest infrastructure market globally, we see continued opportunity to grow. The passage of the U.S. highways bill is providing increased spending confidence and represents growth in high mobility areas such as the West Coast, Texas Southeast and Virginia Mid-Atlantic. We are working on the largest integrated transport and revitalization project in Australia, and we were recently awarded a highway upgrade project in Adelaide. And in the U.K. where we're a top provider in planning and design, we were recently awarded 3 significant contracts for Highway (sic) [Highways] England.
The global rail market is also steadily growing as exemplified by the Los Angeles metropolitan area positioning for a new $130 billion transportation revenue package. Recent major awards include a metro rail project in the Middle East, construction management for a large metro rail project in Seattle and a multi-year CM contract for BART in San Francisco.
Finally, we see increased investment in global aviation, where we're a leading planning asset management company in a top design firm. We recently were awarded an airport design in New York and were selected to assist the American/U.S. Airways rebranding through 80 airports across the U.S.
Our Aerospace & Technology line of business is summarized on Slide 10. We're pleased with the underlying backlog trends in this business. Although year-over-year backlog declined, lower margin revenue burn has been replaced by new higher value strategic sales, which is reflected in the strong second quarter operating profit performance. Also, as we previously reported, the backlog excludes approximately $250 million of ""recently awarded but protested"" contracts, which, by the way, is 3x the protest level of last year. We're confident, however, that most of this delayed backlog will be confirmed in the near future.
Another positive trend is that Jacobs has won all our major contract rebids through the first half of this fiscal year, which contrasts with a 2015 industry benchmark of only a 25% incumbent win rate. Our recently announced U.S. Army Aberdeen Test Center and NASA Ames Research aerospace testing and facilities contracts are significant examples of this rebid success.
Our U.S. government work, particularly with Homeland Security and intelligence-related markets, remains strong. Significant commercial investment in mission-critical and advanced investment design facilities continues, and our pipeline of opportunities in this area is increasing. As announced last month, we acquired the Van Dyke Technology Group, a 180-person firm, which enhances our capabilities in the fast-growing cyber-security and intelligence-related market. We expect to significantly leverage the acquired capabilities globally across Jacobs' public and private sector clients.
The U.S. environmental market sector represents excellent growth potential for Jacobs. Most notably, we recently finalized a framework agreement with BP, a core client of Jacobs, for environmental remediation. In addition, we've leveraged our strong environmental experience to win a significant construction service contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority. In the U.K. the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority funding is projected to be around $20 billion over the next 5 years. A large portion of the spend will be at Sellafield and prioritized around high-hazard risk mitigation, where we are positioned well as an incumbent. The final sanctioning of the Hinkley Point C nuclear newbuild project, which represents a long-term upside for Jacobs, has been delayed but is expected in the relatively near future.
In defense, we reached an agreement with the U.K. Ministry of Defence to extend the financially significant maintenance and operations contract for the Atomic Weapons Establishment, known as AWE, with a contract term through 2025. Also promising for us is the U.K.'s decision to invest in naval shipyards, the F-35 fighter jet and other platforms, providing an improved opportunity pipeline for Jacobs.
I'll now pass to Kevin to present more details on our financial results."
282159,331122163,975218,"Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Jacobs Solutions Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve.And I'm now turning to Slide 12.As we've previously communicated in our last earnings call, we were expecting some continued short-term challenges on revenue, and as expected, revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, which is down just",1708,"Thanks, Steve.
And I'm now turning to Slide 12.
As we've previously communicated in our last earnings call, we were expecting some continued short-term challenges on revenue, and as expected, revenue for the quarter was $2.8 billion, which is down just over 4% from a year ago. Our backlog stands at $18.2 billion, as Steve already highlighted, flat versus Q1 in a relatively challenging environment. We actually feel good about that stability. In addition, our book-to-bill on a trailing 12 basis was 0.94, slightly up from the last quarter. Gross margin dollars for the quarter were $444 million, resulting in an improved gross margin profile versus Q1, up 50 basis points to 16%. Importantly, this improvement was driven by our professional services gross margins, which was at the highest level since 2014, an indication of our improving execution. This has allowed the company to more than offset some of the pricing pressures that exist in certain of our more challenged end markets. Benefits associated with our restructuring continue to gain momentum, resulting in our adjusted G&A being down $22 million versus the year ago quarter.
As Steve talked to, on a year-to-date basis, our adjusted G&A costs have now fallen over 10% versus the year ago period, a clear indication of solid execution against our restructuring program. As a result, adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $122 million, down modestly from our Q1 level. Adjusted EPS was $0.75 for the quarter. This includes a net positive impact of $0.03 from several items, including the successful resolution of an international tax litigation, a one-time benefit to noncontrolling interest related to certain work performed with one of our partially owned subsidiaries, the costs associated with the litigation settlement and the negative impact of a customer bankruptcy.
Finally, operating working capital improved during the quarter, resulting in our net debt position at Q1 of $181 million, turning to actually a positive net cash position of $27 million in Q2, the first net cash positive position that Jacobs has seen since the fourth quarter of 2013. This was driven by an improved free cash flow of over $200 million during the quarter, and importantly, the improvement in our net cash position is after having spent an additional $30 million in share repurchases during the second quarter.
Moving on to Slide 13. I would like to provide some brief commentary on our total backlog. Our backlog currently stands at the combined $18.2 billion recently noted, which is flat from the Q1 figures. We are pleased with this performance as our stability in backlog versus the last quarter was seen across the portfolio, including the Petroleum & Chemicals business. With regard to our professional and field services backlog mix for the quarter -- through the quarter, professional services now stands at $11.4 billion and field service at $6.9 billion, both stable figures versus our Q1 figures. Our backlog at the end of the quarter again exemplifies the benefits of our diversity where certain of our lines of businesses that target customers, and stronger end markets has held steady and helped mitigate some of the pressures from reduced CapEx spending by oil and gas and mining customers.
So turning to Slide 14. I would like to spend a bit of time discussing our new segment reporting. For our SEC guidelines, we have aligned our segment reporting with how we now manage the business. To simplify our discussion, and since this is our first time reporting our segment information, I've noted here on the slide our 6-month results. I believe these 6-month results are indicative of the overall trends in our business, and I will provide some additional color on the quarterly numbers as appropriate in my following comments.
You will note that 3 of the 4 LOBs have actually shown relatively stable adjusted operating profit performance over the first half of 2016, resulting in an improved margin profile in the first 6 months versus the year ago period for our LOB segments. Our Petroleum & Chemicals operating profit margin, up 60 basis points to 3.5%, has shown resiliency in their year-to-date performance and actually held operating profit levels relatively flat in a tough environment. In fact, Petroleum & Chemicals adjusted profit levels increased in Q2 2016 versus the year ago period as our aggressive restructuring efforts resulted in cost reductions, which allowed for us to offset the drop in revenues year-over-year.
Industrial profit is down versus the year ago period, driven by the challenge in mining and minerals end market and the margin benefits last year that were associated with large mining project closeout benefits. The business was also impacted negatively during Q2 this year by a litigation settlement and a customer bankruptcy. Going forward, the elimination of these items and the growing momentum in our life sciences unit bodes well for improving profitability in the second half of 2016.
Regarding Aerospace & Technology, revenue declines and lower margin business has impacted the top line versus the 6-month year-to-date figures of 2015. However, this business still delivered flat adjusted operating profit for the fiscal year first half, improving operating margins actually to 7.7%, up 50 basis points versus the year ago period. The LOB also realized operating profit growth during the second quarter versus the year ago period.
Lastly, B&I revenue, while decreasing over the 6 months, we are optimistic about its ability to grow and deliver profitable growth going forward. Substantial benefits associated with our restructuring effort drove the LOB's improvement in adjusted operating profit over the first half of the year. This resulted in operating margin rising to 7.3% or 70 basis points up versus the year ago period.
As we look ahead, we like the makeup of the LOB diversity as long-term market dynamics in our Buildings & Infrastructure, Aerospace & Technology and Industrial, specifically life sciences businesses, position the company well for growth. And with Petroleum & Chemicals, we believe this line of business provides long-term opportunities to profitably grow when oil and gas market dynamics ultimately improve.
Finally, a few comments about our corporate-related costs. These non-allocated corporate costs consist of cost elements that some are inherently predictable, such as routine G&A expenses related to the corporation as a whole, acquisition-related expenses, primarily amortization of intangible assets, and other routine costs and expenses. But also includes other items that are inherently less predictable, including adjustments to employees' fringe benefit programs around medical, pensions and other employee benefits, certain litigation costs, including defense and settlement expenditures, and margin adjustments on projects not related to LOB performance. These non-allocated corporate costs rose by approximately $19 million over the first half of 2016 versus the year ago period. Increased legal defense costs, fringe-rate true ups and expenses related to our strategy work represent a majority and the bulk of the increase in costs. We believe that especially as it relates to the more predictable elements of this line item that we now present in our segment reporting, we will be able to reduce these non-allocated corporate costs longer term.
So before turning to make some additional comments on our restructuring, a few words about our segment reporting efforts. I really would like to call out the extraordinary efforts of the finance and accounting team here at Jacobs. I am thrilled that they were more than up to the formidable challenge to meet the aggressive time table we set when we put in place -- once we'd put in place the decision to transition to an LOB management structure. I know that the board, and certainly myself, would like to personally thank them.
So I'd like to turn now to Slide 15, where I would like to provide an update on the restructuring effort that was announced in July of last year. As we have discussed in past quarters, the primary focus of our restructuring efforts has been to simplify Jacobs globally and to ensure we have a lean cost-effective structure. We have been very successful with our restructuring efforts, and these are already benefiting our financials as evidenced by the significant reduction in G&A over the last 12 months. These actions support the company's ability to deliver satisfactory profit levels regardless of the economic environment in which we are operating, and we look forward to continued benefits in the second half of this fiscal year and the full year impact in next fiscal year 2017.
Our restructuring efforts are now nearing completion. Our primary focus continues to be on reducing our fixed cost infrastructure, primarily in labor and real estate. Given the incremental opportunities identified as part of the reorganization that we announced late last year, calendar year, we are now forecasting the total one-time cost of our restructuring effort to be $330 million to $350 million through the end of Q3 approximately, with final expected gross savings of $240 million to $270 million. Importantly, the cash portion of both our costs and savings result in a cash payback of less than 1 year relative to this effort.
Steve will discuss -- excuse me. Steve will discuss further in his closing comments coming up, but our cost reduction efforts to become more cost-effective are not over as we close the books on this specific restructuring effort. Our initiatives to date have targeted reducing costs to match the realities of current market conditions, while on the next phase, we will seek further cost synergies that are aligned with our strategic agenda and our ability to support a strategic growth agenda that is profitable.
Finally, turning to Slide 16, a few comments on our share buyback status. We continue to execute per our previous guidance, resulting in $30 million of repurchases in Q2 and increasing our year-to-date figure through the first 6 months of 2016 to $72 million, representing approximately 1.8 million shares being repurchased. The previous guidance remains in place at this point in time that we will spend in a relatively consistent manner over the 3-year term of the program. Again, we continue to work through our strategic review, and our plan is to provide an update in our use of cash and capital structure in our Investor Day later this year.
With that, let me hand it back over to Steve."

Turning to Slide 18. And as we discussed during the last several earnings calls, strengthening our project delivery performance is a top Jacobs priority. Our specific goals, including providing our clients increased value with industry best quality and execution while our shareholders benefit from increased Jacobs project profitability. To achieve this, we're driving several initiatives, including upgrading project tools, streamlining our procedures and strengthening our global strategic sourcing. We're also defining top quartile benchmarks, driving innovation and engaging all leaders to achieve best practices.
We're beginning to see measurable improvement. Our project write-downs have been reduced by 21% versus last year, and our low-cost high-value India execution center work has increased significantly. We're also receiving positive feedback from our customers. Our client-approved Value Plus project savings currently stand at $4.7 billion through the first 6 months, and client satisfaction is running at greater than 92%. This is a long-term transformation, and much of the improvement is ahead. Many initiatives are underway, and we expect full rollout in fiscal year 2017. I'm excited for our employees when it comes to project delivery excellence. We're committing resources and investment that will unleash our people to excel a high level that they desire to be proud about the work we deliver for our clients.
Moving to Slide 19. As previously discussed, we believe that developing and executing a profitable global strategy is necessary for Jacobs to deliver mid- and long-term industry-leading shareholder value. Demonstrating our commitment to this, Alan Dick, who has led large global functions and businesses, utilizing strategic planning to achieve success, has joined Jacobs to lead our global strategy efforts.
Late last year, we commenced our strategic review. The first phase of this involved a deep dive on where we make money, by office, by customer, by our different project delivery models and many other analytical slices. Our business leaders are now combining this data with a strategic lens to further optimize our global office footprint, with the goal of better serving our clients and extracting further cost synergies. When we roll out our strategy later this year, we will provide an update on the new and additional 2017 cost savings. To be clear, as we now approach the successful completion of the restructuring initiative, which was tied to rightsizing Jacobs to the challenged market conditions, the next phase of strategic cost optimization will be more aligned with our strategic growth agenda.
We're now moving into assessing current end markets and geographies along with potential new growth opportunities. Additionally, we'll evaluate those industries and businesses that do not earn an adequate return and make decisions on how to manage these to create shareholder value. Our goal is to have an overarching Jacobs strategy that provides the blueprint focused on profitable growth and additional cost efficiency opportunities, which leads to an improved return profile for the Jacobs portfolio longer term. Our strategy blueprint will also provide clarity on other key elements such as capital deployment and risk profile. We're targeting to review this with our board in July, and soon after, we'll provide a strategic review to the investment community.
So the last slide, while our second quarter and first half generally met our expectations, we continue to be pressured by a challenging global environment. The economic dynamics of commodity prices such as oil and mining will continue to impact our business, although our portfolio diversity remains a strength. Our cost savings initiatives should benefit the company as they continue to ramp up and our market strategies play out in certain businesses. We expect both of these initiatives will yield additional improvements as we move through the second half of fiscal year 2016. Our first half performance gave us increased confidence that we'll meet our objectives for the year. Consequently, we're narrowing our fiscal year 2016 EPS guidance to $2.90 to $3.20.
With that, I'd like to thank you for listening and will now open it up for questions. Austin?"

Kevin, is there any way that you can help me understand the savings that is implied for the full year guidance now and in the back half of the year versus your expectations before? Because you keep increasing your costs and your savings -- the restructuring, and I guess, it sounds like there's more to go after that. I guess I'm just trying to understand for 2016, how much of your earnings are being helped by the savings and sort of how much in terms of a deterioration of your organic business -- how much is that when I think about your 2016 guidance, if that makes any sense? And then I guess my other question, just sort of more strategically, Steve, it was helpful to provide the margins by line of business. The profitability associated with some of your business is very interesting. And I guess, based on some of the hires that you've also just announced, is it fair to say, when you actually provide your color on your long-term strategy, that there could be something more transformational here with Jacobs? Could we see -- is there a bigger opportunity for divestitures of some of your businesses? Or do you feel like a lot can be accomplished through internal self-help?

And so, there's a lot going on. We'll obviously look first and foremost of how do we organically go after that and inorganic could also -- M&A could also play into that. And I did comment, we are going to look at underperforming markets and sectors equally as strong, and that could lead to some decisions, potential divestitures as well. But it's premature to talk about what that will look like. Is it going to be several different small to midsized initiatives that add up to something big? Or is it going to involve some transformational steps? I would say everything is on the table, and we'll have a lot more to talk about later this year."

Look, the dynamic of the restructuring, certainly, there was phase 1 that we did before we initiated our realignment into the LOB structure, right? And so as the LOB structure came into play, and as you recall, this was announced in our first quarter, I believe, and officially and formally in the first quarter of this year, and the teams have been forming and ultimately coming up with an idea what the new structure looks like to help support their growth agendas. And so that has been a big driver to incremental benefits associated with the restructuring as you now see it. Specifically, as it relates to what's in the forecast for 2016, the reality is if you look at where we are right now in terms of our total cost to date, I think we're somewhere in the neighborhood of in the middle $250 million figure -- numbers roughly. And so given that we still got close to $100 million to go, that means that as we're executing now, the benefits of that really won't happen, in a material way, on a full annualized basis until we enter into fiscal year 2017. So certainly, some of it is occurring this year. It certainly is helping as it relates to our ability to perform against our original expectations. And I would say that our guidance that Steve has provided is prudent as it relates to the current economic uncertainties that we're facing."

North America, specifically, is clearly sort of our best-performing pipeline, if you will. And globally, when we comment about those FEED, numerous FEED wins, first of all, they're up significantly from last year, the number of wins on the FEED side, which are really the smaller portion of potential larger opportunities because where we've seen in the past is once we get into the FEED win, there's a higher probability that we're going to be able to convert that to more work, whether it's a full EPC or EPCM opportunity, it provides a significant pipeline to grow with those existing clients. So we're optimistic about that. We're also -- we have shifted very specifically beyond focusing on a set of core clients to spreading our wings and going after more of the pie and more of the market. And that's going very well, and we've announced some recent large framework agreements with some multinational customers that historically we haven't been as strong in. And so I'd say, we're extending our reach. And then also, there's several factors around the cracker world as far as our participation in some of the peripheral work around some of these large projects, but also more importantly, derivatives. So there's a lot of derivative opportunities that people are doing now that a lot of the front-end capacity's put into the market, and that's an area where we're extremely strong. And so those are examples of different opportunities that are making us more bullish about chemicals versus some of the other petroleum, and oil and gas markets."

But I think, right now, we're pleased that in the declining backlog areas like the mining and upstream side of oil and gas, we feel like we've reached a point where that has stabilized, and so we're just doing our best now to go after wins across the different sectors. I will say one of the focal points for Jacobs, as we continue to look at how to strategically adjust to address the market opportunities, is we're looking more today than maybe we have in the past around selective larger projects where we're capable of strong project delivery capability.

And I feel like right now, that's our focus, and I like the mix of business as we're moving forward, and that will start to really pay dividends as some of these commodity cycles turn more positive, positioning us for profitable growth."

And so we continue to see opportunity at Jacobs to drive improvement, efficiency across the company in a meaningful way in many different areas of our spend. The restructuring was clearly heavily focused on adjusting our headcount to the marketplace with some office initiatives. I think as we're now moving into the more strategic phase of our cost optimization, we're broadening that -- all of our spend across Jacobs, and our initial assessment in the strategy work shows some significant opportunity over the next several years. So the reason why we're talking about that and doing that is we're not satisfied with the margins in this business, and we believe that there should be margin growth in all terms. So I would just say that our strategy expectation is for margin improvement over the next several years, and that's what we're going to go after with both the efficiency and mix of business that we're going after. And I'll just end that by seeing, what you should expect then is when some of the commodity businesses cycle back up, with all this work we're doing on cost improvement, we should see eventually stronger margins in those businesses as well."

We welcome everyone to Jacobs' 2016 Third Quarter Earnings Call. I will be joined on the call today by Steve Demetriou, our Chairman and CEO.
As you know, our earnings announcement and Form 10-Q were released this morning, and we have posted a copy of this slide presentation to our website. We will reference this slide presentation in our prepared remarks. 
Before starting, I would like to refer you to our forward-looking statement, which is summarized on Slide 2. 
Any statements that we make today that are not based on historical fact are forward-looking statements. All those such statements are based on the current estimates and expectations and currently available competitive, financial and economic data. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements as actual results may differ materially.
There are a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause Jacobs' actual results to differ materially from what may be contained, projected or implied by our forward-looking statements. For a description of some of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that may occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, see our most recent earnings release and quarterly report on Form 10-Q as well as our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended October 2, 2015, including Item 1 Business, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation as well as other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
Please now turn to Slide 3 for a quick review of the agenda for today's call. Steve will begin our earnings presentation with some general comments on the business and our results for the last quarter, followed by a summary of market conditions for each of our core lines of business or LOBs. I will then provide some more in-depth discussion on our financial metrics, backlog and results for our LOBs. I will continue with some comments on our current restructuring efforts and our share buyback program. Steve will then discuss some steps -- some next steps for the company and focus on the progress of our strategy development before finishing with some closing comments. We will then open it up for some questions. 
Before turning over to Steve, I would like to highlight a recent change to our Board of Directors. As announced a few weeks ago, Noel Watson retired from his role as a Nonexecutive Chairman of the Jacobs Board. Steve Demetriou, our CEO, was appointed to the additional role of Chairman. We are extremely thankful to Noel for his service and dedication to Jacobs' over the years and are especially pleased he will continue to be a member of the board.
With that, I will now pass it over to Chairman and CEO, Steve Demetriou."

Before I begin I'd like to take the opportunity to personally thank Noel for his priceless guidance and support since my appointment as the Jacobs CEO in August of last year. As you all know, Noel led Jacobs to significant profitable growth, while serving as CEO from 1992 to 2006 and has been an amazingly valuable member of the board since. I'm deeply honored to following his footsteps as Chairman. With Noel's continued support with Linda Levens [ph] and our longest tenured independent board member being named Lead Director and with our highly experienced and diverse set of directors, Jacobs is well-positioned to further the tradition of strong corporate governance.
Slide 4 is a summary of our fiscal year third quarter business performance. During the third quarter, global economic conditions post continued challenges in certain end markets. Specifically, weak commodity prices such as crude oil, copper and iron ore have negatively impacted our oil and gas mining sectors.  
Against, this backdrop, we're pleased to report that our backlog at quarter end was $18.3 billion, up modestly versus last quarter. And it's also very encouraging to see how our global business teams are successfully executing on our new strategic focus to upgrade our sales mix. 
Although third quarter revenue of $2.7 billion trended slightly down, this was more than offset by a significant increase in unit gross margin, which at 16.8% of revenue was the highest we have experienced since early 2015.
As we purposely shift to a more profitable mix of clients and markets, I'm confident that we'll soon see the combined benefit of a growing top line that generates higher margins.
We're also seeing the benefits of our increased focus on improving product delivery not only in terms of quality and financial metrics but based on an increasing trend in positive client feedback. 
Also in the third quarter, we continued to successfully rightsize Jacobs and relentlessly drive all cost across the company, resulting in a significant reduction of $102 million in G&A year-to-date versus 2015.
All in all, third quarter earnings came in at $0.78 per share, flat versus a year ago when excluding a one-time discrete tax benefit in the third quarter of fiscal year '15. 
I'm also very pleased with the improved working capital and cash flow performance. Year-over-year, operating working capital is down $192 million and DSO decreased 10 days versus last year. This capital efficiency was a key contributor to a strengthening of our already solid balance sheet, and we look forward to further improvement as our heightened focus on working capital delivers additional cash benefits.
Moving to Slide 5 and as we announced earlier this year, we're now managing the company by 4 global lines of business or LOBs. The chart on the slide shows the breakout of revenues and adjusted segment operating profit by each LOB, excluding non-allocated corporate expenses. Kevin will cover more financial details on the LOBs but here we provide insight into the differing economics of each business as it relates to the mix of profitability versus the top line. 
In summary, the strength of our Aerospace & Technology, Buildings & Infrastructure and certain higher value industrial businesses demonstrate the importance of our diverse portfolio and why we're able to maintain profit stability during a period of very challenging macroeconomic crisis. 
Specifically, during the third quarter, we were able to see segment operating profit growth in 3 of our 4 lines of business versus a year ago. Of these, our industrial LOB showed the most improvement in segment operating profit, up 32% versus last year's third quarter. Followed by Buildings & Infrastructure and Aerospace & Technology up 21% and 16%, respectively. These improvements more than offset the challenges we face in Petroleum & Chemicals, which was down 29% versus the year-ago quarter. 
Overall segment operating profit for the company was up 7% versus the year-ago quarter when excluding non-allocated corporate expense.
Although we're not satisfied with Jacobs' bottom line results, we're pleased with the improvement in segment operating profit margins versus last year, a good indication of our efforts to drive a culture of greater accountability to achieve more profitable and higher-margin work.
Progressing to Slide 6, a summary of our Aerospace & Technology LOB, which continues to be a bright spot for Jacobs. 
This business covers a variety of clients and government agencies that range from NASA to the Department of Defense, U.K. Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and also the intelligence community. 
Backlog for the LOB grew by more than $200 million  since last quarter and now stands at $5.1 billion. Importantly, the higher-margin professional services portion of this backlog increased over $300 million, with a favorable margin opportunity. 
In the near term, the customer programs we're supporting continue to receive stable funding. And we expect that to continue in most of our key markets and geographies for the foreseeable future. This is somewhat mitigated by the ongoing trend towards small business set asides, which we'll need to continue to work towards offsetting and drive profitable growth. 
As we have previously discussed in this LOB, we are experiencing extended procurement cycles and award protests in our U.S. government services markets. However, the $250 million awarded but not in backlog mentioned last quarter, has been reduced to $140 million  on the strength of several previous wins that have finally, cleared the protests process.  Additionally, in the U.S., we have won all of our major rebids awarded this fiscal year and aerospace and defense remains healthy. 
Looking forward, we have a solid pipeline of new business opportunities and are targeting over $3 billion in total contract life cycle revenue prospects closing in the next 18 months.
Last quarter we announced the acquisition of Vandyke [ph] Technology, which expanded our intelligence community and cybersecurity capabilities. We're targeting this strategic investments to drive additional growth, and we expect the Homeland Security cyber and intelligence-related markets to remain strong for the foreseeable future. 
In addition to our traditional government clients, we are building momentum collaboration with under Jacobs lines of business and are looking at opportunities to bring our IT and cyber capabilities to bear with our commercial customers.
While the quarter was positive for our U.S. space work, the recent Brexit vote is creating some uncertainty, specifically in the U.K. nuclear build sector. 
As previously discussed, we have already been awarded a major framework contract for the Hinkley Point C Nuclear Project, and we were pleased with the recent EDF Board approval. The U.K. government has indicated they will make their decision in the fall, all indications are that all 3 nuclear build programs in the U.K. will continue forward even in light of the Brexit vote. We'll continue to closely monitor this. 
In the environmental sectors producing a solid pipeline for our Aerospace & Technology LOB, we are successfully maintaining our work with the U.S. government, while expanding into the commercial sector, including a framework agreement we signed with one of Jacobs' major traditional customers in the Petroleum & Chemicals LOB.
Turning to Slide 7, our Buildings & Infrastructure LOB was steady overall, with backlog largely flat at $4.8 billion versus last quarter and last year. 
We're experiencing growth in the health care industry driven by the dynamics of an aging population. In the corporate building sector, we remain focused on a select base of high-quality opportunities where we can leverage client relationship and synergies across 4 global lines of business. 
Our mission-critical services continues to grow and develop globally where there's an increased need for data systems of storage. We're continuing to work on projects with citywide strategies, and we're assisting with drive towards smart cities. 
We are active on several of these projects across the globe and expect significant opportunities for Jacobs as the Internet of Things drives interconnectivity across city-wide systems. 
In infrastructure, there's been an uptick in government real spending and several high-speed light rail products are moving forward in the U.S. 
Our 2015 acquisition of J.L. Patterson & Associates is supporting our efforts, particularly on the West Coast. The U.S. Highway bill has provided increased spending confidence with most notable opportunities in areas where regional transportation packages exist such as Florida, Texas and California. 
In the U.K., increased government investment in infrastructure to drive economic development has been a positive. Although the Brexit vote may impact us in the midterm. For the moment, most U.K. clients are saying it's business as usual, but we will continue to monitor this situation closely. 
In Australia, the federal and state governments are making strong investments in transportation, and we've had a number of positive highway and rail wins this year. 
Global aviation opportunities are growing, driven by aging airports, growth in passage of travel and increased spending programs. In the U.S. alone, projections are for more than $130 billion in investment over the next 10 years. To this end, we recently announced the strategic expansion of our global aviation practice, hiring several key individuals and appointing a global aviation business leader. 
We're excited about our recent win to support the $8 billion La Guardia Airport redevelopment program. We're also in the mix of several large-scale aviation pursuits globally. 
We're also seeing investments in water-related infrastructure in the Middle East and our major opportunities across Asia Pacific. The environmental market continues to grow globally as clients look to reduce costs through energy savings and increase sustainability practice. And we're seeing opportunities in Asia for power generation, specifically in the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia.
Finally, I'd like to mentioned that in June, Phil Stassi, who was most recently, President of the Buildings & Infrastructure line of business, elected to retire after nearly 40 years with Jacobs. I'd like to take a moment to thank Phil for his leadership and significant contributions to Jacobs over his extensive career with the company and for all he did to help me in my first year at Jacobs. 
I'd also like to welcome Bob Pragada into this expanded role as President of the Buildings & Infrastructure LOB, and I'm excited about the strong leadership experience and strategic insight he will bring to the organization.
Moving to Slide 8, our industrial LOB backlog is at $3.2 billion. This is relatively flat compared to last quarter but up more than $500 million compared to last year on the strength of our Life Science business and our recently announced EPCM contract to support Rio Tinto's Oyo Toygo [ph] Underground Platform Project in Mongolia. 
The mining and mineral sector continues to be significantly challenged as commodity prices remain under pressure and most client projects are continuing to stall. A few potential large investments in the mining space are being broken up and parceled in order to spread out and conserve capital spending. However, as previously mentioned, we were successful in securing one of the only major projects in this industry. This was an exciting win and will have a positive effect on our industrial LOB as we move it to 2017.
There continues to be a robust pipeline of work in our Life Sciences sector, primarily driven by regulatory approvals for next generation therapies. Recent trends indicate significant future investment in both R&D facilities and manufacturing capacity with geographic focus in Europe, Ireland and the U.S. There is a growing pipeline of new drug initiatives and the need for greater capacity is being accelerated as a result of several clients receiving regulatory approvals. 
While we are a clear market leader in the biopharmaceutical space, we continue to grow market share through a strategic focus on sustaining capital opportunities, integrated project delivery and geographic expansion. We expect longer-term success from several of our early phase design efforts on programs currently scheduled for next wave manufacturing capacity expansions. 
Within our Specialty Chemicals and Manufacturing sector, our, cometic business is benefiting from our focus on sustaining capital programs, supporting fertilizer and mining industries. We're also working with certain glides to expand our project delivery scope beyond the traditional licensing model in order to participate in full EPC projects. 
Demand for our Caprimo [ph] Technology in the oil and gas market is also increasing with the recent uptick in project pursuits. Pulp and paper activity continues to be brisk, both in the U.S. as well as in emerging economies such as Russia, Brazil and Indonesia.
And although our backlog in field services have been relatively flat for the last several quarters, we're positive on the market outlook and the opportunities to grow. Specifically, our petrochemical customers in the U.S. Gulf Coast and our nuclear and defense clients in the U.K. have accelerated solicitations for integrated EPC programs to be executed in the 2017 and '18 time frame. 
Additionally, we have seen increase in opportunities as our customers look to drive down operating cost through supplier consolidation and productivity improvements. We're putting particular emphasis in the U.S. Gulf region, and we recently announced an expansion of our presence in their, including a commitment to increase workforce training in development to meet our customers' needs.
And on Slide 9, the summary of our Global Petroleum & Chemicals line of business. Weak global oil prices continue to negatively impact this LOB. After peaking in June at over $50, oil prices have been steadily declining and weakness is projected to continue through the second half of 2016. 
As a result, capital spending across the petroleum sector continues to be down significantly, with certain U.S. clients reducing their spend by more than 50% versus last year. 
With this backdrop, I'm very pleased that we've been able to stabilize and maintain our Petroleum & Chemicals backlog above $5 billion, as we successfully focus on the downstream side of the industry where we see attractive opportunities. 
The upstream oil and gas sector is under the most severe pressure. Saudi Arabia and other national oil companies have kept with the their to maintain market share. Consequently, oil production in the Middle East continues to rise. Our strong position in this region, especially in Saudi Arabia has enabled us to selectively participate where capital is being spent. However, margins are under significant pressure due to heavy competition. 
Outside of the Middle East, high-cost producers are being squeezed, specially in the U.S. One of the only positive trends in this sector is the increased production of shale oil condensates and natural gas liquids. Process and pipeline infrastructure need to be put in place to move these barrels to market and this will be an area of continued focus for Jacobs. 
It should be noted that the upstream sector now represents less than 10% of our total Petroleum & Chemicals backlog, so the downside risk going forward is minimal.
Our refining business remains positive, especially in maintenance, turnaround and sustaining capital projects. There's an increased focus on process safety and compliance. As a result of our Jacob [ph] service, in which we offer our clients world-class process safety management, we are well positioned to capitalize on this strength. 
We're also seeing excellent opportunities as customers focus on octane improvement products and butane disposition, which favors alkylation, a  particular strength of ours. Refining demand in developing countries is expected to increase at more than 3% annually, we continue to see request for feasibility and FEED studies and developing countries in Asia and Africa and we're looking beyond our traditional markets. We're expecting grassroots refining opportunities in India and South Asia as both reason regions continue to develop.
The chemicals market continues to provide a significant opportunity for Jacobs and new sales bookings are up sequentially, this year. We're seeing opportunities in propylene and ethylene derivatives, primarily on the U.S. Gulf Coast and Saudi Arabia. 
Meanwhile, crude oil to come across projects are seeing a heightened interest, particularly in the Middle East. Additionally is increased interest in diversification into value-added products with a move away from first-line commodity chemicals that are impacted by crude oil pricing trends. There's also good activity in energy efficiency and yield improvements projects, ethane, LPG and naphtha feedstocks are plentiful and relatively cheap and may provide the economic incentives for project development. 
Overall, I'm particularly pleased with how the Global Petroleum & Chemicals team has extended beyond our traditional customer base. The team is also expanding geographically and is building up the capability to selectively pursue and win fully integrated EDC opportunities. 
I'll now pass it back to Kevin to present more details on our financial results."
282159,376893947,1030932,"Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2016",2016-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Jacobs Solutions Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. So now turning to Slide 10, where you will see a more detailed summary of our financial performance for the quarter. As we had communicated throughout the fiscal year, adverse market conditions in certain end markets continue to negativel",1650,"Thanks, Steve. So now turning to Slide 10, where you will see a more detailed summary of our financial performance for the quarter. 
As we had communicated throughout the fiscal year, adverse market conditions in certain end markets continue to negatively impact some of our businesses. As a result of these ongoing pressures, particularly in oil and gas, our revenue for the third quarter was $2.7 billion, which is down approximately 7% versus our third quarter last year. However, more positively, as Steve mentioned, our backlog now stands at $18.3 billion, which is up sequentially versus last quarter. 
I will make a few more comments on our backlog a little bit later in the presentation. 
In addition, our book-to-bill on a trailing 12-month basis was just under 1 at 0.96, which also extends the positive sequential improvement seen last quarter. 
Meanwhile, our gross margin dollars for the quarter were $451 million, resulting in the highest absolute level in a quarter this year, continuing a positive sequential trends over the course of our 2016 fiscal year. 
The gross margin percentage also improved during the quarter to 16.8%, was 84 basis points sequentially and plus 10 basis points versus the year-ago quarter. And finally, our gross margin percentage for our professional services business was also up sequentially and versus the year-ago quarter as well. It was also the highest since the fourth quarter of fiscal year '14. 
This is evidence of the increased focus of our teams to improve project execution. The assets from researchers also continued to positively impact and contribute to the bottom line during the quarter, resulting in further reductions in G&A versus the year-ago period.  Specifically, G&A was lower by $32 million versus the year-ago quarter and by $102 million on a year-to-date basis. Both are clear indications of our success in rightsizing the company and improving financial performance.
As a result, our adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $142 million, the highest level in fiscal year '16 and nearly flat versus the year-ago quarter. 
On an adjusted basis, EPS for the quarter was $0.78. This $0.78 figure is flat to last year's EPS figure when excluding the discrete tax benefit of $0.19 that was included in the year-ago quarter figure. 
Finally, as Steve also talked some investment grow in our efforts to improve accounts receivable, the company's DSO levels reduced by 10 days versus the prior year quarter. While we still have further opportunities to reduce this, the improvement in account receivables help support the reduction in operating working capital down to $515 million, which is down $82 million sequentially versus last quarter and $192 million from a year ago quarter. 
Operating working capital as a percent of the trailing 12-month as a [ph] result, decreased 130 basis points versus same calculation a year ago, down to 4.5% of revenues from 5.8% last year. 
Free cash flow was obviously, therefore, strong, totaling $164 million during the quarter and company's net cash position, ended at $128 million, up $101 million from the $27 million figure last quarter and up $259 million from the year-ago quarter.
So moving on now to Slide 11. And you'll see our total backlog stands at a combined $8.3 million previously [indiscernible], which is slightly off from our Q2 figure. A positive, given the tough market conditions our sales teams continue to face in certain end markets. 
Of note, the $18.3 billion figure includes a negative foreign currency exchange and impact of $200 million versus our Q2 figures.  Excluding the impact of these FX movements, our backlog actually grew sequentially by $300 million. 
Versus the year ago figures, our backlog is down $500 million from the $18.8 billion year ago figure to $18.3 billion. Again, a large portion of this reduction is also driven by foreign exchange movements when adjusting for differences in foreign exchange versus the year ago figure, a backlog on a constant currency basis would have been $18.7 billion, only slightly down versus the year-ago quarter. 
We're pleased with this performance, with general stability backlog across the portfolio versus last quarter. Even with the end market challenges facing our Petroleum & Chemicals business, the backlog for this LOB was relatively flat on a sequential basis. 
Our Aerospace & Technology business, which we believe continues to provide good growth opportunities, increased by the $200 million referenced by Steve earlier. 
Finally, our higher-margin professional services backlog actually grew by $500 million sequentially versus the last quarter and now represents $11.9 billion of total backlog. The remaining $6.4 billion represents our field services work and it's sequentially down, $400 million. The growth in professional services bodes well for momentum of the business going forward.
So turning to Slide 12. I'd like to talk all but about our Q3 adjusted segment financials for our 4 lines of business. As you can see, 3 of the 4 LOBs improved their adjusted segment operating profit and profit margin in the third quarter versus the year-ago period. Regarding Aerospace & Technology, while we did see some revenue decline versus the third quarter of '15, the adjusted segment operating profit, excuse me versus the year-ago period, increased by 16% and is now up [ph] 5% for the 9 months year-to-date. 
Segment operating profit margin has also improved to 8% in the quarter, up 140 basis points versus the year-ago period. 
The improvement in the margin profile is driven both by strong performance fees realized this year and by an overall improvement in the margin [indiscernible] of the business. 
Reduced performance fees in the short term could put some incremental pressure on sequential margins going forward. 
The G&A business also saw a revenue decline for the quarter versus the year-ago period but adjusted segment operating profit improved by 21% and is up 9% for the 9 months year-to-date. As a result, segment operating profit margins were exceptionally strong in this quarter at 9.1%, up 210 basis points versus the year-ago period. For the year-to-date figure segment operating profit margin performance was also solid at 7.8%, up 110 basis points versus last fiscal year period.
The pressures in the mining industry, revenue in the industrial line of business increased 12% versus the year-ago quarter, and that's to a 32% increase in segment operating profit versus the year-ago quarter. 
Segment operating profit margin for the quarter was also up and at 4% represented 50 basis points improvement from the year-ago period. Growth in our life sciences businesses is driving the overall growth picture for this LOB. The improved margin this quarter from last is elimination of the discrete items we discussed last quarter and our reported margin profile that we are showing this quarter is very much aligned with our expectations.
Lastly, our P&C line of business totaling chemicals business continued to face end market challenges. As evidenced by the lower segment operating profit versus the year-ago quarter. Although the PC -- P&C segment operating profit margin for the quarter is down 40 basis points versus year ago, importantly, it is up 30 basis points from last quarter, including a clear indication of the strong focus on cost reductions in line of business of the benefits of the restructuring. 
Finally, our unallocated cost for the quarter remained aligned with our cost in the previous 2 [ph] quarters and represent a mix of cost elements, some of which are inherently predictable and some that are not. Now just to continue the education process in terms of what we do have in these figures, these costs include acquisition-related expenses, including amortization of intangible assets, adjustments to employee fringe benefit programs, which include medical, pensions and other employee benefits; litigation cost, including defense and settlement expenditures; and margin adjustments on projects that are not related to LOB performance. 
Consistent with the first 2 quarters of the year, unallocated corporate cost totaled $19.5 million and are up year-over-year due to increased legal defense costs [indiscernible] and expenses relating to our strategy work. 
In summary, the fact that 3 of our 4 LOBs [indiscernible] is a clear indication of the benefits of our diversity and our ability to deliver solid operating profit performance in a challenging environment.
So turning to Slide 13 a quick update at our structuring where we continue to be successful in reducing cost. Certainly, this is evidenced by the magnitude of our G&A reduction over the last few months. The reception effort to reduce our fixed cost infrastructure primarily in labor and real estate is nearing completion and our forecast remain in place. 
The total cost of our restructuring effort is expected in the $330 million to $350 million range to the fiscal year-end, with expected gross savings of $240 million to $270 million. Please note these figures include the most recent step we took to exit our French operations. 
As previously mentioned, some portion of the savings will be reinvested in the business to ensure we position ourselves for profitable growth in the long term. In summary our options are helping Jacobs to an increased profitability and unchallenged economic environment, and we work -- look forward to seeing continued benefits going forward.
Moving to Slide 14, to provide a short update on our share buyback program. During the quarter, we continue to execute against our share buyback program in a balanced and steady manner. 
In Q3, we spent $30 million to repurchase 600,000 shares. Year-to-date, we have now spent a total of $102 million in share buybacks, and we expect to continue to spend the remainder of the $500 million share buyback authorization in a relatively consistent manner of the remaining term of the original 3-year program. Again, we'll continue to work to our strategic review and our plan is to provide an update on our use of cash and capital structure and our strategy to review a day later this year. 
With that, let me hand back over to Steve."

I'd like to spend a couple of minutes discussing our continued focus on project delivery excellence, pitting company systems, tools and procedures and the development of our corporate strategy. We continue to focus on several initiatives to drive positive delivery excellence and then pleased with the progress as reflected in our margin improvements. 
Project write-downs continue to decrease versus a year ago and use of our high-value India execution center is up 15% versus last year. We're implementing new project delivery standards across the 4 lines of business and developing upgraded and standardized tools to improve our project execution. One example of this quarter was the signing of an enterprise agreement with a major software provider to implement a standardized project cost control system, which will provide our project teams with the ability to more effectively manage for life cycle project lost in a single platform, lowering our costs and increasing our multi-office execution capability. 
Also in the final stages of implementing an upgraded enterprise business platform that will deliver powerful analytics across the business and to the operational leaders. This includes our financial systems business intelligence and analytics. By leveraging our scale, we'll be able to increase synergies to drive greater efficiency. While these changes involve a long-term transformation, many initiatives are underway and will be accelerated over the course of fiscal year 2017.
As Kevin pointed out, our company-wide restructuring efforts have continued to deliver significant cost reductions as we focus on optimizing our office footprint. Most recently, we announced the divestiture of our operations in France, which helps streamline our European business and to refocus on higher margin growth areas that provide the best returns for Jacobs and our shareholders.
As discussed during our recent earnings calls, we believe that developing and executing a profitable growth global strategy is necessary for Jacobs to deliver mid and long-term industry shareholder value. 
We completed an initial review of our corporate strategy with our board in late July and have now moved into the phase of developing strategies for our 4 lines of business. To that end, we are finalizing plans for an Investor Day in late November.
Moving to the last slide, and while we're pleased with our third quarter, we expect challenging market conditions for at least the remainder of this year. 
Global uncertainty, compounded by weak growth in developed markets, the Brexit vote, the U.S. federal election and uncertain political environment in several countries, along with lower commodity prices, continue to impact some of our end markets. More positively we've begun to see a stabilization in our backlog, and we remain focused on driving improved margins. Our strategic review is progressing, and we're using early outcomes to adjust the refocus our business where we see the most promising growth. We'll continue to evaluate, modify or refocus our portfolio for a long-term sustainable shareholder value. 
In addition to the restructuring we've undertaken over the past several quarters continues to provide momentum and our strategic review is identifying additional opportunities to further reduce our internal cost and expenses. We're seeing improvements in our project delivery efforts and write us continue to be reduced.
Finally, our performance year-to-date gives us an increased confidence that we will meet our objectives for the year and we're narrowing our fiscal year 2016 EPS guidance range to $2.95 to $3.15. 
With that, I'd like to thank you for listening and will now open it up to questions. Operator?"

And so I think, for us, we -- what we really need to do is continue to strategically narrow in on where we can drive growth, and we believe that growth should come soon from the Building & Infrastructure and pivot to a more steady growth rather than where we've been most recently at the flat backlog.

So is there anything unusual in the fourth quarter because obviously, that has implications for how people are thinking about '17 and the sustainability of the cost savings that you guys are generating?

There still is volatility out in the space out there as it relates to certainly the chemical side of the business as well as just of the general economic situation and some unease relative to elections and implications, and so on, and so forth. So we just thought it's appropriate to do so. Regardless of that though, your comment as it relates to the sequential pieces, two comment I would make. The first is typically this last quarter is a quarter that is generally impacted by a lower level of kind of billings because of the holiday period in Europe and the U.S. and so on, and so forth. So that's a general comment. So effectively sequentially, we tend to open a levy down versus the third quarter because that's kind of a normal kind of dynamic over the course of the year, fourth quarter versus the first 3. The other point certainly is that as we think about going forward, continuing to invest in the savings to back -- to invest some of the savings you would about the aviation spend and some of the investments in support there. So as it relates to the savings initiatives, certainly take into account the fact that there will be some investments that will help offset some of that.

As we look at our mix of businesses and what's happened to the marketplace, we've been faced with a significantly declining backlog over the last couple of years in some of the heavy commodity areas like mining and like upstream oil and gas. And the good news from our backlog standpoint is some of the decline is essentially behind us because other than the new Rio Tilso [ph] project and some of our sustaining capital, et cetera, we don't see -- we really don't have much of backlog as it relates to those heavy margin areas and what we've done is been transitioning to expand our customer base away from -- in addition to the traditional customers we've had. And as we do that, that takes time to replenish and start building backlog in some of those growth areas. As I look at our lines of business, we should be able to assume grow backlog in Building& Infrastructure . It's an area that provides us growth. We have strong positions. We're very well-diversified. We're not happy that our backlog has been flat. We should be able to do better. When we look at the downstream chemical side, we believe that over the next 12 to 18 to 24 months, you're going to see more and more of our Jacobs Petroleum & Chemicals backlog become that sector, and we think there's significant opportunities they are.

It's very clear that as we think about how we want to drive our growth agenda going forward, we're not just thinking and talking about a top line figure. We're talking about top line that is profitable. And of course, there's varying degrees as it relates to mix of business and dynamics that we have to take into account. But it's not -- we're not just looking for growth for growth's sake. We wanted to be profitable and result in incremental margin profile that is able to be realized. So yes, there is certainly a mix benefit because of the dynamic you outlined but when you look at the margin profile at each of the respective LOBs, you see a consistent theme where margins by the LOBs are also regardless of what percentage they make up of the total business. So I think that, that is indicative of the focus that ultimately we're trying to drive and which I think, the LOBs are doing a great job on is look, it's about a possible growth agenda that ultimately we're going to have to drive, which is the foundation of being able to driving capital EBS longer term. And of course, combined with our focus on the working capital side be capital efficient as well. So I think you can see that there is both sides of the coin, which are helping us. One is the mix is in itself good, overall mix but if you look by LOBs, we're also seeing improvements. So I think that bodes well for your comment about are we seeing some benefits. And I think, that in toughly competitive environments, in which we are, we hope to be able to improve that longer term that certainly is something that we'll be pushing for."

We expect that we should be able to continue to realize these benefits, of course, over time we're going to have to invest in [indiscernible], we're going to have to invest in training and development of our people, and so there will be some offsets of that. The idea though of our strategy is not for when we get back to growth at our SG&A and our G&A figure is going to go up correspondingly with our growth in the gross margin dollars. That is what it's all about. It's about having the discipline when we start to see those gross that you get the growth leverage, a better growth levers relative to those incremental dollars. So I think of G&A more as fixed, and we always got to try and figure out how to keep those numbers consistent and certainly growing less over the long haul, with the gross margin growth so you get the incremental leverage."

So that in itself should indicate that we're continuing to drive for incremental benefits beyond where we are today. So that's the first one. I do believe that there will be, at some point in time, when we get to a more efficient kind of cash structure supporting our business, that the incremental cash flow dynamics will not be at the magnitude that we've had this year, obviously. The other dynamic that we certainly have to understand is that our business is not in a growth mode exactly right now, and there are implications on what cash flow dynamic school or occurring during that particular period of time. So hopefully, we'll have a high-class problem when that pivot occurs, where we have profitable growth going forward. And then ultimately if we are at a capital efficient place that we would like to have, that we'll be translating into a good cash flow conversion going forward. But certainly the number for this quarter, for example, well above net income, that's not a sustainable figure but ultimately, we certainly would like to think that we're going to be able to have a really good solid conversion factor going forward."

Any statements that we make today that are not based on historical fact are forward-looking statements. Although such statements are based on the current estimates and expectations and currently available competitive, financial and economic data, forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements as actual results may differ materially.
There are a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause Jacobs' actual results to differ materially from what may be contained, projected or implied by our forward-looking statements. For a description of some of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that may occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, see our most recent earnings release and quarterly report on Form 10-Q as well as our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended October 2, 2015, including Item 1, Business; Item 1A, Risk Factors; Item 3, Legal Proceedings; and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as well as other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
Please now turn to Slide 3 for a quick review of the agenda for today's call. Steve will begin our earnings presentation with some general comments on the business and our results for the last quarter, followed by a summary of market conditions for each of our 4 lines of business or LOBs. I will then provide some more in-depth discussion on our financial metrics, backlog and results for our LOBs. I will continue with some comments on our current restructuring efforts and our share buyback program. Steve will then discuss some steps -- some next steps for the company and focus on the progress of our strategy development before finishing with some closing comments. After, we will then open it up for some questions. 
Before turning over to Steve, I would like to highlight a recent change to our Board of Directors. As announced a few weeks ago, Noel Watson retired from his role as the Nonexecutive Chairman of the Jacobs Board. Steve Demetriou, our CEO, was appointed to the additional role of Chairman. We are extremely thankful to Noel for his service and dedication to Jacobs over the years, and are especially pleased he will continue to be a member of the Board.
With that, I will now pass it over to Chairman and CEO, Steve Demetriou."

Before I begin, I'd like to take the opportunity to personally thank Noel for his priceless guidance and support since my appointment as the Jacobs CEO in August of last year. As you all know, Noel led Jacobs to significant profitable growth, while serving as CEO from 1992 to 2006, and has been an amazingly valuable member of the Board since. I'm deeply honored to following his footsteps as Chairman. With Noel's continued support, with Linda Levinson, our longest tenured independent board member, being named Lead Director, and with our highly experienced and diverse set of directors, Jacobs is well positioned to further the tradition of strong corporate governance.
Slide 4 is a summary of our fiscal year third quarter business performance. During the third quarter, global economic conditions post continued challenges in certain end markets. Specifically, weak commodity prices such as crude oil, copper and iron ore have negatively impacted our oil and gas mining sectors.  
Against, this backdrop, we're pleased to report that our backlog at quarter end was $18.3 billion, up modestly versus last quarter. It is also very encouraging to see how our global business teams are successfully executing on our new strategic focus to upgrade our sales mix. 
Although third quarter revenue of $2.7 billion trended slightly down, this was more than offset by a significant increase in unit gross margin, which, at 16.8% of revenue, was the highest we have experienced since early 2015.
As we purposely shift to a more profitable mix of clients and markets, I'm confident that we'll soon see the combined benefit of a growing top line that generates higher margins.
We're also seeing the benefits of our increased focus on improving project delivery, not only in terms of quality in financial metrics, but based on an increasing trend in positive client feedback. 
Also in the third quarter, we continued to successfully rightsize Jacobs and relentlessly drive out cost across the company, resulting in a significant reduction of $102 million in G&A year-to-date versus 2015.
All in all, third quarter earnings came in at $0.78 per share, flat versus a year ago when excluding a one-time discrete tax benefit in the third quarter of fiscal year '15. 
I'm also very pleased with the improved working capital and cash flow performance. Year-over-year, operating working capital is down $192 million and DSO decreased 10 days versus last year. This capital efficiency was a key contributor to a strengthening of our already solid balance sheet, and we look forward to further improvement as our heightened focus on working capital delivers additional cash benefits.
Moving to Slide 5, and as we announced earlier this year, we're now managing the company by 4 global lines of business or LOBs. The chart on this slide shows the breakout of revenues and adjusted segment operating profit by each LOB, excluding non-allocated corporate expenses. Kevin will cover more financial details on the LOBs, but here we provide insight into the differing economics of each business as it relates to the mix of profitability versus the top line. 
In summary, the strength of our Aerospace & Technology, Buildings & Infrastructure and certain higher-value industrial businesses demonstrate the importance of our diverse portfolio and why we're able to maintain profit stability during a period of very challenging macroeconomic crisis. 
Specifically, during the third quarter, we were able to see segment operating profit growth in 3 of our 4 lines of business versus a year ago. Of these, our industrial LOB showed the most improvement in segment operating profit, up 32% versus last year's third quarter. Followed by Buildings & Infrastructure and Aerospace & Technology up 21% and 16%, respectively. These improvements more than offset the challenges we face in Petroleum & Chemicals, which was down 29% versus the year-ago quarter. 
Overall segment operating profit for the company was up 7% versus the year-ago quarter when excluding non-allocated corporate expenses.
Although we're not satisfied with Jacobs' bottom line results, we're pleased with the improvement in segment operating profit margins versus last year, a good indication of our efforts to drive a culture of greater accountability to achieve more profitable and higher-margin work.
Progressing to Slide 6, a summary of our Aerospace & Technology LOB, which continues to be a bright spot for Jacobs. 
This business covers a variety of clients and government agencies that range from NASA to the Department of Defense, U.K. Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and also the intelligence community. 
Backlog for the LOB grew by more than $200 million since last quarter and now stands at $5.1 billion. Importantly, the higher-margin professional services portion of this backlog increased over $300 million, with a favorable margin opportunity. 
In the near term, the customer programs we're supporting continue to receive stable funding and we expect that to continue in most of our key markets and geographies for the foreseeable future. This is somewhat mitigated by the ongoing trend towards small business set-asides, which we'll need to continue to work towards offsetting and our drive for profitable growth. 
As we have previously discussed, in this LOB, we're experiencing extended procurement cycles and award protests in our U.S. government services markets. However, the $250 million awarded but not in backlog mentioned last quarter, has been reduced to $140 million on the strength of several previous wins that have finally cleared the protest process. Additionally, in the U.S., we have won all of our major rebids awarded this fiscal year, and aerospace and defense remains healthy. 
Looking forward, we have a solid pipeline of new business opportunities and are targeting over $3 billion in total contract life cycle revenue prospects closing in the next 18 months.
Last quarter we announced the acquisition of Van Dyke Technology, which expanded our intelligence community and cyber security capabilities. We're targeting this strategic investment to drive additional growth, and we expect the Homeland Security, cyber and intelligence-related markets to remain strong for the foreseeable future. 
In addition to our traditional government clients, we're building momentum, get collaboration with under Jacobs lines of business and are looking at opportunities to bring our IT and cyber capabilities to bear with our commercial-sector customers.
While the quarter was positive for our U.S. space work, the recent Brexit vote is creating some uncertainty, specifically in the U.K. nuclear build sector. 
As previously discussed, we have already been awarded a major framework contract for the Hinkley Point C nuclear project, and we were pleased with the recent EDF Board approval. The U.K. government has indicated they will make their decision in the fall. All indications are that all 3 nuclear build programs in the U.K. will continue forward even in light of the Brexit vote. We'll continue to closely monitor this. 
And the environmental sector is producing a solid pipeline for our Aerospace & Technology LOB. We're successfully maintaining our work with the U.S. government, while expanding into the commercial sector, including a framework agreement we signed with one of Jacobs' major traditional customers in the Petroleum & Chemicals LOB.
Turning to Slide 7, our Buildings & Infrastructure LOB was steady overall, with backlog largely flat at $4.8 billion versus last quarter and last year. 
We're experiencing growth in the health care industry driven by the dynamics of an aging population. In the corporate building sector, we remain focused on a select base of high-quality opportunities where we can leverage client relationships and synergies across 4 global lines of business. 
Our mission-critical services continues to grow and develop globally where there's an increased need for data systems of storage. We're continuing to work on projects with citywide strategies, and we're assisting the drive towards smart cities. We are active on several of these projects across the globe and expect significant opportunities for Jacobs as the Internet of Things drives interconnectivity across city-wide systems. 
In infrastructure, there's been an uptick in government real spending and several high-speed and light rail projects are moving forward in the U.S. 
Our 2015 acquisition of J.L. Patterson & Associates is supporting our efforts, particularly on the West Coast. The U.S. highway bill has provided increased spending confidence with most notable opportunities in areas where regional transportation packages exist such as Florida, Texas and California. 
In the U.K., increased government investment in infrastructure to drive economic development has been a positive, although the Brexit vote may impact us in the midterm. For the moment, most U.K. clients are saying it's business as usual, but we will continue to monitor this situation closely. 
In Australia, the federal and state governments are making strong investments in transportation, and we've had a number of positive highway and rail wins this year. 
Global aviation opportunities are growing, driven by aging airports, growth in passage of travel and increased spending programs. In the U.S. alone, projections are for more than $130 billion in investment over the next 10 years. To this end, we recently announced the strategic expansion of our global aviation practice, hiring several key individuals and appointing a global aviation business leader. 
We're excited about our recent win to support the LaGuardia Airport redevelopment program. We're also in the midst of several large-scale aviation pursuits globally. 
We're also seeing investments in water-related infrastructure in the Middle East and there are major opportunities across Asia Pacific. The environmental market continues to grow globally as clients look to reduce costs through energy savings and increase sustainability practices. And we're seeing opportunities in Asia for power generation, specifically in the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia.
Finally, I'd like to mention that in June, Phil Stassi, who was most recently President of the Buildings & Infrastructure line of business, elected to retire after nearly 40 years with Jacobs. I'd like to take a moment to thank Phil for his leadership and significant contributions to Jacobs over his extensive career with the company and for all he did to help me in my first year at Jacobs. 
I'd also like to welcome Bob Pragada into this expanded role as President of the Buildings & Infrastructure LOB, and I'm excited about the strong leadership experience and strategic insight he will bring to the organization.
Moving to Slide 8, our industrial LOB backlog is at $3.2 billion. This is relatively flat compared to last quarter, but up more than $500 million compared to last year on the strength of our Life Science business and our recently announced EPCM contract to support Rio Tinto's Oyu Tolgoi Underground Platform Project in Mongolia. 
The mining and mineral sector continues to be significantly challenged as commodity prices remain under pressure, and most client projects are continuing to stall. A few potential large investments in the mining space are being broken up and parceled in order to spread out and conserve capital spending. However, as previously mentioned, we were successful in securing one of the only major projects in this industry. This was an exciting win and will have a positive effect on our industrial LOB as we move in to 2017.
There continues to be a robust pipeline of work in our life sciences sector, primarily driven by regulatory approvals for next-generation therapies. Recent trends indicate significant future investment in both R&D facilities and manufacturing capacity, with geographic focus in Europe, Ireland and the U.S. There's a growing pipeline of new drug initiatives and the need for greater capacity is being accelerated as a result of several clients receiving regulatory approvals. 
Though we are the clear market leader in the biopharmaceutical space, we continue to grow market share through a strategic focus on sustaining capital opportunities, integrated project delivery and geographic expansion. We expect longer-term success from several of our early-phase design efforts on programs currently scheduled for next-wave manufacturing capacity expansions. 
Within our specialty chemicals and manufacturing sector, our Chemetics business is benefiting from our focus on sustaining capital programs, supporting the fertilizer and mining industries. We're also working with certain clients to expand our project delivery scope beyond the traditional licensing model in order to participate in full EPC projects. 
Demand for our Caprimo [ph] technology in the oil and gas market is also increasing with the recent uptick in project pursuits. Pulp and paper activity continues to be brisk, both in the U.S. as well as in emerging economies such as Russia, Brazil and Indonesia.
And although our backlog in field services had been relatively flat over the last several quarters, we're positive on the market outlook and the opportunities to grow. Specifically, our petrochemical customers in the U.S. Gulf Coast and our nuclear and defense clients in the U.K. have accelerated solicitations for integrated EPC programs to be executed in the 2017 and '18 time frame. 
Additionally, we have seen increase in opportunities as our customers look to drive down operating cost through supplier consolidation and productivity improvements. We're putting particular emphasis in the U.S. Gulf region, and we recently announced an expansion of our presence there, including a commitment to increase workforce training and development to meet our customers' needs.
And on Slide 9, the summary of our global Petroleum & Chemicals line of business. Weak global oil prices continue to negatively impact this LOB. After peaking in June at over $50, oil prices have been steadily declining and weakness is projected to continue through the second half of 2016. 
As a result, capital spending across the petroleum sector continues to be down significantly, with certain U.S. clients reducing their spend by more than 50% versus last year. 
With this backdrop, I'm very pleased that we've been able to stabilize and maintain our Petroleum & Chemicals backlog above $5 billion as we successfully focus on the downstream side of the industry where we see attractive opportunities. 
The upstream oil and gas sector is under the most severe pressure. Saudi Arabia and other national oil companies have kept with their decision to maintain market share. Consequently, oil production in the Middle East continues to rise. Our strong position in this region, especially in Saudi Arabia, has enabled us to selectively participate where capital is being spent. However, margins are under significant pressure due to heavy competition. 
Outside of the Middle East, high-cost producers are being squeezed, especially in the U.S. One of the only positive trends in this sector is the increased production of shale oil, condensates and natural gas liquids. Process and pipeline infrastructure need to be put in place to move these barrels to market, and this will be an area of continued focus for Jacobs. 
It should be noted that the upstream sector now represents less than 10% of our total Petroleum & Chemicals backlog, so the downside risk going forward is minimal.
Our refining business remains a positive, especially in maintenance, turnaround and sustaining capital projects. There's an increased focus on process safety and compliance. As a result of our JPro [ph] service, in which we offer our clients world-class process safety management, we are well positioned to capitalize on this strength. 
We're also seeing excellent opportunities as customers focus on octane improvement projects and butane disposition, which favors alkylation, a particular strength of ours. Refining demand in developing countries is expected to increase at more than 3% annually. We continue to see requests for feasibility and FEED studies in developing countries, in Asia and Africa, and we're looking beyond our traditional markets. We're expecting grassroots refining opportunities in India and South Asia as both regions continue to develop.
The chemicals market continues to provide a significant opportunity for Jacobs, and new sales bookings are up sequentially this year. We're seeing opportunities in propylene and ethylene derivatives, primarily on the U.S. Gulf Coast and Saudi Arabia. 
Meanwhile, crude oil to chemicals projects are seeing a heightened interest, particularly in the Middle East. Additionally, there's increased interest in diversification into value-added products with a move away from first-line commodity chemicals that are impacted by crude oil pricing trends. There's also good activity in energy efficiency and yield-improvement projects, ethane, LPG and naphtha feedstocks are plentiful and relatively cheap, and may provide the economic incentives for project development. 
Overall, I'm particularly pleased with how the global Petroleum & Chemicals team has extended beyond our traditional customer base. The team is also expanding geographically and is building up the capability to selectively pursue and win fully integrated EPC opportunities. 
I'll now pass it back to Kevin to present more details on our financial results."
282159,376893947,1031437,"Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2016",2016-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Jacobs Solutions Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve. So now turning to Slide 10, where you will see a more detailed summary of our financial performance for the quarter. As we had communicated throughout the fiscal year, adverse market conditions in certain end markets continue to negativel",1677,"Thanks, Steve. So now turning to Slide 10, where you will see a more detailed summary of our financial performance for the quarter. 
As we had communicated throughout the fiscal year, adverse market conditions in certain end markets continue to negatively impact certain of our businesses. As a result of these ongoing pressures, particularly in oil and gas, our revenue for the third quarter was $2.7 billion, which is down approximately 7% versus our third quarter last year. However, more positively, as Steve mentioned, our backlog now stands at $18.3 billion, which is up sequentially versus last quarter. 
I will make a few more comments on our backlog a little bit later in the presentation. 
In addition, our book-to-bill on a trailing 12-month basis was just under 1 at 0.96, which also extends to the positive sequential improvement seen last quarter. 
Meanwhile, our gross margin dollars for the quarter were $451 million, resulting in the highest absolute level in a quarter this year, continuing the positive sequential trend seen over the course of our 2016 fiscal year. 
The gross margin percentage also improved during the quarter to 16.8%, was 84 basis points sequentially and plus 10 basis points versus the year-ago quarter. Importantly, our gross margin percentage for our professional services business was also up sequentially and versus the year-ago quarter as well. It was also the highest since the fourth quarter of fiscal year '14. 
This is evidence of the increased focus of our teams to improve project execution. The benefits from our restructuring also continued to positively impact and contribute to the bottom line during the quarter, resulting in further reductions in G&A versus the year-ago period. Specifically, G&A was lower by $32 million versus the year-ago quarter and by $102 million on a year-to-date basis. Both are clear indications of our success in rightsizing the company and improving financial performance.
As a result, our adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $142 million, the highest level in fiscal year '16 and nearly flat versus the year-ago quarter. 
On an adjusted basis, EPS for the quarter was $0.78. This $0.78 figure is flat to last year's EPS figure when excluding the discrete tax benefit of $0.19 that was included in the year-ago quarter figure. 
Finally, as Steve also talked to, traction has been growing in our efforts to improve accounts receivable. The company's DSO levels reduced by 10 days versus the prior year quarter, while we still have further opportunities to reduce this. The improvement in accounts receivable helps support the reduction in operating working capital, down to $515 million, which is down $82 million sequentially versus last quarter and $192 million from the year-ago quarter. 
Operating working capital as a percent of the trailing 12-month has as a result, decreased 130 basis points versus same calculation a year ago, down to 4.5% of revenues from 5.8% last year. 
Free cash flow was obviously, therefore, strong, totaling $164 million during the quarter. And company's net -- the net, excuse me, cash position, ended at $128 million, up $101 million from the $27 million figure last quarter and up $259 million from the year-ago quarter.
So I'm moving on now to Slide 11. And you will see our total backlog stands at a combined $8.3 million previously [indiscernible], which is slightly up from our Q2 figure, a positive given the tough market conditions our sales teams continued to face in certain end markets. 
Of note, the $18.3 billion figure includes a negative foreign currency exchange and impact of $200 million versus our Q2 figures. Excluding the impact of these FX movements, our backlog actually grew sequentially by $300 million. 
Versus the year-ago figures, our backlog is down $500 million from the $18.8 billion year-ago figure to $18.3 billion. Again, a large portion of this reduction is also driven by foreign exchange movements. When adjusting for differences in foreign exchange versus the year-ago figure, our backlog on a constant currency basis would have been $18.7 billion, only slightly down versus the year-ago quarter. 
We are pleased with this performance, with general stability backlog across the portfolio versus last quarter. Even with the end market challenges facing our Petroleum & Chemicals business, the backlog for this LOB was relatively flat on a sequential basis. 
Our Aerospace & Technology business, which we believe continues to provide good growth opportunities, increased by the $200 million referenced by Steve earlier. 
Finally, our higher-margin professional services backlog actually grew by $500 million sequentially versus the last quarter and now represents $11.9 billion of total backlog. The remaining $6.4 billion represents our field services work, and it's sequentially down $400 million. The growth of professional services bodes well for momentum of the business going forward.
So turning to Slide 12. I'd like to talk a little bit about our Q3 adjusted segment financials for our 4 lines of business. As you can see, 3 of the 4 LOBs improved their adjusted segment operating profit and profit margin in the third quarter versus the year-ago period. Regarding Aerospace & Technology, while we did see some revenue decline versus the third quarter of '15, the adjusted segment operating profit versus the year-ago period, increased by 16% and is now up 5% for the 9 months year-to-date. Segment operating profit margin has also improved to 8% in the quarter, up 140 basis points versus the year-ago period. 
The improvement in the margin profile is driven both by strong performance fees realized in this year and by an overall improvement in the margin [indiscernible] of the business. 
Reduced performance piece -- fees in the short term could put some incremental pressure on sequential margins going forward. 
The B&I business also saw a revenue decline for the quarter versus the year-ago period, but adjusted segment operating profit improved by 21% and is up 9% for the 9 months year-to-date. As a result, segment operating profit margins were exceptionally strong in this quarter at 9.1%, up 210 basis points versus the year-ago period. For the year-to-date figure segment operating profit margin performance was also solid at 7.8%, up 110 basis points versus the last fiscal year period.
Despite pressures in the mining industry, revenue in the industrial line of business increased 12% versus the year-ago quarter, and led to a 32% increase in segment operating profit versus the year-ago quarter. 
Segment operating profit margin for the quarter was also up, and the 4% represented 60 basis (sic) [ 60 basis point ] improvement from the year-ago period. Growth in our life sciences businesses is driving the overall growth picture for this LOB. The improved margin this quarter from last is due to the elimination of the discrete items we discussed last quarter and our reported margin profile that we are showing this quarter is very much aligned with our expectations.
Lastly, our P&C line of business, Petroleum & Chemicals line of business, continued to face end market challenges as evidenced by the lower segment operating profit versus the year-ago quarter. Although the PC -- P&C segment operating profit margin for the quarter is down 40 basis points versus year ago, importantly, it is up 30 basis points from last quarter, a clear indication of the strong focus on cost reductions in the line of business and the benefits of the restructuring. 
 
Finally, our unallocated cost for the quarter remained aligned with our cost in the previous 2 quarters and represent a mix of cost elements, some of which are inherently predictable and some that are not. Note, just to continue the education process in terms of what we do have in these figures, these costs include acquisition-related expenses, including amortization of intangible assets, adjustments to employee fringe benefit programs, which include medical, pensions and other employee benefits; certain litigation costs, including defense and settlement expenditures; and margin adjustments on projects that are not related to LOB performance. 
Consistent with the first 2 quarters of the year, unallocated corporate cost totaled $19.5 million and are up year-over-year due to increased legal defense costs, fringe-related true-ups and expenses relating to our strategy work. 
In summary, the fact that 3 of our 4 LOBs are up year-over-year is a clear indication of the benefits of our diversity and our ability to deliver solid operating profit performance in a challenging environment.
So turning to Slide 13, a quick update at our structuring where we continue to be successful in reducing cost. Certainly, this is evidenced by the magnitude of our G&A reduction over the last few months. The restructuring effort to reduce our fixed cost infrastructure, primarily in labor and real estate, is nearing completion and our forecast remain in place. 
The total cost of our restructuring effort is expected in the $330 million to $350 million range through the fiscal year end, with expected gross savings of $240 million to $270 million. Please note, these figures include the most recent step we took to exit our French operations. 
As previously mentioned, some portion of these savings will be reinvested in the business to ensure we position ourselves for profitable growth in the long term. In summary, our actions are helping Jacobs to a increase profitability in a unchallenged economic environment, and we work -- look forward to seeing continued benefits going forward.
Moving to Slide 14, to provide a short update on our share buyback program. During the quarter, we continued to execute against our share buyback program in a balanced and steady manner. 
In Q3, we spent $30 million to repurchase 600,000 shares. Year-to-date, we have now spent a total of $102 million in share buybacks, and we expect to continue to spend the remainder of the $500 million share buyback authorization in a relatively consistent manner over the remaining term of the original 3-year program. Again, we'll continue to work through our strategic review. And our plan is to provide an update on our use of cash and capital structure and our strategy to review a day later this year. 
 
With that, let me hand it back over to Steve."

We continue to",580,"Thank you, Kevin. Turning to Slide 15. I'd like to spend a couple of minutes discussing on our continued focus on project delivery excellence, upgrading of company systems, tools and procedures and the development of our corporate strategy. We continue to focus on several initiatives to drive projects delivery excellence, and I'm pleased with the progress as reflected in our margin improvements. 
Project write-downs continued to decrease versus a year ago and use of our high-value India execution center is up 15% versus last year. We're implementing new project delivery standards across the 4 lines of business and developing upgraded and standardized tools to improve our project execution. One example of this quarter was the signing of an enterprise agreement with a major software provider to implement a standardized project cost control system, which will provide our project teams with the ability to more effectively manage full life cycle project cost in a single platform, lowering our costs and increasing our multi-office execution capability. 
Also, we're in the final stages of implementing an upgraded enterprise business platform that will deliver powerful analytics across the business and to the operational leaders. This includes our financial systems, business intelligence and analytics. By leveraging our scale, we'll be able to increase synergies to drive greater efficiency. While these changes involve a long-term transformation, many initiatives are underway and will be accelerated over the course of fiscal year 2017.
As Kevin pointed out, our company-wide restructuring efforts have continued to deliver significant cost reductions as we focus on optimizing our office footprint. Most recently, we announced the divestiture of our operations in France, which helped streamline our European business, and to refocus on higher-margin growth areas that provide the best returns for Jacobs and our shareholders.
As discussed during our recent earnings calls, we believe that developing and executing a profitable growth global strategy is necessary for Jacobs to deliver mid- and long-term industry shareholder value. 
We completed an initial review of our corporate strategy with our board in late July and have now moved into the phase of developing strategies for our 4 lines of business. To that end, we are finalizing plans for an Investor Day in late November.
Moving to the last slide, and while we're pleased with our third quarter, we expect challenging market conditions for at least the remainder of this year. 
Global uncertainty, compounded by weak growth in developed markets, the Brexit vote, the U.S. federal election and uncertain political environment in several countries, along with lower commodity prices, continue to impact some of our end markets. More positively we've begun to see a stabilization in our backlog, and we remain focused on driving improved margins. Our strategic review is progressing, and we're using early outcomes to adjust and refocus our business, where we see the most promising growth. We'll continue to evaluate, modify or refocus our portfolio for long-term sustainable shareholder value. 
In addition, the restructuring we've undertaken over the past several quarters continues to provide momentum and our strategic review is identifying additional opportunities to further reduce our internal cost and expenses. We're seeing improvements in our project delivery efforts, and write-offs continue to be reduced.
Finally, our performance year-to-date gives us an increased confidence that we will meet our objectives for the year and we're narrowing our fiscal year 2016 EPS guidance range to $2.95 to $3.15. 
With that, I'd like to thank you for listening, and we'll now open it up for questions. Operator?"

So is there anything unusual in the fourth quarter because obviously that has implications for how people are thinking about '17 and the sustainability of the cost savings that you guys are generating?

The first one as it relates to the sequential commentary relative to what our guidance is. Look, the guidance is -- we feel, is in appropriate level. We've narrowed it a bit. There still is volatility out in the space out there, you know about it, as it relates to certainly the Petroleum & Chemicals side of the business as well as just the general economic situation and some unease relative to elections and implications and so on, and so forth. So we just thought it's appropriate to do so. Regardless of that though, your comment as it relates to the sequential pieces, 2 comments I would make. The first is that typically this last quarter is a quarter that is generally impacted by a lower level of kind of billings because of the holiday periods in Europe and in the U.S. and so on, and so forth. So that's a general comment. So effectively, sequentially, we tend to open a levy down versus the third quarter. I think that's kind of a normal kind of dynamic over the course of the year, fourth quarter versus the first 3. The other point certainly is that as we think about going forward, continuing to invest in the savings to back -- to invest back again some of the savings, you heard about the aviation spend and some of the investments in support there. So as it relates to the savings initiatives, certainly take into account the fact that there will be some investments that will help offset some of that.

As we look at our mix of businesses and what's happened to the marketplace, we've been faced with a significantly declining backlog over the last couple of years in some of the heavy-fit commodity areas like mining and like upstream oil and gas. And the good news from our backlog standpoint is sort of all that decline now is essentially behind us because other than the new Rio Tinto project and some of our sustaining capital, et cetera, we've -- we don't see -- we really don't have much of a backlog as it relates to those heavy-margin areas. And what we've done we've been transitioning to expand our customer base away from -- in addition to the traditional customers we've had. And as we do that, that takes time to replenish and start building backlog in some of those growth areas. As I look at our lines of business, we should be able to soon grow backlog in Building & Infrastructure. It's an area that provides us growth. We have strong positions. We're very well diversified. We're not happy that our backlog has been flat. We should be able to do better. When we look at the downstream chemical side, we believe that over the next 12 to 18 to 24 months, you're going to see more and more of our Jacobs Petroleum & Chemicals backlog become that sector, and we think there's significant opportunities there. Now obviously, Aerospace & Technology is we are gaining success now in rebids and shifting to some new areas, especially in the U.S. We expect at some point, that, that should put points on the board from a backlog standpoint.

We want it to be profitable and result in incremental margin profile that it's able to be realized. So yes, there's certainly a mix benefit because of the dynamic you outlined, but when you look at the margin profile of each of the respective LOBs, you see a consistent theme where margins by the LOBs are also improving regardless of what percentage they make up of the total business.

And of course, combined with our focus on the working capital side, it ends up being capital-efficient growth as well. So I think you can see that there is both sides of the coin, which are helping us. One is the mix is in itself good, overall mix. But if you look by LOBs, we're also seeing improvements.

First is the one that -- if you look at our G&A over the course of the year, we're down $102 million versus year ago in the first 3 quarters of the year, and some of that is netted against some of the incremental investments that we're already making. So clearly there is a net benefit, which is clear relative to lower G&A figures. We expect that we should be able to continue to realize these benefits. Of course, over time we're going to have to invest in merits, we're going to have to invest in training and development of our people, and so there will be some offsets of that. The idea though of our strategy is not for when we get back to growth at our SG&A and our G&A figure is going to go up correspondingly with our growth in the gross margin dollars. That's what it's all about. It's about having the discipline when we start to see those gross that you get the growth leverage -- a better growth leverage relative to those incremental dollars. So I think of G&A more as fixed, and that we always got to try and figure out how to keep those numbers consistent and certainly growing less over the long haul with the gross margin growth, so you get the incremental leverage."

And so yes, we do believe we have a rich pipeline of opportunities, the strategic review is revealing that. We think we can continue to optimize our footprint in a way that can facilitate growth and at a much more efficient basis. When we compare what we start off in committing to, with regard to projects, and the margin that we should be getting that's agreed in our contracts and ultimately what we get at the end of the project, we've got significant opportunity to do better. And so with that all said, that should lead to margin improvement across all of our 4 lines of businesses as we pursue that. And so it's -- so we have not completed, by all means, our cost initiatives but we'd like to be moving from a restructuring basis to strategic improvement."

And I will tell you that we're not necessarily all the way where we wanted to be in terms of our targets for the year. So that in itself should indicate that we're continuing to drive for incremental benefits beyond where we are today. So that's the first point. I do believe that there will be, at some point in time, when we get to a more efficient kind of cash structure supporting our business, that the incremental cash flow dynamics will not be at the magnitude that we've had this year, obviously. The other dynamic that we certainly have to understand is that our business is not in a growth mode exactly right now, and there are implications on what cash flow dynamics go -- or occur during that particular period of time. So hopefully, we'll have a high-class problem when that pivot occurs, where we have profitable growth going forward. And then ultimately, if we're at the capital-efficient place that we would like to have, that will be translating into a good cash flow conversion going forward. But certainly the number for this quarter, for example, well above net income, is not a sustainable figure. But ultimately, we certainly would like to think that we're going to be able to have a really good solid conversion factor going forward."

As you know, our earnings announcement and Form 10-Q were released this morning, and we have posted a copy of this slide presentation to our website. We will reference this slide presentation in our prepared remarks. 
Before starting, I would like to refer you to our forward-looking statement, which is summarized on Slide 2. 
Any statements that we make today that are not based on historical fact are forward-looking statements. Although such statements are based on the current estimates and expectations and currently available competitive, financial and economic data, forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements as actual results may differ materially.
There are a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause Jacobs' actual results to differ materially from what may be contained, projected or implied by our forward-looking statements. For a description of some of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that may occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, see our most recent earnings release and quarterly report on Form 10-Q as well as our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended October 2, 2015, including Item 1, Business; Item 1A, Risk Factors; Item 3, Legal Proceedings; and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as well as other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
Please now turn to Slide 3 for a quick review of the agenda for today's call. Steve will begin our earnings presentation with some general comments on the business and our results for the last quarter, followed by a summary of market conditions for each of our 4 lines of business or LOBs. I will then provide some more in-depth discussion on our financial metrics, backlog and results for our LOBs. I will continue with some comments on our current restructuring efforts and our share buyback program. Steve will then discuss some steps -- some next steps for the company and focus on the progress of our strategy development before finishing with some closing comments. After, we will then open it up for some questions. 
Before turning over to Steve, I would like to highlight a recent change to our Board of Directors. As announced a few weeks ago, Noel Watson retired from his role as the Nonexecutive Chairman of the Jacobs Board. Steve Demetriou, our CEO, was appointed to the additional role of Chairman. We are extremely thankful to Noel for his service and dedication to Jacobs over the years, and are especially pleased he will continue to be a member of the Board.
With that, I will now pass it over to Chairman and CEO, Steve Demetriou."

Before I begin, I'd like to take the opportunity to personally thank Noel for his priceless guidance and support since my appointment as the Jacobs CEO in August of last year. As you all know, Noel led Jacobs to significant profitable growth, while serving as CEO from 1992 to 2006, and has been an amazingly valuable member of the Board since. I'm deeply honored to following in his footsteps as Chairman. With Noel's continued support, with Linda Levinson, our longest tenured independent board member, being named Lead Director, and with our highly experienced and diverse set of directors, Jacobs is well positioned to further the tradition of strong corporate governance.
Slide 4 is a summary of our fiscal year third quarter business performance. During the third quarter, global economic conditions posed continued challenges in certain end markets. Specifically, weak commodity prices such as crude oil, copper and iron ore have negatively impacted our oil and gas and mining sectors.  
Against this backdrop, we're pleased to report that our backlog at quarter end was $18.3 billion, up modestly versus last quarter. It is also very encouraging to see how our global business teams are successfully executing on our new strategic focus to upgrade our sales mix. 
Although third quarter revenue of $2.7 billion trended slightly down, this was more than offset by a significant increase in unit gross margin, which, at 16.8% of revenue, was the highest we have experienced since early 2015.
As we purposely shift to a more profitable mix of clients and markets, I'm confident that we'll soon see the combined benefit of a growing top line that generates higher margins.
We're also seeing the benefits of our increased focus on improving project delivery, not only in terms of quality in financial metrics, but based on an increasing trend in positive client feedback. 
Also in the third quarter, we continued to successfully rightsize Jacobs and relentlessly drive out cost across the company, resulting in a significant reduction of $102 million in G&A year-to-date versus 2015.
All in all, third quarter earnings came in at $0.78 per share, flat versus a year ago when excluding a one-time discrete tax benefit in the third quarter of fiscal year '15. 
I'm also very pleased with the improved working capital and cash flow performance. Year-over-year, operating working capital is down $192 million and DSO decreased 10 days versus last year. This capital efficiency was a key contributor to a strengthening of our already solid balance sheet, and we look forward to further improvement as our heightened focus on working capital delivers additional cash benefits.
Moving to Slide 5, and as we announced earlier this year, we're now managing the company by 4 global lines of business, or LOBs. The chart on this slide shows the breakout of revenues and adjusted segment operating profit by each LOB, excluding non-allocated corporate expenses. Kevin will cover more financial details on the LOBs, but here we provide insight into the differing economics of each business as it relates to the mix of profitability versus the top line. 
In summary, the strength of our Aerospace & Technology, Buildings & Infrastructure and certain higher-value industrial businesses demonstrate the importance of our diverse portfolio and why we're able to maintain profit stability during a period of very challenging macroeconomic pressures. 
Specifically, during the third quarter, we were able to see segment operating profit growth in 3 of our 4 lines of business versus a year ago. Of these, our industrial LOB showed the most improvement in segment operating profit, up 32% versus last year's third quarter. Followed by Buildings & Infrastructure and Aerospace & Technology up 21% and 16%, respectively. These improvements more than offset the challenges we faced in Petroleum & Chemicals, which was down 29% versus the year-ago quarter. 
Overall segment operating profit for the company was up 7% versus the year-ago quarter when excluding non-allocated corporate expenses.
Although we're not satisfied with Jacobs' bottom line results, we're pleased with the improvement in segment operating profit margins versus last year, a good indication of our efforts to drive a culture of greater accountability to achieve more profitable and higher-margin work.
Progressing to Slide 6, a summary of our Aerospace & Technology LOB, which continues to be a bright spot for Jacobs. 
This business covers a variety of clients and government agencies that range from NASA to the Department of Defense, U.K. Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and also the intelligence community. 
Backlog for the LOB grew by more than $200 million since last quarter and now stands at $5.1 billion. Importantly, the higher-margin professional services portion of this backlog increased over $300 million, with a favorable margin opportunity. 
In the near term, the customer programs we're supporting continue to receive stable funding and we expect that to continue in most of our key markets and geographies for the foreseeable future. This is somewhat mitigated by the ongoing trend towards small business set-asides, which we'll need to continue to work towards offsetting in our drive for profitable growth. 
As we have previously discussed, in this LOB, we're experiencing extended procurement cycles and award protests in our U.S. government services markets. However, the $250 million awarded but not in backlog mentioned last quarter, has been reduced to $140 million on the strength of several previous wins that have finally cleared the protest process. Additionally, in the U.S., we have won all of our major rebids awarded this fiscal year, and aerospace and defense remains healthy. 
Looking forward, we have a solid pipeline of new business opportunities and are targeting over $3 billion in total contract life cycle revenue prospects closing in the next 18 months.
Last quarter we announced the acquisition of Van Dyke Technology, which expanded our intelligence community and cybersecurity capabilities. We're targeting this strategic investment to drive additional growth, and we expect the Homeland Security, cyber and intelligence-related markets to remain strong for the foreseeable future. 
In addition to our traditional government clients, we're building momentum via collaboration with under Jacobs lines of business and are looking at opportunities to bring our IT and cyber capabilities to bear with our commercial-sector customers.
While the quarter was positive for our U.S.-based work, the recent Brexit vote is creating some uncertainty, specifically in the U.K. nuclear build sector. 
As previously discussed, we have already been awarded a major framework contract for the Hinkley Point C nuclear project, and we were pleased with the recent EDF Board final approval. The U.K. government has indicated they will make their decision in the fall. All indications are that all 3 nuclear build programs in the U.K. will continue forward even in light of the Brexit vote. We'll continue to closely monitor this. 
And the environmental sector is producing a solid pipeline for our Aerospace & Technology LOB. We're successfully maintaining our work with the U.S. government, while expanding into the commercial sector, including a framework agreement we signed with one of Jacobs' major traditional customers in the Petroleum & Chemicals LOB.
Turning to Slide 7, our Buildings & Infrastructure LOB was steady overall, with backlog largely flat at $4.8 billion versus last quarter and last year. 
We're experiencing growth in the health care industry driven by the dynamics of an aging population. In the corporate building sector, we remain focused on a select base of high-quality opportunities where we can leverage client relationships and synergies across 4 global lines of business. 
Our mission-critical services continues to grow and develop globally where there's an increased need for data systems and storage. We're continuing to work on projects with citywide strategies, and we're assisting the drive towards smart cities. We are active on several of these projects across the globe and expect significant opportunities for Jacobs as the Internet of Things drives interconnectivity across city-wide systems. 
In infrastructure, there's been an uptick in government real spending and several high-speed and light rail projects are moving forward in the U.S. 
Our 2015 acquisition of J.L. Patterson & Associates is supporting our efforts, particularly on the West Coast. The U.S. highway bill has provided increased spending confidence with most notable opportunities in areas where regional transportation packages exist such as Florida, Texas and California. 
In the U.K., increased government investment in infrastructure to drive economic development has been a positive, although the Brexit vote may impact us in the midterm. For the moment, most U.K. clients are saying it's business as usual, but we will continue to monitor this situation closely. 
In Australia, the federal and state governments are making strong investments in transportation, and we've had a number of positive highway and rail wins this year. 
Global aviation opportunities are growing, driven by aging airports, growth in passage of travel and increased spending programs. In the U.S. alone, projections are for more than $130 billion in investment over the next 10 years. To this end, we recently announced the strategic expansion of our global aviation practice, hiring several key individuals and appointing a global aviation business leader. 
We're excited about our recent win to support the $8 billion LaGuardia Airport redevelopment program. We're also in the midst of several large-scale aviation pursuits globally. 
We're also seeing investments in water-related infrastructure in the Middle East and there are major opportunities across Asia Pacific. The environmental market continues to grow globally as clients look to reduce costs through energy savings and increased sustainability practices. And we're seeing opportunities in Asia for power generation, specifically in the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia.
Finally, I'd like to mention that in June, Phil Stassi, who was most recently President of the Buildings & Infrastructure line of business, elected to retire after nearly 40 years with Jacobs. I'd like to take a moment to thank Phil for his leadership and significant contributions to Jacobs over his extensive career with the company and for all he did to help me in my first year at Jacobs. 
I'd also like to welcome Bob Pragada into this expanded role as President of the Buildings & Infrastructure LOB, and I'm excited about the strong leadership experience and strategic insight he will bring to the organization.
Moving to Slide 8, our industrial LOB backlog is at $3.2 billion. This is relatively flat compared to last quarter, but up more than $500 million compared to last year on the strength of our Life Science business and our recently announced EPCM contract to support Rio Tinto's Oyu Tolgoi Underground Platform Project in Mongolia. 
The mining and mineral sector continues to be significantly challenged as commodity prices remain under pressure, and most client projects are continuing to stall. A few potential large investments in the mining space are being broken up and parceled in order to spread out and conserve capital spending. However, as previously mentioned, we were successful in securing one of the only major projects in this industry. This was an exciting win and will have a positive effect on our industrial LOB as we move into 2017.
There continues to be a robust pipeline of work in our life sciences sector, primarily driven by regulatory approvals for next-generation therapies. Recent trends indicate significant future investment in both R&D facilities and manufacturing capacity, with geographic focus in Europe, Ireland and the U.S. There's a growing pipeline of new drug initiatives and the need for greater capacity is being accelerated as a result of several clients receiving regulatory approvals. 
Though we are the clear market leader in the biopharmaceutical space, we continue to grow market share through a strategic focus on sustaining capital opportunities, integrated project delivery and geographic expansion. We expect longer-term success from several of our early-phase design efforts on programs currently scheduled for next-wave manufacturing capacity expansions. 
Within our specialty chemicals and manufacturing sector, our Chemetics business is benefiting from our focus on sustaining capital programs supporting the fertilizer and mining industries. We're also working with certain clients to expand our project delivery scope beyond the traditional licensing model in order to participate in full EPC projects. 
Demand for our Comprimo technology in the oil and gas markets is also increasing with a recent uptick in project pursuits. Pulp and paper activity continues to be brisk, both in the U.S. as well as in emerging economies such as Russia, Brazil and Indonesia.
And although our backlog in field services had been relatively flat over the last several quarters, we're positive on the market outlook and the opportunities to grow. Specifically, our petrochemical customers in the U.S. Gulf Coast and our nuclear and defense clients in the U.K. have accelerated solicitations for integrated EPC programs to be executed in the 2017 and '18 time frame. 
Additionally, we have seen increase in opportunities as our customers look to drive down operating cost through supplier consolidation and productivity improvements. We're putting particular emphasis in the U.S. Gulf region, and we recently announced an expansion of our presence there, including a commitment to increase workforce training and development to meet our customers' needs.
And on Slide 9, the summary of our global Petroleum & Chemicals line of business. Weak global oil prices continue to negatively impact this LOB. After peaking in June at over $50, oil prices have been steadily declining and weakness is projected to continue through the second half of 2016. 
As a result, capital spending across the petroleum sector continues to be down significantly, with certain U.S. clients reducing their spend by more than 50% versus last year. 
With this backdrop, I'm very pleased that we've been able to stabilize and maintain our Petroleum & Chemicals backlog above $5 billion as we successfully focus on the downstream side of the industry where we see attractive opportunities. 
The upstream oil and gas sector is under the most severe pressure. Saudi Arabia and other national oil companies have kept with their decision to maintain market share. Consequently, oil production in the Middle East continues to rise. Our strong position in this region, especially in Saudi Arabia, has enabled us to selectively participate where capital is being spent. However, margins are under significant pressure due to heavy competition. 
Outside of the Middle East, high-cost producers are being squeezed, especially in the U.S. One of the only positive trends in this sector is the increased production of shale oil, condensates and natural gas liquids. Process and pipeline infrastructure need to be put in place to move these barrels to market, and this will be an area of continued focus for Jacobs. 
It should be noted that the upstream sector now represents less than 10% of our total Petroleum & Chemicals backlog, so the downside risk going forward is minimal.
Our refining business remains a positive, especially in maintenance, turnaround and sustaining capital projects. There's an increased focus on process safety and compliance. As a result of our JPro [ph] service, in which we offer our clients world-class process safety management, we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend. 
We're also seeing excellent opportunities as customers focus on octane improvement projects and butane disposition, which favors alkylation, a particular strength of ours. Refining demand in developing countries is expected to increase at more than 3% annually. We continue to see requests for feasibility and FEED studies in developing countries, in Asia and Africa, and we're looking beyond our traditional markets. We're expecting grassroots refining opportunities in India and South Asia as both regions continue to develop.
The chemicals market continues to provide a significant opportunity for Jacobs, and new sales bookings are up sequentially this year. We're seeing opportunities in propylene and ethylene derivatives, primarily on the U.S. Gulf Coast and Saudi Arabia. 
Meanwhile, crude oil to chemicals projects are seeing a heightened interest, particularly in the Middle East. Additionally, there's increased interest in diversification into value-added products with a move away from first-line commodity chemicals that are impacted by crude oil pricing trends. There's also good activity in energy efficiency and yield-improvement projects. Ethane, LPG and naphtha feedstocks are plentiful and relatively cheap, and may provide the economic incentives for project development. 
Overall, I'm particularly pleased with how the global Petroleum & Chemicals team has extended beyond our traditional customer base. The team is also expanding geographically and is building up the capability to selectively pursue and win fully integrated EPC opportunities. 
I'll now pass it back to Kevin to present more details on our financial results."
282159,376893947,1031869,"Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2016",2016-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Jacobs Solutions Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve.

As we have communicated throughout the fiscal year, adverse market conditions in certain end markets continue to nega",1684,"Thanks, Steve. So I'm now turning to Slide 10, where you will see a more detailed summary of our financial performance for the quarter. 
As we have communicated throughout the fiscal year, adverse market conditions in certain end markets continue to negatively impact certain of our businesses. As a result of these ongoing pressures, particularly in oil and gas, our revenue for the third quarter was $2.7 billion, which is down approximately 7% versus our third quarter last year. However, more positively, as Steve mentioned, our backlog now stands at $18.3 billion, which is up sequentially versus last quarter. 
I will make a few more comments on our backlog a little bit later in the presentation. 
In addition, our book-to-bill on a trailing 12-month basis was just under 1 at 0.96, which also extends the positive sequential improvement seen last quarter. 
Meanwhile, our gross margin dollars for the quarter were $451 million, resulting in the highest absolute level in a quarter this year, continuing the positive sequential trend seen over the course of our 2016 fiscal year. 
The gross margin percentage also improved during the quarter to 16.8%, plus 84 basis points sequentially and plus 10 basis points versus the year-ago quarter. Importantly, our gross margin percentage for our professional services business was also up sequentially and versus the year-ago quarter as well. It was also the highest since the fourth quarter of fiscal year '14. 
This is evidence of the increased focus of our teams to improve project execution. The benefits from our restructuring also continue to positively impact and contribute to the bottom line during the quarter, resulting in further reductions in G&A versus the year-ago period. Specifically, G&A was lower by $32 million versus the year-ago quarter and by $102 million on a year-to-date basis. Both are clear indications of our success in rightsizing the company and improving financial performance.
As a result, our adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $142 million, the highest level in fiscal year '16 and nearly flat versus the year-ago quarter. 
On an adjusted basis, EPS for the quarter was $0.78. This $0.78 figure is flat to last year's EPS figure when excluding the discrete tax benefit of $0.19 that was included in the year-ago quarter figure. 
Finally, as Steve also talked to, traction has been growing in our efforts to improve accounts receivable. The company's DSO levels reduced by 10 days versus the prior year quarter, while we still have further opportunities to reduce this. The improvement in accounts receivable helps support the reduction in operating working capital, down to $515 million, which is down $82 million sequentially versus last quarter and $192 million from the year-ago quarter. 
Operating working capital as a percent of the trailing 12-month has as a result, decreased 130 basis points versus same calculation a year ago, down to 4.5% of revenues from 5.8% last year. 
Free cash flow was obviously, therefore, strong, totaling $164 million during the quarter. And company's net -- the net, excuse me, cash position, ended at $128 million, up $101 million from the $27 million figure last quarter and up $259 million from the year-ago quarter.
So I'm moving on now to Slide 11. And you will see our total backlog stands at the combined $8.3 billion (sic) [ $18.3 billion ] previously referenced, which is slightly up from our Q2 figure, a positive given the tough market conditions our sales teams continued to face in certain end markets. 
Of note, the $18.3 billion figure includes a negative foreign currency exchange impact of $200 million versus our Q2 figures. Excluding the impact of these FX movements, our backlog actually grew sequentially by $300 million. 
Versus the year-ago figures, our backlog is down $500 million from the $18.8 billion year-ago figure to $18.3 billion. Again, a large portion of this reduction is also driven by foreign exchange movements. When adjusting for differences in foreign exchange versus the year-ago figure, our backlog on a constant currency basis would have been $18.7 billion, only slightly down versus the year-ago quarter. 
We are pleased with this performance, with general stability in backlog across the portfolio versus last quarter. Even with the end market challenges facing our Petroleum & Chemicals business, the backlog for this LOB was relatively flat on a sequential basis. 
Our Aerospace & Technology business, which we believe continues to provide good growth opportunities, increased by the $200 million referenced by Steve earlier. 
Finally, our higher-margin professional services backlog actually grew by $500 million sequentially versus the last quarter and now represents $11.9 billion of total backlog. The remaining $6.4 billion represents our field services work, and it's sequentially down $400 million. The growth of professional services bodes well for momentum of the business going forward.
So turning to Slide 12. I'd like to talk a little bit about our Q3 adjusted segment financials for our 4 lines of business. As you can see, 3 of the 4 LOBs improved their adjusted segment operating profit and profit margin in the third quarter versus the year-ago period. Regarding Aerospace & Technology, while we did see some revenue decline versus the third quarter of '15, the adjusted segment operating profit versus the year-ago period, increased by 16% and is now up 5% for the 9 months year-to-date. Segment operating profit margin has also improved to 8% in the quarter, up 140 basis points versus the year-ago period. 
The improvement in the margin profile is driven both by strong performance fees realized in this year and by an overall improvement in the margin mix of the business. 
Reduced performance fees in the short term could put some incremental pressure on sequential margins going forward. 
The B&I business also saw revenue decline for the quarter versus the year-ago period, but adjusted segment operating profit improved by 21% and is up 9% for the 9 months year-to-date. As a result, segment operating profit margins were exceptionally strong in this quarter at 9.1%, up 210 basis points versus the year-ago period. For the year-to-date figure segment, operating profit margin performance was also solid at 7.8%, up 110 basis points versus the last fiscal year period.
Despite pressures in the mining industry, revenue for the industrial line of business increased 12% versus the year-ago quarter and led to a 32% increase in segment operating profit versus the year-ago quarter. 
Segment operating profit margin for the quarter was also up, and at 4% represent a 60 basis (sic) [ 60 basis point ] improvement from the year-ago period. Growth in our life sciences business is driving the overall growth picture for this LOB. The improved margin this quarter from last is due to the elimination of the discrete items we discussed last quarter and our reported margin profile that we are showing this quarter is very much aligned with our expectations.
Lastly, our P&C line of business, Petroleum & Chemicals line of business, continued to face end market challenges as evidenced by the lower segment operating profit versus the year-ago quarter. Although the PC -- P&C segment operating profit margin for the quarter is down 40 basis points versus year ago, importantly, it is up 30 basis points from last quarter, a clear indication of the strong focus on cost reductions in the line of business and the benefits of the restructuring. 
 
Finally, our unallocated costs for the quarter remain aligned with our costs in the previous 2 quarters and represent a mix of cost elements, some of which are inherently predictable and some that are not. Note, just to continue the education process in terms of what we do have in these figures, these costs include acquisition-related expenses, including amortization of intangible assets, adjustments to employee fringe benefit programs, which include medical, pensions and other employee benefits; certain litigation costs, including defense and settlement expenditures; and margin adjustments on projects that are not related to LOB performance. 
Consistent with the first 2 quarters of the year, unallocated corporate cost totaled $19.5 million and are up year-over-year due to increased legal defense costs, French [ph] rate true-ups and expenses relating to our strategy work. 
In summary, the fact that 3 of our 4 LOBs are up year-over-year is a clear indication of the benefits of our diversity and our ability to deliver solid operating profit performance in a challenging environment.
So turning to Slide 13, a quick update on our structuring where we continue to be successful in reducing cost. Certainly, this is evidenced by the magnitude of our G&A reduction over the last few months. The restructuring effort to reduce our fixed cost infrastructure, primarily in labor and real estate, is nearing completion and our forecasts remain in place. 
The total cost of our restructuring effort is expected in the $330 million to $350 million range through the fiscal year end, with expected gross savings of $240 million to $270 million. Please note, these figures include the most recent step we took to exit our French operations. 
As previously mentioned, some portion of these savings will be reinvested in the business to ensure we position ourselves for profitable growth in the long term. In summary, our actions are helping Jacobs to an increased profitability in a challenged economic environment, and we work -- look forward to seeing continued benefits going forward.
Moving to Slide 14, to provide a short update on our share buyback program. During the quarter, we continued to execute against our share buyback program in a balanced and steady manner. 
In Q3, we spent $30 million to repurchase 600,000 shares. Year-to-date, we have now spent a total of $102 million in share buybacks, and we expect to continue to spend the remainder of the $500 million share buyback authorization in a relatively consistent manner over the remaining term of the original 3-year program. Again, we continue to work through our strategic review. And our plan is to provide an update on our use of cash and capital structure in our Strategy Review (sic) [ Investor ] day later this year. 
 
With that, let me hand it back over to Steve."

I'd like to spend a couple of minutes discussing our continued focus on project delivery excellence, upgrading of company systems, tools and procedures and the development of our corporate strategy. We continue to focus on several initiatives to drive projects delivery excellence, and I'm pleased with the progress as reflected in our margin improvements. 
Project write-downs continue to decrease versus a year ago, and use of our high-value India execution center is up 15% versus last year. We're implementing new project delivery standards across the 4 lines of business and developing upgraded and standardized tools to improve on project execution. One example of this quarter was the signing of an enterprise agreement with a major software provider to implement a standardized project cost control system, which will provide our project teams with the ability to more effectively manage full life cycle project costs in a single platform, lowering our costs and increasing our multi-office execution capability. 
Also, we're in the final stages of implementing an upgraded enterprise business platform that will deliver powerful analytics across the business and to the operational leaders. This includes our financial systems, business intelligence and analytics. By leveraging our scale, we'll be able to increase synergies to drive greater efficiency. While these changes involve a long-term transformation, many initiatives are underway and will be accelerated over the course of fiscal year 2017.
As Kevin pointed out, our company-wide restructuring efforts have continued to deliver significant cost reductions as we focus on optimizing our office footprint. Most recently, we announced the divestiture of our operations in France, which helped streamline our European business, and to refocus on higher-margin growth areas that provide the best returns for Jacobs and our shareholders.
As discussed during our recent earnings calls, we believe that developing and executing a profitable growth -- global strategy is necessary for Jacobs to deliver mid- and long-term industry shareholder value. 
We completed an initial review of our corporate strategy with our board in late July and have now moved into the phase of developing strategies for our 4 lines of business. To that end, we are finalizing plans for an Investor Day in late November.
Moving to the last slide, and while we're pleased with our third quarter, we expect challenging market conditions for at least the remainder of this year. 
Global uncertainty, compounded by weak growth in developed markets, the Brexit vote, the U.S. federal election, an uncertain political environment in several countries, along with lower commodity prices, continue to impact some of our end markets. More positively we've begun to see a stabilization in our backlog, and we remain focused on driving improved margins. Our strategic review is progressing, and we're using early outcomes to adjust and refocus our business where we see the most promising growth. We'll continue to evaluate, modify or refocus our portfolio for long-term sustainable shareholder value. 
In addition, the restructuring we've undertaken over the past several quarters continues to provide momentum and our strategic review is identifying additional opportunities to further reduce our internal cost and expenses. We're seeing improvements in our project delivery efforts, and write-offs continue to be reduced.
Finally, our performance year-to-date gives us an increased confidence that we will meet our objectives for the year and we're narrowing our fiscal year 2016 EPS guidance range to $2.95 to $3.15. 
With that, I'd like to thank you for listening, and we'll now open it up for questions. Operator?"

The first one as it relates to the sequential commentary relative to what our guidance is. Look, the guidance is -- we feel, is in appropriate level. We've narrowed it a bit. There still is volatility out in the space out there, you know about it, as it relates to certainly the Petroleum & Chemicals side of the business as well as just the general economic situation and some unease relative to elections and implications and so on, and so forth. So we just thought it appropriate to do so. Regardless of that though, your comment as it relates to the sequential pieces: 2 comments I would make. The first is that, typically, this last quarter is a quarter that is generally impacted by a lower level of kind of billings because of the holiday periods in Europe and in the U.S. and so on, and so forth. So that's a general comment. So effectively, sequentially, we tend to open the levy [ph] down versus the third quarter. I think that's kind of a normal kind of dynamic over the course of the year, fourth quarter versus the first 3. The other point, certainly, is that as we think about going forward, we're continuing to invest in the savings to back -- to invest back again some of the savings. You heard about the aviation spend and some of the investments in support there. So as it relates to the savings initiatives, certainly take into account the fact that there will be some investments that will help offset some of that -- will offset some of those savings opportunities."

As we look at our mix of businesses and what's happened in the marketplace, we've been faced with a significantly declining backlog over the last couple of years in some of the heavy-fit commodity areas like mining and like upstream oil and gas. And the good news from our backlog standpoint is sort of all that decline now is, essentially, behind us. Because other than the new Rio Tinto project and some of our sustaining capital, et cetera, we've -- we don't see -- we really don't have much in the backlog as it relates to those heavy-margin areas. And what we've done is been transitioning to expand our customer base away from -- in addition to the traditional customers we've had. And as we do that, that takes time to replenish and start building backlog in some of those growth areas. As I look at our lines of business, we should be able to soon grow backlog in Building & Infrastructure. It's an area that provides us growth. We have strong positions. We're very well diversified. We're not happy that our backlog has been flat. We should be able to do better. When we look at the downstream chemical side, we believe that over the next 12 to 18 to 24 months, you're going to see more and more of our Jacobs Petroleum & Chemicals backlog become that sector, and we think there's significant opportunities there. Now obviously, Aerospace & Technology as we are gaining success now in rebids and shifting to some new areas, especially in the U.S., we expect at some point, that, that should put points on the board from a backlog standpoint. So we're excited and encouraged about our opportunity to grow, and we just need to start demonstrating that over the near term."

It's very clear that as we think about how we want to drive our growth agenda going forward, we're not just thinking and talking about a top line figure.

And of course, there's varying degrees as it relates to mix of business and dynamics that we have to take into account, but it's not -- we're not just looking for growth for growth's sake. We want it to be profitable and result in incremental margin profile that it's able to be realized. So yes, there's certainly a mix benefit because of the dynamic you outlined. But when you look at the margin profile of each of the respective LOBs, you see a consistent theme where margins by the LOBs are also improving regardless of what percentage they make up of the total business. So I think that, that is indicative of the focus that, ultimately, we're trying to drive and which, I think, the LOBs are doing a great job on is, look, it's about a possible growth agenda that, ultimately, we're going to have to drive, which is the foundation of being able to drive incremental EPS longer term. And of course, combined with our focus on the working capital side, it ends up being capital-efficient growth as well. So I think you can see that there is both sides of the coin, which are helping us. One is the mix is in itself good, overall mix. But if you look by LOBs, we're also seeing improvements. So I think that bodes well for your comment about are we seeing some benefits. And I think that in intensely competitive environments, in which we are, we hope to be able to improve that.

Of course, over time we're going to have to invest in merits, we're going to have to invest in training and development of our people, and so there will be some offsets of that. The idea though of our strategy is not for when we get back to growth that our SG&A and our G&A figures are going to go up correspondingly with our growth in the gross margin dollars. That's what it's all about. It's about having the discipline when we start to see those gross that you get the growth leverage -- a better growth leverage relative to those incremental dollars. So I think of G&A more as fixed, in that we always got to try and figure out how to keep those numbers consistent and certainly growing less over the long haul with the gross margin growth, so you get the incremental leverage."

I will say just to quantify what our expectations are maybe a little bit more. We set established targets for each of our lines of business and for ourselves at the corporate level at the beginning of the year, and we're driving towards figures. And I will tell you that we're not necessarily all the way where we wanted to be in terms of our targets for the year. So that in itself should indicate that we're continuing to drive for incremental benefits beyond where we are today. So that's the first point. I do believe that there will be, at some point in time, when we get to a more efficient kind of cash structure supporting our business, that the incremental cash flow dynamics will not be at the magnitude that we've had this year, obviously. The other dynamic that we certainly have to understand is that our business is not in a growth mode exactly right now, and there are implications on what cash flow dynamics go -- occur during that particular period of time. So hopefully, we'll have a high-class problem when that pivot occurs, where we have profitable growth going forward. And then ultimately, if we're at the capital-efficient place that we would like to have, that will be translating into a good cash flow conversion going forward. But certainly the number for this quarter, for example, well above net income, is not a sustainable figure. But ultimately, we certainly would like to think that we're going to be able to have a really good solid conversion factor going forward."

As you know, our earnings announcement and Form 10-Q were released this morning, and we have posted a copy of this slide presentation to our website. We will reference this slide presentation in our prepared remarks. 
Before starting, I would like to refer you to our forward-looking statement, which is summarized on Slide 2. 
Any statements that we make today that are not based on historical fact are forward-looking statements. Although such statements are based on the current estimates and expectations and currently available competitive, financial and economic data, forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements as actual results may differ materially.
There are a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause Jacobs' actual results to differ materially from what may be contained, projected or implied by our forward-looking statements. For a description of some of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that may occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, see our most recent earnings release and quarterly report on Form 10-Q as well as our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended October 2, 2015, including Item 1, Business; Item 1A, Risk Factors; Item 3, Legal Proceedings; and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as well as other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
Please now turn to Slide 3 for a quick review of the agenda for today's call. Steve will begin our earnings presentation with some general comments on the business and our results for the last quarter, followed by a summary of market conditions for each of our 4 lines of business or LOBs. I will then provide some more in-depth discussion on our financial metrics, backlog and results for our LOBs. I will continue with some comments on our current restructuring efforts and our share buyback program. Steve will then discuss some steps -- some next steps for the company and focus on the progress of our strategy development before finishing with some closing comments. After, we will then open it up for some questions. 
Before turning over to Steve, I would like to highlight a recent change to our Board of Directors. As announced a few weeks ago, Noel Watson retired from his role as the Nonexecutive Chairman of the Jacobs Board. Steve Demetriou, our CEO, was appointed to the additional role of Chairman. We are extremely thankful to Noel for his service and dedication to Jacobs over the years, and are especially pleased he will continue to be a member of the Board.
With that, I will now pass it over to Chairman and CEO, Steve Demetriou."
282159,376893947,1032332,"Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2016",2016-08-09,"Earnings Calls","Jacobs Solutions Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to our fiscal year 2016 third quarter earnings call.Before I begin, I'd like to take the opportunity to personally thank Noel for his priceless guidance and support since my appointment as the Jacobs CEO in August of last y",2740,"Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to our fiscal year 2016 third quarter earnings call.
Before I begin, I'd like to take the opportunity to personally thank Noel for his priceless guidance and support since my appointment as the Jacobs CEO in August of last year. As you all know, Noel led Jacobs to significant profitable growth, while serving as CEO from 1992 to 2006, and has been an amazingly valuable member of the Board since. I'm deeply honored to following in his footsteps as Chairman. With Noel's continued support, with Linda Levinson, our longest tenured independent board member, being named Lead Director, and with our highly experienced and diverse set of directors, Jacobs is well positioned to further the tradition of strong corporate governance.
Slide 4 is a summary of our fiscal year third quarter business performance. During the third quarter, global economic conditions posed continued challenges in certain end markets. Specifically, weak commodity prices such as crude oil, copper and iron ore have negatively impacted our oil and gas and mining sectors.  
Against this backdrop, we're pleased to report that our backlog at quarter end was $18.3 billion, up modestly versus last quarter. It is also very encouraging to see how our global business teams are successfully executing on our new strategic focus to upgrade our sales mix. 
Although third quarter revenue of $2.7 billion trended slightly down, this was more than offset by a significant increase in unit gross margin, which, at 16.8% of revenue, was the highest we have experienced since early 2015.
As we purposely shift to a more profitable mix of clients and markets, I'm confident that we'll soon see the combined benefit of a growing top line that generates higher margins.
We're also seeing the benefits of our increased focus on improving project delivery, not only in terms of quality in financial metrics, but based on an increasing trend in positive client feedback. 
Also in the third quarter, we continued to successfully rightsize Jacobs and relentlessly drive out cost across the company, resulting in a significant reduction of $102 million in G&A year-to-date versus 2015.
All in all, third quarter earnings came in at $0.78 per share, flat versus a year ago when excluding a one-time discrete tax benefit in the third quarter of fiscal year '15. 
I'm also very pleased with the improved working capital and cash flow performance. Year-over-year, operating working capital is down $192 million and DSO decreased 10 days versus last year. This capital efficiency was a key contributor to a strengthening of our already solid balance sheet, and we look forward to further improvement as our heightened focus on working capital delivers additional cash benefits.
Moving to Slide 5, and as we announced earlier this year, we're now managing the company by 4 global lines of business, or LOBs. The chart on this slide shows the breakout of revenues and adjusted segment operating profit by each LOB, excluding non-allocated corporate expenses. Kevin will cover more financial details on the LOBs, but here we provide insight into the differing economics of each business as it relates to the mix of profitability versus the top line. 
In summary, the strength of our Aerospace & Technology, Buildings & Infrastructure and certain higher-value industrial businesses demonstrate the importance of our diverse portfolio and why we're able to maintain profit stability during a period of very challenging macroeconomic pressures. 
Specifically, during the third quarter, we were able to see segment operating profit growth in 3 of our 4 lines of business versus a year ago. Of these, our industrial LOB showed the most improvement in segment operating profit, up 32% versus last year's third quarter. Followed by Buildings & Infrastructure and Aerospace & Technology up 21% and 16%, respectively. These improvements more than offset the challenges we faced in Petroleum & Chemicals, which was down 29% versus the year-ago quarter. 
Overall segment operating profit for the company was up 7% versus the year-ago quarter when excluding non-allocated corporate expenses.
Although we're not satisfied with Jacobs' bottom line results, we're pleased with the improvement in segment operating profit margins versus last year, a good indication of our efforts to drive a culture of greater accountability to achieve more profitable and higher-margin work.
Progressing to Slide 6, a summary of our Aerospace & Technology LOB, which continues to be a bright spot for Jacobs. 
This business covers a variety of clients and government agencies that range from NASA to the Department of Defense, U.K. Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and also the intelligence community. 
Backlog for the LOB grew by more than $200 million since last quarter and now stands at $5.1 billion. Importantly, the higher-margin professional services portion of this backlog increased over $300 million, with a favorable margin opportunity. 
In the near term, the customer programs we're supporting continue to receive stable funding and we expect that to continue in most of our key markets and geographies for the foreseeable future. This is somewhat mitigated by the ongoing trend towards small business set-asides, which we'll need to continue to work towards offsetting in our drive for profitable growth. 
As we have previously discussed, in this LOB, we're experiencing extended procurement cycles and award protests in our U.S. government services markets. However, the $250 million awarded but not in backlog mentioned last quarter, has been reduced to $140 million on the strength of several previous wins that have finally cleared the protest process. Additionally, in the U.S., we have won all of our major rebids awarded this fiscal year, and aerospace and defense remains healthy. 
Looking forward, we have a solid pipeline of new business opportunities and are targeting over $3 billion in total contract life cycle revenue prospects closing in the next 18 months.
Last quarter we announced the acquisition of Van Dyke Technology, which expanded our intelligence community and cybersecurity capabilities. We're targeting this strategic investment to drive additional growth, and we expect the Homeland Security, cyber and intelligence-related markets to remain strong for the foreseeable future. 
In addition to our traditional government clients, we're building momentum via collaboration with under Jacobs lines of business and are looking at opportunities to bring our IT and cyber capabilities to bear with our commercial-sector customers.
While the quarter was positive for our U.S.-based work, the recent Brexit vote is creating some uncertainty, specifically in the U.K. nuclear build sector. 
As previously discussed, we have already been awarded a major framework contract for the Hinkley Point C nuclear project, and we were pleased with the recent EDF Board final approval. The U.K. government has indicated they will make their decision in the fall. All indications are that all 3 nuclear build programs in the U.K. will continue forward even in light of the Brexit vote. We'll continue to closely monitor this. 
And the environmental sector is producing a solid pipeline for our Aerospace & Technology LOB. We're successfully maintaining our work with the U.S. government, while expanding into the commercial sector, including a framework agreement we signed with one of Jacobs' major traditional customers in the Petroleum & Chemicals LOB.
Turning to Slide 7, our Buildings & Infrastructure LOB was steady overall, with backlog largely flat at $4.8 billion versus last quarter and last year. 
We're experiencing growth in the health care industry driven by the dynamics of an aging population. In the corporate building sector, we remain focused on a select base of high-quality opportunities where we can leverage client relationships and synergies across 4 global lines of business. 
Our mission-critical services continues to grow and develop globally where there's an increased need for data systems and storage. We're continuing to work on projects with citywide strategies, and we're assisting the drive towards smart cities. We are active on several of these projects across the globe and expect significant opportunities for Jacobs as the Internet of Things drives interconnectivity across city-wide systems. 
In infrastructure, there's been an uptick in government real spending and several high-speed and light rail projects are moving forward in the U.S. 
Our 2015 acquisition of J.L. Patterson & Associates is supporting our efforts, particularly on the West Coast. The U.S. highway bill has provided increased spending confidence with most notable opportunities in areas where regional transportation packages exist such as Florida, Texas and California. 
In the U.K., increased government investment in infrastructure to drive economic development has been a positive, although the Brexit vote may impact us in the midterm. For the moment, most U.K. clients are saying it's business as usual, but we will continue to monitor this situation closely. 
In Australia, the federal and state governments are making strong investments in transportation, and we've had a number of positive highway and rail wins this year. 
Global aviation opportunities are growing, driven by aging airports, growth in passage of travel and increased spending programs. In the U.S. alone, projections are for more than $130 billion in investment over the next 10 years. To this end, we recently announced the strategic expansion of our global aviation practice, hiring several key individuals and appointing a global aviation business leader. 
We're excited about our recent win to support the $8 billion LaGuardia Airport redevelopment program. We're also in the midst of several large-scale aviation pursuits globally. 
We're also seeing investments in water-related infrastructure in the Middle East and there are major opportunities across Asia Pacific. The environmental market continues to grow globally as clients look to reduce costs through energy savings and increased sustainability practices. And we're seeing opportunities in Asia for power generation, specifically in the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia.
Finally, I'd like to mention that in June, Phil Stassi, who was most recently President of the Buildings & Infrastructure line of business, elected to retire after nearly 40 years with Jacobs. I'd like to take a moment to thank Phil for his leadership and significant contributions to Jacobs over his extensive career with the company and for all he did to help me in my first year at Jacobs. 
I'd also like to welcome Bob Pragada into this expanded role as President of the Buildings & Infrastructure LOB, and I'm excited about the strong leadership experience and strategic insight he will bring to the organization.
Moving to Slide 8, our industrial LOB backlog is at $3.2 billion. This is relatively flat compared to last quarter, but up more than $500 million compared to last year on the strength of our Life Science business and our recently announced EPCM contract to support Rio Tinto's Oyu Tolgoi Underground Platform Project in Mongolia. 
The mining and mineral sector continues to be significantly challenged as commodity prices remain under pressure, and most client projects are continuing to stall. A few potential large investments in the mining space are being broken up and parceled in order to spread out and conserve capital spending. However, as previously mentioned, we were successful in securing one of the only major projects in this industry. This was an exciting win and will have a positive effect on our industrial LOB as we move into 2017.
There continues to be a robust pipeline of work in our life sciences sector, primarily driven by regulatory approvals for next-generation therapies. Recent trends indicate significant future investment in both R&D facilities and manufacturing capacity, with geographic focus in Europe, Ireland and the U.S. There's a growing pipeline of new drug initiatives and the need for greater capacity is being accelerated as a result of several clients receiving regulatory approvals. 
Though we are the clear market leader in the biopharmaceutical space, we continue to grow market share through a strategic focus on sustaining capital opportunities, integrated project delivery and geographic expansion. We expect longer-term success from several of our early-phase design efforts on programs currently scheduled for next-wave manufacturing capacity expansions. 
Within our specialty chemicals and manufacturing sector, our Chemetics business is benefiting from our focus on sustaining capital programs supporting the fertilizer and mining industries. We're also working with certain clients to expand our project delivery scope beyond the traditional licensing model in order to participate in full EPC projects. 
Demand for our Comprimo technology in the oil and gas markets is also increasing with a recent uptick in project pursuits. Pulp and paper activity continues to be brisk, both in the U.S. as well as in emerging economies such as Russia, Brazil and Indonesia.
And although our backlog in field services had been relatively flat over the last several quarters, we're positive on the market outlook and the opportunities to grow. Specifically, our petrochemical customers in the U.S. Gulf Coast and our nuclear and defense clients in the U.K. have accelerated solicitations for integrated EPC programs to be executed in the 2017 and '18 time frame. 
Additionally, we have seen increase in opportunities as our customers look to drive down operating cost through supplier consolidation and productivity improvements. We're putting particular emphasis in the U.S. Gulf region, and we recently announced an expansion of our presence there, including a commitment to increase workforce training and development to meet our customers' needs.
And on Slide 9, the summary of our global Petroleum & Chemicals line of business. Weak global oil prices continue to negatively impact this LOB. After peaking in June at over $50, oil prices have been steadily declining and weakness is projected to continue through the second half of 2016. 
As a result, capital spending across the petroleum sector continues to be down significantly, with certain U.S. clients reducing their spend by more than 50% versus last year. 
With this backdrop, I'm very pleased that we've been able to stabilize and maintain our Petroleum & Chemicals backlog above $5 billion as we successfully focus on the downstream side of the industry where we see attractive opportunities. 
The upstream oil and gas sector is under the most severe pressure. Saudi Arabia and other national oil companies have kept with their decision to maintain market share. Consequently, oil production in the Middle East continues to rise. Our strong position in this region, especially in Saudi Arabia, has enabled us to selectively participate where capital is being spent. However, margins are under significant pressure due to heavy competition. 
Outside of the Middle East, high-cost producers are being squeezed, especially in the U.S. One of the only positive trends in this sector is the increased production of shale oil, condensates and natural gas liquids. Process and pipeline infrastructure need to be put in place to move these barrels to market, and this will be an area of continued focus for Jacobs. 
It should be noted that the upstream sector now represents less than 10% of our total Petroleum & Chemicals backlog, so the downside risk going forward is minimal.
Our refining business remains a positive, especially in maintenance, turnaround and sustaining capital projects. There's an increased focus on process safety and compliance. As a result of our JPro [ph] service, in which we offer our clients world-class process safety management, we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend. 
We're also seeing excellent opportunities as customers focus on octane improvement projects and butane disposition, which favors alkylation, a particular strength of ours. Refining demand in developing countries is expected to increase at more than 3% annually. We continue to see requests for feasibility and FEED studies in developing countries, in Asia and Africa, and we're looking beyond our traditional markets. We're expecting grassroots refining opportunities in India and South Asia as both regions continue to develop.
The chemicals market continues to provide a significant opportunity for Jacobs, and new sales bookings are up sequentially this year. We're seeing opportunities in propylene and ethylene derivatives, primarily on the U.S. Gulf Coast and Saudi Arabia. 
Meanwhile, crude oil to chemicals projects are seeing a heightened interest, particularly in the Middle East. Additionally, there's increased interest in diversification into value-added products with a move away from first-line commodity chemicals that are impacted by crude oil pricing trends. There's also good activity in energy efficiency and yield-improvement projects. Ethane, LPG and naphtha feedstocks are plentiful and relatively cheap, and may provide the economic incentives for project development. 
Overall, I'm particularly pleased with how the global Petroleum & Chemicals team has extended beyond our traditional customer base. The team is also expanding geographically and is building up the capability to selectively pursue and win fully integrated EPC opportunities. 
I'll now pass it back to Kevin to present more details on our financial results."

As we have communicated throughout the fiscal year, adverse market conditions in certain end markets continue to nega",1684,"Thanks, Steve. So I'm now turning to Slide 10, where you will see a more detailed summary of our financial performance for the quarter. 
As we have communicated throughout the fiscal year, adverse market conditions in certain end markets continue to negatively impact certain of our businesses. As a result of these ongoing pressures, particularly in oil and gas, our revenue for the third quarter was $2.7 billion, which is down approximately 7% versus our third quarter last year. However, more positively, as Steve mentioned, our backlog now stands at $18.3 billion, which is up sequentially versus last quarter. 
I will make a few more comments on our backlog a little bit later in the presentation. 
In addition, our book-to-bill on a trailing 12-month basis was just under 1 at 0.96, which also extends the positive sequential improvement seen last quarter. 
Meanwhile, our gross margin dollars for the quarter were $451 million, resulting in the highest absolute level in a quarter this year, continuing the positive sequential trend seen over the course of our 2016 fiscal year. 
The gross margin percentage also improved during the quarter to 16.8%, plus 84 basis points sequentially and plus 10 basis points versus the year-ago quarter. Importantly, our gross margin percentage for our professional services business was also up sequentially and versus the year-ago quarter as well. It was also the highest since the fourth quarter of fiscal year '14. 
This is evidence of the increased focus of our teams to improve project execution. The benefits from our restructuring also continue to positively impact and contribute to the bottom line during the quarter, resulting in further reductions in G&A versus the year-ago period. Specifically, G&A was lower by $32 million versus the year-ago quarter and by $102 million on a year-to-date basis. Both are clear indications of our success in rightsizing the company and improving financial performance.
As a result, our adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $142 million, the highest level in fiscal year '16 and nearly flat versus the year-ago quarter. 
On an adjusted basis, EPS for the quarter was $0.78. This $0.78 figure is flat to last year's EPS figure when excluding the discrete tax benefit of $0.19 that was included in the year-ago quarter figure. 
Finally, as Steve also talked to, traction has been growing in our efforts to improve accounts receivable. The company's DSO levels reduced by 10 days versus the prior year quarter, while we still have further opportunities to reduce this. The improvement in accounts receivable helps support the reduction in operating working capital, down to $515 million, which is down $82 million sequentially versus last quarter and $192 million from the year-ago quarter. 
Operating working capital as a percent of the trailing 12-month has as a result, decreased 130 basis points versus same calculation a year ago, down to 4.5% of revenues from 5.8% last year. 
Free cash flow was obviously, therefore, strong, totaling $164 million during the quarter. And company's net -- the net, excuse me, cash position, ended at $128 million, up $101 million from the $27 million figure last quarter and up $259 million from the year-ago quarter.
So I'm moving on now to Slide 11. And you will see our total backlog stands at the combined $8.3 billion (sic) [ $18.3 billion ] previously referenced, which is slightly up from our Q2 figure, a positive given the tough market conditions our sales teams continued to face in certain end markets. 
Of note, the $18.3 billion figure includes a negative foreign currency exchange impact of $200 million versus our Q2 figures. Excluding the impact of these FX movements, our backlog actually grew sequentially by $300 million. 
Versus the year-ago figures, our backlog is down $500 million from the $18.8 billion year-ago figure to $18.3 billion. Again, a large portion of this reduction is also driven by foreign exchange movements. When adjusting for differences in foreign exchange versus the year-ago figure, our backlog on a constant currency basis would have been $18.7 billion, only slightly down versus the year-ago quarter. 
We are pleased with this performance, with general stability in backlog across the portfolio versus last quarter. Even with the end market challenges facing our Petroleum & Chemicals business, the backlog for this LOB was relatively flat on a sequential basis. 
Our Aerospace & Technology business, which we believe continues to provide good growth opportunities, increased by the $200 million referenced by Steve earlier. 
Finally, our higher-margin professional services backlog actually grew by $500 million sequentially versus the last quarter and now represents $11.9 billion of total backlog. The remaining $6.4 billion represents our field services work, and it's sequentially down $400 million. The growth of professional services bodes well for momentum of the business going forward.
So turning to Slide 12. I'd like to talk a little bit about our Q3 adjusted segment financials for our 4 lines of business. As you can see, 3 of the 4 LOBs improved their adjusted segment operating profit and profit margin in the third quarter versus the year-ago period. Regarding Aerospace & Technology, while we did see some revenue decline versus the third quarter of '15, the adjusted segment operating profit versus the year-ago period, increased by 16% and is now up 5% for the 9 months year-to-date. Segment operating profit margin has also improved to 8% in the quarter, up 140 basis points versus the year-ago period. 
The improvement in the margin profile is driven both by strong performance fees realized in this year and by an overall improvement in the margin mix of the business. 
Reduced performance fees in the short term could put some incremental pressure on sequential margins going forward. 
The B&I business also saw revenue decline for the quarter versus the year-ago period, but adjusted segment operating profit improved by 21% and is up 9% for the 9 months year-to-date. As a result, segment operating profit margins were exceptionally strong in this quarter at 9.1%, up 210 basis points versus the year-ago period. For the year-to-date figure segment, operating profit margin performance was also solid at 7.8%, up 110 basis points versus the last fiscal year period.
Despite pressures in the mining industry, revenue for the industrial line of business increased 12% versus the year-ago quarter and led to a 32% increase in segment operating profit versus the year-ago quarter. 
Segment operating profit margin for the quarter was also up, and at 4% represent a 60 basis (sic) [ 60 basis point ] improvement from the year-ago period. Growth in our life sciences business is driving the overall growth picture for this LOB. The improved margin this quarter from last is due to the elimination of the discrete items we discussed last quarter and our reported margin profile that we are showing this quarter is very much aligned with our expectations.
Lastly, our P&C line of business, Petroleum & Chemicals line of business, continued to face end market challenges as evidenced by the lower segment operating profit versus the year-ago quarter. Although the PC -- P&C segment operating profit margin for the quarter is down 40 basis points versus year ago, importantly, it is up 30 basis points from last quarter, a clear indication of the strong focus on cost reductions in the line of business and the benefits of the restructuring. 
 
Finally, our unallocated costs for the quarter remain aligned with our costs in the previous 2 quarters and represent a mix of cost elements, some of which are inherently predictable and some that are not. Note, just to continue the education process in terms of what we do have in these figures, these costs include acquisition-related expenses, including amortization of intangible assets, adjustments to employee fringe benefit programs, which include medical, pensions and other employee benefits; certain litigation costs, including defense and settlement expenditures; and margin adjustments on projects that are not related to LOB performance. 
Consistent with the first 2 quarters of the year, unallocated corporate cost totaled $19.5 million and are up year-over-year due to increased legal defense costs, French [ph] rate true-ups and expenses relating to our strategy work. 
In summary, the fact that 3 of our 4 LOBs are up year-over-year is a clear indication of the benefits of our diversity and our ability to deliver solid operating profit performance in a challenging environment.
So turning to Slide 13, a quick update on our structuring where we continue to be successful in reducing cost. Certainly, this is evidenced by the magnitude of our G&A reduction over the last few months. The restructuring effort to reduce our fixed cost infrastructure, primarily in labor and real estate, is nearing completion and our forecasts remain in place. 
The total cost of our restructuring effort is expected in the $330 million to $350 million range through the fiscal year end, with expected gross savings of $240 million to $270 million. Please note, these figures include the most recent step we took to exit our French operations. 
As previously mentioned, some portion of these savings will be reinvested in the business to ensure we position ourselves for profitable growth in the long term. In summary, our actions are helping Jacobs to an increased profitability in a challenged economic environment, and we work -- look forward to seeing continued benefits going forward.
Moving to Slide 14, to provide a short update on our share buyback program. During the quarter, we continued to execute against our share buyback program in a balanced and steady manner. 
In Q3, we spent $30 million to repurchase 600,000 shares. Year-to-date, we have now spent a total of $102 million in share buybacks, and we expect to continue to spend the remainder of the $500 million share buyback authorization in a relatively consistent manner over the remaining term of the original 3-year program. Again, we continue to work through our strategic review. And our plan is to provide an update on our use of cash and capital structure in our Strategy Review (sic) [ Investor ] day later this year. 
 
With that, let me hand it back over to Steve."

I'd like to spend a couple of minutes discussing our continued focus on project delivery excellence, upgrading of company systems, tools and procedures and the development of our corporate strategy. We continue to focus on several initiatives to drive projects delivery excellence, and I'm pleased with the progress as reflected in our margin improvements. 
Project write-downs continue to decrease versus a year ago, and use of our high-value India execution center is up 15% versus last year. We're implementing new project delivery standards across the 4 lines of business and developing upgraded and standardized tools to improve on project execution. One example of this quarter was the signing of an enterprise agreement with a major software provider to implement a standardized project cost control system, which will provide our project teams with the ability to more effectively manage full life cycle project costs in a single platform, lowering our costs and increasing our multi-office execution capability. 
Also, we're in the final stages of implementing an upgraded enterprise business platform that will deliver powerful analytics across the business and to the operational leaders. This includes our financial systems, business intelligence and analytics. By leveraging our scale, we'll be able to increase synergies to drive greater efficiency. While these changes involve a long-term transformation, many initiatives are underway and will be accelerated over the course of fiscal year 2017.
As Kevin pointed out, our company-wide restructuring efforts have continued to deliver significant cost reductions as we focus on optimizing our office footprint. Most recently, we announced the divestiture of our operations in France, which helped streamline our European business, and to refocus on higher-margin growth areas that provide the best returns for Jacobs and our shareholders.
As discussed during our recent earnings calls, we believe that developing and executing a profitable growth -- global strategy is necessary for Jacobs to deliver mid- and long-term industry shareholder value. 
We completed an initial review of our corporate strategy with our board in late July and have now moved into the phase of developing strategies for our 4 lines of business. To that end, we are finalizing plans for an Investor Day in late November.
Moving to the last slide, and while we're pleased with our third quarter, we expect challenging market conditions for at least the remainder of this year. 
Global uncertainty, compounded by weak growth in developed markets, the Brexit vote, the U.S. federal election, an uncertain political environment in several countries, along with lower commodity prices, continue to impact some of our end markets. More positively we've begun to see a stabilization in our backlog, and we remain focused on driving improved margins. Our strategic review is progressing, and we're using early outcomes to adjust and refocus our business where we see the most promising growth. We'll continue to evaluate, modify or refocus our portfolio for long-term sustainable shareholder value. 
In addition, the restructuring we've undertaken over the past several quarters continues to provide momentum and our strategic review is identifying additional opportunities to further reduce our internal cost and expenses. We're seeing improvements in our project delivery efforts, and write-offs continue to be reduced.
Finally, our performance year-to-date gives us an increased confidence that we will meet our objectives for the year and we're narrowing our fiscal year 2016 EPS guidance range to $2.95 to $3.15. 
With that, I'd like to thank you for listening, and we'll now open it up for questions. Operator?"

So is there anything unusual in the fourth quarter? Because obviously that has implications for how people are thinking about '17 and the sustainability of the cost savings that you guys are generating.

So we just thought it appropriate to do so. Regardless of that though, your comment as it relates to the sequential pieces: 2 comments I would make. The first is that, typically, this last quarter is a quarter that is generally impacted by a lower level of kind of billings because of the holiday periods in Europe and in the U.S. and so on, and so forth. So that's a general comment. So effectively, sequentially, we tend to open the levy [ph] down versus the third quarter. I think that's kind of a normal kind of dynamic over the course of the year, fourth quarter versus the first 3. The other point, certainly, is that as we think about going forward, we're continuing to invest in the savings to back -- to invest back again some of the savings. You heard about the aviation spend and some of the investments in support there. So as it relates to the savings initiatives, certainly take into account the fact that there will be some investments that will help offset some of that -- will offset some of those savings opportunities."

And certain end markets and certain LOBs are going to have more of an opportunity to do that than others based on the external dynamics.

As we look at our mix of businesses and what's happened in the marketplace, we've been faced with a significantly declining backlog over the last couple of years in some of the heavy-fit commodity areas like mining and like upstream oil and gas. And the good news from our backlog standpoint is sort of all that decline now is, essentially, behind us. Because other than the new Rio Tinto project and some of our sustaining capital, et cetera, we've -- we don't see -- we really don't have much in the backlog as it relates to those heavy-margin areas. And what we've done is been transitioning to expand our customer base away from -- in addition to the traditional customers we've had. And as we do that, that takes time to replenish and start building backlog in some of those growth areas. As I look at our lines of business, we should be able to soon grow backlog in Building & Infrastructure. It's an area that provides us growth. We have strong positions. We're very well diversified. We're not happy that our backlog has been flat. We should be able to do better. When we look at the downstream chemical side, we believe that over the next 12 to 18 to 24 months, you're going to see more and more of our Jacobs Petroleum & Chemicals backlog become that sector, and we think there's significant opportunities there. Now obviously, Aerospace & Technology as we are gaining success now in rebids and shifting to some new areas, especially in the U.S., we expect at some point, that, that should put points on the board from a backlog standpoint. So we're excited and encouraged about our opportunity to grow, and we just need to start demonstrating that over the near term."

And of course, there's varying degrees as it relates to mix of business and dynamics that we have to take into account, but it's not -- we're not just looking for growth for growth's sake. We want it to be profitable and result in incremental margin profile that it's able to be realized. So yes, there's certainly a mix benefit because of the dynamic you outlined. But when you look at the margin profile of each of the respective LOBs, you see a consistent theme where margins by the LOBs are also improving regardless of what percentage they make up of the total business. So I think that, that is indicative of the focus that, ultimately, we're trying to drive and which, I think, the LOBs are doing a great job on is, look, it's about a possible growth agenda that, ultimately, we're going to have to drive, which is the foundation of being able to drive incremental EPS longer term. And of course, combined with our focus on the working capital side, it ends up being capital-efficient growth as well. So I think you can see that there is both sides of the coin, which are helping us. One is the mix is in itself good, overall mix. But if you look by LOBs, we're also seeing improvements. So I think that bodes well for your comment about are we seeing some benefits. And I think that in intensely competitive environments, in which we are, we hope to be able to improve that.

Of course, over time we're going to have to invest in merits, we're going to have to invest in training and development of our people, and so there will be some offsets of that. The idea though of our strategy is not for when we get back to growth that our SG&A and our G&A figures are going to go up correspondingly with our growth in the gross margin dollars. That's what it's all about. It's about having the discipline when we start to see those gross that you get the growth leverage -- a better growth leverage relative to those incremental dollars. So I think of G&A more as fixed, in that we always got to try and figure out how to keep those numbers consistent and certainly growing less over the long haul with the gross margin growth, so you get the incremental leverage."

I will say just to quantify what our expectations are maybe a little bit more. We set established targets for each of our lines of business and for ourselves at the corporate level at the beginning of the year, and we're driving towards figures. And I will tell you that we're not necessarily all the way where we wanted to be in terms of our targets for the year. So that in itself should indicate that we're continuing to drive for incremental benefits beyond where we are today. So that's the first point. I do believe that there will be, at some point in time, when we get to a more efficient kind of cash structure supporting our business, that the incremental cash flow dynamics will not be at the magnitude that we've had this year, obviously. The other dynamic that we certainly have to understand is that our business is not in a growth mode exactly right now, and there are implications on what cash flow dynamics go -- occur during that particular period of time. So hopefully, we'll have a high-class problem when that pivot occurs, where we have profitable growth going forward. And then ultimately, if we're at the capital-efficient place that we would like to have, that will be translating into a good cash flow conversion going forward. But certainly the number for this quarter, for example, well above net income, is not a sustainable figure. But ultimately, we certainly would like to think that we're going to be able to have a really good solid conversion factor going forward."

Welcome to our fiscal year 2016 fourth quarter earnings call. Before we move into the financials, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the recently completed fiscal year 2016. Over the past year, while facing challenging conditio",3154,"Thank you, Kevin. Welcome to our fiscal year 2016 fourth quarter earnings call. Before we move into the financials, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the recently completed fiscal year 2016. 
Over the past year, while facing challenging conditions in several of our key end markets, we took the opportunity to implement a set of key improvement initiatives that significantly strengthened our foundation and positions us for success moving forward. The most important steps taken involved reorganizing the 4 global lines of business; implementing a major restructuring to rightsize the company and become more cost-efficient; and developing our corporate strategy aimed at profitably growing Jacobs. While undertaking these initiatives, we also implemented a number of changes designed to increase accountability and transparency to drive greater financial discipline, in turn significantly optimizing cost at working capital, allowing us to reinvest in Jacobs to upgrade articles [ph] and processes to further strengthen the business and delivery of projects for our clients.  Our efforts to transform the core is driving a renewed sense of urgency and energy across our company to deliver business improvements across the globe. 
While much has and continues to be done to positively change Jacobs, we're also cognizant of our very successful past. Since 1947 when Joe Jacobs founded our great company, Jacobs was headquartered in Pasadena, California, and enjoyed decades of the impressive growth. In recent years, as we faced challenges to sustain growth, we recognized the need to transform our business and structure. One of the many steps identified was a new headquarters location. As such, last month, we announced our relocation to Dallas, Texas, which fits with our plans to drive efficiency, attract top talent and achieve a more convenient access to best serve our clients.
Moving to Slide 5 and a summary of our business performance. Kevin will cover more details regarding our solid fourth quarter in a minute. But on this slide, I'd like to summarize our 2016 total year performance. 
For the year, revenue was right at $11 billion. And on adjusted basis, earnings per share was $3.08, which is above the midpoint of our initial fiscal year 2016 guidance range. As such, we're pleased we're able to consistently deliver for each quarter and for the full year against our internal expectations. 
During fiscal year 2016, we continue to see adverse market conditions across multiple lines of business, particularly in our petroleum and chemicals and mining markets, and these were major contributors to the year-over-year revenue decline in both the fourth quarter and total fiscal year. We also faced competitive pricing pressures in cyclical economic patterns in certain key markets, which negatively impacted our revenue mix. However, as the year progressed, we started to build momentum due in part to our more focused global line of business structure and began to win more business as evidenced by the $438 million increase in our backlog at the end of our fourth quarter and the improved year-over-year margins generated in the second half of the year. I'm very pleased with how the entire Jacobs team has been relentless in improving various financial metrics as we saw considerable improvement across multiple KPIs during the year. Specifically, the restructuring initiative drove down our global adjusted SG&A cost by more than 9%, reducing cost by $127 million. And our efforts to improve our working capital position resulted in a significant increase in operating cash flows, in fact, resulting in the largest ever annual free cash flow in the history of Jacobs. Just as positively, we also achieved our first year in net positive cash position since fiscal year 2013. Much of this was achieved through acute focus on our accounts receivables and improving our DSO, which decreased 7 days versus prior year. Our focus on greater project delivery excellence also assisted in the improved margins we saw in the second half. Given our positive cash flow performance, we continued our efforts to return capital to our shareholders in the form of $153 million of purchases from our share buyback program. 
Moving to Slide 6. I'm extremely pleased with where our total backlog stands at the end of the fourth quarter, $18.8 billion, a significant sequential increase of nearly $440 million versus the prior quarter. Our backlog is now less than 2% off of our previous record of $19.1 billion. Also noteworthy is that our current backlog includes $182 million in negative foreign exchange movements when compared to the year-ago figure. So when adjusting for this, our backlog would, in fact, be up $137 million versus last year. Also positively, the professional services component of our backlog stood at $12 billion at fiscal year-end, the highest since June of 2015 and a positive sign to support higher margins going forward. Overall, we're pleased with our sales performance under the tough macro conditions faced by several of our lines of business, and the improvement in backlog across the portfolio is representative of our more disciplined approach and focus on leveraging synergies across the company to drive growth. 
Over the next 4 slides, I'll provide more specifics on each of our lines of business, but the key messages around our sales efforts going forward are as follows: Number one, we believe we're poised for further backlog growth as we move through 2017; secondly, we're focused on adding higher-value sales to backlog to drive long-term margin improvement. And we're holding ourselves accountable for this. We've added an annual management incentive measurement that will monitor our progress against profitably growing our backlog. 
Turning to Slide 7, the summary of our Aerospace & Technology line of business, where backlog remains steady at $5.1 billion versus last quarter, but higher by $230 million year-over-year. 
Program funding with our various customers remains generally stable and represents a large and diverse market, providing significant opportunity for market share growth. Defense spending, and particularly --  particular in the U.S., U.K. and Australia is expected to remain large and stable in the face of dynamic political circumstances, including the U.S. presidential election and the recent Brexit vote in the U.K. As previously reported, we continue to have a number of awarded contracts with significant value not yet backlogged due to competitor protests. In this line of business for the last 12 to 18 months, we've been primarily focused on core client program rebids and have, for the most part, been very successful based on a strong track record of performance and our lean cost structure. I'm particularly pleased with the mix of business our Aerospace & Technology team has achieved, both in terms of our successful rebids as well as recent high-value new business wins. This is reflected on our operating margins as this business improved to 7.7% of revenue in fiscal year 2016 versus 7% in the prior year. We're now shifting focus to a strong new business pipeline of opportunities valued at over $20 billion, the largest we've ever experienced for this market. While protracted procurement timelines exacerbated by persistent protests are expected to continue, we believe significant organic growth potential exists in Aerospace & Technology. 
With regard to specific market sectors, Homeland Security, cyber and intelligence related industries, remains strong areas of national priorities spend. We continue to build momentum and bringing our services in these markets to other lines of business in Jacobs and have positive success engaging several commercial clients. 
In U.S. environmental services, our rebid win of the 10-year $350 million remedial action contract for New Bedford Harbor with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers further solidifies our base in this market. This, coupled with a dominant position in places like Alaska, where a significant federal spend for environmental services provide a foundation to expand into other government customer bases and geographies. At the same time, we continue to expand our business base with Jacobs' traditional commercial sector customers who have significant environmental-related spend. 
In the U.K., the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority funding is projected to be steady around $20 billion over the next 5 years, and much of this funding will go to the Sellafield facility. Our nuclear cleanup group continues to support efforts  here. And with our strong delivery performance, we are well-positioned for much of the continuing work. 
Also in the U.K., the final sanctioning of the Hinkley Point C nuclear newbuild project has been completed. The recent approval is obviously an important and positive milestone for the program and is expected to have positive ramifications on the prospects of sanctioning approvals for the horizon of new gen nuclear newbuild programs as well. 
As previously reported, we've already been awarded a major framework for the Hinckley C program and we're supporting its development. All 3 nuclear build programs in the U.K. have expressed their intent to continue forward in light of the Brexit vote, and these provide good opportunities for Jacobs. 
Moving to Slide 8. During the fourth quarter, we experienced positive momentum across the globe in Buildings & Infrastructure. For the first time in several quarters, our backlog increased by $190 million to $5.1 billion versus the third quarter and is also up $310 million versus this time last fiscal year. The general buildings market remains steady and we have successfully been growing our position as we continue to target bright spots in selected markets. We are seeing increased opportunities in the health care market, specifically in the U.S. and New Zealand, which we'll be announcing shortly. 
Our market leadership position in the government building sector continues to grow with strategic wins at both the federal level with the U.S. Navy and the state level with customers such as the state of California and the city of Los Angeles. We continue to make great progress in this area and look forward to continuing this aspect of our business. 
The education sector represents one of our highest potential subsectors for growth with emerging opportunities in Asia-Pacific, specifically in Australia and New Zealand and continued growth in the U.S. with several recent bond measures receiving approval in the Midwest and West Coast. We're also utilizing our knowledge base in the sector to enhance our value proposition for large-scale smart cities emerging near Melbourne with the Australian Education City and also in Birmingham, England. 
Finally, we're happy to announce our selection as a platform partner for The Rockefeller Foundation-sponsored 100 Resilient cities program. The program is looking to drive remediation actions in member cities around the world faced with physical, social and economic challenges. 
On the infrastructure side, the global transportation market remains steady, and we're using our strong position to capitalize on a number of opportunities. In aviation specifically, we're leveraging our well-established capabilities to target investments locally and abroad. Positively, we had recent wins at Denver International Airport for critical design build projects; at Washington Dulles Airport for Phase 2 rail expansion; and at LAX for terminal development work. We're also progressing several other international opportunities that we expect to announce soon. 
Within the U.S. highway sector, federal spending remains flat and most developments are being driven by regional design packages. Texas, Florida and California transport departments dominate the local spend, and we're well-positioned since these states are strong Jacobs markets. 
The Australia and U.K. markets continue to be bland, and we're forecasting increased government and local authority investment. Some notable recent highway wins across the globe include the Darlington upgrade project in Australia, a professional services contract for transport for Greater Manchester [ph] and a construction inspection services contract for the New Jersey Department of Transportation. [ph] The U.K. rail market also continues to see significant investments, and we're providing PMCM services on large metro projects in the Middle East. 
In the U.S., we see opportunities across California, Seattle and the Northeast [indiscernible] Australia is also a growth region, as well as Asia. We had a number of exciting wins in the fourth quarter, including U.K. network rail, [ph] the level crossing removal authority program [ph] in Melbourne and the L.A. County purple line extension. [ph] 
In the water market, we have a moderate position and are leveraging our expertise in the U.K. and Australia to grow our position globally. We've just completed 2 major projects in Australia and won several other projects, including the United utilities AMP6 asset management [ph] program in the U.K. and the St. Louis sewer district watershed management [ph] design project in the U.S. 
And now on Slide 9 and a summary of our industrial line of business. In the fourth quarter, we saw positive wins in several markets that offset much of the strong life science backlog burn. As a result, quarter end backlog remained near steady at $3.1 billion. While the mining and mineral sector remains weak, we are seeing some syndications that eventual recovery may begin. In South America specifically, investments totaling $49 billion are projected in Chile over the next 10 years. And in Argentina, there's approximately $5 billion of projects expected to be announced by the end of 2018. 
Despite strong competition and [ph] sustaining capital work, we're also seeing more proposal activities for studies and evaluations, although this is in part driven by some of our competitors exiting the market. Positively, in the fourth quarter, we secured an engineering services contract for a treatment plant in South America; we won an underground study in Chile; and we're awarded a position on the global engineering panel in Australasia, which puts us in a strong position to capture additional opportunities. 
The life science sector remains robust. Expansion continues in biologics and secondary manufacturing  opportunities are also increasing. We are currently capitalizing on the second wave of biotech plant design efforts and expect a third wave from other major companies to meet pipeline products currently in Phase II clinical trials. 
Our global manufacturing facility expertise in emerging areas such as cell and gene therapy is also being sought after as clients shift their focus to small-scale manufacturing approaches using disposable technology. 
Geographically, major CapEx spend continues in Ireland, where we are growing market share through concerted efforts to expand our life sciences presence in Germany and Switzerland, along with the West Coast of the U.S. The India market remains flat, although we expect activity to increase next year as new incumbents plan investments in biosimilars. 
Opportunities in our consumer product and manufacturing clients are -- also increased during the fourth quarter and we're seeing growth opportunities as we establish new alliances in the consumer goods market. Most exciting was the contract award to provide design service for vastly [ph] $2 billion tissue and fertilizer investment in Virginia, the [ph] single largest Chinese greenfield economic development project in the U.S. This award is indicative of the upward investment trend at pulp and paper, particularly as established European and Chinese companies expand in the U.S. and is welcome news for us as we have a strong history and reputation supporting the sector's largest producers. 
Our field services business is seeing an increase in project activity, particularly in the U.S. Gulf Coast. In addition to several petrochemical wins, we secured a 4-year framework agreement with a new client in the private sector water market which will have a positive effect for adjacency work in our Buildings & Infrastructure line of business. 
Sales activity is also increasing in stand-alone construction capabilities, and we are seeing an uptick in opportunities with clients in the U.S. and Canada for sustaining capital services. 
With expansion in Morocco's transport energy and residential commercial sectors, we are leveraging our relationship with our joint venture partner, OCP, to include mid-cap EPC and maintenance opportunities. We anticipate this can be an area of growth for our field services sector in fiscal year 2017. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our Petroleum & Chemicals line of business saw a significant backlog increase of $361 million over the quarter and is now at $5.5 billion, near the year-ago backlog level. Upstream oil and gas markets remain weak, although we're seeing signs of stabilization with oil prices hovering in the $45 to $50 range over the past 6 months. Inventory builds appear to be flattening and OPEC is again talking production caps, [ph] although high inventories and a quick return in production from proven oil reserves will likely moderate crude prices. Established producers continue to make necessary investments to maintain production, but budgets will only begin to increase as balance sheets stabilize and producers gain confidence that prices can be sustained above $50 a barrel. 
With the increased production of shale oil, condensates and natural gas liquids in the U.S., we're more focused on pursuing opportunities in the midstream arena. Process and pipeline infrastructure needs to be put into place to move these barrels to market. Additionally, propane, butane and naphtha oversupply in the U.S. Gulf Coast is forecast to continue, which will require additional export infrastructure or conversion capacity to alleviate. The global excess of LNG will also renew efforts to develop alternative markets. Central, South America, Asia and Africa are likely targets for gas to power and small gas distribution projects, and additional LNG penetration is likely into the transportation fuel markets, sparking new projects. 
The refining market is comparatively steady, although profitability is at lower levels than 18 months ago. And consequently, this will impact capital spend over the near term. Despite this, we're seeing continuing opportunities at maintenance, turnaround, efficiency improvement and regulatory projects, particularly as we expand our JPro [ph] initiative, our new safety, reliability and process optimization service offering. In the U.S., there continues to be increased focus on process safety and octane improvement projects, while the U.S. refining margins also continue to be supported by product exports to Latin America. 
As previously reported, we continue to see feasibility study requests in developing countries across Asia and Africa, and the recent decision by the International Maritime Organization's Marine Environmental Protection Committee confirmed reinforcement of regulations to reduce the global sulfur cap on bunker fuel from 2020. Grassroots refining opportunities are also developing in India and South Asia, driven by growth for clean transportation fuels. 
The downstream petrochemicals market remains strong, and we continue to expect multiple investments in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Middle East.  We're seeing interest from Saudi Arabia and elsewhere regarding development of crude oil to chemicals projects, and there's increased focus on diversification. Moving away from first-line commodity chemicals, ethane, LPG and naphtha feedstocks, are also plentiful and relatively cheap and will provide economic incentives for project development. This is a global trend, which is driven by the excess of petchem feedstocks being exported from the U.S. 
We have several exciting wins in the quarter, including a confidential [ph] grassroots chemical facility in the U.S. Gulf Coast; an engineering contract for TransCanada; an EPC contract with INEOS for a Linear alpha olefin unit in Texas; and a refinery upgrade FEED project for the Singapore Refining Company. 
With that, I'll now pass it to Kevin discuss the financials in more detail."

Turning now to Slide 11, you will see a more detailed summary of our financial performance over the quarter and fiscal year 2016. As we have communicated throughout the current fiscal year, adverse market conditions in certain end markets",1506,"Thanks, Steve. Turning now to Slide 11, you will see a more detailed summary of our financial performance over the quarter and fiscal year 2016. 
As we have communicated throughout the current fiscal year, adverse market conditions in certain end markets continued to negatively impact certain of our businesses. As a result of these ongoing pressures, particularly in oil and gas, our revenue for the quarter was $2.6 billion, down approximately 15% versus our fourth quarter last year. For the year, revenue was $11 billion, down 10% versus last year.  EPS on an adjusted basis was $0.77, which excludes $0.53 per share in after-tax, restructuring and other charges, which are comprised of after-tax charges of $0.30 per share in connection with our restructuring activities that began in fiscal year 2015, a $0.14 per share loss on the sale of our French subsidiary as a result of our strategic decision to exit our French operations, and a $0.09 per share noncash write-off on an equity investment. While the adjusted EPS was $0.77 for the fiscal year -- fiscal quarter 4 was lower than the $0.80 reported in the comparable quarter last year, note that fiscal year '15 included a 53 -- a 53rd week, excuse me, in our Q4 results in 2015, which added approximately a $0.03 per share benefit to the year-ago quarter. 
Book-to-bill on a trailing 12-month basis continued to improve over the course of fiscal year '16 and ended at a high for the year at 1.0x. Q4 gross margin percentage was up 120 basis points versus the year-ago quarter, indicative of our improving execution and focus on cost discipline. Importantly, our gross margin percentage for our professional services business continued the positive trend that we had seen earlier this year. Specifically, this helped increase our consolidated gross margin percentage in the second half of 2016 by 70 basis points versus the same period of 2015. 
For the full year, adjusted G&A was reduced by $127 million versus the last fiscal year, or an improvement of 9.3%; again, a positive indication of our success in rightsizing the company and driving cost efficiencies. Our adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $134 million, an improvement of 25 basis points on an operating profit margin basis versus the fourth quarter of 2015. Specifically in the second half of 2016, our improving traction and financial discipline resulted in our operating profit margin improving the second half of 2015 by 30 basis points to 5.2%.  
Finally, our efforts to improve our accounts receivable efficiencies saw our DSO improving to 70 days at year-end versus 77 last year as noted earlier by Steve. As a result, free cash flow also continue to improve totaling $213 [ph] million for the quarter, an improvement of $134 million versus the fourth quarter of 2015. For the year, free cash flow reached $612 million, up $216 million versus year ago and the highest in the history of the company. At fiscal year-end, the company's net cash position now stands at $268 million, an improvement of $140 million from the last quarter sequentially and a more significant $405 million turnaround from last fiscal year-end. 
So turning to Slide 12. You will see the Q4 and fiscal year '16 adjusted segment financials for our 4 lines of businesses. As you can see, 2 of our 4 business lines increased their segment operating profit versus the year-ago quarter.
Importantly, 3 of our LOBs improved their adjusted operating profit margins both for the quarter and for the full year versus the year-ago periods. 
Regarding Aerospace & Technology, while we did see a decline in adjusted operating profit versus the fourth quarter of fiscal year '15, the adjusted operating profit for the entire fiscal year held near flat despite a decrease in revenues on account of a 70 basis point improvement in margins for the year. The improvement in the margin profile over the year was driven by strong performance fees, particularly in Q3, and by an overall improvement in the margin mix of this line of business. 
The Buildings & Infrastructure business also saw revenue decline in Q4 versus the year-ago period, but adjusted segment operating profit actually increased by a significant 79% and finished up 20% for the whole of fiscal year 2016. This was driven by significant improvements in project execution which allowed [ph] higher project margins versus a more challenged Q4 and full year in 2015. As a result, the operating profit margin for this business was up 380 basis points in Q4 and 190 basis points for the full year versus the year-ago periods. The industrial line of business saw an increase in revenues for the quarter of 12% versus a year ago quarter, supporting a near 11% increase for the fiscal year driven by strong performance in our life science business. Despite this, adjusted segment operating profit was down 54% versus last year's Q4 when compared to the year-ago period and down 36% for the fiscal year. 2016 challenges were related to several project disputes and client settlements in Q2 and Q4 of 2016, primarily in our mining businesses. In addition, last year had a significant benefit in Q2 associated with successful closeouts associated with several large projects. 
Lastly, our Petroleum & Chemicals line of business saw a 33% decline in revenue for Q4 versus the year-ago, but a far more positive 6% increase in adjusted operating profit over the same period. The fall in revenue was also apparent for the full year given the challenging end market dynamics. Despite these challenges, segment operating profit margins actually increased by 180 basis points for the quarter and by 60 basis points for the full year versus the year-ago like periods, a clear indication of the strong focus on cost efficiencies and restructuring in this line of business. 
So moving to Slide 13. You will see the split of revenues in segment operating profit by each LOB. As discussed over the past several quarters, the strength of some of our lines of businesses such as Buildings & Infrastructure and Aerospace & Technology demonstrate the benefits of our diverse portfolio in maintaining relative stability in times when economic challenges exist in certain of our end markets. What's clear is that the shape of our portfolio is changing. Specifically, those LOBs that are most impacted by global commodity price changes are representing a lower percentage of the profits of the company, while other businesses are expanding. Consequently, the position of our portfolio offers us to advantages at this point in time. First, we continue to be well positioned to further leverage off of our strong position in those businesses that are not impacted by commodities; and two, we are at a point where further falloff in a commodity-oriented business is obviously less likely. As a result, there is real upside for these businesses when commodity prices do ultimately improve. This argues for relative stability in the short run with upside in the long run. 
Moving to Slide 14. We continue to be successful with our restructuring and efforts to improve financial discipline and performance. Restructuring that began in July of 2015 which aimed at simplifying the business and enhancing our cost effectiveness. Our LOB realignment and continue to drive to identify cost savings allowed us to find additional cost savings opportunities over the course of the year. And as a result, our final savings are expected to be in the range of $260 million to $270 million, with total cost approximating $390 million to $400 million. Relative to our cash cost and savings, our payback a slightly less than 1 year. I'm pleased to report that we are on track to obtain the full run rate of these savings in fiscal year '17, and the reduction in adjusted G&A of $127 million we achieved in fiscal year '16 is evidence of this, especially when adding to the savings already realized in 2015. Further savings that we will realize in 2017 are important as it will allow us to reinvest back into the business to fund certain strategic investments in the company and to enhance our position to drive profitable growth in the long term. 
Finally, before turning it back to Steve, Slide 16 provide a short update on our share buyback program activities for fiscal year '16. During the quarter, we continue to execute share buybacks in a balanced and steady manner, bringing the total repurchases for the fiscal year to 3.4 million shares for a total of $153 million. This represents a 3.7% reduction in shares outstanding for fiscal year '15. 
As you're aware, we have previously indicated that we expect to continue to spend the remainder of the $500 million share buyback in a relatively consistent manner over the remaining term of the 3-year program. We plan to provide an update on our use of cash and capital structure strategy at our 2016 Investor Day next week on Thursday, December 1. 
With that, let me hand it back over to Steve for closing comments."

We expect challenging market conditions to continue into fiscal year 2017. [indiscernible] growth in developed markets, geopolitical issues and uncertain commodity prices will continue to impact some of our end markets. Much like the beginning of last year, our oil and gas, mining and certain industrial clients are continuing to avoid large capital expenditures to convert -- conserve cash. We do believe most of the declines in these end markets are now behind us, but it remains to be seen what industry growth will return and the sectors. More positively, we saw select growth opportunities in our Buildings & Infrastructure, Aerospace & Technology and life sciences markets in fiscal year 2016, and we expect further growth in these end markets in 2017. 
As we progress through our fiscal year 2016, we saw our backlog stabilize and then increased by the fourth quarter, and we expect further increases to our backlog as we progress through fiscal year 2017. We also remain heavily focused on improving margins. The restructuring we have undertaken over the past several quarters continues to provide momentum and supports our ability to invest back in our profitable growth agenda. We are seeing improvements in our project delivery efforts and write-offs continue to be reduced across the board.  
Finally, our efforts to improve our financial performance for 2016 and particularly our operating profits gives us confidence in a more stable outlook for fiscal year 2017. Consequently, we're providing initial guidance between $3 and $3.30 for adjusted EPS, which provides for operating profit growth in a continuing challenged market environment and includes a set of largely onetime investments of $0.15 per share to support our growth strategy. 
As Kevin mentioned, our strategic review is complete, and we look forward to our discussions next week at our Investor Day on December 1, wher we will outline our strategy for long-term sustainable shareholder value. With that, I'd like to thank you for listening, and we'll now open it up for questions."

Look, we're very pleased with the amount of progress, a lot of hard work within the lines of businesses to really gain some momentum in the back half of the year specifically on improving our DSO. It doesn't just automatically happen. I do think that our year-end position is really quite quite good. And the way we think about driving long-term capital benefits and specifically accounts receivable is in to validate point in time is about an average level so that we ultimately are able to have a sustainable level of working capital. So having said all of that, I would not perceive us being able to necessarily have the kind of free cash flow that we saw in 2016 per se, but we are planning on continuing to drive DSO improvements in 2017 and will be part of our financial metrics. We'll talk a little bit more about this in our Investor Day next week, but we still think there's opportunities to improve and, longer term, be a more efficient capital investment behind our business, which ultimately will increase our return on invested capital."

And our new line of business structure has given us the capability to leverage off of certain strengths regionally and take those trends globally.

And we typically like to focus in on the professional services side where we get good margin. And we've shifted our strategy as we go forward that we're going to be much more conscious of the total margin. And therefore, whether it's professional services or the field services side, we're expecting to drive margin improvement. And as a result, we are seeing the effect to some extent of our strategy mix of really focusing in on margin as we also drive down cost and all the things that we talked about for fiscal year '16. But as we move into '17, we are talking about the whole shift of pivoting to growth and we feel like it's pretty broad-based. As you saw, we got backlog growth [indiscernible] in our Petroleum & Chemicals business, which I think is extremely successful achievement in light of the tough conditions. And that's because of the successful strategy shift to really focus on petrochemicals. A lion share of our wins are coming in petrochemicals. We continue to see very robust pipeline of activity in petrochemicals. And again, our new line of business structure has given us the opportunity to really globalize and expand beyond our previous core client focus to a much larger set of customers. So we see that in Petroleum & Chemicals. I think, we gave you a sense that Building and Infrastructure, we're pretty bullish globally, and we're actually leading the way in growth in Australia. Our Australia team on the backs of what came out of the political situation last year has really driven some spending increase across that country, and we're now see in momentum in the U.S. and the U.K. as well. So I'm very positive on Buildings & Infrastructure. Aerospace & Technology, one thing in that business we all need to remind ourselves about is that from 2010 to 2015, there was a 25% decline in federal defense spending in the U.S. And in spite of that, we held our backlog up. And now as we progressed our strategy and we've seen stabilization of that spending and we're gaining market share in what's a very large spend and government services in the U.S. especially, we believe as we get through '17, we're going to actually see backlog growth and revenue growth. I think, the area that right now is, I'd say, more stable is the overall industrial segment because that is made up of a lot of different businesses and there's a bit of a timing going on, on when we win the next wave of pharma projects as we burn off some backlog in that business. So that's kind of the overall story of sales growth."

The other note that is important to understand is that as we look at this focus of pivoting to our profitable growth agenda, I would say in those businesses, specifically Petroleum & Chemicals, we're still comparing to some pretty big year ago numbers and the stabilization of that business is happening as we speak. So as we progress over the course of 2017, we would expect that, that pivot to growth will actually play out hopefully in the Petroleum & Chemicals business.

But it's really to move away from a mindset of restructuring to productivity and with a large efforts around now taking that leaner cost structure and winning more business because of the competitiveness that, that brought us. As far as the postelection situation, again, I feel like I commented on that Jamie. But with everything we were doing to position ourselves for growth, we attribute the momentum to that activity and less around the early stages of postelection. Are we optimistic? Yes. Do we hope all the stuff we read about happens? Of course. And we've seen what the Australian elections have done and we hope that same thing happens in the U.S. And, in fact, Theresa May's administration in the U.K. is reaffirming several of the important nuclear and other projects in that region that are important to us. And so we feel good about what's going on globally around the political side of positioning our business. With regard to Motiva, the arbitration process continues.

But I think, what you're going to see Jacobs shifting and a shift that we really have moved from a company that had 250 offices that everyone around the world at Jacobs was sort of locally focused on how to win business and offices to a much more targeted strategic growth strategy that's going to be fact-based around where we believe the markets are growing fastest, where we're the natural holder of that market, if you will, and where we're strong. And therefore, still maintaining a very strong diversity of end market participation, but anything in much more focused a digit area. And we're going to highlight what those markets are next week. They clearly involve building infrastructure market but even within that big the anti-sector, there's going to be priority targets. Aerospace & Technology, of course, is going to lead the way and you're going to hear about the focus there and how we're going to extend into some new areas outside of our current situation. And even in Petroleum & Chemicals, I think, I've already talked about the focus on downstream and petrochemicals and Gary Mandel will talk about that next week and discuss how were going to focus there, and a few other important some verticals across Jacobs. So we're looking forward to laying them out next week."

But the other dynamic is also with that as we stabilized what we believe that we begin to stabilize our revenues, the first quarter of this year compared to last year will still -- there still was a larger revenue stream that we are realizing in the first quarter. So there is specifically some challenges in Q1, and as relates to your specific comment about balance of the year, that's where we see the pivot that Steve has alluded to when we start to be able to see improved EPS growth in the back part of the year.

The backlog momentum is really across the board rather that any single projects. I think that's been traditionally Jacobs' strength is that we're not over relying on large projects that really is built off of our strong end market diversity. And I think, I covered that earlier that we actually see it in most of our line of businesses and we feel throughout the year that that's going to happen. Last year, we recognize the need to really drive cash and put DSO and working capital in our management incentives compensation target. And we're going to maintain that going into 2017 because we believe there is, as Kevin said, there is more working capital efficiency out there. But as we pivot to growth, we now want to do the same thing with backlog growth specifically. And I think, you hit the nail on the head, that is profitable growth, and so as we look at backlog growth without getting into the specifics, what our board is going to hold us accountable for is actually the gross margin in that backlog growth. So it is going to be aimed at profitable backlog growth, and we put new systems and tools in place to be able to measure that growth, which kind of goes to the last talked about margin focus and it still in a very tough environment, I think the major difference moving forward is we now have the ability to measure profitability by client, by office and many other ways in a much better way than we had a few years ago. So as everyone goes after upgrading the mix, the actual have the tools and capabilities to track that."

With that, I would now like to pass it over to our Chairman and CEO, Steve Demetriou."

Welcome to our fiscal year 2016 fourth quarter earnings call. Before we move into the financials, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the recently completed fiscal year 2016. Over the past year, while facing challenging conditio",3143,"Thank you, Kevin. Welcome to our fiscal year 2016 fourth quarter earnings call. Before we move into the financials, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the recently completed fiscal year 2016. 
Over the past year, while facing challenging conditions in several of our key end markets, we took the opportunity to implement a set of key improvement initiatives that significantly strengthened our foundation and positions us for success moving forward. The most important steps taken involved reorganizing the 4 global lines of business; implementing a major restructuring to rightsize the company and become more cost-efficient; and developing our corporate strategy aimed at profitably growing Jacobs. While undertaking these initiatives, we also implemented a number of changes designed to increase accountability and transparency to drive greater financial discipline, in turn significantly optimizing cost and working capital, allowing us to reinvest in Jacobs to upgrade articles and processes to further strengthen the business and delivery of projects for our clients.  Our efforts to transform the core is driving a renewed sense of urgency and energy across our company to deliver business improvements across the globe. 
While much has and continues to be done to positively change Jacobs, we're also cognizant of our very successful past. Since 1947 when Joe Jacobs founded our great company, Jacobs was headquartered in Pasadena, California, and enjoyed decades of the impressive growth. In recent years, as we faced challenges to sustain growth, we recognized the need to transform our business and structure. One of the many steps identified was a new headquarters location. As such, last month, we announced our relocation to Dallas, Texas, which fits with our plans to drive efficiency, attract top talent and achieve a more convenient access to best serve our clients.
Moving to Slide 5 and a summary of our business performance. Kevin will cover more details regarding our solid fourth quarter in a minute. But on this slide, I'd like to summarize our 2016 total year performance. 
For the year, revenue was right at $11 billion. And on adjusted basis, earnings per share was $3.08, which is above the midpoint of our initial fiscal year 2016 guidance range. As such, we're pleased we're able to consistently deliver for each quarter and for the full year against our internal expectations. 
During fiscal year 2016, we continue to see adverse market conditions across multiple lines of business, particularly in our petroleum and chemicals and mining markets, and these were major contributors to the year-over-year revenue decline in both the fourth quarter and total fiscal year. We also faced competitive pricing pressures in cyclical economic patterns in certain key markets, which negatively impacted our revenue mix. However, as the year progressed, we started to build momentum due in part to our more focused global line of business structure and began to win more business as evidenced by the $438 million increase in our backlog at the end of our fourth quarter and the improved year-over-year margins generated in the second half of the year. I'm very pleased with how the entire Jacobs team has been relentless in improving various financial metrics as we saw considerable improvement across multiple KPIs during the year. Specifically, the restructuring initiative drove down our global adjusted SG&A cost by more than 9%, reducing cost by $127 million. And our efforts to improve our working capital position resulted in a significant increase in operating cash flows, in fact, resulting in the largest ever annual free cash flow in the history of Jacobs. Just as positively, we also achieved our first year in net positive cash position since fiscal year 2013. Much of this was achieved through acute focus on our accounts receivables and improving our DSO, which decreased 7 days versus prior year. Our focus on greater project delivery excellence also assisted in the improved margins we saw in the second half. Given our positive cash flow performance, we continued our efforts to return capital to our shareholders in the form of $153 million of purchases from our share buyback program. 
Moving to Slide 6. I'm extremely pleased with where our total backlog stands at the end of the fourth quarter, $18.8 billion, a significant sequential increase of nearly $440 million versus the prior quarter. Our backlog is now less than 2% off of our previous record of $19.1 billion. Also noteworthy is that our current backlog includes $182 million in negative foreign exchange movements when compared to the year-ago figure. So when adjusting for this, our backlog would, in fact, be up $137 million versus last year. Also positively, the professional services component of our backlog stood at $12 billion at fiscal year-end, the highest since June of 2015 and a positive sign to support higher margins going forward. Overall, we're pleased with our sales performance under the tough macro conditions faced by several of our lines of business, and the improvement in backlog across the portfolio is representative of our more disciplined approach and focus on leveraging synergies across the company to drive growth. 
Over the next 4 slides, I'll provide more specifics on each of our lines of business, but the key messages around our sales efforts going forward are as follows: Number one, we believe we're poised for further backlog growth as we move through 2017; secondly, we're focused on adding higher-value sales to backlog to drive long-term margin improvement. And we're holding ourselves accountable for this. We've added an annual management incentive measurement that will monitor our progress against profitably growing our backlog. 
Turning to Slide 7, the summary of our Aerospace & Technology line of business, where backlog remains steady at $5.1 billion versus last quarter, but higher by $230 million year-over-year. 
Program funding with our various customers remains generally stable and represents a large and diverse market, providing significant opportunity for market share growth. Defense spending, and particularly --  particular in the U.S., U.K. and Australia is expected to remain large and stable in the face of dynamic political circumstances, including the U.S. presidential election and the recent Brexit vote in the U.K. As previously reported, we continue to have a number of awarded contracts with significant value not yet backlogged due to competitor protests. In this line of business for the last 12 to 18 months, we've been primarily focused on core client program rebids and have, for the most part, been very successful based on a strong track record of performance and our lean cost structure. I'm particularly pleased with the mix of business our Aerospace & Technology team has achieved, both in terms of our successful rebids as well as recent high-value new business wins. This is reflected on our operating margins as this business improved to 7.7% of revenue in fiscal year 2016 versus 7% in the prior year. We're now shifting focus to a strong new business pipeline of opportunities valued at over $20 billion, the largest we've ever experienced for this market. While protracted procurement timelines exacerbated by persistent protests are expected to continue, we believe significant organic growth potential exists in Aerospace & Technology. 
With regard to specific market sectors, Homeland Security, cyber and intelligence related industries, remains strong areas of national priorities spend. We continue to build momentum and bringing our services in these markets to other lines of business in Jacobs and have positive success engaging several commercial clients. 
In U.S. environmental services, our rebid win of the 10-year $350 million remedial action contract for New Bedford Harbor with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers further solidifies our base in this market. This, coupled with a dominant position in places like Alaska, where a significant federal spend for environmental services provide a foundation to expand into other government customer bases and geographies. At the same time, we continue to expand our business base with Jacobs' traditional commercial sector customers who have significant environmental-related spend. 
In the U.K., the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority funding is projected to be steady around $20 billion over the next 5 years, and much of this funding will go to the Sellafield facility. Our nuclear cleanup group continues to support efforts  here. And with our strong delivery performance, we are well-positioned for much of the continuing work. 
Also in the U.K., the final sanctioning of the Hinkley Point C nuclear newbuild project has been completed. The recent approval is obviously an important and positive milestone for the program and is expected to have positive ramifications on the prospects of sanctioning approvals for the horizon of new gen nuclear newbuild programs as well. 
As previously reported, we've already been awarded a major framework for the Hinckley C program and we're supporting its development. All 3 nuclear build programs in the U.K. have expressed their intent to continue forward in light of the Brexit vote, and these provide good opportunities for Jacobs. 
Moving to Slide 8. During the fourth quarter, we experienced positive momentum across the globe in Buildings & Infrastructure. For the first time in several quarters, our backlog increased by $190 million to $5.1 billion versus the third quarter and is also up $310 million versus this time last fiscal year. The general buildings market remains steady and we have successfully been growing our position as we continue to target bright spots in selected markets. We are seeing increased opportunities in the health care market, specifically in the U.S. and New Zealand, which we'll be announcing shortly. 
Our market leadership position in the government building sector continues to grow with strategic wins at both the federal level with the U.S. Navy and the state level with customers such as the state of California and the city of Los Angeles. We continue to make great progress in this area and look forward to continuing this aspect of our business. 
The education sector represents one of our highest potential subsectors for growth with emerging opportunities in Asia-Pacific, specifically in Australia and New Zealand and continued growth in the U.S. with several recent bond measures receiving approval in the Midwest and West Coast. We're also utilizing our knowledge base in the sector to enhance our value proposition for large-scale smart cities emerging near Melbourne with the Australian Education City and also in Birmingham, England. 
Finally, we're happy to announce our selection as a platform partner for The Rockefeller Foundation-sponsored 100 Resilient cities program. The program is looking to drive remediation actions in member cities around the world faced with physical, social and economic challenges. 
On the infrastructure side, the global transportation market remains steady, and we're using our strong position to capitalize on a number of opportunities. In aviation specifically, we're leveraging our well-established capabilities to target investments locally and abroad. Positively, we had recent wins at Denver International Airport for critical design build projects; at Washington Dulles Airport for Phase 2 rail expansion; and at LAX for terminal development work. We're also progressing several other international opportunities that we expect to announce soon. 
Within the U.S. highway sector, federal spending remains flat and most developments are being driven by regional design packages. Texas, Florida and California transport departments dominate the local spend, and we're well-positioned since these states are strong Jacobs markets. 
The Australia and U.K. markets continue to be bland, and we're forecasting increased government and local authority investment. Some notable recent highway wins across the globe include the Darlington upgrade project in Australia, a professional services contract for transport for Greater Manchester and a construction inspection services contract for the New Jersey Department of Transportation. The U.K. rail market also continues to see significant investments, and we're providing PMCM services on large metro projects in the Middle East. 
In the U.S., we see opportunities across California, Seattle and the Northeast corridor. Australia is also a growth region, as well as Asia. We had a number of exciting wins in the fourth quarter, including the U.K. Network Rail, the Level Crossing Removal Authority program in Melbourne and the L.A. County Purple Line Extension. 
In the water market, we have a moderate position and are leveraging our expertise in the U.K. and Australia to grow our position globally. We've just completed 2 major projects in Australia and won several other projects, including the United utilities AMP6 asset management program in the U.K. and the St. Louis Sewer District watershed management design project in the U.S. 
And now on Slide 9 and a summary of our industrial line of business. In the fourth quarter, we saw positive wins in several markets that offset much of the strong life science backlog burn. As a result, quarter end backlog remained near steady at $3.1 billion. While the mining and mineral sector remains weak, we are seeing some syndications that eventual recovery may begin. In South America specifically, investments totaling $49 billion are projected in Chile over the next 10 years. And in Argentina, there's approximately $5 billion of projects expected to be announced by the end of 2018. 
Despite strong competition and sustaining capital work, we're also seeing more proposal activities for studies and evaluations, although this is in part driven by some of our competitors exiting the market. Positively, in the fourth quarter, we secured an engineering services contract for a treatment plant in South America; we won an underground study in Chile; and we're awarded a position on the global engineering panel in Australasia, which puts us in a strong position to capture additional opportunities. 
The life science sector remains robust. Expansion continues in biologics and secondary manufacturing  opportunities are also increasing. We are currently capitalizing on the second wave of biotech plant design efforts and expect a third wave from other major companies to meet pipeline products currently in Phase II clinical trials. 
Our global manufacturing facility expertise in emerging areas such as cell and gene therapy is also being sought after as clients shift their focus to small-scale manufacturing approaches using disposable technology. 
Geographically, major CapEx spend continues in Ireland, where we are growing market share through concerted efforts to expand our life sciences presence in Germany and Switzerland, along with the West Coast of the U.S. The India market remains flat, although we expect activity to increase next year as new incumbents plan investments in biosimilars. 
Opportunities in our consumer product and manufacturing clients are -- also increased during the fourth quarter and we're seeing growth opportunities as we establish new alliances in the consumer goods market. Most exciting was the contract award to provide design service for Vastly's $2 billion tissue and fertilizer investment in Virginia, the single largest Chinese greenfield economic development project in the U.S. This award is indicative of the upward investment trend at pulp and paper, particularly as established European and Chinese companies expand in the U.S. and is welcome news for us as we have a strong history and reputation supporting the sector's largest producers. 
Our field services business is seeing an increase in project activity, particularly in the U.S. Gulf Coast. In addition to several petrochemical wins, we secured a 4-year framework agreement with a new client in the private sector water market which will have a positive effect for adjacency work in our Buildings & Infrastructure line of business. 
Sales activity is also increasing in stand-alone construction capabilities, and we are seeing an uptick in opportunities with clients in the U.S. and Canada for sustaining capital services. 
With expansion in Morocco's transport energy and residential commercial sectors, we are leveraging our relationship with our joint venture partner, OCP, to include mid-cap EPC and maintenance opportunities. We anticipate this can be an area of growth for our field services sector in fiscal year 2017. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our Petroleum & Chemicals line of business saw a significant backlog increase of $361 million over the quarter and is now at $5.5 billion, near the year-ago backlog level. Upstream oil and gas markets remain weak, although we're seeing signs of stabilization with oil prices hovering in the $45 to $50 range over the past 6 months. Inventory builds appear to be flattening and OPEC is again talking production caps, although high inventories and a quick return in production from proven oil reserves will likely moderate crude prices. Established producers continue to make necessary investments to maintain production, but budgets will only begin to increase as balance sheets stabilize and producers gain confidence that prices can be sustained above $50 a barrel. 
With the increased production of shale oil, condensates and natural gas liquids in the U.S., we're more focused on pursuing opportunities in the midstream arena. Process and pipeline infrastructure needs to be put into place to move these barrels to market. Additionally, propane, butane and naphtha oversupply in the U.S. Gulf Coast is forecast to continue, which will require additional export infrastructure or conversion capacity to alleviate. The global excess of LNG will also renew efforts to develop alternative markets. Central, South America, Asia and Africa are likely targets for gas to power and small gas distribution projects, and additional LNG penetration is likely into the transportation fuel markets, sparking new projects. 
The refining market is comparatively steady, although profitability is at lower levels than 18 months ago. And consequently, this will impact capital spend over the near term. Despite this, we're seeing continuing opportunities at maintenance, turnaround, efficiency improvement and regulatory projects, particularly as we expand our J Pro [ph] initiative, our new safety, reliability and process optimization service offering. In the U.S., there continues to be increased focus on process safety and octane improvement projects, while the U.S. refining margins also continue to be supported by product exports to Latin America. 
As previously reported, we continue to see feasibility study requests in developing countries across Asia and Africa, and the recent decision by the International Maritime Organization's Marine Environmental Protection Committee confirmed reinforcement of regulations to reduce the global sulfur cap on bunker fuel from 2020. Grassroots refining opportunities are also developing in India and South Asia, driven by growth for clean transportation fuels. 
The downstream petrochemicals market remains strong, and we continue to expect multiple investments in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Middle East.  We're seeing interest from Saudi Arabia and elsewhere regarding development of crude oil to chemicals projects, and there's increased focus on diversification. Moving away from first-line commodity chemicals, ethane, LPG and naphtha feedstocks, are also plentiful and relatively cheap and will provide economic incentives for project development. This is a global trend, which is driven by the excess of petchem feedstocks being exported from the U.S. 
We have several exciting wins in the quarter, including a confidential grassroots chemical facility in the U.S. Gulf Coast; an engineering contract for TransCanada; an EPC contract with INEOS for a Linear alpha olefin unit in Texas; and a refinery upgrade FEED project for the Singapore Refining Company. 
With that, I'll now pass it to Kevin discuss the financials in more detail."

Turning now to Slide 11, you will see a more detailed summary of our financial performance over the quarter and fiscal year 2016. As we have communicated throughout the current fiscal year, adverse market conditions in certain end markets",1506,"Thanks, Steve. Turning now to Slide 11, you will see a more detailed summary of our financial performance over the quarter and fiscal year 2016. 
As we have communicated throughout the current fiscal year, adverse market conditions in certain end markets continued to negatively impact certain of our businesses. As a result of these ongoing pressures, particularly in oil and gas, our revenue for the quarter was $2.6 billion, down approximately 15% versus our fourth quarter last year. For the year, revenue was $11 billion, down 10% versus last year.  EPS on an adjusted basis was $0.77, which excludes $0.53 per share in after-tax, restructuring and other charges, which are comprised of after-tax charges of $0.30 per share in connection with our restructuring activities that began in fiscal year 2015, a $0.14 per share loss on the sale of our French subsidiary as a result of our strategic decision to exit our French operations, and a $0.09 per share noncash write-off on an equity investment. While the adjusted EPS was $0.77 for the fiscal year -- fiscal quarter 4 was lower than the $0.80 reported in the comparable quarter last year, note that fiscal year '15 included a 53 -- a 53rd week, excuse me, in our Q4 results in 2015, which added approximately a $0.03 per share benefit to the year-ago quarter. 
Book-to-bill on a trailing 12-month basis continued to improve over the course of fiscal year '16 and ended at a high for the year at 1.0x. Q4 gross margin percentage was up 120 basis points versus the year-ago quarter, indicative of our improving execution and focus on cost discipline. Importantly, our gross margin percentage for our professional services business continued the positive trend that we had seen earlier this year. Specifically, this helped increase our consolidated gross margin percentage in the second half of 2016 by 70 basis points versus the same period of 2015. 
For the full year, adjusted G&A was reduced by $127 million versus the last fiscal year, or an improvement of 9.3%; again, a positive indication of our success in rightsizing the company and driving cost efficiencies. Our adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $134 million, an improvement of 25 basis points on an operating profit margin basis versus the fourth quarter of 2015. Specifically in the second half of 2016, our improving traction and financial discipline resulted in our operating profit margin improving the second half of 2015 by 30 basis points to 5.2%.  
Finally, our efforts to improve our accounts receivable efficiencies saw our DSO improving to 70 days at year-end versus 77 last year, as noted earlier by Steve. As a result, free cash flow also continued to improve totaling $213 million for the quarter, an improvement of $134 million versus the fourth quarter of 2015. For the year, free cash flow reached $612 million, up $216 million versus year ago and the highest in the history of the company. At fiscal year-end, the company's net cash position now stands at $268 million, an improvement of $140 million from the last quarter sequentially and a more significant $405 million turnaround from last fiscal year end. 
So turning to Slide 12. You will see the Q4 and fiscal year '16 adjusted segment financials for our 4 lines of businesses. As you can see, 2 of our 4 business lines increased their segment operating profit versus the year-ago quarter.
Importantly, 3 of our LOBs improved their adjusted operating profit margins both for the quarter and for the full year versus the year-ago periods. 
Regarding Aerospace & Technology, while we did see a decline in adjusted operating profit versus the fourth quarter of fiscal year '15, the adjusted operating profit for the entire fiscal year held near flat despite a decrease in revenues on account of a 70 basis point improvement in margins for the year. The improvement in the margin profile over the year was driven by strong performance fees, particularly in Q3, and by an overall improvement in the margin mix of this line of business. 
The Buildings & Infrastructure business also saw revenue decline in Q4 versus the year-ago period, but adjusted segment operating profit actually increased by a significant 79% and finished up 20% for the whole of fiscal year 2016. This was driven by significant improvements in project execution which allowed higher project margins versus a more challenged Q4 and full year in 2015. As a result, the operating profit margin for this business was up 380 basis points in Q4 and 190 basis points for the full year versus the year-ago periods. 
The industrial line of business saw an increase in revenues for the quarter of 12% versus the year ago quarter, supporting a near 11% increase for the fiscal year, driven by strong performance in our life science business. Despite this, adjusted segment operating profit was down 54% versus last year's Q4 when compared to the year-ago period and down 36% for the fiscal year. 2016 challenges were related to several project disputes and client settlements in Q2 and Q4 of 2016, primarily in our mining businesses. In addition, last year had a significant benefit in Q2 associated with successful closeouts associated with several large projects. 
Lastly, our Petroleum & Chemicals line of business saw a 33% decline in revenue for Q4 versus the year-ago period, but a far more positive 6% increase in adjusted operating profit over the same period. The fall in revenue was also apparent for the full year given the challenging end market dynamics. Despite these challenges, segment operating profit margins actually increased by 180 basis points for the quarter and by 60 basis points for the full year versus the year-ago like periods, a clear indication of the strong focus on cost efficiencies and restructuring in this line of business. 
So moving to Slide 13. You will see the split of revenues in segment operating profit by each LOB. As discussed over the past several quarters, the strength in some of our lines of businesses, such as Buildings & Infrastructure and Aerospace & Technology, demonstrate the benefits of our diverse portfolio in maintaining relative stability in times when economic challenges exist in certain of our end markets. What's clear is that the shape of our portfolio is changing. Specifically, those LOBs that are most impacted by global commodity price changes are representing a lower percentage of the profits of the company, while other businesses are expanding. Consequently, the position of our portfolio offers us 2 advantages at this point in time. First, we continue to be well-positioned to further leverage off of our strong position in those businesses that are not impacted by commodities; and two, we are at a point where further falloff in a commodity-oriented business is obviously less likely. As a result, there is real upside for these businesses when commodity prices do ultimately improve. This argues for relative stability in the short run with upside in the long run. 
Moving to Slide 14. We continue to be successful with our restructuring and efforts to improve financial discipline and performance. The restructuring that began in July of 2015 was aimed at simplifying the business and enhancing our cost effectiveness. Our LOB realignment and continued drive to identify cost savings allowed us to find additional cost savings opportunities over the course of the year. And the result, our final savings are expected to be in the range of $260 million to $270 million, with total cost approximating $390 million to $400 million. Relative to our cash cost and savings, our payback is slightly less than 1 year. 
I am pleased to report that we are on track to obtain the full run rate of these savings in fiscal year '17, and the reduction in adjusted G&A of $127 million we achieved in fiscal year '16 is evidence of this, especially when adding to the savings already realized in 2015. Further savings that we will realize in 2017 are important as it will allow us to reinvest back into the business to fund certain strategic investments in the company and to enhance our position to drive profitable growth in the long term. 
Finally, before turning it back over to Steve, Slide 16 provides a short update on our share buyback program activities for fiscal year '16. During the quarter, we continue to execute share buybacks in a balanced and steady manner, bringing the total repurchases for the fiscal year to 3.4 million shares for a total of $153 million. This represents a 3.7% reduction in shares outstanding for fiscal year '15. 
As you're aware, we have previously indicated that we expect to continue to spend the remainder of the $500 million share buyback in a relatively consistent manner over the remaining term of the 3-year program. We plan to provide an update on our use of cash and capital structure strategy at our 2016 Investor Day next week on Thursday, December 1. 
With that, let me hand it back over to Steve for closing comments."

We expect challenging market conditions to continue into fiscal year 2017. Weak growth in developed markets, geopolitical issues and uncertain commodity prices will continue to impact some of our end markets. 
Much like the beginning of last year, our oil and gas, mining and certain industrial clients are continuing to avoid large capital expenditures to convert -- conserve cash. We do believe most of the declines in these end markets are now behind us, but it remains to be seen when industry growth will return in these sectors. More positively, we saw select growth opportunities in our Buildings & Infrastructure, Aerospace & Technology and life sciences markets in fiscal year 2016, and we expect further growth in these end markets in 2017. 
As we progress throughout fiscal year 2016, we saw our backlog stabilize and then increase by the fourth quarter, and we expect further increases to our backlog as we progress through fiscal year 2017. We also remain heavily focused on improving margins. The restructuring we have undertaken over the past several quarters continues to provide momentum and supports our ability to invest back in our profitable growth agenda. We are seeing improvements in our project delivery efforts and write-offs continue to be reduced across the board.  
Finally, our efforts to improve our financial performance in 2016, and particularly our operating profits, gives us confidence in a more stable outlook for fiscal year 2017. Consequently, we're providing initial guidance between $3 and $3.30 for adjusted EPS, which provides for operating profit growth in a continuing challenged market environment and includes a set of largely onetime investments of $0.15 per share to support our growth strategy. 
As Kevin mentioned, our strategic review is complete, and we look forward to our discussions next week at our Investor Day on December 1, where we will outline our strategy for long-term sustainable shareholder value. With that, I'd like to thank you for listening, and we'll now open it up for questions."

Look, we're very pleased with the amount of progress. A lot of hard work within the lines of businesses to really gain some momentum at the -- in the back half of the year, specifically on improving our DSO, that doesn't just automatically happen. I do think that our year-end position is really quite good. And the way we think about driving long-term working capital benefits and specifically accounts receivable isn't about a point in time, it's about an average level. So that we ultimately are able to have a sustainable level of working capital. So having said all of that, I would not perceive us being able to necessarily have the kind of free cash flow that we saw in 2016 per se, but we are planning on continuing to drive DSO improvements in 2017. It will be part of our financial metrics. We'll talk a little bit more about this in our Investor Day next week, but we still think there's opportunities to improve and, longer term, be a more efficient capital investment behind our business, which ultimately will increase our return on invested capital."

Can you talk about the confidence that you have in these markets maybe beginning to pick up after we did get some positive referendum spending?

And those are 3 states where we believe we're -- provide leadership and strong capabilities. So we were bullish on our capabilities to grow in transportation regardless of the election outcome. And so we're pleased to see a lot of the positive hype around what's going on with the Trump expectations. But we're positive about moving forward in transportation. And when we talk about transportation, by the way, we think of not only highways, but we think of rail, where we've got a very strong position. And then the broader aero -- aviation sector where we're seeing the big benefits of how we've integrated Buildings & Infrastructure because, as you know, when we get into aviation projects, it's a combination of infrastructure, but as well as building facilities. And our new line of business structure has given us the capability to leverage off of certain strengths regionally and take those strengths globally. And I think you're going to see us win projects around the world over the next several quarters that are going to be very exciting."

So in general, we're seeing a reduction in 2016 and also into 2017, so we holistically are seeing a reduction. As it relates to the specific question on mining, you know that, that business is really quite challenged right now. We're not doing much work, and a lot of the work that we are doing is sustaining capital-related activities. Plus obviously, we have the new project that we announced up in Mongolia. I think that was last quarter or a quarter before. So I think we're well-positioned as it relates

So I think the revenue is a tough metric for our company, because as you know, we have certain businesses we win with pass-through revenue, and we typically like to focus in on the professional services side where we get good margin. And we've shifted our strategy, as we go forward, that we're going to be much more conscious of the total margin. And therefore, whether it's professional services or the field services side, we're expecting to drive margin improvement. And as a result, you're seeing the effect, to some extent, of our strategy mix of really focusing on margin as we also drive down cost and all the things that we've talked about for fiscal year '16. But as we move into '17, we are talking about the whole shift of -- and pivoting to growth, and we feel like it's pretty broad-based. As you saw, we got backlog growth in our Petroleum & Chemicals business, which I think is an extremely successful achievement in light of the tough conditions. And that's because of a successful strategy shift to really focus on petrochemicals. A lion's share of our wins are coming in petrochemicals. We continue to see a very robust pipeline of activity in petrochemicals. And again, our new line of business structure has given us the opportunity to really globalize and expand beyond our previous core client focus to a much larger set of customers. So we see that in Petroleum & Chemicals. I think we gave you a sense that Building and Infrastructure, we're pretty bullish globally. And we're actually leading the way in growth in Australia. Our Australia team, on the backs of what came out of the political situation last year, has really driven some spending increase across that country, and we're now seeing momentum in the U.S. and the U.K. as well, so very positive on Buildings & Infrastructure. Aerospace & Technology, one thing in that business we all need to remind ourselves about is that from 2010 to 2015, there was a 25% decline in federal defense spending in the U.S. And in spite of that, we held our backlog up. And now, as we've progressed our strategy and we've seen stabilization of that spending and we're gaining market share in what's a very large spend in government services in the U.S. especially, we believe as we get through 2017, we're going to actually see backlog growth and revenue growth. I think, the area that right now is, I'd say, more stable is the overall industrial segment because that is made up of a lot of different businesses and there's a bit of a timing going on, on when we win the next wave of pharma projects as we burn off some backlog in that business. So that's kind of the overall story of sales growth."

Maybe augmenting Steve's commentary, specifically started as discussion relative to that focus on margin and that we're looking really to focus on driving a profitable growth agenda as opposed to just a growth agenda, so that's an important point that he made. The other note that is important to understand is as we look at this focus of pivoting to our profitable growth agenda, I would say in those businesses, specifically Petroleum & Chemicals, we're still comparing to some pretty big year-ago numbers, and the stabilization of that business is happening as we speak. So as we progress over the course of 2017, we would expect that, that pivot to growth will actually play out hopefully in the Petroleum & Chemicals business. But at least in the near term, there will be some pressure points in the first quarters of the year."

And -- but we're not going to take our eye off the cost ball, and we still believe that we have several productivity efficiency steps that we can implement on an ongoing basis like all great companies do. But it's really to move away from a mindset of restructuring to productivity, and with a large effort around now taking that leaner cost structure and winning more business because of the competitiveness that, that brought us. As far as the postelection situation, again, I feel like I've commented on that Jamie, that with everything we were doing to position ourselves for growth, we attribute the momentum to that activity and less around the early stages of postelection. Are we optimistic? Yes. Do we hope all the stuff we read about happens? Of course. And we've seen what the Australian elections have done, and we hope that same thing happens in the U.S. And in fact, Theresa May's administration in the U.K. is reaffirming several of the important nuclear and other projects in that region that are important to us. And so we feel good about what's going on globally around the political side of positioning our business. With regard to Motiva, the arbitration process continues.

And therefore, still maintaining a very strong diversity of end market participation, but I think a much more focused, strategic area. And we're going to highlight what those markets are next week. They clearly involve building an infrastructure markets. But even within that big B& sector, there's going to be priority targets. Aerospace & Technology, of course, is going to lead the way, and you're going to hear about the focus there and how we're going to extend into some new areas outside of our current situation.

Last year, we recognized the need to really drive cash and put DSO and working capital in our management incentive compensation target, and we're going to maintain that going into 2017 because we believe there's -- as Kevin said, there's more working capital efficiency out there. But as we pivot to growth, we now want to do the same thing with backlog growth specifically. And I think, you hit the nail on the head, that is profitable growth. And so as we look at backlog growth, without getting into the specifics, what our board is going to hold us accountable for is actually the gross margin in that backlog growth. So it is going to be aimed at profitable backlog growth. And we've put new systems and tools in place to be able to measure that growth, which kind of goes to the last question is, as we talk about margin focus, and it's still in a very tough environment, I think the major difference moving forward is we now have the ability to measure profitability by client, by office in many other ways in a much better way than we had a few years ago.

Welcome to our Fiscal Year 2016 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Before we move into the financials, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the recently completed fiscal year 2016. Over the past year, while facing challenging conditio",3142,"Thank you, Kevin. Welcome to our Fiscal Year 2016 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Before we move into the financials, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the recently completed fiscal year 2016. 
Over the past year, while facing challenging conditions in several of our key end markets, we took the opportunity to implement a set of key improvement initiatives that significantly strengthened our foundation and positions us for success moving forward. The most important steps taken involved reorganizing the 4 global lines of business; implementing a major restructuring to rightsize the company and become more cost-efficient; and developing a corporate strategy aimed at profitably growing Jacobs. While undertaking these initiatives, we also implemented a number of changes designed to increase accountability and transparency to drive greater financial discipline, in turn significantly optimizing cost and working capital, allowing us to reinvest in Jacobs to upgrade articles and processes to further strengthen the business and delivery of projects for our clients.  Our efforts to transform the core is driving a renewed sense of urgency and energy across our company to deliver business improvements across the globe. 
While much has and continues to be done to positively change Jacobs, we're also cognizant of our very successful past. Since 1947 when Joe Jacobs founded our great company, Jacobs was headquartered in Pasadena, California, and enjoyed decades of the impressive growth. In recent years, as we faced challenges to sustain growth, we recognized the need to transform our business and structure. One of the many steps identified was a new headquarters location. As such, last month, we announced our relocation to Dallas, Texas, which fits with our plans to drive efficiency, attract top talent and achieve a more convenient access to best serve our clients.
Moving to Slide 5 and a summary of our business performance. Kevin will cover more details regarding our solid fourth quarter in a minute. But on this slide, I'd like to summarize our 2016 total year performance.  For the year, revenue was right at $11 billion. And on adjusted basis, earnings per share was $3.08, which is above the midpoint of our initial fiscal year 2016 guidance range. As such, we're pleased we were able to consistently deliver for each quarter and for the full year against our internal expectations. 
During fiscal year 2016, we continue to see adverse market conditions across multiple lines of business, particularly in our petroleum and chemicals and mining markets, and these were major contributors to the year-over-year revenue decline in both the fourth quarter and total fiscal year. We also faced competitive pricing pressures and cyclical economic patterns in certain key markets, which negatively impacted our revenue mix. However, as the year progressed, we started to build momentum due in part to our more focused global line of business structure and began to win more business as evidenced by the $438 million increase in our backlog at the end of our fourth quarter and the improved year-over-year margins generated in the second half of the year. 
I'm very pleased with how the entire Jacobs team has been relentless on improving various financial metrics as we saw considerable improvement across multiple KPIs during the year. Specifically, the restructuring initiative drove down our global adjusted SG&A cost by more than 9%, reducing cost by $127 million. And our efforts to improve our working capital position resulted in a significant increase in operating cash flows, in fact, resulting in the largest ever annual free cash flow in the history of Jacobs. Just as positively, we also achieved our first year-end net positive cash position since fiscal year 2013. Much of this was achieved through acute focus on our accounts receivables and improving our DSO, which decreased 7 days versus prior year. Our focus on greater project delivery excellence also assisted in the improved margins we saw in the second half. Given our positive cash flow performance, we continued our efforts to return capital to our shareholders in the form of $153 million of purchases from our share buyback program. 
Moving to Slide 6. I'm extremely pleased with where our total backlog stands at the end of the fourth quarter, $18.8 billion, a significant sequential increase of nearly $440 million versus the prior quarter. Our backlog is now less than 2% off of our previous record of $19.1 billion. Also noteworthy is that our current backlog includes $182 million in negative foreign exchange movements when compared to the year-ago figure. So when adjusting for this, our backlog would, in fact, be up $137 million versus last year. Also positively, the professional services component of our backlog stood at $12 billion at fiscal year-end, the highest since June of 2015 and a positive sign to support higher margins going forward. Overall, we're pleased with our sales performance under the tough macro conditions faced by several of our lines of business, and the improvement in backlog across the portfolio is representative of our more disciplined approach and focus on leveraging synergies across the company to drive growth. 
Over the next 4 slides, I'll provide more specifics on each of our lines of business, but the key messages around our sales efforts going forward are as follows: Number one, we believe we're poised for further backlog growth as we move through 2017; secondly, we're focused on adding higher-value sales to backlog to drive long-term margin improvement. And we're holding ourselves accountable for this. We've added an annual management incentive measurement that will monitor our progress against profitably growing our backlog. 
Turning to Slide 7, the summary of our Aerospace & Technology line of business, where backlog remains steady at $5.1 billion versus last quarter, but higher by $230 million year-over-year.  Program funding with our various customers remains generally stable and represents a large and diverse market, providing significant opportunity for market share growth. Defense spending, and particularly --  particular in the U.S., U.K. and Australia is expected to remain large and stable in the face of dynamic political circumstances, including the U.S. presidential election and the recent Brexit vote in the U.K. As previously reported, we continue to have a number of awarded contracts with significant value not yet backlogged due to competitor protests. 
In this line of business for the last 12 to 18 months, we've been primarily focused on core client program rebids and have, for the most part, been very successful based on a strong track record of performance and our lean cost structure. I'm particularly pleased with the mix of business our Aerospace & Technology team has achieved, both in terms of our successful rebids as well as recent high-value new business wins. This is reflected on our operating margins as this business improved to 7.7% of revenue in fiscal year 2016 versus 7% in the prior year. We're now shifting focus to a strong new business pipeline of opportunities valued at over $20 billion, the largest we've ever experienced for this market. While protracted procurement timelines exacerbated by persistent protests are expected to continue, we believe significant organic growth potential exists in Aerospace & Technology.  With regard to specific market sectors, Homeland Security, cyber and intelligence-related industries, remains strong areas of national priority spend. We continue to build momentum and bringing our services in these markets to other lines of business in Jacobs and have positive success engaging several commercial clients. 
In U.S. environmental services, our rebid win of the 10-year $350 million remedial action contract for New Bedford Harbor with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers further solidifies our base in this market. This, coupled with a dominant position in places like Alaska, where a significant federal spend for environmental services provide a foundation to expand into other government customer bases and geographies. At the same time, we continue to expand our business base with Jacobs' traditional commercial sector customers who have significant environmental-related spend. 
In the U.K., the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority funding is projected to be steady around $20 billion over the next 5 years, and much of this funding will go to the Sellafield facility. Our nuclear cleanup group continues to support efforts here. And with our strong delivery performance, we are well-positioned for much of the continuing work. 
Also in the U.K., the final sanctioning of the Hinkley Point C nuclear newbuild project has been completed. The recent approval is obviously an important and positive milestone for the program and is expected to have positive ramifications on the prospects of sanctioning approvals for the horizon of new gen nuclear newbuild programs as well.  As previously reported, we've already been awarded a major framework for the Hinckley C program and we're supporting its development. All 3 nuclear build programs in the U.K. have expressed their intent to continue forward in light of the Brexit vote, and these provide good opportunities for Jacobs. 
Moving to Slide 8. During the fourth quarter, we experienced positive momentum across the globe in Buildings & Infrastructure. For the first time in several quarters, our backlog increased by $190 million to $5.1 billion versus the third quarter and is also up $310 million versus this time last fiscal year. The general buildings market remains steady and we have successfully been growing our position as we continue to target bright spots in selected markets. We are seeing increased opportunities in the health care market, specifically in the U.S. and New Zealand, which we'll be announcing shortly. 
Our market leadership position in the government building sector continues to grow with strategic wins at both the federal level with the U.S. Navy and the state level with customers such as the state of California and the city of Los Angeles. We continue to make great progress in this area and look forward to continuing this aspect of our business. 
The education sector represents one of our highest potential subsectors for growth with emerging opportunities in Asia-Pacific, specifically in Australia and New Zealand and continued growth in the U.S. with several recent bond measures receiving approval in the Midwest and West Coast. We're also utilizing our knowledge base in the sector to enhance our value proposition for large-scale smart cities emerging near Melbourne with the Australian Education City and also in Birmingham, England.  Finally, we're happy to announce our selection as a platform partner for The Rockefeller Foundation-sponsored 100 Resilient Cities program. The program is looking to drive remediation actions in member cities around the world faced with physical, social and economic challenges. 
On the infrastructure side, the global transportation market remains steady, and we're using our strong position to capitalize on a number of opportunities. In aviation specifically, we're leveraging our well-established capabilities to target investments locally and abroad. Positively, we had recent wins at Denver International Airport for critical design build projects; at Washington Dulles Airport for Phase 2 rail expansion; and at LAX for terminal development work. We're also progressing several other international opportunities that we expect to announce soon. 
Within the U.S. highway sector, federal spending remains flat and most developments are being driven by regional design packages. Texas, Florida and California transport departments dominate the local spend, and we're well-positioned since these states are strong Jacobs markets. 
The Australia and U.K. markets continue to be buoyant, and we're forecasting increased government and local authority investment. Some notable recent highway wins across the globe include the Darlington upgrade project in Australia, a professional services contract for transport from Greater Manchester and a construction inspection services contract for the New Jersey Department of Transportation. The U.K. rail market also continues to see significant investment, and we're providing PMCM services on large metro projects in the Middle East. 
In the U.S., we see opportunities across California, Seattle and the Northeast corridor. Australia is also a growth region, as well as Asia. We had a number of exciting wins in the fourth quarter, including the U.K. Network Rail, the Level Crossing Removal Authority program in Melbourne and the L.A. County Purple Line Extension. In the water market, we have a moderate position and are leveraging our expertise in the U.K. and Australia to grow our position globally. We've just completed 2 major projects in Australia and won several other projects, including the United utilities AMP6 asset management program in the U.K. and the St. Louis Sewer District watershed management design project in the U.S. 
And now on Slide 9 and the summary of our industrial line of business. In the fourth quarter, we saw positive wins in several markets that offset much of the strong life science backlog burn. As a result, quarter end backlog remained near steady at $3.1 billion. While the mining and mineral sector remains weak, we are seeing some indications that eventual recovery may begin. In South America specifically, investments totaling $49 billion are projected in Chile over the next 10 years. And in Argentina, there's approximately $5 billion of projects expected to be announced by the end of 2018. 
Despite strong competition and sustaining capital work, we're also seeing more proposal activities for studies and evaluations, although this is in part driven by some of our competitors exiting the market. Positively, in the fourth quarter, we secured an engineering services contract for a treatment plant in South America; we won an underground study in Chile; and were awarded a position on the global engineering panel in Australasia, which puts us in a strong position to capture additional opportunities. 
The life science sector remains robust. Expansion continues in biologics and secondary manufacturing  opportunities are also increasing. We are currently capitalizing on the second wave of biotech plant design efforts and expect a third wave from other major companies to meet pipeline products currently in Phase II clinical trials. Our global manufacturing facility expertise in emerging areas such as cell and gene therapy is also being sought after, as clients shift their focus to small-scale manufacturing approaches using disposable technology. Geographically, major CapEx spend continues in Ireland, where we are growing market share through concerted efforts to expand our life sciences presence in Germany and Switzerland, along with the West Coast of the U.S. The India market remains flat, although we expect activity to increase next year as new incumbents plan investments in biosimilars. 
Opportunities in our consumer product and manufacturing clients are -- also increased during the fourth quarter and we're seeing growth opportunities as we establish new alliances in the consumer goods market. Most exciting was the contract award to provide design service for Vastly's $2 billion tissue and fertilizer investment in Virginia, the single largest Chinese greenfield economic development project in the U.S. This award is indicative of the upward investment trend in pulp and paper, particularly as established European and Chinese companies expand in the U.S. and is welcome news for us as we have a strong history and reputation supporting the sector's largest producers. 
Our field services business is seeing an increase in project activity, particularly in the U.S. Gulf Coast. In addition to several petrochemical wins, we secured a 4-year framework agreement with a new client in the private sector water market which will have a positive effect for adjacency work in our Buildings & Infrastructure line of business. Sales activity is also increasing in stand-alone construction capabilities, and we are seeing an uptick in opportunities with clients in the U.S. and Canada for sustaining capital services.  With expansion in Morocco's transport energy and residential commercial sectors, we are leveraging our relationship with our joint venture partner, OCP, to include mid-cap EPC and maintenance opportunities. We anticipate this can be an area of growth for our field services sector in fiscal year 2017. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our Petroleum & Chemicals line of business saw a significant backlog increase of $361 million over the quarter and is now at $5.5 billion, near the year-ago backlog level. Upstream oil and gas markets remain weak, although we're seeing signs of stabilization with oil prices hovering in the $45 to $50 range over the past 6 months. Inventory builds appear to be flattening and OPEC is again talking production caps, although high inventories and a quick return in production from proven oil reserves will likely moderate crude prices. Established producers continue to make necessary investments to maintain production, but budgets will only begin to increase as balance sheets stabilize and producers gain confidence that prices can be sustained above $50 a barrel. 
With the increased production of shale oil, condensates and natural gas liquids in the U.S., we're more focused on pursuing opportunities in the midstream arena. Process and pipeline infrastructure needs to be put into place to move these barrels to market. Additionally, propane, butane and naphtha oversupply in the U.S. Gulf Coast is forecast to continue, which will require additional export infrastructure or conversion capacity to alleviate. The global excess of LNG will also renew efforts to develop alternative markets. Central, South America, Asia and Africa are likely targets for gas to power and small gas distribution projects, and additional LNG penetration is likely into the transportation fuel markets, sparking new projects. 
The refining market is comparatively steady, although profitability is at lower levels than 18 months ago. And consequently, this will impact capital spend over the near term. Despite this, we're seeing continuing opportunities at maintenance, turnaround, efficiency improvement and regulatory projects, particularly as we expand our J Pro [ph] initiative, our new safety, reliability and process optimization service offering. In the U.S., there continues to be increased focus on process safety and octane improvement projects, while the U.S. refining margins also continue to be supported by product exports to Latin America. 
As previously reported, we continue to see feasibility study requests in developing countries across Asia and Africa, and the recent decision by the International Maritime Organization's Marine Environmental Protection Committee confirmed reinforcement of regulations to reduce the global sulfur cap on bunker fuel from 2020. Grassroots refining opportunities are also developing in India and South Asia, driven by growth for clean transportation fuels. 
The downstream petrochemicals market remains strong, and we continue to expect multiple investments in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Middle East.  We're seeing interest from Saudi Arabia and elsewhere regarding development of crude oil to chemical projects, and there's increased focus on diversification. Moving away from first-line commodity chemicals, ethane, LPG and naphtha feedstocks, are also plentiful and relatively cheap and will provide economic incentives for project development. This is a global trend, which is driven by the excess of petchem feedstocks being exported from the U.S.  We had several exciting wins in the quarter, including a confidential grassroots chemical facility in the U.S. Gulf Coast; an engineering contract for TransCanada; an EPC contract with INEOS for a Linear alpha olefin unit in Texas; and a refinery upgrade FEED project for the Singapore Refining Company. 
With that, I'll now pass it to Kevin discuss the financials in more detail."

Turning now to Slide 11, you will see a more detailed summary of our financial performance over the quarter and fiscal year 2016. As we have communicated throughout the current fiscal year, adverse market conditions in certain end markets",1507,"Thanks, Steve. Turning now to Slide 11, you will see a more detailed summary of our financial performance over the quarter and fiscal year 2016. 
As we have communicated throughout the current fiscal year, adverse market conditions in certain end markets continued to negatively impact certain of our businesses. As a result of these ongoing pressures, particularly in oil and gas, our revenue for the quarter was $2.6 billion, down approximately 15% versus our fourth quarter last year. For the year, revenue was $11 billion, down 10% versus last year.  EPS on an adjusted basis was $0.77, which excludes $0.53 per share in after-tax restructuring and other charges, which are comprised of after-tax charges of $0.30 per share in connection with our restructuring activities that began in fiscal year 2015, a $0.14 per share loss on the sale of our French subsidiary as a result of our strategic decision to exit our French operations, and a $0.09 per share noncash write-off on an equity investment. While the adjusted EPS of $0.77 for the fiscal year -- fiscal quarter 4 was lower than the $0.80 reported in the comparable quarter last year, note that fiscal year '15 included a 53 -- a 53rd week, excuse me, in our Q4 results in 2015, which added approximately a $0.03 per share benefit to the year-ago quarter. 
Book-to-bill on a trailing 12-month basis continued to improve over the course of fiscal year '16 and ended at a high for the year at 1.0x. Q4 gross margin percentage was up 120 basis points versus the year-ago quarter, indicative of our improving execution and focus on cost discipline. Importantly, our gross margin percentage for our professional services business continued the positive trend that we had seen earlier this year. Specifically, this helped increase our consolidated gross margin percentage in the second half of 2016 by 70 basis points versus the same period of 2015. 
For the full year, adjusted G&A was reduced by $127 million versus the last fiscal year, or an improvement of 9.3%; again, a positive indication of our success in rightsizing the company and driving cost efficiencies. Our adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $134 million, an improvement of 25 basis points on an operating profit margin basis versus the fourth quarter of 2015. Specifically in the second half of 2016, our improving traction and financial discipline resulted in our operating profit margin improving the second half of 2015 by 30 basis points to 5.2%.  
Finally, our efforts to improve our accounts receivable efficiencies saw our DSO improving to 70 days at year-end versus 77 last year, as noted earlier by Steve. As a result, free cash flow also continued to improve totaling $213 million for the quarter, an improvement of $134 million versus the fourth quarter of 2015. For the year, free cash flow reached $612 million, up $216 million versus year ago and the highest in the history of the company. At fiscal year-end, the company's net cash position now stands at $268 million, an improvement of $140 million from the last quarter sequentially and a more significant $405 million turnaround from last fiscal year end. 
So turning to Slide 12. You will see the Q4 and fiscal year '16 adjusted segment financials for our 4 lines of businesses. As you can see, 2 of our 4 business lines increased their segment operating profit versus the year-ago quarter. Importantly, 3 of our LOBs improved their adjusted operating profit margins both for the quarter and for the full year versus the year-ago periods. 
Regarding Aerospace & Technology, while we did see a decline in adjusted operating profit versus the fourth quarter of fiscal year '15, the adjusted operating profit for the entire fiscal year held near flat despite a decrease in revenues on account of a 70 basis point improvement in margins for the year. The improvement in the margin profile over the year was driven by strong performance fees, particularly in Q3, and by an overall improvement in the margin mix of this line of business. 
The Buildings & Infrastructure business also saw revenue decline in Q4 versus the year-ago period, but adjusted segment operating profit actually increased by a significant 79% and finished up 20% for the whole of fiscal year 2016. This was driven by significant improvements in project execution which allowed higher project margins versus a more challenged Q4 and full year in 2015. As a result, the operating profit margin for this business was up 380 basis points in Q4 and 190 basis points for the full year versus the year-ago periods. 
The industrial line of business saw an increase in revenues for the quarter of 12% versus the year ago quarter, supporting a near 11% increase for the fiscal year, driven by strong performance in our life science business. Despite this, adjusted segment operating profit was down 54% versus last year's Q4 when compared to the year-ago period and down 36% for the fiscal year. 2016 challenges were related to several project disputes and client settlements in Q2 and Q4 of 2016, primarily in our mining businesses. In addition, last year had a significant benefit in Q2 associated with successful closeouts associated with several large projects. 
Lastly, our Petroleum & Chemicals line of business saw a 33% decline in revenue for Q4 versus the year-ago period, but a far more positive 6% increase in adjusted operating profit over the same period. The fall in revenue was also apparent for the full year given the challenging end market dynamics. Despite these challenges, segment operating profit margins actually increased by 180 basis points for the quarter and by 60 basis points for the full year versus the year-ago like periods, a clear indication of the strong focus on cost efficiencies and restructuring in this line of business. 
So moving to Slide 13. You will see the split of revenues in segment operating profit by each LOB. As discussed over the past several quarters, the strength in some of our lines of businesses, such as Buildings & Infrastructure and Aerospace & Technology, demonstrate the benefits of our diverse portfolio in maintaining relative stability in times when economic challenges exist in certain of our end markets. What's clear is that the shape of our portfolio is changing. Specifically, those LOBs that are most impacted by global commodity price changes are representing a lower percentage of the profits of the company, while other businesses are expanding. Consequently, the position of our portfolio offers us 2 advantages at this point in time. First, we continue to be well-positioned to further leverage off of our strong position in those businesses that are not impacted by commodities; and two, we are at a point where further falloff in a commodity-oriented business is obviously less likely. As a result, there is real upside for these businesses when commodity prices do ultimately improve. This argues for relative stability in the short run with upside in the long run. 
Moving to Slide 14. We continue to be successful with our restructuring and efforts to improve financial discipline and performance. The restructuring that began in July of 2015 was aimed at simplifying the business and enhancing our cost effectiveness. Our LOB realignment and continued drive to identify cost savings allowed us to find additional cost savings opportunities over the course of the year. And the result, our final savings are expected to be in the range of $260 million to $270 million, with total cost approximating $390 million to $400 million. Relative to our cash cost and savings, our payback is slightly less than 1 year. 
I am pleased to report that we are on track to obtain the full run rate of these savings in fiscal year '17, and the reduction in adjusted G&A of $127 million we achieved in fiscal year '16 is evidence of this, especially when adding to the savings already realized in 2015. Further savings that we will realize in 2017 are important as it will allow us to reinvest back into the business to fund certain strategic investments in the company and to enhance our position to drive profitable growth in the long term. 
Finally, before turning it back over to Steve, Slide 16 provides a short update on our share buyback program activities for fiscal year '16. During the quarter, we continued to execute share buybacks in a balanced and steady manner, bringing the total repurchases for the fiscal year to 3.4 million shares for a total of $153 million. This represents a 3.7% reduction in shares outstanding for fiscal year '15.  As you are aware, we have previously indicated that we expect to continue to spend the remainder of the $500 million share buyback in a relatively consistent manner over the remaining term of the 3-year program. We plan to provide an update on our use of cash and capital structure strategy at our 2016 Investor Day next week on Thursday, December 1. 
With that, let me hand it back over to Steve for closing comments."

We expect challenging market conditions to continue into fiscal year 2017. Weak growth in developed markets, geopolitical issues and uncertain commodity prices will continue to impact some of our end markets. 
Much like the beginning of last year, our oil and gas, mining and certain industrial clients are continuing to avoid large capital expenditures to conserve cash. We do believe most of the declines in these end markets are now behind us, but it remains to be seen when industry growth will return in these sectors. More positively, we saw select growth opportunities in our Buildings & Infrastructure, Aerospace & Technology and life sciences markets in fiscal year 2016, and we expect further growth in these end markets in 2017. 
As we progressed through our fiscal year 2016, we saw our backlog stabilize and then increase by the fourth quarter, and we expect further increases to our backlog as we progress through fiscal year 2017. We also remain heavily focused on improving margins. The restructuring we have undertaken over the past several quarters continues to provide momentum and supports our ability to invest back in our profitable growth agenda. We are seeing improvements in our project delivery efforts and write-offs continue to be reduced across the board.  
Finally, our efforts to improve our financial performance in 2016, and particularly our operating profits, gives us confidence in a more stable outlook for fiscal year 2017. Consequently, we're providing initial guidance between $3 and $3.30 for adjusted EPS, which provides for operating profit growth in a continuing challenged market environment and includes a set of largely onetime investments of $0.15 per share to support our growth strategy.  As Kevin mentioned, our strategic review is complete, and we look forward to our discussions next week at our Investor Day on December 1, where we will outline our strategy for long-term sustainable shareholder value. 
With that, I'd like to thank you for listening, and we'll now open it up for questions."

Look, we're very pleased with the amount of progress. A lot of hard work within the lines of businesses to really gain some momentum at the -- in the back half of the year, specifically on improving our DSO, that doesn't just automatically happen. I do think that our year-end position is really quite good. And the way we think about driving long-term working capital benefits and specifically accounts receivable isn't about a point in time, it's about an average level, so that we ultimately are able to have a sustainable level of working capital. So having said all of that, I would not perceive us being able to necessarily have the kind of free cash flow that we saw in 2016 per se, but we are planning on continuing to drive DSO improvements in 2017. It will be part of our financial metrics. We'll talk a little bit more about this in our Investor Day next week, but we still think there's opportunities to improve and, longer term, be a more efficient capital investment behind our business, which ultimately will increase our return on invested capital."

And so we're pleased to see a lot of the positive hype around what's going on with the Trump expectations. But we're positive about moving forward in transportation. And when we talk about transportation, by the way, we think of not only highways, but we think of rail, where we've got a very strong position. And then the broader aviation sector where we're seeing the big benefits of how we've integrated Buildings & Infrastructure because, as you know, when we get into aviation projects, it's a combination of infrastructure, but as well as building facilities. And our new line of business structure has given us the capability to leverage off of certain strengths regionally and take those strengths globally. And I think you're going to see us win projects around the world over the next several quarters that are going to be very exciting."

So I think the revenue is a tough metric for our company, because as you know, we have certain businesses we win with pass-through revenue, and we typically like to focus in on the professional services side where we get good margin. And we've shifted our strategy, as we go forward, that we're going to be much more conscious of the total margin. And therefore, whether it's professional services or the field services side, we're expecting to drive margin improvement. And as a result, you're seeing the effect, to some extent, of a strategy mix of really focusing on margin as we also drive down cost and all the things that we've talked about for fiscal year '16. But as we move into '17, we are talking about the whole shift of -- and pivoting to growth, and we feel like it's pretty broad-based. As you saw, we got backlog growth in our Petroleum & Chemicals business, which I think is an extremely successful achievement in light of the tough conditions. And that's because of a successful strategy shift to really focus on petrochemicals. The lion's share of our wins are coming in petrochemicals. We continue to see a very robust pipeline of activity in petrochemicals. And again, our new line of business structure has given us the opportunity to really globalize and expand beyond our previous core client focus to a much larger set of customers. So we see that in Petroleum & Chemicals. I think we gave you a sense that Building and Infrastructure, we're pretty bullish globally. And we're actually leading the way in growth in Australia. Our Australia team, on the backs of what came out of the political situation last year, has really driven some spending increase across that country, and we're now seeing momentum in the U.S. and the U.K. as well, so very positive on Buildings & Infrastructure. Aerospace & Technology, one thing in that business we all need to remind ourselves about is that from 2010 to 2015, there was a 25% decline in federal defense spending in the U.S. And in spite of that, we held our backlog up. And now, as we've progressed our strategy and we've seen stabilization of that spending and we're gaining market share in what's a very large spend in government services in the U.S. especially, we believe as we get through 2017, we're going to actually see backlog growth and revenue growth. I think, the area that right now is, I'd say, more stable is the overall industrial segment because that is made up of a lot of different businesses and there's a bit of a timing going on, on when we win the next wave of pharma projects as we burn off some backlog in that business. So that's kind of the overall story of sales growth."

So as we progress over the course of 2017, we would expect that, that pivot to growth will actually play out hopefully in the Petroleum & Chemicals business.

So next week in Investor Day, we're going to lay out our growth strategy and talk a little more about that. But it's really near-term investments very heavily weighted toward the first quarter -- a large portion of it in the first quarter or third quarter of fiscal year. It involves a set of actions to ignite our strategy and position us for -- to achieve our 3-year goals that we're putting into our strategy. And it involves some external consultants that we're bringing in as part of our strategy execution. It involves a major neutral set in project controls and a few other areas of delivering projects. And also some systems enhancements that we're implementing as we speak. So again, very front end-loaded to the fiscal year, and we believe are going to be critical and measurable as far as how we achieve our 3-year growth strategy."

I'm just trying to figure out where we are in terms of the innings of the ballgame there. And then, I guess, my 2 other quick questions. While it's still very early, Steve, I think people are trying to figure sort of post the election, has the tone from customers changed at all, do you feel like, post-election? And then my last question, any update that you could provide on the Motiva arbitration?"

And as we move into 2017, I really want to emphasize, what we're talking about now is the pivot to growth. And -- but we're not going to take our eye off the cost ball, and we still believe that we have several productivity efficiency steps that we can implement on an ongoing basis like all great companies do. But it's really to move away from a mindset of restructuring to productivity, and with a large effort around now taking that leaner cost structure and winning more business because of the competitiveness that, that brought us. As far as the post-election situation, again, I feel like I've commented on that, Jamie, that with everything we were doing to position ourselves for growth, we attribute the momentum to that activity and less around the early stages of postelection. Are we optimistic? Yes. Do we hope all the stuff we read about happens? Of course. And we've seen what the Australian elections have done, and we hope that same thing happens in the U.S. And in fact, Theresa May's administration in the U.K. is reaffirming several of the important nuclear and other projects in that region that are important to us. And so we feel good about what's going on globally around the political side of positioning our business. With regard to Motiva, the arbitration process continues. We continue to feel very confident around that whole activity. And we hope in the near term, we'll be able to put that behind us and move forward."

And therefore, still maintaining a very strong diversity of end market participation, but I think a much more focused, strategic area. And we're going to highlight what those markets are next week. They clearly involve building in infrastructure markets. But even within that big B&I sector, there's going to be priority targets. Aerospace & Technology, of course, is going to lead the way, and you're going to hear about the focus there and how we're going to extend into some new areas outside of our current situation.

So there is specifically some challenges in Q1. And as it relates to your specific comment about the balance of the year, that's where we see the pivot that Steve has alluded to when we'll start to be able to see improved EPS growth in the back part of the year.

The backlog momentum is really across the board rather that any single projects. I think that's been traditionally Jacobs' strength, is that we're not over-reliant on large projects, that it really is built off of our strong end market diversity. And I think I covered that earlier, that we actually see it in most of our line of businesses and feel throughout the year that, that's going to happen. Last year, we recognized the need to really drive cash and put DSO and working capital in our management incentive compensation targets, and we're going to maintain that going into 2017 because we believe there's -- as Kevin said, there's more working capital efficiency out there. But as we pivot to growth, we now want to do the same thing with backlog growth specifically. And I think you hit the nail on the head, that is profitable growth. And so as we look at backlog growth, the -- without getting into the specifics, what our board is going to hold us accountable for is actually the gross margin in that backlog growth. So it is going to be aimed at profitable backlog growth. And we've put new systems and tools in place to be able to measure that growth, which kind of goes to the last question is, as we talk about margin focus, and it's still in a very tough environment, I think the major difference moving forward is we now have the ability to measure profitability by client, by office and many other ways, in a much better way than we had a few years ago.

Welcome to our Fiscal Year 2016 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Before we move into the financials, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the recently completed fiscal year 2016. Over the past year, while facing challenging conditio",3142,"Thank you, Kevin. Welcome to our Fiscal Year 2016 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Before we move into the financials, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the recently completed fiscal year 2016. 
Over the past year, while facing challenging conditions in several of our key end markets, we took the opportunity to implement a set of key improvement initiatives that significantly strengthened our foundation and positions us for success moving forward. The most important steps taken involved reorganizing the 4 global lines of business; implementing a major restructuring to rightsize the company and become more cost-efficient; and developing a corporate strategy aimed at profitably growing Jacobs. While undertaking these initiatives, we also implemented a number of changes designed to increase accountability and transparency to drive greater financial discipline, in turn significantly optimizing cost and working capital, allowing us to reinvest in Jacobs to upgrade articles and processes to further strengthen the business and delivery of projects for our clients.  Our efforts to transform the core is driving a renewed sense of urgency and energy across our company to deliver business improvements across the globe. 
While much has and continues to be done to positively change Jacobs, we're also cognizant of our very successful past. Since 1947 when Joe Jacobs founded our great company, Jacobs was headquartered in Pasadena, California, and enjoyed decades of the impressive growth. In recent years, as we faced challenges to sustain growth, we recognized the need to transform our business and structure. One of the many steps identified was a new headquarters location. As such, last month, we announced our relocation to Dallas, Texas, which fits with our plans to drive efficiency, attract top talent and achieve a more convenient access to best serve our clients.
Moving to Slide 5 and a summary of our business performance. Kevin will cover more details regarding our solid fourth quarter in a minute. But on this slide, I'd like to summarize our 2016 total year performance.  For the year, revenue was right at $11 billion. And on adjusted basis, earnings per share was $3.08, which is above the midpoint of our initial fiscal year 2016 guidance range. As such, we're pleased we were able to consistently deliver for each quarter and for the full year against our internal expectations. 
During fiscal year 2016, we continue to see adverse market conditions across multiple lines of business, particularly in our petroleum and chemicals and mining markets, and these were major contributors to the year-over-year revenue decline in both the fourth quarter and total fiscal year. We also faced competitive pricing pressures and cyclical economic patterns in certain key markets, which negatively impacted our revenue mix. However, as the year progressed, we started to build momentum due in part to our more focused global line of business structure and began to win more business as evidenced by the $438 million increase in our backlog at the end of our fourth quarter and the improved year-over-year margins generated in the second half of the year. 
I'm very pleased with how the entire Jacobs team has been relentless on improving various financial metrics as we saw considerable improvement across multiple KPIs during the year. Specifically, the restructuring initiative drove down our global adjusted SG&A cost by more than 9%, reducing cost by $127 million. And our efforts to improve our working capital position resulted in a significant increase in operating cash flows, in fact, resulting in the largest ever annual free cash flow in the history of Jacobs. Just as positively, we also achieved our first year-end net positive cash position since fiscal year 2013. Much of this was achieved through acute focus on our accounts receivables and improving our DSO, which decreased 7 days versus prior year. Our focus on greater project delivery excellence also assisted in the improved margins we saw in the second half. Given our positive cash flow performance, we continued our efforts to return capital to our shareholders in the form of $153 million of purchases from our share buyback program. 
Moving to Slide 6. I'm extremely pleased with where our total backlog stands at the end of the fourth quarter, $18.8 billion, a significant sequential increase of nearly $440 million versus the prior quarter. Our backlog is now less than 2% off of our previous record of $19.1 billion. Also noteworthy is that our current backlog includes $182 million in negative foreign exchange movements when compared to the year-ago figure. So when adjusting for this, our backlog would, in fact, be up $137 million versus last year. Also positively, the professional services component of our backlog stood at $12 billion at fiscal year-end, the highest since June of 2015 and a positive sign to support higher margins going forward. Overall, we're pleased with our sales performance under the tough macro conditions faced by several of our lines of business, and the improvement in backlog across the portfolio is representative of our more disciplined approach and focus on leveraging synergies across the company to drive growth. 
Over the next 4 slides, I'll provide more specifics on each of our lines of business, but the key messages around our sales efforts going forward are as follows: Number one, we believe we're poised for further backlog growth as we move through 2017; secondly, we're focused on adding higher-value sales to backlog to drive long-term margin improvement. And we're holding ourselves accountable for this. We've added an annual management incentive measurement that will monitor our progress against profitably growing our backlog. 
Turning to Slide 7, the summary of our Aerospace & Technology line of business, where backlog remains steady at $5.1 billion versus last quarter, but higher by $230 million year-over-year.  Program funding with our various customers remains generally stable and represents a large and diverse market, providing significant opportunity for market share growth. Defense spending, and particularly --  particular in the U.S., U.K. and Australia is expected to remain large and stable in the face of dynamic political circumstances, including the U.S. presidential election and the recent Brexit vote in the U.K. As previously reported, we continue to have a number of awarded contracts with significant value not yet backlogged due to competitor protests. 
In this line of business for the last 12 to 18 months, we've been primarily focused on core client program rebids and have, for the most part, been very successful based on a strong track record of performance and our lean cost structure. I'm particularly pleased with the mix of business our Aerospace & Technology team has achieved, both in terms of our successful rebids as well as recent high-value new business wins. This is reflected on our operating margins as this business improved to 7.7% of revenue in fiscal year 2016 versus 7% in the prior year. We're now shifting focus to a strong new business pipeline of opportunities valued at over $20 billion, the largest we've ever experienced for this market. While protracted procurement timelines exacerbated by persistent protests are expected to continue, we believe significant organic growth potential exists in Aerospace & Technology.  With regard to specific market sectors, Homeland Security, cyber and intelligence-related industries, remains strong areas of national priority spend. We continue to build momentum and bringing our services in these markets to other lines of business in Jacobs and have positive success engaging several commercial clients. 
In U.S. environmental services, our rebid win of the 10-year $350 million remedial action contract for New Bedford Harbor with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers further solidifies our base in this market. This, coupled with a dominant position in places like Alaska, where a significant federal spend for environmental services provide a foundation to expand into other government customer bases and geographies. At the same time, we continue to expand our business base with Jacobs' traditional commercial sector customers who have significant environmental-related spend. 
In the U.K., the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority funding is projected to be steady around $20 billion over the next 5 years, and much of this funding will go to the Sellafield facility. Our nuclear cleanup group continues to support efforts here. And with our strong delivery performance, we are well-positioned for much of the continuing work. 
Also in the U.K., the final sanctioning of the Hinkley Point C nuclear newbuild project has been completed. The recent approval is obviously an important and positive milestone for the program and is expected to have positive ramifications on the prospects of sanctioning approvals for the horizon of new gen nuclear newbuild programs as well.  As previously reported, we've already been awarded a major framework for the Hinckley C program and we're supporting its development. All 3 nuclear build programs in the U.K. have expressed their intent to continue forward in light of the Brexit vote, and these provide good opportunities for Jacobs. 
Moving to Slide 8. During the fourth quarter, we experienced positive momentum across the globe in Buildings & Infrastructure. For the first time in several quarters, our backlog increased by $190 million to $5.1 billion versus the third quarter and is also up $310 million versus this time last fiscal year. The general buildings market remains steady and we have successfully been growing our position as we continue to target bright spots in selected markets. We are seeing increased opportunities in the health care market, specifically in the U.S. and New Zealand, which we'll be announcing shortly. 
Our market leadership position in the government building sector continues to grow with strategic wins at both the federal level with the U.S. Navy and the state level with customers such as the state of California and the city of Los Angeles. We continue to make great progress in this area and look forward to continuing this aspect of our business. 
The education sector represents one of our highest potential subsectors for growth with emerging opportunities in Asia-Pacific, specifically in Australia and New Zealand and continued growth in the U.S. with several recent bond measures receiving approval in the Midwest and West Coast. We're also utilizing our knowledge base in the sector to enhance our value proposition for large-scale smart cities emerging near Melbourne with the Australian Education City and also in Birmingham, England.  Finally, we're happy to announce our selection as a platform partner for The Rockefeller Foundation-sponsored 100 Resilient Cities program. The program is looking to drive remediation actions in member cities around the world faced with physical, social and economic challenges. 
On the infrastructure side, the global transportation market remains steady, and we're using our strong position to capitalize on a number of opportunities. In aviation specifically, we're leveraging our well-established capabilities to target investments locally and abroad. Positively, we had recent wins at Denver International Airport for critical design build projects; at Washington Dulles Airport for Phase 2 rail expansion; and at LAX for terminal development work. We're also progressing several other international opportunities that we expect to announce soon. 
Within the U.S. highway sector, federal spending remains flat and most developments are being driven by regional design packages. Texas, Florida and California transport departments dominate the local spend, and we're well-positioned since these states are strong Jacobs markets. 
The Australia and U.K. markets continue to be buoyant, and we're forecasting increased government and local authority investment. Some notable recent highway wins across the globe include the Darlington upgrade project in Australia, a professional services contract for transport from Greater Manchester and a construction inspection services contract for the New Jersey Department of Transportation. The U.K. rail market also continues to see significant investment, and we're providing PMCM services on large metro projects in the Middle East. 
In the U.S., we see opportunities across California, Seattle and the Northeast corridor. Australia is also a growth region, as well as Asia. We had a number of exciting wins in the fourth quarter, including the U.K. Network Rail, the Level Crossing Removal Authority program in Melbourne and the L.A. County Purple Line Extension. In the water market, we have a moderate position and are leveraging our expertise in the U.K. and Australia to grow our position globally. We've just completed 2 major projects in Australia and won several other projects, including the United utilities AMP6 asset management program in the U.K. and the St. Louis Sewer District watershed management design project in the U.S. 
And now on Slide 9 and the summary of our industrial line of business. In the fourth quarter, we saw positive wins in several markets that offset much of the strong life science backlog burn. As a result, quarter end backlog remained near steady at $3.1 billion. While the mining and mineral sector remains weak, we are seeing some indications that eventual recovery may begin. In South America specifically, investments totaling $49 billion are projected in Chile over the next 10 years. And in Argentina, there's approximately $5 billion of projects expected to be announced by the end of 2018. 
Despite strong competition and sustaining capital work, we're also seeing more proposal activities for studies and evaluations, although this is in part driven by some of our competitors exiting the market. Positively, in the fourth quarter, we secured an engineering services contract for a treatment plant in South America; we won an underground study in Chile; and were awarded a position on the global engineering panel in Australasia, which puts us in a strong position to capture additional opportunities. 
The life science sector remains robust. Expansion continues in biologics and secondary manufacturing  opportunities are also increasing. We are currently capitalizing on the second wave of biotech plant design efforts and expect a third wave from other major companies to meet pipeline products currently in Phase II clinical trials. Our global manufacturing facility expertise in emerging areas such as cell and gene therapy is also being sought after, as clients shift their focus to small-scale manufacturing approaches using disposable technology. Geographically, major CapEx spend continues in Ireland, where we are growing market share through concerted efforts to expand our life sciences presence in Germany and Switzerland, along with the West Coast of the U.S. The India market remains flat, although we expect activity to increase next year as new incumbents plan investments in biosimilars. 
Opportunities in our consumer product and manufacturing clients are -- also increased during the fourth quarter and we're seeing growth opportunities as we establish new alliances in the consumer goods market. Most exciting was the contract award to provide design service for Vastly's $2 billion tissue and fertilizer investment in Virginia, the single largest Chinese greenfield economic development project in the U.S. This award is indicative of the upward investment trend in pulp and paper, particularly as established European and Chinese companies expand in the U.S. and is welcome news for us as we have a strong history and reputation supporting the sector's largest producers. 
Our field services business is seeing an increase in project activity, particularly in the U.S. Gulf Coast. In addition to several petrochemical wins, we secured a 4-year framework agreement with a new client in the private sector water market which will have a positive effect for adjacency work in our Buildings & Infrastructure line of business. Sales activity is also increasing in stand-alone construction capabilities, and we are seeing an uptick in opportunities with clients in the U.S. and Canada for sustaining capital services.  With expansion in Morocco's transport energy and residential commercial sectors, we are leveraging our relationship with our joint venture partner, OCP, to include mid-cap EPC and maintenance opportunities. We anticipate this can be an area of growth for our field services sector in fiscal year 2017. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our Petroleum & Chemicals line of business saw a significant backlog increase of $361 million over the quarter and is now at $5.5 billion, near the year-ago backlog level. Upstream oil and gas markets remain weak, although we're seeing signs of stabilization with oil prices hovering in the $45 to $50 range over the past 6 months. Inventory builds appear to be flattening and OPEC is again talking production caps, although high inventories and a quick return in production from proven oil reserves will likely moderate crude prices. Established producers continue to make necessary investments to maintain production, but budgets will only begin to increase as balance sheets stabilize and producers gain confidence that prices can be sustained above $50 a barrel. 
With the increased production of shale oil, condensates and natural gas liquids in the U.S., we're more focused on pursuing opportunities in the midstream arena. Process and pipeline infrastructure needs to be put into place to move these barrels to market. Additionally, propane, butane and naphtha oversupply in the U.S. Gulf Coast is forecast to continue, which will require additional export infrastructure or conversion capacity to alleviate. The global excess of LNG will also renew efforts to develop alternative markets. Central, South America, Asia and Africa are likely targets for gas to power and small gas distribution projects, and additional LNG penetration is likely into the transportation fuel markets, sparking new projects. 
The refining market is comparatively steady, although profitability is at lower levels than 18 months ago. And consequently, this will impact capital spend over the near term. Despite this, we're seeing continuing opportunities at maintenance, turnaround, efficiency improvement and regulatory projects, particularly as we expand our J Pro [ph] initiative, our new safety, reliability and process optimization service offering. In the U.S., there continues to be increased focus on process safety and octane improvement projects, while the U.S. refining margins also continue to be supported by product exports to Latin America. 
As previously reported, we continue to see feasibility study requests in developing countries across Asia and Africa, and the recent decision by the International Maritime Organization's Marine Environmental Protection Committee confirmed reinforcement of regulations to reduce the global sulfur cap on bunker fuel from 2020. Grassroots refining opportunities are also developing in India and South Asia, driven by growth for clean transportation fuels. 
The downstream petrochemicals market remains strong, and we continue to expect multiple investments in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Middle East.  We're seeing interest from Saudi Arabia and elsewhere regarding development of crude oil to chemical projects, and there's increased focus on diversification. Moving away from first-line commodity chemicals, ethane, LPG and naphtha feedstocks, are also plentiful and relatively cheap and will provide economic incentives for project development. This is a global trend, which is driven by the excess of petchem feedstocks being exported from the U.S.  We had several exciting wins in the quarter, including a confidential grassroots chemical facility in the U.S. Gulf Coast; an engineering contract for TransCanada; an EPC contract with INEOS for a Linear alpha olefin unit in Texas; and a refinery upgrade FEED project for the Singapore Refining Company. 
With that, I'll now pass it to Kevin discuss the financials in more detail."

Turning now to Slide 11, you will see a more detailed summary of our financial performance over the quarter and fiscal year 2016. As we have communicated throughout the current fiscal year, adverse market conditions in certain end markets",1507,"Thanks, Steve. Turning now to Slide 11, you will see a more detailed summary of our financial performance over the quarter and fiscal year 2016. 
As we have communicated throughout the current fiscal year, adverse market conditions in certain end markets continued to negatively impact certain of our businesses. As a result of these ongoing pressures, particularly in oil and gas, our revenue for the quarter was $2.6 billion, down approximately 15% versus our fourth quarter last year. For the year, revenue was $11 billion, down 10% versus last year.  EPS on an adjusted basis was $0.77, which excludes $0.53 per share in after-tax restructuring and other charges, which are comprised of after-tax charges of $0.30 per share in connection with our restructuring activities that began in fiscal year 2015, a $0.14 per share loss on the sale of our French subsidiary as a result of our strategic decision to exit our French operations, and a $0.09 per share noncash write-off on an equity investment. While the adjusted EPS of $0.77 for the fiscal year -- fiscal quarter 4 was lower than the $0.80 reported in the comparable quarter last year, note that fiscal year '15 included a 53 -- a 53rd week, excuse me, in our Q4 results in 2015, which added approximately a $0.03 per share benefit to the year-ago quarter. 
Book-to-bill on a trailing 12-month basis continued to improve over the course of fiscal year '16 and ended at a high for the year at 1.0x. Q4 gross margin percentage was up 120 basis points versus the year-ago quarter, indicative of our improving execution and focus on cost discipline. Importantly, our gross margin percentage for our professional services business continued the positive trend that we had seen earlier this year. Specifically, this helped increase our consolidated gross margin percentage in the second half of 2016 by 70 basis points versus the same period of 2015. 
For the full year, adjusted G&A was reduced by $127 million versus the last fiscal year, or an improvement of 9.3%; again, a positive indication of our success in rightsizing the company and driving cost efficiencies. Our adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $134 million, an improvement of 25 basis points on an operating profit margin basis versus the fourth quarter of 2015. Specifically in the second half of 2016, our improving traction and financial discipline resulted in our operating profit margin improving the second half of 2015 by 30 basis points to 5.2%.  
Finally, our efforts to improve our accounts receivable efficiencies saw our DSO improving to 70 days at year-end versus 77 last year, as noted earlier by Steve. As a result, free cash flow also continued to improve totaling $213 million for the quarter, an improvement of $134 million versus the fourth quarter of 2015. For the year, free cash flow reached $612 million, up $216 million versus year ago and the highest in the history of the company. At fiscal year-end, the company's net cash position now stands at $268 million, an improvement of $140 million from the last quarter sequentially and a more significant $405 million turnaround from last fiscal year end. 
So turning to Slide 12. You will see the Q4 and fiscal year '16 adjusted segment financials for our 4 lines of businesses. As you can see, 2 of our 4 business lines increased their segment operating profit versus the year-ago quarter. Importantly, 3 of our LOBs improved their adjusted operating profit margins both for the quarter and for the full year versus the year-ago periods. 
Regarding Aerospace & Technology, while we did see a decline in adjusted operating profit versus the fourth quarter of fiscal year '15, the adjusted operating profit for the entire fiscal year held near flat despite a decrease in revenues on account of a 70 basis point improvement in margins for the year. The improvement in the margin profile over the year was driven by strong performance fees, particularly in Q3, and by an overall improvement in the margin mix of this line of business. 
The Buildings & Infrastructure business also saw revenue decline in Q4 versus the year-ago period, but adjusted segment operating profit actually increased by a significant 79% and finished up 20% for the whole of fiscal year 2016. This was driven by significant improvements in project execution which allowed higher project margins versus a more challenged Q4 and full year in 2015. As a result, the operating profit margin for this business was up 380 basis points in Q4 and 190 basis points for the full year versus the year-ago periods. 
The industrial line of business saw an increase in revenues for the quarter of 12% versus the year ago quarter, supporting a near 11% increase for the fiscal year, driven by strong performance in our life science business. Despite this, adjusted segment operating profit was down 54% versus last year's Q4 when compared to the year-ago period and down 36% for the fiscal year. 2016 challenges were related to several project disputes and client settlements in Q2 and Q4 of 2016, primarily in our mining businesses. In addition, last year had a significant benefit in Q2 associated with successful closeouts associated with several large projects. 
Lastly, our Petroleum & Chemicals line of business saw a 33% decline in revenue for Q4 versus the year-ago period, but a far more positive 6% increase in adjusted operating profit over the same period. The fall in revenue was also apparent for the full year given the challenging end market dynamics. Despite these challenges, segment operating profit margins actually increased by 180 basis points for the quarter and by 60 basis points for the full year versus the year-ago like periods, a clear indication of the strong focus on cost efficiencies and restructuring in this line of business. 
So moving to Slide 13. You will see the split of revenues in segment operating profit by each LOB. As discussed over the past several quarters, the strength in some of our lines of businesses, such as Buildings & Infrastructure and Aerospace & Technology, demonstrate the benefits of our diverse portfolio in maintaining relative stability in times when economic challenges exist in certain of our end markets. What's clear is that the shape of our portfolio is changing. Specifically, those LOBs that are most impacted by global commodity price changes are representing a lower percentage of the profits of the company, while other businesses are expanding. Consequently, the position of our portfolio offers us 2 advantages at this point in time. First, we continue to be well-positioned to further leverage off of our strong position in those businesses that are not impacted by commodities; and two, we are at a point where further falloff in a commodity-oriented business is obviously less likely. As a result, there is real upside for these businesses when commodity prices do ultimately improve. This argues for relative stability in the short run with upside in the long run. 
Moving to Slide 14. We continue to be successful with our restructuring and efforts to improve financial discipline and performance. The restructuring that began in July of 2015 was aimed at simplifying the business and enhancing our cost effectiveness. Our LOB realignment and continued drive to identify cost savings allowed us to find additional cost savings opportunities over the course of the year. And the result, our final savings are expected to be in the range of $260 million to $270 million, with total cost approximating $390 million to $400 million. Relative to our cash cost and savings, our payback is slightly less than 1 year. 
I am pleased to report that we are on track to obtain the full run rate of these savings in fiscal year '17, and the reduction in adjusted G&A of $127 million we achieved in fiscal year '16 is evidence of this, especially when adding to the savings already realized in 2015. Further savings that we will realize in 2017 are important as it will allow us to reinvest back into the business to fund certain strategic investments in the company and to enhance our position to drive profitable growth in the long term. 
Finally, before turning it back over to Steve, Slide 16 provides a short update on our share buyback program activities for fiscal year '16. During the quarter, we continued to execute share buybacks in a balanced and steady manner, bringing the total repurchases for the fiscal year to 3.4 million shares for a total of $153 million. This represents a 3.7% reduction in shares outstanding for fiscal year '15.  As you are aware, we have previously indicated that we expect to continue to spend the remainder of the $500 million share buyback in a relatively consistent manner over the remaining term of the 3-year program. We plan to provide an update on our use of cash and capital structure strategy at our 2016 Investor Day next week on Thursday, December 1. 
With that, let me hand it back over to Steve for closing comments."

We expect challenging market conditions to continue into fiscal year 2017. Weak growth in developed markets, geopolitical issues and uncertain commodity prices will continue to impact some of our end markets. 
Much like the beginning of last year, our oil and gas, mining and certain industrial clients are continuing to avoid large capital expenditures to conserve cash. We do believe most of the declines in these end markets are now behind us, but it remains to be seen when industry growth will return in these sectors. More positively, we saw select growth opportunities in our Buildings & Infrastructure, Aerospace & Technology and life sciences markets in fiscal year 2016, and we expect further growth in these end markets in 2017. 
As we progressed through our fiscal year 2016, we saw our backlog stabilize and then increase by the fourth quarter, and we expect further increases to our backlog as we progress through fiscal year 2017. We also remain heavily focused on improving margins. The restructuring we have undertaken over the past several quarters continues to provide momentum and supports our ability to invest back in our profitable growth agenda. We are seeing improvements in our project delivery efforts and write-offs continue to be reduced across the board.  
Finally, our efforts to improve our financial performance in 2016, and particularly our operating profits, gives us confidence in a more stable outlook for fiscal year 2017. Consequently, we're providing initial guidance between $3 and $3.30 for adjusted EPS, which provides for operating profit growth in a continuing challenged market environment and includes a set of largely onetime investments of $0.15 per share to support our growth strategy.  As Kevin mentioned, our strategic review is complete, and we look forward to our discussions next week at our Investor Day on December 1, where we will outline our strategy for long-term sustainable shareholder value. 
With that, I'd like to thank you for listening, and we'll now open it up for questions."

Look, we're very pleased with the amount of progress. A lot of hard work within the lines of businesses to really gain some momentum at the -- in the back half of the year, specifically on improving our DSO, that doesn't just automatically happen. I do think that our year-end position is really quite good. And the way we think about driving long-term working capital benefits and specifically accounts receivable isn't about a point in time, it's about an average level, so that we ultimately are able to have a sustainable level of working capital. So having said all of that, I would not perceive us being able to necessarily have the kind of free cash flow that we saw in 2016 per se, but we are planning on continuing to drive DSO improvements in 2017. It will be part of our financial metrics. We'll talk a little bit more about this in our Investor Day next week, but we still think there's opportunities to improve and, longer term, be a more efficient capital investment behind our business, which ultimately will increase our return on invested capital."

And so we're pleased to see a lot of the positive hype around what's going on with the Trump expectations. But we're positive about moving forward in transportation. And when we talk about transportation, by the way, we think of not only highways, but we think of rail, where we've got a very strong position. And then the broader aviation sector where we're seeing the big benefits of how we've integrated Buildings & Infrastructure because, as you know, when we get into aviation projects, it's a combination of infrastructure, but as well as building facilities. And our new line of business structure has given us the capability to leverage off of certain strengths regionally and take those strengths globally.

So I think the revenue is a tough metric for our company, because as you know, we have certain businesses we win with pass-through revenue, and we typically like to focus in on the professional services side where we get good margin. And we've shifted our strategy, as we go forward, that we're going to be much more conscious of the total margin. And therefore, whether it's professional services or the field services side, we're expecting to drive margin improvement. And as a result, you're seeing the effect, to some extent, of a strategy mix of really focusing on margin as we also drive down cost and all the things that we've talked about for fiscal year '16. But as we move into '17, we are talking about the whole shift of -- and pivoting to growth, and we feel like it's pretty broad-based. As you saw, we got backlog growth in our Petroleum & Chemicals business, which I think is an extremely successful achievement in light of the tough conditions. And that's because of a successful strategy shift to really focus on petrochemicals. The lion's share of our wins are coming in petrochemicals. We continue to see a very robust pipeline of activity in petrochemicals. And again, our new line of business structure has given us the opportunity to really globalize and expand beyond our previous core client focus to a much larger set of customers. So we see that in Petroleum & Chemicals. I think we gave you a sense that Building and Infrastructure, we're pretty bullish globally. And we're actually leading the way in growth in Australia. Our Australia team, on the backs of what came out of the political situation last year, has really driven some spending increase across that country, and we're now seeing momentum in the U.S. and the U.K. as well, so very positive on Buildings & Infrastructure. Aerospace & Technology, one thing in that business we all need to remind ourselves about is that from 2010 to 2015, there was a 25% decline in federal defense spending in the U.S. And in spite of that, we held our backlog up. And now, as we've progressed our strategy and we've seen stabilization of that spending and we're gaining market share in what's a very large spend in government services in the U.S. especially, we believe as we get through 2017, we're going to actually see backlog growth and revenue growth. I think, the area that right now is, I'd say, more stable is the overall industrial segment because that is made up of a lot of different businesses and there's a bit of a timing going on, on when we win the next wave of pharma projects as we burn off some backlog in that business. So that's kind of the overall story of sales growth."

Maybe augmenting Steve's commentary, specifically started as discussion relative to that focus on margin and that we're looking really to focus on driving a profitable growth agenda as opposed to just a growth agenda, so that's an important point that he made. The other note that is important to understand is as we look at this focus of pivoting to our profitable growth agenda, I would say in those businesses, specifically Petroleum & Chemicals, we're still comparing to some pretty big year-ago numbers, and the stabilization of that business is happening as we speak. So as we progress over the course of 2017, we would expect that, that pivot to growth will actually play out hopefully in the Petroleum & Chemicals business. But at least in the near term, there'll be some pressure points in the first quarters of the year."

But it's really to move away from a mindset of restructuring to productivity, and with a large effort around now taking that leaner cost structure and winning more business because of the competitiveness that, that brought us. As far as the post-election situation, again, I feel like I've commented on that, Jamie, that with everything we were doing to position ourselves for growth, we attribute the momentum to that activity and less around the early stages of postelection. Are we optimistic? Yes. Do we hope all the stuff we read about happens? Of course. And we've seen what the Australian elections have done, and we hope that same thing happens in the U.S. And in fact, Theresa May's administration in the U.K. is reaffirming several of the important nuclear and other projects in that region that are important to us. And so we feel good about what's going on globally around the political side of positioning our business. With regard to Motiva, the arbitration process continues.

And as it relates to your specific comment about the balance of the year, that's where we see the pivot that Steve has alluded to when we'll start to be able to see improved EPS growth in the back part of the year. But certainly, Q1 will have some comparability challenges versus year ago."

The backlog momentum is really across the board rather that any single projects. I think that's been traditionally Jacobs' strength, is that we're not over-reliant on large projects, that it really is built off of our strong end market diversity. And I think I covered that earlier, that we actually see it in most of our line of businesses and feel throughout the year that, that's going to happen. Last year, we recognized the need to really drive cash and put DSO and working capital in our management incentive compensation targets, and we're going to maintain that going into 2017 because we believe there's -- as Kevin said, there's more working capital efficiency out there. But as we pivot to growth, we now want to do the same thing with backlog growth specifically. And I think you hit the nail on the head, that is profitable growth. And so as we look at backlog growth, the -- without getting into the specifics, what our board is going to hold us accountable for is actually the gross margin in that backlog growth. So it is going to be aimed at profitable backlog growth. And we've put new systems and tools in place to be able to measure that growth, which kind of goes to the last question is, as we talk about margin focus, and it's still in a very tough environment, I think the major difference moving forward is we now have the ability to measure profitability by client, by office and many other ways, in a much better way than we had a few years ago. So as everyone goes after upgrading the mix, they actually have the tools and capabilities to track that."

Most of the write-offs that you hear about at Jacobs actually involved the more reimbursable side of our business.
