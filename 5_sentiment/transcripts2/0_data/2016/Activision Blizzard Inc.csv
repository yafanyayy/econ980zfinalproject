This month, Mike Morhaime and I are celebrating are 25th anniversaries with the company and I want to take this opportunity to thank Mike and the incredibly talented team at Blizzard for 25 years of creating some of the world's most inspired, enduring and entertaining franchises. They have one of the best track records of any game company in the creation of franchises and this year, with Overwatch, Blizzard will launch its entire fairly new franchises in 17 years. From the reaction so for, Overwatch, is on track to become a fantastic success. Mike, thank you for 25 extraordinary years that I'm looking forward to many more together. 
We ended our 2015, our 25th year, with $4.6 billion, $1.5 billion of operating income and $1.2 billion of operating cash flow. Upon the expected close of our acquisition of King later this month, will we'll over 0.5 million monthly active users in 196 countries, which as an entertainment networks, runs only behind Facebook, YouTube and WeChat in monthly active users.

We'll be the world's leading stand-alone interactive entertainment company common expect 2016 to be a record year for the company with $6.25 billion of revenues and more than $2 billion of operating income. In the past 25 years, based on yesterdays stock price, our compound rate of return was over 1,000%, and we outperformed the S&P 500 by almost 300%. In our Annual Report last year, we shared over plans to enhance engagement in our franchises and celebrate our players through initiatives like esports economy really beginning to better realize of these plans. 
Last year, our Activision Blizzard games were played for over 14 billion hours and spectator watched over 1.5 million hours of video content based on our games. In the 2014, 2015 season, fans of the NFL watch about 7 billion hours of nationally televised games, which is less than half the time spent engaged with our franchises. Those televised games generated approximately $7 billion of broadcast rights fees for the NFL and another $4 billion and other revenues, including sponsorships, merchandise and ticket sales. When we think about our franchises, we view our responsibilities to our fans and the associated business opportunity through the lens of these leagues like the NFL, the Premier league, the NBA, Major league baseball or NHL. Our franchise today generate revenues principally from the sale of interactive content but not meaningful revenues from play, advertising, broadcasting and pay-per-view, licensing or merchandising, all of which are great future financial opportunities we are pursuing. 
We think competitive gaming in the spectator opportunities connected to organized gaming competitions could provide accessible opportunities for shareholders and great rewards and recognition for our hundreds of millions of players. We could you to believe that esports is another long-term growth pillar for the company and our recent acquisition of Major League Gaming has accelerated our strategic plans. Esports helps fuel one of the underlying drivers of our strong performance, which is a deepening engagement with our offense. As I begin might 25th year at the company, I couldn't be more excited about the many, many opportunities we see ahead. Prioritization of opportunity remains a great challenge but our well-defined strategy and focused execution have enabled us to make great content, satisfy large audiences and generate superior shareholder returns for 25 years.

Activision Blizzard had another successful year in 2015. We achieved record digital revenues up 20% year-over-year and for the first time in 2015, our digital revenues were larger than our retail revenue. At",630,"Thank you, Bobby, and good afternoon, everyone. Activision Blizzard had another successful year in 2015. We achieved record digital revenues up 20% year-over-year and for the first time in 2015, our digital revenues were larger than our retail revenue. At constant currency, we achieve 4% revenue growth and 13% EPS growth above 2014's record levels. These results were driven by our strategic focus and execution on growing our audiences, deepening engagement and providing opportunities for more player investment. Let's briefly go through each of these key business drivers. First, we broaden our audience reached with successful new content launches and expanded onto new platforms and geographies. In the fourth quarter, our monthly active users grew to our highest level ever at over 80 million users. For the full year, MAUs grew 25% over 2014. And in key markets like China, where we launched 3 new games in 2015, our revenue growth accelerated 87% year-over-year faster than ever before. 
Second, we drove deeper engagement by providing outstanding gameplay and frequent content updates. Player spent 3.5 billion hours play our games in the fourth quarter alone. For the full year, engagement was up 16% to a record 14 billion hours. And this doesn't include rapidly growing our state in which we estimate for Activision Blizzard alone is now 1.5 billion hours. 
Third, we progress in something that is very hard to do but it's critical for our business. We shifted to a year-round player investment model, while growing engagement at the same time. And as a result, we grew our revenues from in-game content in services to over 1.6 billion, that's up 57% year-over-year at constant FX. 
When executed well, increased player investment and deep engagement are not a tradeoff but instead can reinforce each other and we're pleased that our results are improving out this important element of our business strategy. As we look ahead to 2016 on our core business, we expect continued growth from this strategic initiatives against the backdrop of an increasing install base of devices capable of delivering games around the world. We will continue to see the shift towards a digital distribution network and most importantly, we will deliver it another year of the very best interactive entertainment in the world. 
In addition to the organic progress we made in 2015, we also created opportunities for growth ahead through new corporate initiatives focused on the fastest-growing parts of our industry. Let's start with King which we expect to add to our portfolio later this month. King operates in the large and rapidly growing mobile segment, with a world-class management team, exceptional game development talent and great commercial instincts. 
In addition to being significantly accretive this year, we expect the transaction will Activision position as a world in interactive entertainment, positioning the combined company for growth across platforms, audiences, geographies and business models. Second, our recent acquisition of Major League Gaming will accelerate our opportunities in esports. Major League Gaming provides us with a superb streaming platform, link management expertise with MLG Pro circuit and online competition and Price place we'd give on the platform. We believe our investments in esports fit perfectly with our strategy to deepen audience engagement by celebrating our players, delivering high production values to our communities and providing great opportunities for player investment. 
By the end of February, we'll have one of the largest entertainment networks in the world with over 0.5 million monthly active users and some of the strongest franchises in all of entertainment with manyfold new long-term growth opportunities for future value creation. We couldn't be more excited to welcome the incredibly talented teams at King and MLG into the Activision Blizzard family.

Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our Q4 and full year 2015 financial results and then I will review our outlook for 2016. 12 months ago, our original non-GAAP outlook included revenues of $4.4 billion, 30% operating margin",1836,"Thank you, Thomas. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our Q4 and full year 2015 financial results and then I will review our outlook for 2016. 12 months ago, our original non-GAAP outlook included revenues of $4.4 billion, 30% operating margin and EPS of $1.15 per. Today, we're announcing we delivered revenues of $4.62 billion, a 32% operating margin and EPS of $1.32. Once again exceeded our initial guidance this year by $221 million on revenues and by $0.17 EPS. Importantly, digital revenue such a quarterly record in Q4 and for the year grew 20% or 29% at constant FX versus last year to an all-time annual record of $2.63 billion. This represented 57% share of our total revenues, up from 46% last year. This strong growth in digital revenue was driven by new and emerging high-margin opportunities, including in-game content and services, which grew 57% at constant FX. This in-game content and services now account for about 1/3 of our total revenues. In addition, console full game downloads grew 56% year-over-year or at 65% at constant FX. 
From a capital perspective, we delivered more than $1 billion of operating cash flow for the 6 year out of the past 7. Further, we strengthened our balance sheet and it's ever upgraded to investment-grade by Moody's. We paid record dividend to shareholders, repaid $250 million of our debt and then to invest in a strong pipeline of new opportunities with high-margin potential and announced agreements to acquire a King Digital and Major League Gaming. So it was a busy year on many fronts for the company. 
Now let's take a moment to review our operational performance for 2015. Activision grew in 2015 on its path to becoming an increasingly digital business with digital revenues up nearly 70% this year, driven by strong growth from full game digital downloads and in-game content and services. We still have considerable opportunity in digital because even with the strong growth less than 50% of Activision revenues were digital last year. 
In Q4, Call of Duty: Black Ops exceeded our plan in prior year in practically every e-commerce of engagement metrics, delivering upside for the year. And more importantly, the Call of Duty franchise had its largest player community ever at year-end. Destiny’s Q3 release The Taken King continue to perform strongly as well. We did, however, express lower-than-expected performance on Skylanders and Guitar Hero, which Eric will discuss in more detail in a few moments. 2015 was an important year for Blizzard with expansion across more platforms, business models and regions than ever before. It was the first year since our merger than more than 50% of the Blizzard's revenue was derived from content in-games other than World of Warcraft. With adults exhibited strong growth in your territories with China revenues reaching new highs. Blizzard's large online community is growing and is stronger than ever. Baluster into our future results. For the quarter on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.35 billion, up $135 million versus our November guidance and operating margin of 18% and GAAP EPS of $0.21, up $0.12 versus our November guidance. 
For the quarter on a non-GAAP basis that we generated revenues of $2.12 billion and operating margin of 40% and EPS of $0.83 per. We outperformed November guidance by $0.01 on EPS. We came in slightly below our total revenue expectations largely due to foreign exchange and underperform us with our cash more franchises on console. In terms of EBITDA, in Q4, we generated non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $862 million and $1.55 billion for the year. Operating cash flow for the year was $1.19 billion and free cash flow was $1.08 billion. We had no share repurchases during the year. On a non-GAAP basis for the year, revenues were $4.62 billion, down slightly year-over-year end of the 4% at constant FX. Our non-GAAP operating income $1.47 billion, reflecting an operating margin of 32% or 34% at constant FX and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 34%. Our tax rate was 22% and EPS our was $1.32. At constant currency, our EPS grew 13% year-over-year above 2014's record EPS levels. Turning to FX. Please note that as discussed on prior calls, the strong dollar continue to be a headwind as our international revenues were translated at lower rates than in 2014. In the quarter, the year-over-year FX impact was $125 million on revenue and $0.11 on EPS. For the year, there was a significant FX impact of $364 million on revenue and $0.28 on EPS. 
Turning to the balance sheet. As of December 31, we had approximately $5.4 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $1.35 billion was held domestically. Approximately $3.6 billion of this cash was held in escrow and combined with the incremental $2.3 billion term loan that we have committed from our banking syndicate will provide funding for the closing of our pending King transaction. 
Now let's turn to our plans for 2016. For the first time as we shift to a year-round engagement model in our business, we expect more than 50% of earnings to be realized in the first 3 quarters of the calendar year. For our Activision business, we expect Call of Duty to continue it's strong momentum to buy the delivery of fantastic new game content, including multiple map packs and an in-game content and innovative new Call of Duty may even Q4. For planning purposes, as we have assumed in past years, we have modeled Q4 new really sales to be down from last year is Black Ops III levels. We do expect overall Call of Duty franchise revenues, however, to be up for the year given strong engagement trends leading into the digital season for Black Ops in the first half of 2016. 
On Destiny, we expect to deliver a new expansion in 2016 but note that we no longer expect full game Destiny release during the year. We do, however, expect the forgive Destiny sequel to an outcome in 2017. For Skylanders in Q4, we expect the release and innovative new game was for guidance purposes we've got to be down year-over-year given the challenging competitive environment in the toys-to-life category. 
Turning to Blizzard. We have a lot of exciting plns this year that Mike will cover in more detail later on the call. Blizzard was really cited disputed over a what's in the spring as was the Legion, expansion for World of Warcraft in the summer. In addition, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm will have ongoing content updates throughout the year. Our 2016 guidance today also includes King as we expect to close the transaction later this month. Note that there are a few key closing conditions still outstanding, including Irish High Court approval and EU regulatory approval both of which are expected shortly. King is already lost Candy Crush Jelly Saga the first of 3 new franchise gives that are expected in 2016. We are excited about their plan and look forward of closing of the transaction soon. 
On capital allocation, our board has once again increased our dividend this year by 13% to $0.26 per share payable in May. Additionally, once we've closed the King transaction, our primary focus for the near term will be on the reduction and we plan to repay up to $1.5 billion of debt in 2016. 
With that context, now let's review the numbers. For 2016, we expect GAAP revenues of $6.1 billion, product costs of 23% and operating expenses of 65%. We expect GAAP net interest expense of $245 million. For both GAAP and non-GAAP, we expect the fully diluted weighted average share count of 767 million and a tax rate of 25%. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.45. Our GAAP earnings are expected to be down versus prior year as the expected results will be impacted by an additional accounting charges associated with the King transaction, which includes among other things, transaction-related cost and the amortization of intangibles resulting from purchase price accounting adjustments; the majority of these GAAP accounting charges will not impact the economics of our business or cash flows although development material impact on our 2016 GAAP results. I want to highlight that there could be significant movement in our GAAP out because it will be impacted by as within assumptions, which may be materially different when the King transaction actually closes. These estimates and assumptions are inherently difficult to predict. Please refer to our GAAP to non-GAAP outlook reconciliation they both on our earnings release for more details. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.25 billion, product cost of 23% and operating expense of 44%. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of 32% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 35%. We expect non-GAAP net interest expense of $235 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.75, which as we indicated when we announce the transaction in November, contemplate 30% accretion from King. A few things that go now to help you understand you non-GAAP EPS numbers here. First of all, please note that as was mentioned earlier, we do not expect the full game Destiny release this year, which has an approximately $0.15 impact on our guidance. A full game Destiny is now expected in 2017. Also note that we plan to transition kicks current compensation plan from an equity -based compensation program to a cash-based profit-sharing plan more similar to what is used today at Blizzard and our divisions to the organization. Overall this is a value neutral as it was a quick expense in the compensation expense, however, it will negatively affect non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.06 this year. We believe that this incentive structure has proven successful in our existing business, and we're confident that it will also drive business results with King. Note that both of the Destiny timing and the King compensation impact are included in our $1.75 non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year. 
Now let's turn to our quarterly outlook, which assumes King closes later this month. On a GAAP basis for the March quarter, we expect net revenues of $1.26 million, product costs of 21% and operating expenses of 58%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $55 million, attach rate of 25% and share count of 756 million. We expect GAAP EPS of $0.21 per on a non-GAAP basis for the March quarter, we expect revenues of $800 million, product costs of 23% and operating expenses of 57%. 
We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.11 per. In summary, 2015 was an important year for Activision Blizzard, and we again delivered strong financial results during its way transformational year for the company, which had distribution foundation for future growth. With the largest interactive entertainment network, some of the most important holy owned franchises in all of entertainment, solid execution skill and continued business discipline, we are poised for coded success and driving shareholder value creation over the long term. 
Now I will turn the call over to Eric to discuss Activision."

In quarters 1, 2, 3, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare over performed our plan in the prior year with very strong performance on our digital season of content. In Q4, Call of Duty: Black Ops III exceeded our plan in the prior year in practically every tear year. Retail, selling and so Pro, digital full game sales, digital ink in sales and Season Pass sales. Black Ops III delivered the biggest entertainment launch of 2015 even bit in Star Wars The Force Awakens in its opening weekend.

In fact according to NPD and GfK, we sold through more copies of Black Ops III than the 2 closest competitors in the general combined. On a franchise basis, Call of Duty was #1 in North America for the incredible 70 you're in a row and is now surpassed 250 million units sold life-to-date worldwide with over $15 billion in selling on full game and in-game content.

Our specific franchise highlights further demonstrate the value we see in delivering and supporting high-quality game experiences globally. Hearthstone had a great quarter and a great year. For those who might not be familiar with Hearthstone, it's our free-to-play collectible card game on PC, Mac, tablet and mobile. It has very strong global appeal and brought Blizzard to a new genre on new platforms with new business model. Ahead of BlizzCon, Hearthstone surpassed for the million registered players and it will stop December with record global engagement in multiple categories, including MAUs. 
The introduction of Hearthstone on mobile last year was a big contributor to that. We announced our new adventure the League of Explorers at BlizzCon and launched the following week. League of Explorers bring new words, new game mechanics and a lot of personality. Despite the shorter window to launch and no presales as we've had with our previous adventure, League of Explorers sold over 20% more units as of 6 weeks post launch. We also expanded her story into new regions. In October, rereleased the Japanese version, providing easier access for a new and existing Japanese players. 
Moving on to World of Warcraft. We saw quarter-over-quarter growth in Q4 as we kicked off presales at BlizzCon for new expansion, Legion, which is coming out in the summer.

And for the first time, we're also offering early access to the new character class, which will be activated for everyone who prepurchase of the expansion once it's ready. Before I move on, he want to thank our community for the generosity they showed with the World of Warcraft charity path that we offered on behalf of Make a Wish. With our players support to Molly achieved a new record for the donation will be making to make out we spent over $1.7 million. That reflects a deep passion and power of the very strong and very engaged community. 
Next, Overwatch, our new IP, which will be a big step into a new genre for us as well as our first simultaneous release across multiple platforms. As with our other Blizzard franchises, we have long-term plans to support this new IP with more content and also with external world that building efforts and robust esports program. Overwatch with a lot of news in the quarter and continued to build momentum. We announced the remainder of the 21-hero launch lineup at BlizzCon and rebuild the console versions of the game. We also began closed beta testing reaching top status on Twitch. In addition, we shed our plans to patch in more Heroes after launch, which received a very positive response. 
We are excited about Overwatch's potential and we look forward to sharing more details as we get closer to its spring release. Part of our big highlights for the quarter with the launch of StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void. The new features and content make Starcraft II easier to get into than ever before. And is a lot of excitement with the launch. As of its first 24 hours, Legacy of the Void have told through more than 1 million copies. In addition, it received multiple awards for best strategy game of 2015. At BlizzCon, we released a series of stand-alone digital mission packs featuring nova, a popular character in Starcraft II and in Heroes of the Storm. This content will give the players exciting new options for continuing their StarCraft II experience and will be a great entry point for anyone new to StarCraft. 
We've been very pleased to see a very positive player response and look forward to releasing the first mission pocket in the spring. Q4 was also a busy one for Heroes of the Storm. Our free-to-play team roller that features iconic characters from across our best-selling franchises. With Heroes of the Storm we've worked hard to push the boundaries of the genre, while keeping the game engaging and accessible for the lightest possible audience. For example, at BlizzCon, we announced a new game mode, the arena, which will mix up gameplay with fun parameters, smaller maps and shorter sessions when it's released later this year. We also revealed our 10th battleground and 3 new Heroes at the show, including should welcome, a hero controlled by 2 players. Players around the world responded with enthusiasm for unique Heroes like Chagall and with support for the experience that Heroes of the Storm. Heroes of the Storm on the great close of the year taking home multiple awards, including Best Competitive Multiplayer and Best MOBA from Game Informer. 
I also want to touch on Diablo III, which had a strong and active -- has a strong and active community nearly 4 years after launch. The game performed very well throughout 2015 in part due to our launch in China, which broke sales records there. Players in the media have been enthusiastic about the content we've added over time and our recent patch and January is no exception. There are new zones, legendary weapons, set dungeons and more. In addition, we periodically restart seasons, refreshing the challenge for players. Diablo III continues to thrive in all regions and we appreciate all the support from players around the world. We're also supporting community engagement and franchise growth outside of our games, particularly with world class esports that represent the diversity of our portfolio and our audiences interest. At BlizzCon, we had our strongest esports line up to-date and crowned champions in Hearthstone, World of Warcraft Arena, Starcraft II and Heroes of the Storm for a very different but equally exciting esports experiences for attendees and spectators online. 
Looking forward, 2016 will be our biggest Blizzard esports program ever. It will be Heroes of the Storm's first full year of global competition. In addition, Heroes of the Dorm collegiate tournament is returning and we've added another evening of prime time coverage at this time. With the final matches, the Heroic 4, playing out over 2 nights on the ESPN2. 
We also made changes to the Starcraft II world championship series and sports championship took to give a local heroes even more opportunities to shine. And we're excited about our esports plans for Overwatch and look forward to sharing more details about that in the future. With strength across all franchises and border regions than ever, we are very enthusiastic about 2016. We are especially excited about the spring launch of Overwatch and look forward to releasing World of Warcraft Legion in the summer on the heels of the general release of the Warcraft movie. With all of the content and activities we have planned, we expect another year of solid growth of the Blizzard community, and we're very excited about the future. As Bobby mentioned, Monday was Blizzard's 25th anniversary. We've put our hearts into making great games for 25 years. We're very proud of the world's of that we've greeted and the great moments we have shared with our players. We are extremely grateful for the support of our players and we look forward to many more adventures in the next 25 years and beyond. 
Thank you. And I'll turn the call back over to Amrita."

For Call of Duty just based on the size of the player base, full game downloads were a lower certain although on a lower basis could forgive downloads are up over 80% year-over-year. So a very nice progress there. And we know when we look at the Blizzard's side of our portfolio on the PC the vast majority of those frontline games are delivered digitally. Obviously that brings margin benefits for us as each new game that delivered through digital channels, brings us gross margin benefits and you'll see that in over or corporate margin we are at the 32% this year and with currency effects, excluding currency FX it would have been up of 34%.

This month, Mike Morhaime and I are celebrating our 25th anniversaries with the company, and I wanted to take this opportunity to thank Mike and the incredibly talented team at Blizzard f",648,"Thank you, Amrita, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon. This month, Mike Morhaime and I are celebrating our 25th anniversaries with the company, and I wanted to take this opportunity to thank Mike and the incredibly talented team at Blizzard for 25 years of creating some of the world's most inspired, enduring and entertaining franchises. 
They have one of the best track records of any game company in the creation of franchises, and this year, with Overwatch, Blizzard will launch its entire -- first entirely new franchise in 17 years. From the reaction so far, Overwatch is on track to become a fantastic success. Mike, thank you for 25 extraordinary years, and I'm looking forward to many more together. 
We ended our 2015, our 25th year, with $4.6 billion of revenues, $1.5 billion of operating income and $1.2 billion of operating cash flow. Upon the expected close of our acquisition of King later this month, we'll have over 0.5 billion monthly active users in 196 countries, which as an entertainment network, ranks only behind Facebook, YouTube and WeChat in monthly active users. We'll have 7x the audience members of Netflix and have a larger audience than Snapchat and Twitter combined. We'll be the world's leading standalone interactive entertainment company, and we expect 2016 to be a record year for the company, with $6.25 billion of revenues and more than $2 billion of operating income. In the past 25 years, based on yesterday's stock price, our compound rate of return was over 1,000%, and we outperformed the S&P 500 by almost 300%. In our Annual Report last year, we shared our plans to enhance engagement in our franchises and celebrate our players through initiatives like eSports, and we're really beginning to better realize these plans. 
Last year, our Activision Blizzard games were played for over 14 billion hours, and spectators watched over 1.5 billion hours of video content based on our games. In the 2014, 2015 seasons, fans of the NFL watched about 7 billion hours of nationally televised games, which is less than half the time spent engaged with our franchises. Those televised games generated approximately $7 billion of broadcast rights fees for the NFL and another $4 billion in other revenues, including sponsorships, merchandise and ticket sales. When we think about our franchises, we view our responsibilities to our fans and the associated business opportunity through the lens of these leagues, like the NFL, the Premier League, the NBA, Major League Baseball or NHL. Our franchise today generate revenues principally from the sale of interactive content but not meaningful revenues from tournament play, advertising, broadcasting and pay-per-view, licensing or merchandising, all of which are great future financial opportunities we are pursuing. 
We think competitive gaming in the spectator opportunities connected to organize gaming competitions could provide sizeable opportunities for shareholders and great rewards and recognition for our hundreds of millions of players. We continue to believe that eSports is another long-term growth pillar for the company, and our recent acquisition of Major League Gaming has accelerated our strategic plans. eSports helps fuel one of the underlying drivers of our strong financial performance, which is a deepening engagement with our fans. As I begin my 25th year at the company, I couldn't be more excited about the many, many opportunities we see ahead. Prioritization of opportunity remains a great challenge, but our well-defined strategy and focused execution have enabled us to make great content, satisfy large audiences and generate superior shareholder returns for 25 years. 
Our talented teams around the world are committed to our future success, and for their effort and commitment to excellence, we are very grateful. Now Thomas will discuss the key drivers of our overall performance. Dennis will review our future results and 2016 outlook in detail. And Mike and Eric will discuss the results of their respective operating units. Thomas?"

Activision Blizzard had another successful year in 2015. We achieved record digital revenues, up 20% year-over-year, and for the first time in 2015, our digital revenues were larger than our retail revenues.",634,"Thank you, Bobby, and good afternoon, everyone. Activision Blizzard had another successful year in 2015. We achieved record digital revenues, up 20% year-over-year, and for the first time in 2015, our digital revenues were larger than our retail revenues. At constant currency, we achieved 4% revenue growth and 13% EPS growth above 2014's record levels. These results were driven by our strategic focus and execution of growing our audiences, deepening engagement and providing opportunities for more player investment. Let's briefly go through each of these key business drivers. First, we broadened our audience reach with successful new content launches and expanded onto new platforms and geographies. In the fourth quarter, our monthly active users grew to our highest level ever at over 80 million users. For the full year, MAUs grew 25% over 2014. And in key markets like China, where we launched 3 new games in 2015, our revenue growth accelerated to 87% year-over-year, faster than ever before. 
Second, we drove deeper engagement by providing outstanding gameplay and frequent content updates. Players spent 3.5 billion hours playing our games in the fourth quarter alone. For the full year, engagement was up 16% to a record 14 billion hours. And this doesn't include rapidly growing hours spent spectating, which we estimate for Activision Blizzard alone is now 1.5 billion hours. 
Third, we progressed in something that is very hard to do but is critical for our business. We shifted to a year-round player investment model while growing engagement at the same time. And as a result, we grew our revenues from in-game content in services to over 1.6 billion, that's up 57% year-over-year at constant FX. 
When executed well, increased player investment and deeper engagement are not a trade-off but instead can reinforce each other, and we are pleased that our results are proving out this important element of our business strategy. As we look ahead to 2016 on our core business, we expect continued growth from these strategic initiatives against the backdrop of an increasing install base of devices capable of delivering games around the world. We will continue to see the shift towards a digital distribution network, and most importantly, we will deliver another year of the very best interactive entertainment in the world. 
In addition to the organic progress we made in 2015, we also created opportunities for growth ahead through new corporate initiatives focused on the fastest-growing parts of our industry. Let's start with King, which we expect to add to our portfolio later this month. King operates in the large and rapidly growing mobile segment, with a world-class management team, exceptional game development talent and great commercial instincts. 
In addition to being significantly accretive this year, we expect the transaction will solidify Activision Blizzard's position as a world leader in interactive entertainment, positioning the combined company for growth across platforms, audiences, geographies and business models. 
Second, our recent acquisition of Major League Gaming will accelerate our opportunities in eSports. Major League Gaming provides us with a superb streaming platform, league management expertise with MLG Pro Circuit and online competition and prize play through the game balance platform. We believe our investments in eSports fit perfectly with our strategy to deepen audience engagement by celebrating our players, delivering high-production values to our communities and providing greater opportunities for player investment. 
By the end of February, we'll have one of the largest entertainment networks in the world, with over 0.5 billion monthly active users and some of the strongest franchises in all of entertainment with meaningful new long-term growth opportunities for future value creation. We couldn't be more excited to welcome the incredibly talented teams at King and MLG into the Activision Blizzard family. 
So now I hand it over to Dennis, who will take you through our results in detail."

Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our Q4 and full year 2015 financial results and then I will review our outlook for 2016. 12 months ago, our original non-GAAP outlook included revenues of $4.4 billion, 30% operating margin",1831,"Thank you, Thomas. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our Q4 and full year 2015 financial results and then I will review our outlook for 2016. 12 months ago, our original non-GAAP outlook included revenues of $4.4 billion, 30% operating margin and EPS of $1.15. Today, we are announcing that we delivered revenues of $4.62 billion, a 32% operating margin and EPS of $1.32. Once again exceeding our initial guidance this year by $221 million on revenues and by $0.17 on EPS. Importantly, digital revenues achieved the quarterly record in Q4, and for the year, grew 20% or 29% at constant FX versus last year to an all-time annual record of $2.63 billion. This represented a 57% share of our total revenues, up from 46% last year. This strong growth in digital revenue was driven by new and emerging high-margin opportunities, including in-game content and services, which grew 57% at constant FX. This in-game content and services now account for about 1/3 of our total revenues. In addition, console full-game downloads grew 56% year-over-year or at 65% at constant FX. 
From a capital perspective, we delivered more than $1 billion of operating cash flow for the 6th year out of the past 7. Further, we strengthened our balance sheet and we're upgraded to investment-grade by Moody's. We paid a record dividend to shareholders, repaid $250 million of our debt and continued to invest in a strong pipeline of new opportunities with high-margin potential and announced agreements to acquire King Digital and Major League Gaming. So it was a busy year on many fronts for the company. 
Now let's take a moment to review our operational performance for 2015. Activision grew in 2015 on its path to becoming an increasingly digital business, with digital revenues up nearly 70% this year, driven by strong growth from full game digital downloads and in-game content and services. We still have considerable opportunity in digital, because even with the strong growth, less than 50% of Activision revenues were digital last year. 
In Q4, Call of Duty: Black Ops exceeded our plan in prior year in practically every key commercial and engagement metric, delivering upside for the year. And more importantly, the Call of Duty franchise had its largest player community ever at year-end. Destiny’s Q3 release, The Taken King, continued to perform strongly as well. We did, however, experienced lower-than-expected performance on Skylanders and Guitar Hero, which Eric will discuss in more detail in a few moments. 2015 was an important year for Blizzard, with expansion across more platforms, business models and regions than ever before. It was the first year since our merger that more than 50% of Blizzard's revenue was derived from content in-games other than World of Warcraft. Blizzard has also exhibited strong growth in new territories, with China revenues reaching new highs. Blizzard's large online community is growing and is stronger than ever. 
Now let's turn to our financial results. For the quarter, on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.35 billion, up $135 million versus our November guidance, and operating margin of 18% and GAAP EPS of $0.21, up $0.12 versus our November guidance. 
For the quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $2.12 billion and operating margin of 40% and EPS of $0.83. We outperformed November guidance by $0.01 on EPS. We came in slightly below our total revenue expectations, largely due to foreign exchange and underperformance on our casual franchises on console. In terms of EBITDA, in Q4, we generated non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $862 million and $1.55 billion for the year. 
Operating cash flow for the year was $1.19 billion, and free cash flow was $1.08 billion. We had no share repurchases during the year. On a non-GAAP basis for the year, revenues were $4.62 billion, down slightly year-over-year and up 4% at constant FX. Our non-GAAP operating income was $1.47 billion, reflecting an operating margin of 32% or 34% at constant FX and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 34%. Our tax rate was 22%, and our EPS was $1.32. At constant currency, our EPS grew 13% year-over-year above 2014's record EPS levels. 
Turning to FX. Please note that as discussed on prior calls, the strong dollar continue to be a headwind as our international revenues were translated at lower rates than in 2014. In the quarter, the year-over-year FX impact was $125 million on revenue and $0.11 on EPS. For the year, there was a significant FX impact of $364 million on revenue and $0.28 on EPS. 
Turning to the balance sheet. As of December 31, we had approximately $5.4 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $1.35 billion was held domestically. Approximately $3.6 billion of this cash was held in escrow, and combined with the incremental $2.3 billion term loan we have committed from our banking syndicate, will provide funding for the closing of our pending King transaction. 
Now let's turn to our plans for 2016. For the first time as we shift to a year-round engagement model in our business, we expect more than 50% of our earnings to be realized in the first 3 quarters of the calendar year. For our Activision business, we expect Call of Duty to continue its strong momentum by the delivery of fantastic new game content, including multiple map packs, in-game content and an innovative, new Call of Duty game in Q4. For planning purposes, as we have assumed in past years, we have modeled Q4 new release sales to be down from last year's Black Ops III levels. We do expect overall Call of Duty franchise revenues, however, to be up for the year, given strong engagement trends leading into the digital season for Black Ops in the first half of 2016. 
On Destiny, we expect to deliver a new expansion in 2016, but note that we no longer expect the full-game Destiny released during the year. We do, however, expect the full-game Destiny sequel to now come in 2017. For Skylanders, in Q4, we expect to release an innovative new game, which for guidance purposes, we plan to be down year-over-year given the challenging competitive environment in the toys-to-life category. 
Turning to Blizzard. We have a lot of exciting plans this year that Mike will cover in more detail later on the call. Blizzard plans to release the highly anticipated Overwatch in the spring as well as the Legion, expansion for World of Warcraft, in the summer. In addition, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm will have ongoing content updates throughout the year. Our 2016 guidance today also includes King, as we expect to close the transaction later this month. Note that there are a few key closing conditions still outstanding, including Irish High Court approval and EU regulatory approval, both of which are expected shortly. King has already launched Candy Crush Jelly Saga, the first of 3 new franchise games that are expected in 2016. We are excited about their plan and look forward to closing of the transaction soon. 
On capital allocation, our board has once again increased our dividend this year by 13% to $0.26 per share payable in May. Additionally, once we've closed the King transaction, our primary focus for the nearer term will be on debt reduction, and we plan to repay up to $1.5 billion of debt in 2016. 
With that context, now let's review the numbers. For 2016, we expect GAAP revenues of $6.1 billion, product costs of 23% and operating expenses of 65%. We expect GAAP net interest expense of $245 million. For both GAAP and non-GAAP, we expect the fully diluted weighted average share count of 767 million and a tax rate of 25%. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.45. Our GAAP earnings are expected to be down versus prior year, as the expected results will be impacted by additional accounting charges associated with the King transaction, which include, among other things, transaction-related cost and the amortization of intangibles resulting from purchase price accounting adjustments. The majority of these GAAP accounting charges will not impact the economics of our business or cash flows, although they will have a material impact on our 2016 GAAP results. 
I want to highlight that there could be significant movement in our GAAP outlook as it will be impacted by estimates and assumptions, which may be materially different when the King transaction actually closes. These estimates and assumptions are inherently difficult to predict. Please refer to our GAAP to non-GAAP outlook reconciliation tables on our earnings release for more details. 
On a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.25 billion, product cost of 23% and operating expense of 44%. We expect a non-GAAP operating margin of 32% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 35%. We expect non-GAAP net interest expense of $235 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.75, which as we indicated when we announced the transaction in November, contemplates 30% accretion from King. 
A few things to call out to help you understand the non-GAAP EPS numbers here. First of all, please note that as was mentioned earlier, we do not expect the full game Destiny release this year, which has an approximately $0.15 impact on our guidance. A full game Destiny sequel is now expected in 2017. Also note that we plan to transition King's current compensation plan from an equity-based compensation program to a cash-based, profit-sharing plan, more similar to what is used today at Blizzard and in Activision studio organization. Overall, this is value neutral as it moves equity expense in the compensation expense, however, it will negatively affect non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.06 this year. We believe that this incentive structure has proven successful in our existing business, and we're confident that it will also drive business results with King. Note that both the Destiny timing and the King compensation impact are included in our $1.75 non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year. 
Now let's turn to our quarterly outlook, which assumes King closes later this month. On a GAAP basis for the March quarter, we expect net revenues of $1.26 billion, product costs of 21% and operating expenses of 58%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $55 million, attach rate of 25% and share count of 756 million. We expect GAAP EPS of $0.21. On a non-GAAP basis for the March quarter, we expect revenues of $800 million, product cost of 23% and operating expenses of 57%. 
We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.11. In summary, 2015 was an important year for Activision Blizzard, and we again delivered strong financial results during a truly transformational year for the company, which had a strong foundation for future growth. With the largest interactive entertainment network, some of the most important wholly owned franchises in all of entertainment, solid execution skill and continued business discipline, we are poised for continued success and driving shareholder value creation over the long term. 
Now I will turn the call over to Eric to discuss Activision."

Our digital revenues grew by 68% year-over-year. At constant currency, our total revenues grew 7% and our operating income grew 30% year-over-year, with more than 600 basis points of margin expansion. We're providing great year-round content that our fans will have in its results our monthly active users were up 20% in 2015 year-over-year, with a double-digit increase in Q4 as well reaching our highest level ever. We grew our leadership on next-gen. We now have 4 of the top 10 titles on PS4 and Xbox One life-to-date, including the #1 spot with Call of Duty Black Ops III. And our partnership with Sony is up to a great start on both Call of Duty and Destiny. This year we saw our largest franchise, Call of Duty, ascend to new heights with performance above our plans. OI and margin growth for Call of Duty continues to expand and we also saw phenomenal reception to in-game content and services. This was a virtuous cycle engagement, creates the opportunity for us to earn additional player investment by providing more great content, which in turn leads to more engagement. Along with our partners at Bungie, we continue to grow Destiny’s incredibly loyal audience base and introduced new ways to excite the community throughout the year, culminating the release of the Taken King, which achieved record digital attach rates in Q3. And the Destiny community responded well to the new content we made available for purchase in-game in Q4, which allowed players to customize their experience. Our games for core audiences did extremely well, but our games for casual audiences performed below expectations, largely due to greater competition in the toys-to-life genre, and we believe because of the casual audiences shift to mobile devices, which will benefit the company overall in the future. We want to be where our casual audience is, in light of the pending King transaction where we're starting new opportunities on mobile. While Skylanders performed below our expectations, we believe in its future and remain committed to the franchise. We will do what we always do, which is to make sure that we have rightsized the investment on our efforts in the category, while continuing to introduce breakthrough innovations that our fans will love. We're excited about the innovations in the next Skylanders game launching this fall, from the creators of the franchise and the genre, Toys for Bob. More on that in the coming months. 
We expect to launch Skylanders Academy, a new animated TV series, later this year, which will help extend the reach and the popularity of the franchise and introduce our characters and their adventures to new audiences. Next, Guitar Hero Live, is a fun, high-quality game to introduce innovative new gameplay to fans, including the GHTV platform, which keeps our community engaged and will allow us to cost-effectively deliver new content and build our install base. We plan to release new content but not another full Guitar Hero console game this cycle. 
Turning to Destiny. The Destiny community is one of the most passionate, loyal audiences for a game that we have ever seen. Our audience has logged in with 3 billion hours in the game. We're excited to announce that we will be bringing a large, new expansion to Destiny this year the players are going to love. We'll also be delivering other content and events throughout the year to keep the community engaged. We're also working with Bungie on the sequel to Destiny, which will be coming in 2017. And we look forward to sharing more with you on this in the future. 
Finally, Call of Duty, which continues to gain momentum and set new records. In quarters 1 through 3, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare overperformed our plan and the prior year with very strong performance on our digital season of content. In Q4, Call of Duty: Black Ops III exceeded our plan in the prior year in practically every key area: retail selling and sell through, digital full game sales, digital in-game sales and Season Pass sales. Black Ops III delivered the biggest entertainment launch in 2015, even beating Star Wars: The Force Awakens in its opening weekend. 
Black Ops III was the top-selling console game globally by a wide margin in both units and dollars sold through. In fact, according to NPD and GfK, we sold through more copies of Black Ops III than the 2 closest competitors in the genre combined. On a franchise basis, Call of Duty was #1 in North America for the incredible 7th year in a row, and has now surpassed 250 million units sold life-to-date worldwide, with over $15 billion in sell-in, on full game and in-game content. Importantly, engagement on Call of Duty exceeded, both our plan and the prior year. Call of Duty franchise monthly active users grew by 20% year-over-year in December, and time spent grew by 30%. In fact, in November and December, we had the highest monthly active users in franchise history. This reach and engagement is a promising sign as we look ahead to Black Ops III's upcoming 2016 season of content. Season Pass sales for Black Ops III have increased significantly year-over-year, setting a franchise record for total sales. 
We're seeing the players are deeply invested in personalizing their gameplay experience in the game. We launched Supply Drops for Advanced Warfare well after the launch of the game itself, driving significant player investment and strong engagement. We have already launched an early version of Supply Drops in Black Ops III and we plan to create more fun new content for our fans to enjoy in the months ahead. This Q4, we'll have a new, innovative Call of Duty game from our award-winning studio, Infinity Ward, the makers of the Modern Warfare series. 
And of course, our eSports initiatives on Call of Duty are transforming the experience for pro players and fans alike. Interest in Call of Duty eSports continues to rise, with 1/3 more people watching the prequalifying matches for Call of Duty World League than watched the championship matches last year. The top teams in the world are competing each week in live broadcast competitions to see who will qualify for the Call of Duty World Championships later this year. We'll broadcast 750 hours of competitive Call of Duty programming, but more importantly, we'll aspire millions of Call of Duty fans to celebrate the game in a whole new way. And now I'll turn the call over to Mike to talk about Blizzard."

We achieved an all-time high in active players and ended Q4 up nearly 25% in average MAUs year-over-year. On a constant-currency basis, we achieved even higher revenues in 2015 than 2014, which was a record year for us. These results reflect our careful and long-held approach to growing our community and deepening their engagement with high-quality content. In 2015, we expanded to new platforms and new regions, bringing our games to more players than ever before. In addition, we broke new ground with the first live telecast of a collegiate eSports tournament on ESPN, and our ninth BlizzCon highlighted the amount of diversity and diversity of upcoming content in our pipeline. BlizzCon also showed the strong connection we have with our global community. More than 25,000 Blizzard gamers attended the show from all 50 states and nearly 60 countries. We had our highest livestream viewership ever, with over 10 million people around the world tuning in, and we have record audience on pay-per-view as well. 
Our specific franchise highlights further demonstrate the value we see in delivering and supporting high-quality game experiences globally. Hearthstone had a great quarter and a great year. For those who might not be familiar with Hearthstone, it's our free-to-play collectible card game on PC, Mac, tablet and mobile. It has very strong global appeal and it brought Blizzard to a new genre, on new platforms, with a new business model. Ahead of BlizzCon, Hearthstone surpassed 40 million registered players, and it closed out December with record global engagement in multiple categories including MAUs. 
The introduction of Hearthstone on mobile last year was a big contributor to that. We announced our new adventure, The League of Explorers, at BlizzCon and launched it the following week. League of Explorers brings new cards, new game mechanics and a lot of personality. Despite the shorter window to launch and no presales, as we've had with our previous adventure, League of Explorers sold over 20% more units as of 6 weeks post launch. We also expanded Hearthstone into a new region. In October, we released the Japanese version, providing easier access for new and existing Japanese players. 
Moving on to World of Warcraft. We saw quarter-over-quarter growth in Q4, as we kicked off presales at BlizzCon for our new expansion, Legion, which is coming out in the summer. And we released a new content patch. With Legion, we're taking care to build off the best aspects of Warlords of Draenor to create an experience that appeals to an even wider audience and, which offers more opportunities for sustained engagement. Legion adds a new hero class, customizable weapons, class order halls, which strengthened the social elements of the game and more. This will give players more compelling options for extending their experience. With this expansion, we are again offering a character level boost immediately with prepurchase. And for the first time, we're also offering early access to the new character class, which will be activated for everyone who prepurchases the expansion once it's ready. Before I move on, I want to thank our community for the generosity they showed with the World of Warcraft charity pet that we offered on behalf of Make-a-Wish. With our players' support, we achieved a new record for the donation we'll be making to Make-a-Wish, over $1.7 million. That reflects the passion and power of a very strong and very engaged community. 
Next, Overwatch, our new IP, which will be a big step into a new genre for us as well as our first simultaneous release across multiple platforms. As with other Blizzard franchises, we have long-term plans to support this new IP with more content and also with external world bid of building efforts and a robust eSports program. Overwatch made a lot of news in the quarter and continued to build momentum. We announced the remainder of the 21-hero launch lineup at BlizzCon and revealed the console versions of the game. We also began closed beta testing, reaching top viewed status on Twitch. In addition, we shared our plans to patch in more heroes after launch, which received a very positive response. 
We are excited about Overwatch's potential, and we look forward to sharing more details as we get closer to its spring release. One of our big highlights for the quarter was the launch of StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void. The new features and content make StarCraft II easier to get into than ever before. And we see a lot of excitement with the launch. As of its first 24 hours, Legacy of the Void had sold through more than 1 million copies. In addition, it received multiple awards for best strategy game of 2015. At BlizzCon, we announced a series of standalone digital mission packs featuring Nova, a popular character in StarCraft II and Heroes of the Storm. This content will give players exciting new options for continuing their StarCraft II experience and will be a great entry point for anyone new to StarCraft. 
We've been very pleased to see a very positive player response and look forward to releasing the first mission pack in the spring. Q4 was also a busy one for Heroes of the Storm, our free-to-play team brawler that features iconic characters from across our best-selling franchises. With Heroes of the Storm, we've worked hard to push the boundaries of the genre while keeping the game engaging and accessible for the widest possible audience. For example, at BlizzCon, we announced a new game mode, the Arena, which will mix up gameplay with fun parameters, smaller maps and shorter sessions when it's released later this year. We also revealed our 10th battleground and 3 new heroes at the show, including Cho'gall, a hero controlled by 2 players. Players around the world have responded with enthusiasm for unique heroes like Cho'gall, and with support for the experience that Heroes of the Storm delivers. Heroes of the Storm had a great close to the year, taking home multiple awards, including: Best Competitive Multiplayer and Best MOBA from Game Informer. 
I also want to touch on Diablo III, which had a strong and active -- have the strong and active community nearly 4 years after launch. The game performed very well throughout 2015, in part, due to our launch in China, which broke sales records there. Players in the media have been enthusiastic about the content we've added over time, and our recent patch in January is no exception. There are new zones, legendary weapons, set dungeons and more. In addition, we periodically restart seasons, refreshing the challenge for players. Diablo III continues to thrive in all regions, and we appreciate all the support from players around the world. We are also supporting community engagement and franchise growth outside of our games, particularly with world-class eSports that represent the diversity of our portfolio and our audiences' interests. At BlizzCon, we had our strongest eSports lineup to-date and crowned champions in Hearthstone, World of Warcraft Arena, StarCraft II and Heroes of the Storm for a very different but equally exciting eSports experiences for attendees and spectators online. 
Looking forward, 2016 will be our biggest Blizzard eSports program ever. It will be Heroes of the Storm's first full year of global competition. In addition, Heroes of the Dorm collegiate tournament is returning, and we've added another evening of prime time coverage this time, with the final matches, The Heroic Four, playing out over 2 nights on ESPN2. 
We also made changes to the StarCraft II World Championship series and Hearthstone's Championship Tour to give local heroes even more opportunities to shine. And we're excited about our eSports plans for Overwatch and look forward to sharing more details about that in the future. With strength across all franchises and broader reach than ever, we're very enthusiastic about 2016. We are especially excited about the spring launch of Overwatch and look forward to releasing World of Warcraft: Legion in the summer on the heels of the June release of the Warcraft movie. With all of the content and activities we have planned, we expect another year of solid growth of the Blizzard community, and we're very excited about the future. As Bobby mentioned, Monday was Blizzard's 25th anniversary. We've put our hearts into making great games for 25 years. We're very proud of the worlds that we've created and the great moments we've shared with our players. We are extremely grateful for the support of our players, and we look forward to many more adventures in the next 25 years and beyond. 
Thank you. And I'll turn the call back over to Amrita."

Its excellent gameplay, art style, interface. And so I think we're bringing a Blizzard take 2 to an already very fun genre. We're looking forward to launching our PC and console's simultaneous launch this spring.

And most of that is against the media networks, which is our eSports division that Bobby was referencing there. We do have additional eSports investments in some of our business and franchise level, details that Mike and Eric alluded to. But we think those are more around demand generation than anything and help support the franchise that they cover. On your other question, Colin, around macro environment and sort of competitive aspects. It is, yes, you've hit on the, obviously, Skylanders and Guitar Hero points, where in the casual segment on console, there was more competition that feels more category specific. When we look more across the broad base of our business, we feel -- we haven't really felt many of the macro trends that are sort of -- and volatility we've seen in the overall market really affecting our business, and in fact, many of the digital trends when you look at our biggest franchises, are stronger than ever. And in fact in many new regions, even regions that are experiencing some turmoil like China, we've had great growth in the past year.

Obviously, the digital transition has been a very nice tailwind for us over the past several years, and really frontline console games are the final part of the transition.

As we mentioned in the call and Thomas's remarks and my remarks, the add-on content and services, which is purchases effectively after the initial sale, are really increasingly more important and are as important and are growing incredibly fast and is one of the fastest parts of our digital portfolio. Your question now on frontline titles, it really varies by title, super games like Destiny, it had a -- in the high 20s in terms of digital downloads, in terms of overall volume. For Call of Duty, just based on the size of the player base, full game downloads were a lower share than that, although on an absolute basis, call it full game downloads were up over 80% year-over-year. So a very nice progress there. And we know when we look at the Blizzard's side of our portfolio on the PC, the vast majority of those frontline games are delivered digitally. Obviously that brings margin benefits for us as each new game gets delivered through digital channels, brings us gross margin benefits, and you'll see that in our overall corporate margin. We were at 32% this year, and with currency effects or excluding the currency effects, it would have been north of 34%.

This month, Mike Morhaime and I are celebrating our 25th anniversaries with the company, and I wanted to take this opportunity to thank Mike and the incredibly talented team at Blizzard f",648,"Thank you, Amrita, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon. This month, Mike Morhaime and I are celebrating our 25th anniversaries with the company, and I wanted to take this opportunity to thank Mike and the incredibly talented team at Blizzard for 25 years of creating some of the world's most inspired, enduring and entertaining franchises. 
They have one of the best track records of any game company in the creation of franchises, and this year, with Overwatch, Blizzard will launch its entire -- first entirely new franchise in 17 years. From the reaction so far, Overwatch is on track to become a fantastic success. Mike, thank you for 25 extraordinary years, and I'm looking forward to many more together. 
We ended our 2015, our 25th year, with $4.6 billion of revenues, $1.5 billion of operating income and $1.2 billion of operating cash flow. Upon the expected close of our acquisition of King later this month, we'll have over 0.5 billion monthly active users in 196 countries, which as an entertainment network, ranks only behind Facebook, YouTube and WeChat in monthly active users. We'll have 7x the audience members of Netflix and have a larger audience than Snapchat and Twitter combined. We'll be the world's leading standalone interactive entertainment company, and we expect 2016 to be a record year for the company, with $6.25 billion of revenues and more than $2 billion of operating income. In the past 25 years, based on yesterday's stock price, our compound rate of return was over 1,000%, and we outperformed the S&P 500 by almost 300%. In our Annual Report last year, we shared our plans to enhance engagement in our franchises and celebrate our players through initiatives like eSports, and we're really beginning to better realize these plans. 
Last year, our Activision Blizzard games were played for over 14 billion hours, and spectators watched over 1.5 billion hours of video content based on our games. In the 2014, 2015 seasons, fans of the NFL watched about 7 billion hours of nationally televised games, which is less than half the time spent engaged with our franchises. Those televised games generated approximately $7 billion of broadcast rights fees for the NFL and another $4 billion in other revenues, including sponsorships, merchandise and ticket sales. When we think about our franchises, we view our responsibilities to our fans and the associated business opportunity through the lens of these leagues, like the NFL, the Premier League, the NBA, Major League Baseball or NHL. Our franchise today generates revenues principally from the sale of interactive content but not meaningful revenues from tournament play, advertising, broadcasting and pay-per-view, licensing or merchandising, all of which are great future financial opportunities we are pursuing. 
We think competitive gaming and the spectator opportunities connected to organize gaming competitions could provide sizeable opportunities for shareholders and great rewards and recognition for our hundreds of millions of players. We continue to believe that eSports is another long-term growth pillar for the company, and our recent acquisition of Major League Gaming has accelerated our strategic plans. eSports helps fuel one of the underlying drivers of our strong financial performance, which is a deepening engagement with our fans. As I begin my 25th year at the company, I couldn't be more excited about the many, many opportunities we see ahead. Prioritization of opportunity remains a great challenge, but our well-defined strategy and focused execution have enabled us to make great content, satisfy large audiences and generate superior shareholder returns for 25 years. 
Our talented teams around the world are committed to our future success, and for their effort and commitment to excellence, we are very grateful. Now Thomas will discuss the key drivers of our overall performance. Dennis will review our future results and 2016 outlook in detail. And Mike and Eric will discuss the results of their respective operating units. Thomas?"

Activision Blizzard had another successful year in 2015. We achieved record digital revenues, up 20% year-over-year, and for the first time in 2015, our digital revenues were larger than our retail revenues.",634,"Thank you, Bobby, and good afternoon, everyone. Activision Blizzard had another successful year in 2015. We achieved record digital revenues, up 20% year-over-year, and for the first time in 2015, our digital revenues were larger than our retail revenues. At constant currency, we achieved 4% revenue growth and 13% EPS growth above 2014's record levels. These results were driven by our strategic focus and execution of growing our audiences, deepening engagement and providing opportunities for more player investment. Let's briefly go through each of these key business drivers. First, we broadened our audience reach with successful new content launches and expanded onto new platforms and geographies. In the fourth quarter, our monthly active users grew to our highest level ever at over 80 million users. For the full year, MAUs grew 25% over 2014. And in key markets like China, where we launched 3 new games in 2015, our revenue growth accelerated to 87% year-over-year, faster than ever before. 
Second, we drove deeper engagement by providing outstanding gameplay and frequent content updates. Players spent 3.5 billion hours playing our games in the fourth quarter alone. For the full year, engagement was up 16% to a record 14 billion hours. And this doesn't include rapidly growing hours spent spectating, which we estimate for Activision Blizzard alone is now 1.5 billion hours. 
Third, we progressed in something that is very hard to do but is critical for our business. We shifted to a year-round player investment model while growing engagement at the same time. And as a result, we grew our revenues from in-game content in services to over 1.6 billion; that's up 57% year-over-year at constant FX. 
When executed well, increased player investment and deeper engagement are not a trade-off but instead can reinforce each other, and we are pleased that our results are proving out this important element of our business strategy. As we look ahead to 2016 on our core business, we expect continued growth from these strategic initiatives against the backdrop of an increasing install base of devices capable of delivering games around the world. We will continue to see the shift towards a digital distribution network, and most importantly, we will deliver another year of the very best interactive entertainment in the world. 
In addition to the organic progress we made in 2015, we also created opportunities for growth ahead through new corporate initiatives focused on the fastest-growing parts of our industry. Let's start with King, which we expect to add to our portfolio later this month. King operates in the large and rapidly growing mobile segment, with a world-class management team, exceptional game development talent and great commercial instincts. 
In addition to being significantly accretive this year, we expect the transaction will solidify Activision Blizzard's position as a world leader in interactive entertainment, positioning the combined company for growth across platforms, audiences, geographies and business models. 
Second, our recent acquisition of Major League Gaming will accelerate our opportunities in eSports. Major League Gaming provides us with a superb streaming platform, league management expertise with MLG Pro Circuit and online competition and prize plays through the game balance platform. We believe our investments in eSports fit perfectly with our strategy to deepen audience engagement by celebrating our players, delivering high-production values to our communities and providing greater opportunities for player investment. 
By the end of February, we'll have one of the largest entertainment networks in the world, with over 0.5 billion monthly active users and some of the strongest franchises in all of entertainment with meaningful new long-term growth opportunities for future value creation. We couldn't be more excited to welcome the incredibly talented teams at King and MLG into the Activision Blizzard family. 
So now I hand it over to Dennis, who will take you through our results in detail."

Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our Q4 and full year 2015 financial results and then I will review our outlook for 2016. 12 months ago, our original non-GAAP outlook included revenues of $4.4 billion, 30% operating margin",1833,"Thank you, Thomas. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our Q4 and full year 2015 financial results and then I will review our outlook for 2016. 12 months ago, our original non-GAAP outlook included revenues of $4.4 billion, 30% operating margin and EPS of $1.15. Today, we are announcing that we delivered revenues of $4.62 billion, a 32% operating margin and EPS of $1.32 -- once again exceeding our initial guidance this year by $221 million on revenues and by $0.17 on EPS. Importantly, digital revenues achieved a quarterly record in Q4, and for the year, grew 20% or 29% at constant FX versus last year to an all-time annual record of $2.63 billion. This represented a 57% share of our total revenues, up from 46% last year. This strong growth in digital revenue was driven by new and emerging high-margin opportunities, including in-game content and services, which grew 57% at constant FX. This in-game content and services now account for about 1/3 of our total revenues. In addition, console full-game downloads grew 56% year-over-year or at 65% at constant FX. 
From a capital perspective, we delivered more than $1 billion of operating cash flow for the 6th year out of the past 7. Further, we strengthened our balance sheet and we were upgraded to investment-grade by Moody's. We paid a record dividend to shareholders, repaid $250 million of our debt and continued to invest in a strong pipeline of new opportunities with high-margin potential and announced agreements to acquire King Digital and Major League Gaming. So it was a busy year on many fronts for the company. 
Now let's take a moment to review our operational performance for 2015. Activision grew in 2015 on its path to becoming an increasingly digital business, with digital revenues up nearly 70% this year, driven by strong growth from full game digital downloads and in-game content and services. We still have considerable opportunity in digital, because even with this strong growth, less than 50% of Activision revenues were digital last year. 
In Q4, Call of Duty: Black Ops exceeded our plan in prior year in practically every key commercial and engagement metric, delivering upside for the year. And more importantly, the Call of Duty franchise had its largest player community ever at year-end. Destiny’s Q3 release, The Taken King, continued to perform strongly as well. We did, however, experienced lower-than-expected performance on Skylanders and Guitar Hero, which Eric will discuss in more detail in a few moments. 2015 was an important year for Blizzard, with expansion across more platforms, business models and regions than ever before. It was the first year since our merger that more than 50% of Blizzard's revenue was derived from content in games other than World of Warcraft. Blizzard has also exhibited strong growth in new territories, with China revenues reaching new highs. Blizzard's large online community is growing and is stronger than ever. 
Now let's turn to our financial results. For the quarter, on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.35 billion, up $135 million versus our November guidance, and operating margin of 18% and GAAP EPS of $0.21, up $0.12 versus our November guidance. 
For the quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $2.12 billion and operating margin of 40% and EPS of $0.83. We outperformed November guidance by $0.01 on EPS. We came in slightly below our revenue expectations, largely due to foreign exchange and underperformance on our casual franchises on console. In terms of EBITDA, in Q4, we generated non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $862 million and $1.55 billion for the year. 
Operating cash flow for the year was $1.19 billion, and free cash flow was $1.08 billion. We had no share repurchases during the year. On a non-GAAP basis for the year, revenues were $4.62 billion, down slightly year-over-year and up 4% at constant FX. Our non-GAAP operating income was $1.47 billion, reflecting an operating margin of 32% or 34% at constant FX and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 34%. Our tax rate was 22%, and our EPS was $1.32. At constant currency, our EPS grew 13% year-over-year above 2014's record EPS levels. 
Turning to FX. Please note that as discussed on prior calls, the strong dollar continues to be a headwind as our international revenues were translated at lower rates than in 2014. In the quarter, the year-over-year FX impact was $125 million on revenue and $0.11 on EPS. For the year, there was a significant FX impact of $364 million on revenue and $0.28 on EPS. 
Turning to the balance sheet. As of December 31, we had approximately $5.4 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $1.35 billion was held domestically. Approximately $3.6 billion of this cash was held in escrow, and combined with the incremental $2.3 billion term loan we have committed from our banking syndicate, will provide funding for the closing of our pending King transaction. 
Now let's turn to our plans for 2016. For the first time as we shift to a year-round engagement model in our business, we expect more than 50% of our earnings to be realized in the first 3 quarters of the calendar year. For our Activision business, we expect Call of Duty to continue its strong momentum by the delivery of fantastic new game content, including multiple map packs, in-game content and an innovative, new Call of Duty game in Q4. For planning purposes, as we have assumed in past years, we have modeled Q4 new release sales to be down from last year's Black Ops III levels. We do expect overall Call of Duty franchise revenues, however, to be up for the year, given strong engagement trends leading into the digital season for Black Ops in the first half of 2016. 
On Destiny, we expect to deliver a new expansion in 2016, but note that we no longer expect a full-game Destiny release during the year. We do, however, expect a full-game Destiny sequel to now come in 2017. For Skylanders, in Q4, we expect to release an innovative new game, which for guidance purposes, we plan to be down year-over-year given the challenging competitive environment in the toys-to-life category. 
Turning to Blizzard. We have a lot of exciting plans this year that Mike will cover in more detail later on the call. Blizzard plans to release the highly anticipated Overwatch in the spring as well as the Legion expansion for World of Warcraft in the summer. In addition, Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm will have ongoing content updates throughout the year. Our 2016 guidance today also includes King, as we expect to close the transaction later this month. Note that there are a few key closing conditions still outstanding, including Irish High Court approval and EU regulatory approval, both of which are expected shortly. King has already launched Candy Crush Jelly Saga, the first of 3 new franchise games that are expected in 2016. We are excited about their plans and look forward to closing of the transaction soon. 
On capital allocation, our board has once again increased our dividend this year by 13% to $0.26 per share payable in May. Additionally, once we've closed the King transaction, our primary focus for the near term will be on debt reduction, and we plan to repay up to $1.5 billion of debt in 2016. 
With that context, now let's review the numbers. For 2016, we expect GAAP revenues of $6.1 billion, product costs of 23% and operating expenses of 65%. We expect GAAP net interest expense of $245 million. For both GAAP and non-GAAP, we expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of 767 million and a tax rate of 25%. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.45. Our GAAP earnings are expected to be down versus prior year, as the expected results will be impacted by additional accounting charges associated with the King transaction, which include, among other things, transaction-related cost and the amortization of intangibles resulting from purchase price accounting adjustments. The majority of these GAAP accounting charges will not impact the economics of our business or cash flows, although they will have a material impact on our 2016 GAAP results. 
I want to highlight that there could be significant movement in our GAAP outlook as it will be impacted by estimates and assumptions, which may be materially different when the King transaction actually closes. These estimates and assumptions are inherently difficult to predict. Please refer to our GAAP to non-GAAP outlook reconciliation tables on our earnings release for more details. 
On a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.25 billion, product cost of 23% and operating expense of 44%. We expect a non-GAAP operating margin of 32% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 35%. We expect non-GAAP net interest expense of $235 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.75, which as we indicated when we announced the transaction in November, contemplates 30% accretion from King. 
A few things to call out to help you understand the non-GAAP EPS numbers here. First of all, please note that as was mentioned earlier, we do not expect a full game Destiny release this year, which has an approximately $0.15 impact on our guidance. A full game Destiny sequel is now expected in 2017. Also note that we plan to transition King's current compensation plan from an equity-based compensation program to a cash-based, profit-sharing plan, more similar to what is used today at Blizzard and in Activision studio organization. Overall, this is value neutral as it moves equity expense into compensation expense; however, it will negatively affect non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.06 this year. We believe that this incentive structure has proven successful in our existing business, and we're confident that it will also drive business results with King. Note that both the Destiny timing and the King compensation impact are included in our $1.75 non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year. 
Now let's turn to our quarterly outlook, which assumes King closes later this month. On a GAAP basis for the March quarter, we expect net revenues of $1.26 billion, product costs of 21% and operating expenses of 58%. We expect GAAP and non-GAAP interest expense of $55 million, a tax rate of 25% and share count of 756 million. We expect GAAP EPS of $0.21. On a non-GAAP basis for the March quarter, we expect revenues of $800 million, product cost of 23% and operating expenses of 57%. 
We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.11. In summary, 2015 was an important year for Activision Blizzard, and we again delivered strong financial results during a truly transformational year for the company, which had a strong foundation for future growth. With the largest interactive entertainment network, some of the most important wholly owned franchises in all of entertainment, solid execution skill and continued business discipline, we are poised for continued success and driving shareholder value creation over the long term. 
Now I will turn the call over to Eric to discuss Activision."

Our digital revenues grew by 68% year-over-year. At constant currency, our total revenues grew 7% and our operating income grew 30% year-over-year, with more than 600 basis points of margin",1096,"Thanks, Dennis. 2015 was an important growth year for Activision. Our digital revenues grew by 68% year-over-year. At constant currency, our total revenues grew 7% and our operating income grew 30% year-over-year, with more than 600 basis points of margin expansion. We're providing great year-round content that our fans love, and as a result, our monthly active users were up 20% in 2015 year-over-year, with a double-digit increase in Q4 as well, reaching our highest level ever. We grew our leadership on next-gen. We now have 4 of the top 10 titles on PS4 and Xbox One life-to-date, including the #1 spot with Call of Duty Black Ops III. And our partnership with Sony is off to a great start on both Call of Duty and Destiny. This year we saw our largest franchise, Call of Duty, ascend to new heights with performance above our plans. OI and margin growth for Call of Duty continues to expand and we also saw phenomenal reception to in-game content and services. This is a virtuous cycle: engagement, creates the opportunity for us to earn additional player investment by providing more great content, which in turn leads to more engagement. Along with our partners at Bungie, we continue to grow Destiny’s incredibly loyal audience base and introduced new ways to excite the community throughout the year, culminating in the release of the Taken King, which achieved record digital attach rates in Q3. And the Destiny community responded well to the new content we made available for purchase in-game in Q4, which allowed players to customize their experience. Our games for core audiences did extremely well, but our games for casual audiences performed below expectations, largely due to greater competition in the toys-to-life genre, and we believe because of the casual audience shift to mobile devices, which will benefit the company overall in the future. We want to be where our casual audience is, in light of the pending King transaction with exciting new opportunities on mobile. While Skylanders performed below our expectations, we believe in its future and remain committed to the franchise. We will do what we always do, which is to make sure that we have rightsized the investment on our efforts in the category, while continuing to introduce breakthrough innovations that our fans will love. We're excited about the innovations in the next Skylanders game launching this fall, from the creators of the franchise and the genre, Toys for Bob. More on that in the coming months. 
We expect to launch Skylanders Academy, a new animated TV series, later this year, which will help extend the reach and the popularity of the franchise and introduce our characters and their adventures to new audiences. Next, Guitar Hero Live is a fun, high-quality game to introduce innovative new gameplay to fans, including the GHTV platform, which keeps our community engaged and will allow us to cost-effectively deliver new content and build our install base. We plan to release new content but not another full Guitar Hero console game this cycle. 
Turning to Destiny. The Destiny community is one of the most passionate, loyal audiences for a game that we have ever seen. Our audience has logged nearly 3 billion hours in the game. We're excited to announce that we will be bringing a large, new expansion to Destiny this year the players are going to love. We'll also be delivering other content and events throughout the year to keep the community engaged. We're also working with Bungie on the sequel to Destiny, which will be coming in 2017. And we look forward to sharing more with you on this in the future. 
Finally, Call of Duty, which continues to gain momentum and set new records. In quarters 1 through 3, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare overperformed our plan and the prior year with very strong performance on our digital season of content. In Q4, Call of Duty: Black Ops III exceeded our plan in the prior year in practically every key area: retail selling and sell through, digital full game sales, digital in-game sales and Season Pass sales. Black Ops III delivered the biggest entertainment launch in 2015, even beating Star Wars: The Force Awakens in its opening weekend. 
Black Ops III was the top-selling console game globally by a wide margin in both units and dollars sold through. In fact, according to NPD and GfK, we sold through more copies of Black Ops III than the 2 closest competitors in the genre combined. On a franchise basis, Call of Duty was #1 in North America for the incredible 7th year in a row, and has now surpassed 250 million units sold life-to-date worldwide, with over $15 billion in sell-in, on full game and in-game content. Importantly, engagement on Call of Duty exceeded, both our plan and the prior year. Call of Duty franchise monthly active users grew by 20% year-over-year in December, and time spent grew by 30%. In fact, in November and December, we had the highest monthly active users in franchise history. This reach and engagement is a promising sign as we look ahead to Black Ops III's upcoming 2016 season of content. Season Pass sales for Black Ops III have increased significantly year-over-year, setting a franchise record for total sales. 
We're seeing that players are deeply invested in personalizing their gameplay experience in the game. We launched Supply Drops for Advanced Warfare well after the launch of the game itself, driving significant player investment and strong engagement. We have already launched an early version of Supply Drops in Black Ops III and we plan to create more fun new content for our fans to enjoy in the months ahead. This Q4, we'll have a new, innovative Call of Duty game from our award-winning studio, Infinity Ward, the makers of the Modern Warfare series. 
And of course, our eSports initiatives on Call of Duty are transforming the experience for pro players and fans alike. Interest in Call of Duty eSports continues to rise, with 1/3 more people watching the prequalifying matches for Call of Duty World League than watched the championship matches last year. The top teams in the world are competing each week in live broadcast competitions to see who will qualify for the Call of Duty World Championships later this year. We'll broadcast 750 hours of competitive Call of Duty programming, but more importantly, we'll inspire millions of Call of Duty fans to celebrate the game in a whole new way. And now I'll turn the call over to Mike to talk about Blizzard."

On a constant-currency basis, we achieved even higher revenues in 2015 than 2014, which was a record year for us. These results reflect our careful and long-held approach to growing our community and deepening their engagement with high-quality content. In 2015, we expanded to new platforms and new regions, bringing our games to more players than ever before. In addition, we broke new ground with the first live telecast of a collegiate eSports tournament on ESPN, and our ninth BlizzCon highlighted the amount of diversity and diversity of upcoming content in our pipeline. BlizzCon also showed the strong connection we have with our global community. More than 25,000 Blizzard gamers attended the show from all 50 states and nearly 60 countries. We had our highest livestream viewership ever, with over 10 million people around the world tuning in, and we had record audience on pay-per-view as well. 
Our specific franchise highlights further demonstrate the value we see in delivering and supporting high-quality game experiences globally. Hearthstone had a great quarter and a great year. For those who might not be familiar with Hearthstone, it's our free-to-play collectible card game on PC, Mac, tablet and mobile. It has very strong global appeal and it brought Blizzard to a new genre, on new platforms, with a new business model. Ahead of BlizzCon, Hearthstone surpassed 40 million registered players, and it closed out December with record global engagement in multiple categories including MAUs. 
The introduction of Hearthstone on mobile last year was a big contributor to that. We announced our new adventure, The League of Explorers, at BlizzCon and launched it the following week. League of Explorers brings new cards, new game mechanics and a lot of personality. Despite the shorter window to launch and no presales as we've had with our previous adventure, League of Explorers sold over 20% more units as of 6 weeks post launch. We also expanded Hearthstone into a new region. In October, we released the Japanese version, providing easier access for new and existing Japanese players. 
Moving on to World of Warcraft. We saw quarter-over-quarter growth in Q4, as we kicked off presales at BlizzCon for our new expansion, Legion, which is coming out in the summer. And we released a new content patch. With Legion, we're taking care to build off the best aspects of Warlords of Draenor to create an experience that appeals to an even wider audience and which offers more opportunities for sustained engagement. Legion adds a new hero class, customizable weapons, class order halls, which strengthened the social elements of the game and more. This will give players more compelling options for extending their experience. With this expansion, we are again offering a character level boost immediately with prepurchase. And for the first time, we're also offering early access to the new character class, which will be activated for everyone who prepurchases the expansion once it's ready. Before I move on, I want to thank our community for the generosity they showed with the World of Warcraft charity pet that we offered on behalf of Make-a-Wish. With our players' support, we achieved a new record for the donation we'll be making to Make-a-Wish, over $1.7 million. That reflects the passion and power of a very strong and very engaged community. 
Next, Overwatch, our new IP, which will be a big step into a new genre for us as well as our first simultaneous release across multiple platforms. As with other Blizzard franchises, we have long-term plans to support this new IP with more content and also with external world-building efforts and a robust eSports program. Overwatch made a lot of news in the quarter and continued to build momentum. We announced the remainder of the 21-hero launch lineup at BlizzCon and revealed the console versions of the game. We also began closed beta testing, reaching top viewed status on Twitch. In addition, we shared our plans to patch in more heroes after launch, which received a very positive response. 
We are excited about Overwatch's potential, and we look forward to sharing more details as we get closer to its spring release. One of our big highlights for the quarter was the launch of StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void. The new features and content make StarCraft II easier to get into than ever before. And we see a lot of excitement with the launch. As of its first 24 hours, Legacy of the Void had sold through more than 1 million copies. In addition, it received multiple awards for best strategy game of 2015. At BlizzCon, we announced a series of standalone digital mission packs featuring Nova, a popular character in StarCraft II, and Heroes of the Storm. This content will give players exciting new options for continuing their StarCraft II experience and will be a great entry point for anyone new to StarCraft. 
We've been very pleased to see a very positive player response and look forward to releasing the first mission pack in the spring. Q4 was also a busy one for Heroes of the Storm, our free-to-play team brawler that features iconic characters from across our best-selling franchises. With Heroes of the Storm, we've worked hard to push the boundaries of the genre while keeping the game engaging and accessible for the widest possible audience. For example, at BlizzCon, we announced a new game mode, the Arena, which will mix up gameplay with fun parameters, smaller maps and shorter sessions when it's released later this year. We also revealed our 10th battleground and 3 new heroes at the show, including Cho'gall, a hero controlled by 2 players. Players around the world have responded with enthusiasm for unique heroes like Cho'gall, and with support for the experience that Heroes of the Storm delivers. Heroes of the Storm had a great close to the year, taking home multiple awards, including: Best Competitive Multiplayer and Best MOBA from Game Informer. 
I also want to touch on Diablo III, which had a strong and active -- has a strong and active community nearly 4 years after launch. The game performed very well throughout 2015, in part, due to our launch in China, which broke sales records there. Players in the media have been enthusiastic about the content we've added over time, and our recent patch in January is no exception. There are new zones, legendary weapons, set dungeons and more. In addition, we periodically restart seasons, refreshing the challenge for players. Diablo III continues to thrive in all regions, and we appreciate all the support from players around the world. We are also supporting community engagement and franchise growth outside of our games, particularly with world-class eSports that represent the diversity of our portfolio and our audiences' interests. At BlizzCon, we had our strongest eSports lineup to-date and crowned champions in Hearthstone, World of Warcraft Arena, StarCraft II and Heroes of the Storm for a very different but equally exciting eSports experiences for attendees and spectators online. 
Looking forward, 2016 will be our biggest Blizzard eSports program ever. It will be Heroes of the Storm's first full year of global competition. In addition, Heroes of the Dorm collegiate tournament is returning, and we've added another evening of prime time coverage this time, with the final matches, The Heroic Four, playing out over 2 nights on ESPN2. 
We also made changes to the StarCraft II World Championship series and Hearthstone's Championship Tour to give local heroes even more opportunities to shine. And we're excited about our eSports plans for Overwatch and look forward to sharing more details about that in the future. With strength across all franchises and broader reach than ever, we're very enthusiastic about 2016. We are especially excited about the spring launch of Overwatch and look forward to releasing World of Warcraft: Legion in the summer on the heels of the June release of the Warcraft movie. With all of the content and activities we have planned, we expect another year of solid growth of the Blizzard community, and we're very excited about the future. As Bobby mentioned, Monday was Blizzard's 25th anniversary. We've put our hearts into making great games for 25 years. We're very proud of the worlds that we've created and the great moments we've shared with our players. We are extremely grateful for the support of our players, and we look forward to many more adventures in the next 25 years and beyond. 
Thank you. And I'll turn the call back over to Amrita."

Its excellent gameplay, art style, interface. And so I think we're bringing a Blizzard take to an already very fun genre.

We do have additional eSports investments in some of our business and franchise level details that Mike and Eric alluded to. But we think those are more around demand generation than anything and help support the franchises that they cover. On your other question, Colin, around macro environment and sort of competitive aspects. It is -- yes, you've hit on the -- obviously, Skylanders and Guitar Hero points, where in the casual segment on console, there was more competition that feels more category specific. When we look more across the broad base of our business, we feel -- we haven't really felt many of the macro trends that are sort of -- and volatility we've seen in the overall market really affecting our business, and in fact, many of the digital trends when you look at our biggest franchises are stronger than ever. And in fact in many new regions, even regions that are experiencing some turmoil like China, we've had great growth in the past year.

Obviously, the digital transition has been a very nice tailwind for us over the past several years, and really frontline console games are the final part of the transition.

As we mentioned in the call and Thomas's remarks and my remarks, the add-on content and services, which is purchases effectively after the initial sale, are really increasingly more important and are as important and are growing incredibly fast and is one of the fastest parts of our digital portfolio. To your question now on frontline titles, it really varies by title -- so for games like Destiny, it had a -- in the high 20s in terms of digital downloads, in terms of overall volume. For Call of Duty, just based on the size of the player base, full-game downloads were a lower share than that although on an absolute basis, Call of -- full game downloads were up over 80% year-over-year. So a very nice progress there. And we know when we look at the Blizzard's side of our portfolio on the PC, the vast majority of those frontline games are delivered digitally. Obviously that brings margin benefits for us as each new game gets delivered through digital channels, brings us gross margin benefits, and you'll see that in our overall corporate margin. We were at 32% this year, and with currency effects or excluding the currency effects, it would have been north of 34%.

4222231,330341397,974590,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Amrita and thank you, all, for joining us this afternoon. This year, the global market for interactive entertainment is expected to reach $94 billion. With more than a $6 billion of revenues forecasted for this year, Activision Blizzard is cl",770,"Thank you, Amrita and thank you, all, for joining us this afternoon. 
This year, the global market for interactive entertainment is expected to reach $94 billion. With more than a $6 billion of revenues forecasted for this year, Activision Blizzard is clearly the world's most successful standalone interactive entertainment company. Yet, we only have a 7% participation. 
These forecast don't really contemplate the growth in e-sports or the introduction of advertising into games and they certainly don't contemplate the introduction of price and cash in the games. All of which are emerging and potentially significant opportunities for the company. 
E-sports has unique meaning to our audiences. Frank Pierce, one of the founders of Blizzard, captured what makes our games and the organized competitions we host so special to our players. He said, ""our players feel a unique sense of belonging from their engagement with our content. Their social experiences are shaped by the communities they are part of and the investment our players make in our games is rewarded by being part of a community that celebrates their play and recognizes their accomplishments"". 
Our audiences spent 42 billion hours playing and watching our games in the past 12 months. Similar to the number of hours people spent watching Netflix and greater than the number of hours people consumed video on Facebook. But because these are principally social and truly interactive experiences, the commitment to our franchises is deeper and much more personnel than other forms of entertainment. 
One special example is that of a high school whose father was deployed in Afghanistan. The son and the father stayed connected by regularly playing World of Warcraft throughout his deployment. The shared experiences and high engagement required to play our games creates a unique bond and a special sense of belonging for the players. 
A great multigenerational example is an 84-year-old grandfather who, for 10 years now, has played well with both his son and grandson. And another example of a life-changing experience is our most recent Heroes of the Dorm competition. The result changed the lives of 5 players when they won the [indiscernible] championship and have their college tuitions entirely paid for. 
There isn't any other form of entertainment that generates, passion and engagement that game players experience and we're at the very beginning stages of providing opportunities to celebrate and reward our audience commitment. 
This year, our franchises will provide over $10 million in prize money for players and shout casters and commentators are earning real revenues and yet, we're barely in the first inning of opportunity for games as organized sport. 
Today, collectively, eSports viewership is greater than the individual audiences for NHL, Major League Baseball or the NBA. In the future, Call of Duty, Hearthstone and Overwatch could each have audiences in excess of any of the most well-known sports leagues. 
Advertising and subscription revenues for eSports events are dwarfed by major league sports and yet the passion of the Call of Duty player is no less than the passion of the most ardent NFL fan. 
My friend Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, paid a little less than $180 million for the Patriots in the early 1990s and told me, it was the investment he ever made. 15 to to years from now, pro team owners of our major franchises will likely be sharing similar sentiments. 
Our network itself has over 0.5 billion users each month. Only Facebook, YouTube and WeChat have bigger audiences. And we continue to transform our business to franchise focused, frequent content delivered directly to our 0.5 billion audience members in 196 countries around the world. Value is delivered through a variety of player investment models, all providing flexibility to our audiences. 
And as we introduce new player investment opportunities like advertising and we start seeing our eSports events command their fair share of broadcasting levels, our players will have their efforts recognized and their achievement rewarded and their sense of belonging to their communities will only deepen. 
Because of our uniquely talented 9,000 employees around the world, we're better positioned than any other entertainment company to take advantage of the sizable opportunities ahead. Our challenge, a challenge of prosperity, is the prioritization of these many opportunities and our 25 years of disciplined careful execution is what will enable us to pursue these opportunities with success as we have for 25 years. Since I joined the company, I haven't felt more excitement for our prospects. And now Thomas will discuss the key drivers of our overall performance and our operating units and Dennis will review our financial results. Thomas?"

We overperformed our plan for the first quarter, delivered year-over-year growth, achieved record digital revenues and raised our full year guidance.

We overperformed our plan for the first quarter, delivered year-over-year growth, achieved record digital revenues and raised our full year guidance. These results are driven by focus and execution against our 3 strategic pillars: First, expanding our audiences; second, deepening engagement; and third, providing opportunities for more player investment. 
Let's start with our progress in growing our audience reach, which grew to 544 million monthly active players this quarter. With the close of the King acquisition, we massively expanded our audience reach. King brought the diverse network of 463 million global players to the Activision Blizzard family. The acquisition also provides us with significant audience expansion opportunities going forward as mobile is the fastest-growing platform and has the greatest global outreach. 
The team at King continues to execute with excellence as they grew monthly active users 3% over a large base last quarter. King's growth was driven by the release of Candy Crush Jelly Saga, which became a top 10 grossing game on the iPhone in the U.S. and Google Play worldwide. 
This combined with continued strong performance of the first 2 Candy Crush games, which are regularly updated with new content, features and live return to Candy Crush franchise to sequential growth. This further demonstrates that continued investment in innovation in existing franchises drives longevity. 
We have also seen strong organic audience expansion in the Activision and Blizzard businesses. Both divisions set an all-time record with quarterly MAUs up 10% year-over-year for Activision and 23% for Blizzard. 
Activision's audience expansion was driven by Call of Duty, which on the back of high-quality DLC, set a new franchise record for MAUs in the quarter. Impressively growing its MAUs to exceed that of the holiday quarter. With the #1 title on both next-gen platforms [indiscernible] to date and with 2 other titles in the top 10 list, Call of Duty is the preferred choice on next-gen. 
In fact, about 85% of all PS4 buyers in North America this quarter opted for the Black Ops III bundle, an amazing statistic which bodes well for the franchises engagement and in gameplay investment continued to expand rapidly. 
On top of the Black Ops III momentum, Activision plans to build upon the community with an innovative new release this holiday, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare expected to launch November 4. This is the first 3 development cycle for award-winning studio Infinity Ward and they've been taking full advantage. With Infinite Warfare, they're redefining and building upon a classic war story that takes place in a bold new settings, which includes what happens when a space becomes militarized. We can't wait to share more with you, including a hands-on experience later this year. 
Activision also revealed Infinite Warfare's legacy and Digital Deluxe Edition, which includes Call of Duty: Modern Warfare remastered. Activision is thrilled to fulfill the Call of Duty's communities passionate request by remastering with great care one of the most beloved games of all time for this console generation. Not only do these additions represent an incredible value, but they also represent the largest content offering we have ever provided, filled with both innovative new experiences and classic co-op gameplay in 1 great package, which will appeal to a wide audience. 
Blizzard's 23% MAU growth was driven by the continued success of Hearthstone, which recently surpassed the 50 million registered player milestone. This is a testament not only to how awesome the game is but also to its accessibility on multiple platforms as well as Blizzard's ability to deliver a regular pace of content updates. Hearthstone has had 6 major releases since the games launch just over 2 years ago. 
In the next major initiative to expand Blizzard's audience is just around the corner with the upcoming launch of the highly anticipated new IP Overwatch. On May 24, Blizzard will enter the largest draw gaming with this very compelling and innovative team-based shooter. Overwatch will not only serve Blizzard's current loyal community, but also introduce Blizzard's signature high-quality experience to a whole new audience. 
The open beta, which just started last night is off to a terrific start with millions of people playing already, and the player feedback has been exceptional. We expect Overwatch to be Blizzard's biggest launch since Diablo in 2012. We also believe Overwatch will resonate well in eSports, which provides yet another vector for audience expansion. In fact, eSports is not only a driver of audience expansion but also importantly, drives growth in terms of time spent with our franchises. 
So let's talk about the progress we made on our second strategic pillar, deepening engagement. As a result of our creative teams providing outstanding gameplay and frequent content updates, we are rewarded with a player spending more than 10 billion hours playing our games during the first quarter. Over the last 12 months, player spent about 42 billion hours playing and watching our games. This level of engagement is in line with Netflix 2015 viewership of 42.5 billion hours, higher than Facebook's video consumption of about 37 billion hours annually and more than 4x the national viewership of professional U.S. sports leagues, including the NFL, NBA, MLB come NHL and MLS combined. 
And the secular trends we are seeing are going to further expand our advantage. Viewership of those additional sports leagues increased only 2% last year, while player and viewer time spent with Activision and Blizzard games increased nearly 20% last year. 
We are confident that we can further build on this momentum as we expand our ability to deliver more frequent and meaningful content updates on our core franchises and provide new ways for our audiences to engage with our franchises. On this note, last week's release of Hearthstone third expansion card set, Whispers of the Old Gods, is off to a great start, with record daily active users and record hours played per daily active user. In addition to what I already mentioned, our content [indiscernible] includes new expansions for World of Warcraft and for the Destiny Universe in the second half of the year, which will drive reengagement across the communities. 
With World of Warcraft next expansion, Legion, which will release in August 30, players will that only be able to dive into the new zones, quests, dungeons and raids that they expect, but will also gain access to features that deepen and expand engagement post launch of the expansions. There will be ongoing social interactions in order halls, customization by artifact weapons and new character class and a revamp player-versus-player system. 
Players that have been away from World of Warcraft will be able to jump right into Legion content with an included boost to level 100. Before the expansion go, the whole world will get to experience the epic orcs versus humans conflict on big screens with the release of the Warcraft film produced by Legendary Pictures. It's an exciting time for players to dive even deeper into the game to comeback to World of Warcraft or to try it for the first time. Best in his loyal passionate community also remains highly engaged. Bunge has released over 40 the updates since launch in an effort to continually improve the game, which has helped attract new players and keeps them coming back. 
The game now has nearly 30 million registered players who have averaged over 100 game time each. In April, Bungie released an update to the game, which was well-received by players and drove strong story engagement. Also successfully introduced a new look box feature, which had a double-digit pass rate. Later this year, Activision and Blizzard J plan to launch a large new expansion for the Destiny universe, which vote your were about in the coming months. Beyond new content, we are also driving increased engagement with our eSports initiatives, which are making great progress. 
Since the beginning of the year, we have delivered millions of hours of audience engagement with our marquee eSports events. Specifically on Call of Duty, Activision concluded the Stage 1 finals of The Call of Duty World League and will host the Call of Duty Championship presented by Playstation 4 fall with teams are competing for a $3 million price pool. 
You will soon hear more about the Call of Duty Championships this year and the amazing player celebrations we are putting together. Also, Call of Duty is partnering with MLG on a number of fronts. MLG's sanctioning systems now govern The Call of Duty World League. MLG will produce their first event this summer and we're making strides inside the game with MLG's live event video viewer non-embedded. Blizzard is also expanding engagement this year through its biggest eSports calendar this year, including the second year of the Heroes of the Dorm collegiate tournament, which ESPN and [indiscernible] during prime time. 
ESPN2 audience was up 17% versus 2015. Additionally, BlizzCon 2016 was announced for November 4 and 5 and once again thousands of tickets sold out within minutes of going on sale. The annual celebration Anaheim will bring passionate players from around the world together to compete and to celebrate all things Blizzard. 
Finally, eSports is not only helping us grow our franchises but also developing as a business opportunity. Our media networks division held an event [indiscernible] Counter-Strike at the end of the quarter and delivered 45 million hours of viewership, which ranks among the top eSports events ever. It's a 6-day celebration of players and teams. It was notably a profitable even for MLG on a standalone P&L basis, including ticketing, merchandising, broadcast rights, advertising sponsorship and NTX revenues. We've extended our partnership with [indiscernible] based on the success of this event. Advertisers will hear more about the plans for media networks at next week's digital new fronts in New York. 
Now turning to the third pillar of our strategy, providing increased opportunities for player investment. During the March quarter, revenues from in-game content reached over $620 million, an increase of 20% year-over-year from the base Activision and Blizzard businesses and up 80% with the inclusion of King [indiscernible] quarter results. Growth in this area has been broad-based. King's metrics improved quarter-over-quarter in terms of the number of monthly unique payers and gross bookings per paying player as well as overall gross bookings. King is doing a great job implementing live ops as well as adding fresh content across their games. These updates serves to drive engagement and providing value-added services to the players. 
On the Activision business, Call of Duty is setting new records for follow-on digital content sales. Season Pass attach rates are at all-time highest and the number of players will choose to purchase in-game content more than doubled, while maintaining average revenue per paying user. 
Most importantly, engagement with the game is stronger than ever. And within the Blizzard business, Hearthstone delivered 20% revenue growth year-over-year by growing audience reach, engagement and providing more opportunities for players to invest in the game. This performance across the businesses again shows that increased player investment and deeper engagement are virtuous cycle when executed well. 
So in summary, Q1 was a great start to the year and confirmed that our execution against our strategic pillars is paying off. 
And with that, I will not it over to Dennis to talk us through the details of the financials."

Q1 was a great start to the year that including -- included the close of the King transacti",1537,"Thanks, Thomas. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our better-than-expected financial results, our outlook for Q2 and our increased outlook for 2016. 
Q1 was a great start to the year that including -- included the close of the King transaction and strong trends in our year-round franchises. We overperformed our non-GAAP February guidance by $108 million on revenue and $0.12 on EPS. Our results grew year-over-year by 29% or $205 million on a non-GAAP revenues and by 44% or $0.07 on EPS. This increase is largely due to the inclusion of King in our results since the closing date of the acquisition on February 23. Excluding King, non-GAAP revenues and EPS were relatively flat to Q1 of last year. 
Reflecting on some highlights by segment, Activision exceeded plan and last year's results on revenues and profits with record Q1 digital revenues that were up 54% year-over-year. Activision also continued its next-gen leadership with 4 of the top 10 titles on PS4 and Xbox One life-to-date, including the #1 spot with Call of Duty: Black Ops III, which, as Tom has mentioned, accelerated user engagement in Q1. 
This outstanding Call of Duty performance was partially offset by continued weakness in the toys-to-life market. As expected, Blizzard's Q1 was relatively quiet and consistent with expectations as the team prepares for the onslaught of upcoming content for its fans. But starting this quarter, Blizzard Entertainment what may be the busiest stretch of releases in their history with activity across franchises, genres, platforms and linear media to appeal to Blizzard's current community, while attracting new and lapse players. 
In Q1, we also completed the successful integration with King and the team did not skip a beat. They continue to stay focused and execute through the closing of the transaction and once again, had at least 3 of the top 15 grossing games on both the Apple App Store and Google Play store in the U.S. for the ninth consecutive quarter. 
Importantly, the King business grew quarter-over-quarter in both engagement and gross bookings. 
Turning to our financial results. Please refer to our earnings release for full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations. Also, the numbers I'll be quoting are compared to the prior year unless otherwise noted. For the quarter on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.46 billion, up 14% year-over-year and operating margin of 32% and EPS of $0.45 because.   
As we said on our February call, our GAAP earnings are expected to be down in 2016 versus prior year as our expected results will be impacted by additional accounting charges associated with the King transaction, which include, among other things, transaction-related costs and the amortization of intangibles resulting from purchase price accounting adjustments. The majority of these GAAP accounting charges will not impact the economics of our business or our cash flows although they will have the material impact on our 2016 GAAP results. 
For the quarter on a non-GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $908 million and operating margin of 28% and EPS of $0.23. On a non-GAAP basis, digital revenues in Q1 grew 48% year-over-year to a quarterly record. These increases were due to the inclusion of King in our results in Q1 of 2016 as well as the higher performance of Activision's Call of Duty Blizzard -- Call of Duty and Blizzard's Hearthstone year-over-year. 
While the $0.12 in non-GAAP EPS overperformance versus guidance, about $0.07 was related to timing, about $0.03 was related to strong franchise momentum and the earlier King, and about $0.02 was related to onetime tax benefits. Please note that when you look at the segment results, King's Q1 financials are not directly comparable with their previously reported quarters. 
Among other things, we have adjusted King's compensation plan from an equity-based program to a cash-based profit-sharing plan, and we've also allocated corporate overhead to the group as we do with our other divisions. Both of these changes are value neutral to the company. 
Controlling for those factors and comparing their full quarter resorts, in addition to gross bookings in engagement, King's overall revenues and operating income were up quarter-over-quarter. Turning to the specific P&L items. Please note that all percentages are based on revenues except for the tax rate. 
For Q1, GAAP product cost were 21%. Operating expenses were 47%. Interest expense was $52 million and our GAAP tax rate was 18%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average share count was 750 million, including participating securities. On a non-GAAP basis for the quarter, product costs were 24%, operating expenses were 48% and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 31%. Interest expense was $51 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 14%. As mentioned, this tax rate was as a result of one-time discrete benefits. 
In terms of cash flow, in Q1, we generated strong cash flow with non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $277 million, up 24% year-over-year, operating cash flow of $309 million, up 48% year-over-year and free cash flow of $282 million, after CapEx, up 50% year-over-year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We closed the King transaction in February for approximately $5.8 billion, which was funded with $3.5 billion in cash held internationally and $2.3 billion of cash from new debt. The enterprise value was $4.7 billion after factoring in the $1.15 of cash that came along with King or about 6x King's 2015 EBITDA. 
Directly following the transaction, we also paid down a net $500 million of our outstanding debt balance, which ended the quarter at $5.92 billion in aggregate. As mentioned on our last call, we are authorized to pay down an additional $1 billion of debt this year. 
As of March 31, we had approximately $2.91 billion in cash and investments, of which roughly half was held internationally. On the dividend front, next week, on May 11, we plan to pay a $0.26 per share cash dividend or approximately $192 million in aggregate to shareholders of record as of March 30, 2016. 
So in summary, Q1 was a very strong start to the year for the company and set us up well for the coming quarters ahead. 
Now let's turn to our slate, outlook for Q2 and the balance of 2016. Our Q2 slate includes Call of Duty second map pack and Hearthstone's latest expansion, Whispers of the Old Gods, which released last week. And on May 24, Blizzard plans to release its newest IP, Overwatch. 
We also plan to continue to release new content and updates across our portfolio to keep our players engaged, while at the same time beginning the ramp and sales and marketing spending for our major releases later this year. For Q2 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.425 billion, product cost of 24% and operating expenses of 65%. 
We expect GAAP interest expense of $62 million, a GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate of 23%, a GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 755 million and EPS of $0.10. 
For Q2 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $1.375 billion, product cost of 23% and operating expenses of 46%. We expect a non-GAAP interest expense of $60 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.38. 
In the back half of the year, Blizzard plans to release World of Warcraft's next highly anticipated expansion, Legion. Activision plans to release 2 more map packs for Call of Duty, a large expansion for Destiny and new releases in Q4 for Skylanders and Call of Duty. 
King plans to release 2 non-Candy Crush franchise games this year, 1 the summer and another later this year. 
Now to our 2016 full year numbers. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.13 billion, product costs of 25% and operating expenses of 60%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $243 million. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 24%, 1 point better than our February guidance. 
We expect 765 million fully diluted shares both for GAAP and non-GAAP and EPS for GAAP is expected to be $0.69. For 2016 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.275 billion, an increase of $25 million versus our February guidance, product cost of 24%, operating expenses of 44% and an operating margin of 32%. 
Our non-GAAP interest expense is expected to be $235 million. But it's still early in the year and nearly all of our major launches lodges are still in front of us, we are raising our full year outlook by $0.03 on EPS to $1.78 related to business performance and tax benefits. 
In summary, Q1 was an incredibly productive quarter for the company and a great start for the year. With the closing of the King acquisitions, we now have a global leadership across major gaming platforms and one of the largest interactive entertainment networks on the planet. 
Our franchise focus has delivered growing audience weeks, deepening player engagement and more player investment than ever before. 
In addition, the tailwind in emerging areas like eSports provides compelling option value going forward. As a team, we couldn't be more excited about the large opportunities for growth that we have ahead of us.

We've already seen millions of players try out the game in open beta. The feedback has been extremely positive. This is our first global simultaneous multiplatform launch and so we're on PS4, Xbox, PC, across all of our legions. We don't project out specific unit numbers. But like Thomas mentioned, we do expect this to be our biggest launch since Diablo III, which was heavily anticipated and the Diablo franchise was something that has been loved for many years. This is a brand-new IP. We're doing a ton to expose players to the richness of this world that we've created, but it is a new IP in a very popular genere.

First of all, its' nice to talk to you again, and thank you for the question. So before I answer the first part of your question on the strategic plans as part of Activision Blizzard, I would like to highlight that the integration went extremely smoothly and is effectively complete. King has been part of the Activision Blizzard family as you know now for 2 months, and we have retained our key talent and have a remain focused on driving the business and executing on our existing plan. As you have heard in Q1, we have delivered both top line and profit growth by growing our player and payer networks as well as the investment per player. We'll, first of all, focused on the executing on our strategy, and we have a strong pipeline across our franchises and we're working on new titles within this franchises. We're also developing additional new IPs within our studios. In addition to developing the new titles, we're also continuing to invest in our existing franchise games with new content, new features and with live ops, live ops, as a brief reminder, are the time-limited events. And all of these content is driving engagement, retention and investment per player. Now as part of the Activision Blizzard family, beyond existing plans, we have now new opportunities to create even greater games for our massive player network by combining Activision Blizzard's top-performing IPs on console and PC with our mobile expertise. The deal, as you know, closed 2 months ago, and we have started conversations with both Activision and Blizzard to explore those opportunities. In regards to the second part to -- of your question regarding advertising, I want to say that first and foremost, we are focused on retaining our players, and we're focused on providing a great player experience. And we will not compromise on this points. That said, given our work massive network, we do believe that advertising could be a meaningful revenue stream for King in the long-term. We have 463 million monthly active users and with that, it's one of the largest untapped audiences for advertisers in the world. But it's early days, and we have just begun experimenting with that in 2 of our games. So we do not expect any impact to this year's results from ad sales."

Black Ops III is performing very well but before I address our digital performance specifically, I think it's important to take a step back and first talk about overall engagement. We've made a great game that our fans love and that's demonstrated by the fact that our monthly active users are at all-time highs. And as a result of that, our digital business is also operating at Q1 all-time highs and is up significantly year-over-year. Season Pass is in all-time high and in fact, we expect to deliver the most map packs ever to players with Black Ops III. So the most important thing for us is we're delivering all these performance, while seeing seeing record engagement with the game. On the second part of your question related to Infinite Warfare, first of all, you've got to love the passionate gamers. This is an industry like no other and the fan base like no other and we love that our fans treat this franchise like it's their own and have such strong points of view about it. They're just aren't many entertainment franchises on earth that can generate the kind of passion that Call of Duty can and the that's a good thing. Then secondly, of course, we know that there are people in our community who are nostalgic for the boots on the ground style gameplay and that's why we made Modern Warfare Remastered. But we also have millions of people in our community you want to have do innovative experiences in the game each year and Infinite Warfare is going to delivery that. And the good news is this year, we found a way to deliver both in 1 package, while keeping our community together. And while, of course, we see the passion and opinions online, we also look at other measurements and the fact is whilst it's very early, preorders are off to a very strong start. Views of the Reveal trailer that you're referring to our up and in fact the number of likes per view on the Infinite Warfare review trailer are also the highest we've ever seen. We've seen this in the franchise before. The reveal trailer for Black Ops II, which took the franchise into the future for the first time had the most dislikes of any trailer we had ever made at a time and that, of course, went on to become our most successful game ever. And right now, the franchise has never been stronger. We have more people playing Black Ops III, a game that takes plays in the future with boost jumps and fictitious weapons and all the rest than any game in our history. So what we know for sure is that if we always just did what were in the past and never took any creative risks, we don't wouldn't have a franchise. The day we worry is the day we stop trying new things."

We continue to execute on our 4-pronged approach to creating and doing franchises by #1, adding new content, implementing live ops, delivering expansions in our existing games as well as offering players new or secret titles. This approach has lead to continued strong performance by the Candy Crush franchise. In fact, the original game, the Candy Crush Saga is already 4 years old and it continues to lead the casual game category and was the #3 top grossing game in the U.S. in Q1. In regards to your question on Candy Crush Jelly Saga, we launched the game in January of this year and it's a sister title to Candy Crush Saga. It has the same story, I think as Candy Crush Saga and our players are clearly enjoying the game. It's our third largest title and a top 10 gross game in the U.S. on iPhone and it's also worldwide top 10 grossing game on Google Play. The game broke new players to King's network in Q1 and help to return the franchise to growth. When you look across the entire franchise, all 3 Candy Crush titles were top 15 grossing games in the U.S. in Q1, which demonstrates the longevity and strength of the brand. So we believe we have an enduring franchise with Candy Crush and we're executing to keep innovating for our players."

This year, the global market for interactive entertainment is expected to reach $94 billion. With more than $6 billion of revenues forecasted for this year, Activision Blizzard is clearl",771,"Thank you, Amrita and thank you all for joining us this afternoon. 
This year, the global market for interactive entertainment is expected to reach $94 billion. With more than $6 billion of revenues forecasted for this year, Activision Blizzard is clearly the world's most successful stand-alone interactive entertainment company. Yet, we only have a 7% participation. 
These forecasts don't really contemplate the growth in eSports or the introduction of advertising into games, and they certainly don't contemplate the introduction of price and cash play into games, all of which are emerging and potentially significant opportunities for the company. 
eSports has unique meaning to our audiences. Frank Pierce, one of the founders of Blizzard, captured what makes our games and the organized competitions we host so special to our players. He said, ""Our players feel a unique sense of belonging from their engagement with our content. Their social experiences are shaped by the communities they are part of and the investment our players make in our games is rewarded by being part of a community that celebrates their play and recognizes their accomplishments"". 
Our audiences spent 42 billion hours playing and watching our games in the past 12 months. Similar to the number of hours, people spent watching Netflix and greater than the number of hours people consumed video on Facebook. But because these are principally social and truly interactive experiences, the commitment to our franchises is deeper and much more personal than other forms of entertainment. 
One special example is that of a high schooler whose father was deployed in Afghanistan. The son and the father stayed connected by regularly playing World of Warcraft throughout his deployment. The shared experiences and high engagement required to play our games creates a unique bond and a special sense of belonging for the players.
A great multigenerational example is an 84-year-old grandfather who, for 10 years now, has played well with both his son and grandson. And another example of a life-changing experience is our most recent Heroes of the Dorm competition. The result changed the lives of 5 players when they won the collegiate championship and had their college tuitions entirely paid for. 
There isn't any other form of entertainment that generates the passion, engagement and commitment that game players experience, and we're at the very beginning stages of providing opportunities to celebrate and reward our audience commitment. 
This year, our franchises will provide over $10 million in prize money for players and shoutcasters and commentators are earning real revenues and yet, we're barely in the first inning of opportunity for games as organized sport. 
Today, collectively, eSports' viewership is greater than the individual audiences for NHL, Major League Baseball or the NBA. In the future, Call of Duty, Hearthstone and Overwatch could each have audiences in excess of any of the most well-known sports leagues. 
Advertising and subscription revenues for eSports events are dwarfed by major league sports and yet the passion of the Call of Duty player is no less than the passion of the most ardent NFL fan.
My friend Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, paid a little less than $180 million for the Patriots in the early 1990s and he told me it was the best investment he ever made. 15 to 20  years from now, pro team owners of our major franchises will likely be sharing similar sentiments. 
Our network itself has over 0.5 billion users each month. Only Facebook, YouTube and WeChat have bigger audiences. And we continue to transform our business to franchise-focused, frequent content delivered directly to our 0.5 billion audience members in 196 countries around the world. Value is delivered through a variety of player investment models, all providing flexibility to our audiences.
And as we introduce new player investment opportunities like advertising and we start seeing our eSports events command their fair share of broadcasting levels, our players will have their efforts recognized and their achievement rewarded and their sense of belonging to their communities will only deepen.
Because of our uniquely talented 9,000 employees around the world, we're better positioned than any other entertainment company to take advantage of the sizable opportunities ahead. Our challenge, a challenge of prosperity, is the prioritization of these many opportunities, and our 25 years of disciplined careful execution is what will enable us to pursue these opportunities with success as we have for 25 years. Since I joined the company, I haven't felt more excitement for our prospects. 
And now Thomas will discuss the key drivers of our overall performance and our operating units and Dennis will review our financial results. Thomas?"

We overperformed our plan for the first quarter, delivered year-over-year growth, achieved record digital revenues and raised our full year guidance. These results are driven by focus and execution against our 3 strategic pillars: first, expanding our audiences; second, deepening engagement; and third, providing opportunities for more player investment.
Let's start with our progress in growing our audience reach, which grew to 544 million monthly active players this quarter. With the close of the King acquisition, we massively expanded our audience reach. King brought the diverse network of 463 million global players to the Activision Blizzard family. The acquisition also provides us with significant audience expansion opportunities going forward, as mobile is the fastest-growing platform and has the greatest global outreach. 
The team at King continues to execute with excellence as they grew monthly active users 3% over a large base last quarter. King's growth was driven by the release of Candy Crush Jelly Saga, which became a top 10 grossing game on the iPhone in the U.S. and Google Play worldwide.
This combined with continued strong performance of the first 2 Candy Crush games, which are regularly updated with new content, features and live ops, returns the Candy Crush franchise to sequential growth. This further demonstrates that continued investment in innovation in existing franchises drives longevity.
We have also seen strong organic audience expansion in the Activision and Blizzard businesses. Both divisions set new all-time records with quarterly MAUs up 10% year-over-year for Activision and 23% for Blizzard.
Activision's audience expansion was driven by Call of Duty, which on the back of high-quality DLC, set a new franchise record for MAUs in the quarter, impressively growing its MAUs to exceed that of the holiday quarter. With the #1 title on both next-gen platforms live to date and with 2 other titles in the top 10 list, Call of Duty is the preferred choice on next-gen.
In fact, about 85% of all PS4 buyers in North America this quarter opted for the Black Ops III bundle, an amazing statistic which bodes well for the franchises' engagement and in gameplay investment continued to expand rapidly. 
On top of the Black Ops III momentum, Activision plans to build upon the community with an innovative new release this holiday, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare expected to launch November 4. This is the first development cycle for award-winning studio Infinity Ward, and they've been taking full advantage. With Infinite Warfare, they're redefining and building upon a classic war story that takes place in a bold new setting, which includes what happens when space becomes militarized. We can't wait to share more with you, including a hands-on experience later this year.
Activision also revealed Infinite Warfare's legacy and Digital Deluxe editions, which includes Call of Duty: Modern Warfare remastered. Activision is thrilled to fulfill the Call of Duty communities' passionate request by remastering with great care: one of the most beloved games of all time for this console generation. Not only do these additions represent an incredible value but they also represent the largest content offering we have ever provided, filled with both innovative new experiences and classic co-op gameplay in one great package, which will appeal to a wide audience. 
Blizzard's 23% MAU growth was driven by the continued success of Hearthstone, which recently surpassed the 50 million registered player milestone. This is a testament not only to how awesome the game is but also to its accessibility on multiple platforms as well as Blizzard's ability to deliver a regular pace of content updates. Hearthstone has had 6 major releases since the game's launch just over 2 years ago. 
In the next major initiative to expand Blizzard's audience is just around the corner, with the upcoming launch of the highly anticipated new IP Overwatch. On May 24, Blizzard will enter the largest online gaming with this very compelling and innovative team-based shooter. Overwatch will not only serve Blizzard's current loyal community but also introduce Blizzard's signature high-quality experience to a whole new audience. 
The open beta, which just started last night is off to a terrific start with millions of people playing already, and the player feedback has been exceptional. We expect Overwatch to be Blizzard's biggest launch since Diablo in 2012. We also believe Overwatch will resonate well in eSports, which provides yet another vector for audience expansion. In fact, eSports is not only a driver of audience expansion but also importantly, drives growth in terms of time spent with our franchises. 
So let's talk about the progress we made on our second strategic pillar, deepening engagement. As a result of our creative teams providing outstanding gameplay and frequent content updates, we were rewarded, with player spending more than 10 billion hours playing our games during the first quarter. Over the last 12 months, players spent about 42 billion hours playing and watching our games. This level of engagement is in line with Netflix 2015 viewership of 42.5 billion hours; higher than Facebook's video consumption of about 37 billion hours annually; and more than 4x the national viewership of professional U.S. sports leagues, including the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL and MLS combined. 
And the secular trends we are seeing are going to further expand our advantage. Viewership of those additional sports leagues increased only 2% last year, while player and viewer time spent with Activision and Blizzard games increased nearly 20% last year. 
We are confident that we can further build on this momentum as we expand our ability to deliver more frequent and meaningful content updates on our core franchises and provide new ways for our audiences to engage with our franchises. On this note, last week's release of Hearthstone's third expansion cards set, Whispers of the Old Gods, is off to a great start, with record daily active users and record hours played per daily active user. In addition to what I already mentioned, our content [indiscernible] includes new expansions for World of Warcraft and for the Destiny Universe in the second half of the year, which will drive reengagement across the vibrant communities.
With World of Warcraft's next expansion, Legion, which will release on August 30, players will that only be able to dive into the new zones, quests, dungeons and raids that they expect, but will also gain access to features that deepen and expand engagement post launch of the expansions. There will be ongoing social interactions in order halls, customization by artifact weapons and new character class and a revamp player-versus-player system. 
Players that have been away from World of Warcraft will be able to jump right into Legion content with an included boost to level 100. Before the expansion go, the whole world will get to experience the epic orcs versus humans conflict on big screens with the release of the Warcraft film produced by Legendary Pictures. It's an exciting time for players to dive even deeper into the game to come back to World of Warcraft or to try it for the first time. Destiny's loyal passionate with community also remains highly engaged. Bungie has released over 40 updates since launch in an effort to continually improve the game, which has helped attract new players and keeps them coming back. 
The game now has nearly 30 million registered players who have averaged over 100 hours of game time each. In April, Bungie released an update to the game, which was well received by players and drove strong reengagement. We also successfully introduced a new look box [ph] feature, which had a double-digit attach rate. Later this year, Activision and Bungie planning to launch a large new expansion for the Destiny Universe, which you will hear more about in the coming months. Beyond new content, we are also driving increased engagement with our eSports initiatives, which are making great progress. 
Since the beginning of the year, we have delivered millions of hours of audience engagement with our marquee eSports events. Specifically on Call of Duty, Activision concluded the Stage 1 finals of The Call of Duty World League and will host the Call of Duty Championship presented by PlayStation 4 this fall, where teams are competing for a $3 million price pool.
You will soon hear more about the Call of Duty Championships this year, and the amazing player celebrations we are putting together. Also, Call of Duty is partnering with MLG on a number of fronts. MLG's sanctioning systems now govern The Call of Duty World League. MLG will produce their first event this summer, and we're making strides inside the game, with MLG's live event video viewer nonembedded. Blizzard is also expanding engagement this year through its biggest eSports calendar ever, including the second year of the Heroes of the Dorm collegiate tournament, which ESPN again air during prime time. 
The ESPN2 audience was up 17% versus 2015. Additionally, BlizzCon 2016 was announced for November 4 and 5, and once again thousands of tickets sold out within minutes of going on sale. The annual celebration in Anaheim will bring passionate players from around the world together to compete and to celebrate all things Blizzard.
Finally, eSports is not only helping us grow our franchises but also developing as a business opportunity. Our Media Networks division held an event for Valve's Counter-Strike Go Major at the end of the quarter and delivered 45 million hours of viewership, which ranks among the top eSports events ever. It's a 6-day celebration of players and teams. It was notably a profitable event for MLG on a stand-alone P&L basis, including ticketing, merchandising, broadcast rights, advertising, sponsorship and NTX revenues. We've extended our partnership with Valve's based on the success of this event. Advertisers will hear more about the plans for Media Networks at next week's Digital Newfronts in New York. 
Now turning to the third pillar of our strategy, providing increased opportunities for player investment. During the March quarter, revenues from in-game content reached over $620 million, an increase of 20% year-over-year from the base Activision and Blizzard businesses and up 80% with the inclusion of King's top quarter results. Growth in this area has been broad-based. King's metrics improved quarter-over-quarter in terms of the number of monthly unique payers and gross bookings per paying player as well as overall gross bookings. King is doing a great job implementing live ops as well as adding fresh content across their games. This upbeat serves to drive engagement and provide value-added services to the players. 
On the Activision business, Call of Duty is setting new records for follow-on digital content sales. Season Pass attach rates are at all-time highest and the number of players who choose to purchase in-game content more than doubled while maintaining average revenue per paying user. 
Most importantly, engagement with the game is stronger than ever. And within the Blizzard business, Hearthstone delivered 20% revenue growth year-over-year by growing audience reach, engagement and providing more opportunities for players to invest in the game. This performance across the businesses again shows that increased player investment and deeper engagement are virtuous cycle when executed well.
So in summary, Q1 was a great start to the year and confirmed that our execution against our strategic pillars is paying off.
And with that, I will now turn it over to Dennis to talk us through the details of the financials."

Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our better-than-expected Q1 financial results, our outlook for Q2 and our increased outlook for 2016.
Q1 was a great start to the year that including -- included the close of the King transaction and strong trends in our year-round franchises. We overperformed our non-GAAP February guidance by $108 million on revenue and $0.12 on EPS. Our results grew year-over-year by 29% or $205 million on non-GAAP revenues and by 44% or $0.07 on EPS. This increase is largely due to the inclusion of King in our results since the closing date of the acquisition, February 23. Excluding King, non-GAAP revenues and EPS were relatively flat to Q1 of last year.
Reflecting on some highlights by segment. Activision exceeded plan on last year's results on revenues and profit, with record Q1 digital revenues that were up 54% year-over-year. Activision also continued its next-gen leadership with 4 of the top 10 titles on PS4 and Xbox One Life to date, including the #1 spot with Call of Duty: Black Ops III, which, As Thomas mentioned, accelerated user engagement in Q1.
This outstanding Call of Duty performance was partially offset by continued weakness in the toys-to-life market. As expected, Blizzard's Q1 was relatively quiet and consistent with expectations as the team prepares for the onslaught of upcoming content for its fans. But starting this quarter, Blizzard entered into what may be the busiest stretch of releases in their history, with activity across franchises, genres, platforms and linear media to appeal to Blizzard's current community, while attracting new and lapsed players.
In Q1, we also completed the successful integration with King, and the team did not skip a beat. They continued to stay focused and execute through the closing of the transaction and once again, had at least 3 of the top 15 grossing games on both the Apple App Store and Google Play store in the U.S. for the ninth consecutive quarter.
Importantly, the King business grew quarter-over-quarter in both engagement and gross bookings. 
Turning to our financial results. Please refer to our earnings release for full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations. Also, the numbers I'll be quoting are compared to the prior year unless otherwise noted. For the quarter on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.46 billion, up 14% year-over-year and operating margin of 32% and EPS of $0.45..   
As we said on our February call, our GAAP earnings are expected to be down in 2016 versus prior year, as our expected results will be impacted by additional accounting charges associated with the King transaction, which include, among other things, transaction-related costs and the amortization of intangibles, resulting from purchase price accounting adjustments. The majority of these GAAP accounting charges will not impact the economics of our business or our cash flows, although they will have a material impact on our 2016 GAAP results. 
For the quarter on a non-GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $908 million and operating margin of 28% and EPS of $0.23. On a non-GAAP basis, digital revenues in Q1 grew 48% year-over-year to a quarterly record. These increases were due to the inclusion of King in our results in Q1 of 2016 as well as the higher performance of Activision's Call of Duty Blizzard -- Call of Duty and Blizzard's Hearthstone year-over-year. 
Of the $0.12 in non-GAAP EPS overperformance versus guidance, about $0.07 was related to timing; about $0.03 was related to strong franchise momentum and the earlier King close; and about $0.02 was related to onetime tax benefits. Please note that when you look at the segment results, King's Q1 financials are not directly comparable with their previously reported quarters. 
Among other things, we have adjusted King's compensation plan from an equity-based program to a cash-based profit-sharing plan, and we've also allocated corporate overhead to the group as we do with our other divisions. Both of these changes are value neutral to the company. 
Controlling for those factors and comparing their full quarter resorts, in addition to gross bookings in engagement, King's overall revenues and operating income were up quarter-over-quarter. 
Turning to the specific P&L items. Please note that all percentages are based on revenues except for the tax rate.
For Q1, GAAP product costs were 21%. Operating expenses were 47%. Interest expense was $52 million, and our GAAP tax rate was 18%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average share count was 750 million, including participating securities. On a non-GAAP basis for the quarter, product costs were 24%, operating expenses were 48% and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 31%. Interest expense was $51 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 14%. As mentioned, this tax rate was as a result of onetime discrete benefits.
In terms of cash flow, in Q1, we generated strong cash flow with non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $277 million, up 24% year-over-year; operating cash flow of $309 million, up 48% year-over-year; and free cash flow of $282 million after CapEx, up 50% year-over-year.
Turning to the balance sheet. We closed the King transaction in February for approximately $5.8 billion, which was funded with $3.5 billion in cash held internationally and $2.3 billion of cash from new debt. The enterprise value was $4.7 billion after factoring in the $1.15 of cash that came along with King or about 6x King's 2015 EBITDA. 
Directly following the transaction, we also paid down a net $500 million of our outstanding debt balance, which ended the quarter at $5.92 billion in aggregate. As mentioned on our last call, we are authorized to pay down an additional $1 billion of debt this year.
As of March 31, we had approximately $2.91 billion in cash and investments, of which roughly half was held internationally. On the dividend front, next week, on May 11, we plan to pay a $0.26 per share cash dividend or approximately $192 million in aggregate to shareholders of record as of March 30, 2016. 
So in summary, Q1 was a very strong start to the year for the company and set us up well for the coming quarters ahead. 
Now let's turn to our slate, outlook for Q2 and the balance of 2016. Our Q2 slate includes Call of Duty second Map Pack and Hearthstone's latest expansion, Whispers of the Old Gods, which released last week. And on May 24, Blizzard plans to release its newest IP, Overwatch.
We also plan to continue to release new content and updates across our portfolio to keep our players engaged, while at the same time beginning the ramp in sales and marketing spending for our major releases later this year. For Q2 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.425 billion, product cost of 24% and operating expenses of 65%. 
We expect GAAP interest expense of $62 million, a GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate of 23%, a GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 755 million and EPS of $0.10. 
For Q2 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $1.375 billion, product cost of 23% and operating expenses of 46%. We expect a non-GAAP interest expense of $60 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.38. 
In the back half of the year, Blizzard plans to release World of Warcraft's next highly anticipated expansion, Legion. Activision plans to release 2 more Map Packs for Call of Duty, a large expansion for Destiny and new releases in Q4 for Skylanders and Call of Duty. 
King plans to release 2 non-Candy Crush franchise games this year, one this summer and another later this year.
Now to our 2016 full year numbers. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.13 billion, product cost of 25% and operating expenses of 60%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $243 million. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 24%, 1 point better than our February guidance. 
We expect 765 million fully diluted shares both for GAAP and non-GAAP and EPS for GAAP is expected to be $0.69. For 2016 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.275 billion, an increase of $25 million versus our February guidance; product cost of 24%; operating expenses of 44%; and an operating margin of 32%.
Our non-GAAP interest expense is expected to be $235 million. Though it's still early in the year and nearly all of our major launches are still in front of us, we are raising our full year outlook by $0.03 on EPS to $1.78 related to business performance and tax benefits.
In summary, Q1 was an incredibly productive quarter for the company and a great start for the year. With the closing of the King acquisition, we now have global leadership across major gaming platforms and one of the largest interactive entertainment networks on the planet.
Our franchise focus has delivered growing audience reach, deepening player engagement and more player investment than ever before. 
In addition, the tailwind in emerging areas like eSports provides compelling option value going forward. As a team, we couldn't be more excited about the large opportunities for growth that we have ahead of us.

First of all, it's nice to talk to you again, and thank you for the question. So before I answer the first part of your question on the strategic plans as part of Activision Blizzard, I would like to highlight that the integration went extremely smoothly and is effectively complete. King has been part of the Activision Blizzard family, as you know, now for 2 months. And we have retained our key talent and have remained focused on driving the business and executing on our existing plan. As you have heard in Q1, we have delivered both top line and profit growth by growing our player and payer networks as well as the investment per player. We're, first of all, focused on the executing on our strategy, and we have a strong pipeline across our franchises and we're working on new titles within these franchises. We're also developing additional new IPs within our studios. In addition to developing the new titles, we're also continuing to invest in our existing franchise games with new content, new features and with live ops. Live ops, as a brief reminder, are the time-limited events. And all of this content is driving engagement, retention and investment per player. Now as part of the Activision Blizzard family, beyond the existing plans, we have now new opportunities to create even greater games for our massive player network by combining Activision Blizzard's top-performing IPs on console and PC with our mobile expertise. The deal, as you know, closed 2 months ago, and we have started conversations with both Activision and Blizzard to explore those opportunities. In regards to the second part to -- of your question regarding advertising, I want to say that first and foremost, we are focused on retaining our players, and we are focused on providing a great player experience. And we will not compromise on this time. That said, given our work massive network, we do believe that advertising could be a meaningful revenue stream for King in the long term. We have 463 million monthly active users and with that, it's one of the largest untapped audiences for advertisers in the world. But it's early days, and we have just begun experimenting with that in 2 of our games. So we do not expect any impact to this year's result from ad sales."

So Black Ops III is performing very well, but before I address our digital performance specifically, I think it's important to take a step back and first talk about overall engagement. We've made a great game that our fans loved, and that's demonstrated by the fact that our monthly active users are at all-time highs. And as a result of that, our digital business is also operating at Q1 all-time highs and is up significantly year-over-year. Season Pass is in all-time high, and in fact, we expect to deliver the most Map Packs ever to players with Black Ops III. So the most important thing for us is that we're delivering all this performance, while seeing record engagement with the game. On the second part of your question related to Infinite Warfare, first of all, you've got to love the passionate gamers. This is an industry like no other and the fan base like no other, and we love that our fans treat this franchise like it's their own and have such strong points of view about it. They're just aren't many entertainment franchises on earth that can generate the kind of passion that Call of Duty can, and that's a good thing. Then secondly, of course, we know that there are people in our community who are nostalgic for the boots on the ground style gameplay and that's why we made Modern Warfare Remastered. But we also have millions of people in our community who want to have do innovative experiences in the game each year, and Infinite Warfare is going to delivery that. And the good news is this year, we found a way to deliver both in one package, while keeping our community together. And while, of course, we see the passionate opinions online, we also look at other measurements and the fact is whilst it's very early, preorders are off to a very strong start; views of the reveal trailers that you're referring are up; and in fact, the number of likes per view on the Infinite Warfare reveal trailer are also the highest we've ever seen. We've seen this in the franchise before. The reveal trailer for Black Ops II, which took the franchise into the future for the first time, had the most dislikes of any reveal trailer we had ever made at that time and that, of course, went on to become our most successful game ever. And right now, the franchise has never been stronger. We have more people playing Black Ops III, a game that takes plays in the future with boost jumps and fictitious weapons and all the rest than any game in our history. So what we know for sure is that if we always just did what were in the past and never took any creative risks, we wouldn't have a franchise. The day to worry is the day we stop trying new things."

First of all, the overall Candy Crush franchise is very healthy. It continues to produce strong performance, growing sequentially in Q1 as you have seen and this validates our franchise focus strategy. We continue to execute on our 4-pronged approach to creating and doing franchises by #1, adding new content, implementing live ops, delivering expansions in our existing games as well as offering players new sister or secret titles. This approach has lead to continued strong performance by the Candy Crush franchise. In fact, the original game, the Candy Crush Saga is already 4 years old, and it continues to lead the casual game category and was the #3 top grossing game in the U.S. in Q1. In regards to your question on Candy Crush Jelly Saga, we launched the game in January of this year, and it's a sister title to Candy Crush Saga. It has the same story, I think, as Candy Crush Saga, and our players are clearly enjoying the game. It's our third-largest title and top 10 grossing game in the U.S. on iPhone and it's also worldwide top 10 grossing game on Google Play. The game brought new players to King's network in Q1 and helped return the franchise to growth. When you look across the entire franchise, all 3 Candy Crush titles were top 15 grossing games in the U.S. in Q1, which demonstrates the longevity and strength of the brand. So we believe we have an enduring franchise with Candy Crush, and we're executing to keep innovating for our players."

I think when you look at the untapped opportunities, though, that enable you to do a lot of those things, we have this very virtuous cycle. People pay to participate, sponsors are willing to finance events, those events then become the content that's broadcast on our network or on other networks. Those events then lead to having the ability to have regional events, national events, international events. All of these things have the opportunity for us to expand broadcast rights, licensing and merchandising, ticket sales, local sponsorships, national sponsorships and these are all things that we're very actively engaged in. Not to mention all of the authorities to sell our professional teams for professional leagues.

4222231,330341397,975038,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Amrita and thank you all for joining us this afternoon. This year, the global market for interactive entertainment is expected to reach $94 billion.

This year, the global market for interactive entertainment is expected to reach $94 billion. With more than $6 billion of revenues forecasted for this year, Activision Blizzard is clearly the world's most successful stand-alone interactive entertainment company. Yet, we only have a 7% participation. 
These forecasts don't really contemplate the growth in eSports or the introduction of advertising into games, and they certainly don't contemplate the introduction of prize and cash play into games, all of which are emerging and potentially significant opportunities for the company. 
eSports has unique meaning to our audiences. Frank Pierce, one of the founders of Blizzard, captured what makes our games and the organized competitions we host so special to our players. He said, ""Our players feel a unique sense of belonging from their engagement with our content. Their social experiences are shaped by the communities they are part of and the investments our players make in our games is rewarded by being part of a community that celebrates their play and recognizes their accomplishments"". 
Our audiences spent 42 billion hours playing and watching our games in the past 12 months. Similar to the number of hours, people spent watching Netflix and greater than the number of hours people consumed video on Facebook. But because these are principally social and truly interactive experiences, the commitment to our franchises is deeper and much more personal than other forms of entertainment. 
One special example is that of a high schooler whose father was deployed in Afghanistan. The son and the father stayed connected by regularly playing World of Warcraft throughout his deployment. The shared experiences and high engagement required to play our games creates a unique bond and a special sense of belonging for the players.
A great multigenerational example is an 84-year-old grandfather who, for 10 years now, has played WoW with both his son and grandson. And another example of a life-changing experience is our most recent Heroes of the Dorm competition. The result changed the lives of 5 players when they won the collegiate championship and had their college tuitions entirely paid for. 
There isn't any other form of entertainment that generates the passion, engagement and commitment that game players experience, and we're at the very beginning stages of providing opportunities to celebrate and reward our audience commitment. 
This year, our franchises will provide over $10 million in prize money for players and shoutcasters and commentators are earning real revenues and yet, we're barely in the first inning of opportunity for games as organized sport. 
Today, collectively, eSports' viewership is greater than the individual audiences for NHL, Major League Baseball or the NBA. In the future, Call of Duty, Hearthstone and Overwatch could each have audiences in excess of any of the most well-known sports leagues. 
Advertising and subscription revenues for eSports events are dwarfed by major league sports and yet the passion of the Call of Duty player is no less than the passion of the most ardent NFL fan.
My friend Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, paid a little less than $180 million for the Patriots in the early 1990s and he told me it was the best investment he ever made. 15 to 20  years from now, pro team owners of our major franchises will likely be sharing similar sentiments. 
Our network itself has over 0.5 billion users each month. Only Facebook, YouTube and WeChat have bigger audiences. And we continue to transform our business to franchise-focused, frequent content delivered directly to our 0.5 billion audience members in 196 countries around the world. Value is delivered through a variety of player investment models, all providing flexibility to our audiences.
And as we introduce new player investment opportunities like advertising and we start seeing our eSports events command their fair share of broadcasting revenues, our players will have their efforts recognized and their achievement rewarded and their sense of belonging to their communities will only deepen.
Because of our uniquely talented 9,000 employees around the world, we're better positioned than any other entertainment company to take advantage of the sizable opportunities ahead. Our challenge, a challenge of prosperity, is the prioritization of these many opportunities, and our 25 years of disciplined careful execution is what will enable us to pursue these opportunities with success as we have for 25 years. Since I joined the company, I haven't felt more excitement for our prospects. 
And now Thomas will discuss the key drivers of our overall performance in our operating units and Dennis will review our financial results. Thomas?"
4222231,330341397,975038,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bobby, and good afternoon, everyone. 2016 is off to great start. We overperformed our plan for the first quarter, delivered year-over-year growth, achieved record digital revenues and raised our full year guidance.

We overperformed our plan for the first quarter, delivered year-over-year growth, achieved record digital revenues and raised our full year guidance. These results are driven by focus and execution against our 3 strategic pillars: first, expanding our audiences; second, deepening engagement; and third, providing opportunities for more player investment.
Let's start with our progress in growing our audience reach, which grew to 544 million monthly active players this quarter. With the close of the King acquisition, we massively expanded our audience reach. King brought a diverse network of 463 million global players to the Activision Blizzard family. The acquisition also provides us with significant audience expansion opportunities going forward, as mobile is the fastest-growing platform and has the greatest global outreach. 
The team at King continues to execute with excellence as they grew monthly active users 3% over a large base last quarter. King's growth was driven by the release of Candy Crush Jelly Saga, which became a top 10 grossing game on the iPhone in the U.S. and Google Play worldwide.
This, combined with continued strong performance of the first 2 Candy Crush games, which are regularly updated with new content, features and live ops, returns the Candy Crush franchise to sequential growth. This further demonstrates that continued investment in innovation in existing franchises drives longevity.
We have also seen strong organic audience expansion in the Activision and Blizzard businesses. Both divisions set new all-time records with quarterly MAUs up 10% year-over-year for Activision and 23% for Blizzard.
Activision's audience expansion was driven by Call of Duty, which on the back of high-quality DLC, set a new franchise record for MAUs in the quarter, impressively growing its MAUs to exceed that of the holiday quarter. With the #1 title on both next-gen platforms live to date and with 2 other titles in the top 10 list, Call of Duty is the preferred choice on next-gen.
In fact, about 85% of all PS4 buyers in North America this quarter opted for the Black Ops III bundle, an amazing statistic which bodes well for the franchises' engagement, and gameplay investment continued to expand rapidly. 
On top of the Black Ops III momentum, Activision plans to build upon the community with an innovative new release this holiday, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, expected to launch November 4. This is the first redevelopment cycle for award-winning studio Infinity Ward, and they've been taking full advantage. With Infinite Warfare, they're redefining and building upon a classic war story that takes place in a bold new setting, which includes what happens when space becomes militarized. We can't wait to share more with you, including a hands-on experience later this year.
Activision also revealed Infinite Warfare's legacy and Digital Deluxe editions, which includes Call of Duty: Modern Warfare remastered. Activision is thrilled to fulfill the Call of Duty communities' passionate request by remastering with great care: one of the most beloved games of all time for this console generation. Not only do these editions represent an incredible value but they also represent the largest content offering we have ever provided, filled with both innovative new experiences and classic co-op gameplay in one great package, which will appeal to a wide audience. 
Blizzard's 23% MAU growth was driven by the continued success of Hearthstone, which recently surpassed the 50 million registered player milestone. This is a testament not only to how awesome the game is but also to its accessibility on multiple platforms as well as Blizzard's ability to deliver regular pace of content updates. Hearthstone has had 6 major releases since the game's launch just over 2 years ago. 
And the next major initiative to expand Blizzard's audience is just around the corner, with the upcoming launch of the highly anticipated new IP Overwatch. On May 24, Blizzard will enter the largest draw in gaming with this very compelling and innovative team-based shooter. Overwatch will not only serve Blizzard's current loyal community but also introduce Blizzard's signature high-quality experience to a whole new audience. 
The open beta, which just started last night, is off to a terrific start with millions of people playing already, and the player feedback has been exceptional. We expect Overwatch to be Blizzard's biggest launch since Diablo in 2012. We also believe Overwatch will resonate well in eSports, which provides yet another vector for audience expansion. In fact, eSports is not only a driver of audience expansion but also importantly, drives growth in terms of time spent with our franchises. 
So let's talk about the progress we made on our second strategic pillar, deepening engagement. As a result of our creative teams providing outstanding gameplay and frequent content updates, we were rewarded, with player spending more than 10 billion hours playing our games during the first quarter. Over the last 12 months, players spent about 42 billion hours playing and watching our games. This level of engagement is in line with Netflix 2015 viewership of 42.5 billion hours; higher than Facebook's video consumption of about 37 billion hours annually; and more than 4x the national viewership of professional U.S. sports leagues, including the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL and MLS combined. 
And the secular trends we are seeing are going to further expand our advantage. Viewership of those additional sports leagues increased only 2% last year, while player and viewer time spent with Activision and Blizzard games increased nearly 20% last year. 
We are confident that we can further build on this momentum as we expand our ability to deliver more frequent and meaningful content updates on our core franchises and provide new ways for our audiences to engage with our franchises. On this note, last week's release of Hearthstone's third expansion card set, Whispers of the Old Gods, is off to a great start, with record daily active users and record hours played per daily active user. In addition to what I already mentioned, our content pipeline includes new expansions for World of Warcraft and for the Destiny Universe in the second half of the year, which will drive reengagement across their vibrant communities.
With World of Warcraft's next expansion, Legion, which will release on August 30, players will not only be able to dive into the new zones, quests, dungeons and raids that they expect, but they will also gain access to features that deepen and expand engagement post launch of the expansions. There will be ongoing social interactions in order halls, customization by artifact weapons and new character class and a revamped player-versus-player system. 
Players that have been away from World of Warcraft will be able to jump right into Legion content with an included boost to level 100. Before the expansion build, the whole world will get to experience the epic orcs versus humans conflict on big screens with the release of the Warcraft film produced by Legendary Pictures. It's an exciting time for players to dive even deeper into the game, to come back to World of Warcraft or to try it for the first time. Destiny's loyal passionate with community also remains highly engaged. Bungie has released over 40 updates since launch in an effort to continually improve the game, which has helped attract new players and keeps them coming back. 
The game now has nearly 30 million registered players who have averaged over 100 hours of game time each. In April, Bungie released an update to the game, which was well received by players and drove strong reengagement. We also successfully introduced a new loot box feature, which had a double-digit attach rate. Later this year, Activision and Bungie plan to launch a large new expansion for the Destiny Universe, which you will hear more about in the coming months. Beyond new content, we are also driving increased engagement with our eSports initiatives, which are making great progress. 
Since the beginning of the year, we have delivered millions of hours of audience engagement with our marquee eSports events. Specifically on Call of Duty, Activision concluded the Stage 1 finals of The Call of Duty World League and will host the Call of Duty Championship presented by PlayStation 4 this fall, where teams are competing for a $3 million price pool.
You will soon hear more about the Call of Duty Championships this year, and the amazing player celebrations we are putting together. Also, Call of Duty is partnering with MLG on a number of fronts. MLG's sanctioning systems now govern The Call of Duty World League. MLG will produce their first event this summer, and we're making strides inside the game, with MLG's live event video viewer now embedded. Blizzard is also expanding engagement this year through its biggest eSports calendar ever, including the second year of the Heroes of the Dorm collegiate tournament, which ESPN again aired during prime time. 
The ESPN2 audience was up 17% versus 2015. Additionally, BlizzCon 2016 was announced for November 4 and 5, and once again thousands of tickets sold out within minutes of going on sale. The annual celebration in Anaheim will bring passionate players from around the world together to compete and to celebrate all things Blizzard.
Finally, eSports is not only helping us grow our franchises but also developing as a business opportunity. Our Media Networks division held an event for Valve's Counter-Strike Go Major at the end of the quarter and delivered 45 million hours of viewership, which ranks among the top eSports events ever. It's a 6-day celebration of players and teams. It was notably a profitable event for MLG on a stand-alone P&L basis, including ticketing, merchandising, broadcast rights, advertising, sponsorship and NTX revenues. We've extended our partnership with Valve based on the success of this event. Advertisers will hear more about the plans for Media Networks at next week's Digital Newfronts in New York. 
Now turning to the third pillar of our strategy, providing increased opportunities for player investment. During the March quarter, revenues from in-game content reached over $620 million, an increase of 20% year-over-year from the base Activision and Blizzard businesses and up 80% with the inclusion of King's top quarter results. Growth in this area has been broad-based. King's metrics improved quarter-over-quarter in terms of the number of monthly unique payers and gross bookings per paying player as well as overall gross bookings. King is doing a great job implementing live ops as well as adding fresh content across their games. These updates serve to drive engagement and provide value-added services to the players. 
On the Activision business, Call of Duty is setting new records for follow-on digital content sales. Season Pass attach rates are at all-time highs and the number of players who choose to purchase in-game content more than doubled while maintaining average revenue per paying user. 
Most importantly, engagement with the game is stronger than ever. And within the Blizzard business, Hearthstone delivered 20% revenue growth year-over-year by growing audience reach, engagement and providing more opportunities for players to invest in the game. This performance across the businesses again shows that increased player investment and deeper engagement are a virtuous cycle when executed well.
So in summary, Q1 was a great start to the year and confirmed that our execution against our strategic pillars is paying off.
And with that, I will now turn it over to Dennis to talk us through the details of the financials."

Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will review our better-than-expected Q1 financial results, our outlook for Q2 and our increased outlook for 2016.
Q1 was a great start to the year that including -- included the close of the King transaction and strong trends in our year-round franchises. We overperformed our non-GAAP February guidance by $108 million on revenue and $0.12 on EPS. Our results grew year-over-year by 29% or $205 million on non-GAAP revenues and by 44% or $0.07 on EPS. This increase is largely due to the inclusion of King in our results since the closing date of the acquisition, February 23. Excluding King, non-GAAP revenues and EPS were relatively flat to Q1 of last year.
Reflecting on some highlights by segment. Activision exceeded plan on last year's results on revenues and profit, with record Q1 digital revenues that were up 54% year-over-year. Activision also continued its next-gen leadership with 4 of the top 10 titles on PS4 and Xbox One Life to date, including the #1 spot with Call of Duty: Black Ops III, which, as Thomas mentioned, accelerated user engagement in Q1.
This outstanding Call of Duty performance was partially offset by continued weakness in the toys-to-life market. As expected, Blizzard's Q1 was relatively quiet and consistent with expectations as the team prepares for the onslaught of upcoming content for its fans. But starting this quarter, Blizzard entered into what may be the busiest stretch of releases in their history, with activity across franchises, genres, platforms and linear media to appeal to Blizzard's current community, while attracting new and lapsed players.
In Q1, we also completed the successful integration with King, and the team did not skip a beat. They continued to stay focused and execute through the closing of the transaction and once again, had at least 3 of the top 15 grossing games on both the Apple App Store and Google Play store in the U.S. for the ninth consecutive quarter.
Importantly, the King business grew quarter-over-quarter in both engagement and gross bookings. 
Turning to our financial results. Please refer to our earnings release for full non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliations. Also, the numbers I'll be quoting are compared to the prior year unless otherwise noted. For the quarter on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.46 billion, up 14% year-over-year and operating margin of 32% and EPS of $0.45..   
As we said on our February call, our GAAP earnings are expected to be down in 2016 versus prior year, as our expected results will be impacted by additional accounting charges associated with the King transaction, which include, among other things, transaction-related costs and the amortization of intangibles, resulting from purchase price accounting adjustments. The majority of these GAAP accounting charges will not impact the economics of our business or our cash flows, although they will have a material impact on our 2016 GAAP results. 
For the quarter on a non-GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $908 million and operating margin of 28% and EPS of $0.23. On a non-GAAP basis, digital revenues in Q1 grew 48% year-over-year to a quarterly record. These increases were due to the inclusion of King in our results in Q1 of 2016 as well as the higher performance of Activision's Call of Duty Blizzard -- Call of Duty and Blizzard's Hearthstone year-over-year. 
Of the $0.12 in non-GAAP EPS overperformance versus guidance, about $0.07 was related to timing; about $0.03 was related to strong franchise momentum and the earlier King close; and about $0.02 was related to onetime tax benefits. Please note that when you look at the segment results, King's Q1 financials are not directly comparable with their previously reported quarters. 
Among other things, we have adjusted King's compensation plan from an equity-based program to a cash-based profit-sharing plan, and we've also allocated corporate overhead to the group as we do with our other divisions. Both of these changes are value neutral to the company. 
Controlling for those factors and comparing their full quarter resorts, in addition to gross bookings in engagement, King's overall revenues and operating income were up quarter-over-quarter. 
Turning to the specific P&L items. Please note that all percentages are based on revenues except for the tax rate.
For Q1, GAAP product costs were 21%. Operating expenses were 47%. Interest expense was $52 million, and our GAAP tax rate was 18%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average share count was 750 million, including participating securities. On a non-GAAP basis for the quarter, product costs were 24%, operating expenses were 48% and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 31%. Interest expense was $51 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 14%. As mentioned, this tax rate was as a result of onetime discrete benefits.
In terms of cash flow, in Q1, we generated strong cash flow with non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $277 million, up 24% year-over-year; operating cash flow of $309 million, up 48% year-over-year; and free cash flow of $282 million after CapEx, up 50% year-over-year.
Turning to the balance sheet. We closed the King transaction in February for approximately $5.8 billion, which was funded with $3.5 billion in cash held internationally and $2.3 billion of cash from new debt. The enterprise value was $4.7 billion after factoring in the $1.15 of cash that came along with King or about 6x King's 2015 EBITDA. 
Directly following the transaction, we also paid down a net $500 million of our outstanding debt balance, which ended the quarter at $5.92 billion in aggregate. As mentioned on our last call, we are authorized to pay down an additional $1 billion of debt this year.
As of March 31, we had approximately $2.91 billion in cash and investments, of which roughly half was held internationally. On the dividend front, next week, on May 11, we plan to pay a $0.26 per share cash dividend or approximately $192 million in aggregate to shareholders of record as of March 30, 2016. 
So in summary, Q1 was a very strong start to the year for the company and set us up well for the coming quarters ahead. 
Now let's turn to our slate and our outlook for Q2 and the balance of 2016. Our Q2 slate includes Call of Duty second Map Pack and Hearthstone's latest expansion, Whispers of the Old Gods, which released last week. And on May 24, Blizzard plans to release its newest IP, Overwatch.
We also plan to continue to release new content and updates across our portfolio to keep our players engaged, while at the same time beginning the ramp in sales and marketing spending for our major releases later this year. For Q2 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.425 billion, product cost of 24% and operating expenses of 65%. 
We expect GAAP interest expense of $62 million, a GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate of 23%, a GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 755 million and EPS of $0.10. 
For Q2 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $1.375 billion, product cost of 23% and operating expenses of 46%. We expect a non-GAAP interest expense of $60 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.38. 
In the back half of the year, Blizzard plans to release World of Warcraft's next highly anticipated expansion, Legion. Activision plans to release 2 more Map Packs for Call of Duty, a large expansion for Destiny and new releases in Q4 for Skylanders and Call of Duty. 
King plans to release 2 non-Candy Crush franchise games this year, one this summer and another later this year.
Now to our 2016 full year numbers. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.13 billion, product cost of 25% and operating expenses of 60%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $243 million. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 24%, 1 point better than our February guidance. 
We expect 765 million fully diluted shares both for GAAP and non-GAAP and EPS for GAAP is expected to be $0.69. For 2016 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.275 billion, an increase of $25 million versus our February guidance; product cost of 24%; operating expenses of 44%; and an operating margin of 32%.
Our non-GAAP interest expense is expected to be $235 million. Though it's still early in the year and nearly all of our major launches are still in front of us, we are raising our full year outlook by $0.03 on EPS to $1.78, related to business performance and tax benefits.
In summary, Q1 was an incredibly productive quarter for the company and a great start for the year. With the closing of the King acquisition, we now have global leadership across major gaming platforms and one of the largest interactive entertainment networks on the planet.
Our franchise focus has delivered growing audience reach, deepening player engagement and more player investment than ever before. 
In addition, the tailwind in emerging areas like eSports provides compelling option value going forward. As a team, we couldn't be more excited about the large opportunities for growth that we have ahead of us. 
Now I will welcome our business leaders, Eric, Mike and Riccardo as they join as for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?"

This is our first global simultaneous multiplatform launch and so we're on PS4, Xbox, PC, across all of our regions. We don't project out specific unit numbers. But like Thomas mentioned, we do expect this to be our biggest launch since Diablo III, which was heavily anticipated, and the Diablo franchise was something that has been loved for many years. This is a brand new IP. We're doing a ton to expose players to the richness of this world that we've created, but it is a new IP in a very popular genre."

First of all, it's nice to talk to you again, and thank you for the question. So before I answer the first part of your question on the strategic plans as part of Activision Blizzard, I would like to highlight that the integration went extremely smoothly and is effectively complete. King has been part of the Activision Blizzard family, as you know, now for 2 months. And we have retained our key talent and have remained focused on driving the business and executing on our existing plan. As you have heard in Q1, we have delivered both top line and profit growth by growing our player and payer networks as well as the investment per player. We're, first of all, focused on executing on our strategy, and we have a strong pipeline across our franchises and we're working on new titles within these franchises. We're also developing additional new IPs within our studios. In addition to developing the new titles, we're also continuing to invest in our existing franchise games with new content, new features and with live ops. Live ops, as a brief reminder, are the time-limited events. And all of this content is driving engagement, retention and investment per player. Now as part of the Activision Blizzard family, beyond the existing plans, we have now new opportunities to create even greater games for our massive player network by combining Activision Blizzard's top-performing IPs on console and PC with our mobile expertise. The deal, as you know, closed 2 months ago, and we have started conversations with both Activision and Blizzard to explore those opportunities. In regards to the second part to -- of your question regarding advertising, I want to say that first and foremost, we are focused on retaining our players, and we are focused on providing a great player experience. And we will not compromise on this point. That said, given our massive network, we do believe that advertising could be a meaningful revenue stream for King in the long term. We have 463 million monthly active users and with that, it's one of the largest untapped audiences for advertisers in the world. But it's early days, and we have just begun experimenting with that in 2 of our games. So we do not expect any impact to this year's result from ad sales."

So Black Ops III is performing very well, but before I address our digital performance specifically, I think it's important to take a step back and first talk about overall engagement. We've made a great game that our fans love, and that's demonstrated by the fact that our monthly active users are at all-time highs. And as a result of that, our digital business is also operating at Q1 all-time highs and is up significantly year-over-year. Season Pass is in all-time high, and in fact, we expect to deliver the most Map Packs ever to players with Black Ops III. So the most important thing for us is that we're delivering all this performance, while seeing record engagement with the game. On the second part of your question, related to Infinite Warfare, first of all, you've got to love the passion of gamers. This is an industry like no other and a fan base like no other, and we love that our fans treat this franchise like it's their own and have such strong points of view about it. They're just aren't many entertainment franchises on earth that can generate the kind of passion that Call of Duty can, and that's a good thing. Then secondly, of course, we know that there are people in our community who are nostalgic for the boots on the ground style gameplay and that's why we made Modern Warfare Remastered. But we also have millions of people in our community who want to have new, innovative experiences in the game each year, and Infinite Warfare is going to delivery that. And the good news is this year, we found a way to deliver both in one package, while keeping our community together. And while, of course, we see the passionate opinions online, we also look at other measurements and the fact is while it's very early, preorders are off to a very strong start; views of the reveal trailer that you're referring are up; and in fact, the number of likes per view on the Infinite Warfare reveal trailer are also the highest we've ever seen. We've seen this in the franchise before. The reveal trailer for Black Ops II, which took the franchise into the future for the first time, had the most dislikes of any reveal trailer we had ever made at that time and that, of course, went on to become our most successful game ever. And right now, the franchise has never been stronger. We have more people playing Black Ops III, a game that takes plays in the future with boost jumps and fictitious weapons and all the rest, than any game in our history. So what we know for sure is that if we always just did what worked in the past and never took any creative risks, we wouldn't have a franchise. The day to worry is the day we stop trying new things."

This approach has lead to continued strong performance by the Candy Crush franchise. In fact, the original game, the Candy Crush Saga, is already 4 years old, and it continues to lead the casual game category and was the #3 top grossing game in the U.S. in Q1. In regards to your question on Candy Crush Jelly Saga, we launched the game in January of this year, and it's a sister title to Candy Crush Saga. It has the same story, I think, as Candy Crush Saga, and our players are clearly enjoying the game. It's our third-largest title and a top 10 grossing game in the U.S. on iPhone and it's also worldwide top 10 grossing game on Google Play. The game brought new players to King's network in Q1 and helped return the franchise to growth. When you look across the entire franchise, all 3 Candy Crush titles were top 15 grossing games in the U.S. in Q1, which demonstrates the longevity and strength of the brand. So we believe we have an enduring franchise with Candy Crush, and we're executing to keep innovating for our players."

I think when you look at the untapped opportunities, though, that enable you to do a lot of those things, we have this very virtuous cycle: People pay to participate, sponsors are willing to finance events, those events then become the content that's broadcast on our network or on other networks. Those events then lead to having the ability to have regional events, national events, international events. All of these things have the opportunity for us to expand broadcast rights, licensing and merchandising, ticket sales, local sponsorships, national sponsorships and these are all things that we're very actively engaged in. Not to mention all of the opportunities to sell our professional teams for our professional leagues. And so over the long term, we view this as a tremendous opportunity both to celebrate our players and to create a lot of value for our shareholders."

This quarter was a record quarter in large measure because of the unique capability we have as a company to create new franchises. The truly extraordinary team at Blizzard launched Overwatch to incredible audience success. Overwatch already has over 15 million players who have spent about 0.5 billion hours playing the game and has achieved success throughout the world, including in China and Korea where Overwatch is now the #1 game in terms of share of play time. We remain focused on the priorities that we have outlined to you before: Building our audience around-s the world, growing engagement by continuously investing in new content for our audiences, celebrating our players through initiatives like competitive gaming and making certain we continue to be a great place to work.

Our creative and commercial teams across our 5 [ph] operating divisions delivered a very strong first half of 2016 with broad-based record results. To expand on what Bobby mentioned, our results are driven by focus and execution against",1907,"Thank you, Bobby. Our creative and commercial teams across our 5 [ph] operating divisions delivered a very strong first half of 2016 with broad-based record results. To expand on what Bobby mentioned, our results are driven by focus and execution against our 3 strategic pillars. First, expanding our audiences; second, deepening engagement; and third, providing opportunities for more play investment. 
Let's start with audience reach, which was nearly 0.5 billion monthly active players in what is typically a seasonally softer quarter. In Q2, Blizzard had its highest MAUs in history, up 13% year-over-year and 29% quarter-over-quarter driven by increases in players from Overwatch, World of Warcraft and Hearthstone. Important to think the setback and review Blizzard's continued growth over the past few years. Blizzard has doubled its number of franchises, expanding into genres, business models and platforms, and as a result, they have doubled the size of the audience over a relatively short period of time. This performance is due to the strength of the team at Blizzard and their strategic focus on building epic entertainment experiences that captured imagination of tens of millions of people globally. Overwatch has had incredible momentum, and has now reached over 15 [ph] million players globally achieving this milestone than any game in Blizzard's history. In China, Overwatch broke the Appletree's record as the fastest selling PC game in the market's history. Additionally, Overwatch has came to #1 position in Korean IGR's with over 30% share of playtime. This global success have led to roughly even players split between the East and West. 
World of Warcraft momentum continues to build ahead of the August launch of Legions. MAUs have seen double-digit growth both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, and Legion pre-purchases are tracking in line with the last expansion in 2014. In particular, we've had strong momentum in China following the launch of the Warcraft movie, which is now one of the highest grossing Hollywood releases ever in China and the biggest game-based movie release worldwide. 
Activation MAUs were also a Q2 record and were up 11% year-over-year. This was largely driven by the continued strength of Call of Duty. Black Ops III continues to be the top-selling game life-to-date, and again, overperformed the prior year game across every key metrics, MAUs, full game sales, in content and engagement. 
Destiny also saw month-to-month growth in MAUs with the launch of our April update and the June announced Destiny's next expansion, Rise of Iron. The continued hunger for great new content from this passionate community bodes well for the September launch of Rise of Iron. Digital repurchases so far are very strong and tracking ahead of last year's [indiscernible]. 
Let me to your second pillar. Once again, our compelling game worlds not only large communities, but also deep engagement, with nearly 10 billion hours of playtime during the second quarter. Visit franchises continue to displace the [indiscernible] are known for. As Bobby mentioned, players spent about [ph] 500 million hours playing Overwatch. Since launch, business added a competitive playbook again, in June and [indiscernible] in mid-july and just introduced this week Summer Games content, which includes an exciting new software live game mode. Both the New Hero and Summer Games also added what [indiscernible] to [indiscernible] that the players can earn or purchase. In just the first day, we saw record engagement with the new summer games mode and its customization items. Visitors pleased with the strong adoption of all those releases and want to continue adding new content and improving existing features to deliver a great ongoing experience to Overwatch players. 
Hearthstone had its highest MAUs and highest quarterly time spent in the game's history this quarter on the back of the launch of the Whispers of the Old Gods expansion. This deep engagement drove a double-digit revenue increase year-over-year. Just last week in the [indiscernible], Blizzard announced its fourth [indiscernible] set for release on August 11. One Night in Karazhan, continuous Hearthstone tradition of bringing a charming and accessible approach to some of the most popular Warcraft setting. 
As to our other adventures, players will be able to experience a single player storyline and earn cards with a player versus player deck. The strong engagement around our franchises also serves our initiatives outside of our games. 
Our eSports and film and TV initiatives are not only a driver of audience expansion, but drives deeper engagement, which will lead to longer franchise lives with greater profitably. 
First, on eSports. Last year, BlizzCon had its highest live spent viewership ever with over 10 million people around the world tuning in, higher than the viewership for this year's NBA and MLB All-Star games. This November, Blizzard will be hosting its 10th BlizzCon. One of the biggest attractions there will be the culmination of the Road to BlizzCon Tournaments with global champions across a number of franchises being crowned, including the champion for the just announced Overwatch World Cup. 
We've also made a lot of progress in the launch of our East West Network Major League Gaming. MLG presented to advertisers a new [indiscernible] in New York in May where they showcase a significant new product innovation that provides an enhanced viewing experience offering realtime statistics, leader boards and insights based on the competition you're watching, making the viewing experience far more accessible and rich. MLG also announced a partnership with Facebook to broadcast live competitions as relatively eSports reports, providing broad reach for our premium content. Since the acquisition in December, MLG's reach has increased by more than 700% on Facebook. MLG is also working closely with our internal teams to build out our eSports Leagues and events for key franchises. MLG and the Call of Duty World League hosted the Anaheim Open in June and are preparing for the upcoming Orlando open as well. 
With the growth of the Call of Duty World League, Call of Duty East West viewership has increased by more than 5x year-over-year to 33 million views of our stage 1 event this year, and there are still major events to come, including the championship of Call of Duty [indiscernible] in September, which we anticipate will be our most viewed Call of Duty eSports event in history by a wide margin. 
Our film and TV units announced that the first 2 seasons of the first initiative Skylanders Academy has been sold to Netflix for global distribution. Skylanders Academy is an extremely high-quality animated TV show, coming on the heels of the release of our innovative new game this fall, Skylanders Imagination, which was developed by the investors of the Toy Select category, [indiscernible]. 
Now turning to our third pillar of our strategy: Providing increased opportunities for player investment. This quarter, excluding deferrals, we drove a record billion dollars in digital in-game content sales, a rapidly growing part of our business. A big driver of that performance was King, which continued to drive large audiences of over 400 million monthly active users when best increasing amount in our games because of the incredibly compelling content King continues to deliver. As expected, due to seasonality and launch timing, King MAUs went down this quarter, but deeper engagement and play investment, in part due to the new initiatives around live operations and events, led again to Candy Crush franchise growth, with gross bookings up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. King's time spent per MAU and average revenue per 10 [ph] user across the network were both up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Mobile gross bookings for King also increased year-over-year. King has had at least 3 of the top 15 grossing games in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in the U.S. for 10 quarters in a row, showing the durability of top mobile franchises over time. King has also continued with its in-network advertising path, which we expect to expand to Candy Crush later this year. The test are critical to ensuring that engagement and value-added offers can be a virtuous cycle as we've seen with the new in-game content in our game. We believe advertising is an attractive opportunity, given the size and quality of the King's network, and broadcasting is critical to ensure we preserve a high-quality play experience and player investment opportunities. 
Turning to our core game experiences. We see continued evidence of this virtuous cycle. Strong engagement leads to strong play investment, which in turn, fuels strong engagement. Blizzard is a testimony to that. Record engagement in Q2 led to Blizzard's biggest revenue quarter ever. This strong performance was driven by Overwatch’s successful launch, now with [indiscernible] franchise revenue, excluding deferral at about $0.5 billion. World of Warcraft strong pre-expansion momentum with Legion III purchases tracking in line with the previous expansion, and Hearthstone's double-digit revenue growth behind the successful launch of the Old Gods expansion. 
The teams at Activision and Bungie continued to successfully introduce new earned and purchase in-game content into Destiny. We have seen strong community response to this content with no reduction in engagement. 
Finally, Call of Duty has seen strong performance across the board.  In-game content purchases, including Season Pack, Map Packs and micro transactions continued to deliver at record levels for the franchise. In fact, on the back of the strength as well as strong catalog sales, the first half of the year was the best in terms of both non-GAAP operating income and revenue in the franchise's history. 
Activision also doubled the number of in-game purchases in Call of Duty with no degradation to average revenue per user. Most importantly, this was accomplished by actually improving overall engagement. 
The bold innovations in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare drove exceptional positive media sentiment at E3 [ph], including being named Best Shooter Game and receiving 25 other awards and distinctions. Activision is taking a different approach to the collector's editions this year with the best bonus content we have ever offered, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered. The Legacy edition and Digital Deluxe Edition offer an amazing value and incredible breadth and variety of gameplay. Infinite Warfare offers 3 full modes, which will deliver bold, new innovations for the franchise and a beautiful remastered of Modern Warfare will return fans to the classic game play of one of the most beloved games in history. 
It seems to be a winning combination since we are seeing as strong half [ph] percentage of our preorders in our higher value premium SKUs than ever before. 
While as expected overall preorders are down versus last year, Activision is taking a different approach to the marketing cadence this year, which is more backloaded. This has allowed for increased focus on driving [indiscernible] engagement, which given the record first half of the year for the franchise, has been a fruitful strategy.  As a result, the majority of the assets for this year's launch, including Infinite Warfare's market player reveal and hands on, Zombies Reveal and hence on and Modern Warfare remastered multi player enhanced on are all yet to be revealed. This set the stage for next month's Call of Duty XP, which will provide the perfect stage to showcase all of this incredible content to drive momentum as we entered the launch season and, of course, to celebrate Call of Duty's amazing [indiscernible]. 
In summary, our strong performance in the first half of the year confirmed that execution against our strategic pillars is paying off, and we have a great schedule of content for the balance of the year. Dennis?"

It's been an incredible first half of the year and across nearly all parts of our business, we saw strong performance in the quarter. This performance pretty validates many of the important growth themes we discussed around opportunities in mobile, digital, and ability to launch new world-class and intellectual property. 
Before we go into the results, as a reminder, we hosted a quick call last week to discuss changes to our external non-GAAP reporting in response to the SEC staff updated interpretations, and I'd encourage you to review those materials if you haven't done so already. These interpretations affect external reporting for numerous companies, but do not affect our strong underlying business fundamentals or cash flows. As we explained, starting this quarter, we will be sharing some new reporting metrics and we will continue to provide you with supplemental disclosure to help you calculate relative metrics for year-over-year comparisons. Our disclosures can be found in the tables in the earnings press release and the Excel model posted to our website following this call. 
Turning to our Q2 results and highlights, we will now, for one last time, refer to our non-GAAP results as we have been previously decided them, excluding deferrals. We generated revenues of $1.61 [ph] billion in the quarter, $234 million above May guidance, and $850 million or 112% above Q2 last year. We generated EPS of $0.54, $0.16 above guidance and $0.41 or 315% above Q2 last year. The overperformance versus guidance was composed of $0.04 of cost timing and $0.12 of business overperformance, with the key drivers being the successful launch of our newest franchise, Overwatch, which is obviously off to a resounding start, continued momentum of the Call of Duty digital business and continued growth of the Candy Crush franchise. 
In addition, digital momentum continued to be a strong business driver in Q2 producing record quarterly digital revenues and operating margins for the company. Digital revenues were $1.4 billion, growing 129% year-over-year and 76% quarter-over-quarter and, as Tom has mentioned, a remarkable $1 billion of this came from in-game content sales. Excluding King, digital revenues were also up a record -- up over 50% year-over-year. Our digital performance drove operating margins to a Q2 record of 37%, up from 28% operating margin last quarter and 23% in Q2 of last year. So we have continued strong tailwinds on the digital front, which bodes well for the future across the business. 
Now let's take a look at the business results for each of our 3 segments. Let's start with Blizzard. The launch of Overwatch drove engagement to record highs, leading to their biggest revenue quarter ever with quarterly operating income that was nearly tripled Q2 of last year. Blizzard also had its biggest quarter in China, with a meaningful increase in revenues versus the previous high last year. World of Warcraft, Hearthstone and Overwatch success in Asia shows the depth of Blizzard's resonance in important growth markets. Overwatch was the fastest selling PC game ever in China, and the Warcraft film had the biggest Hollywood launch ever in China as well. On the Activision front, the team delivered record MAUs in operating income for both Q2 and the first half of the year, driven by the continued strength to Call of Duty, and in particular, digital in-game content. 
Turning to King. The Candy Crush franchise continues to perform well showing growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. King's Q2 segment operating income was also up quarter-over-quarter on a full-quarter basis. 
With all that as a backdrop, let's now turn to our detailed financial results and our updated external reporting format. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. Please note non-GAAP redefined influence deferrals. 
For the quarter, on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.57 billion, up 50% year-over-year and operating margin of 15% and EPS of $0.17. 
For the quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, to include deferrals, we generated an operating margin of 31% and EPS of $0.45, up 45% year-over-year. 
Turning to the specific P&L items, please note that all percentages are based on revenues, except for the tax rate. 
For Q2, GAAP product cost were 25%, operating expenses were 60% [ph], interest expense was $65 million and our GAAP tax rate was 24%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average share count was 753 million shares, including participating securities. 
On a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, which includes deferrals, product costs were 25%, operating expenses were 45%, interest expense was $64 million and our non-GAAP tax rate was 18%. 
In terms of cash flow, in Q2, we generated strong cash flow with non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $511 million, up 37% year-over-year, operating cash flow of $479 million, up 255% year-over-year; and free cash flow of $435 million after CapEx, up 307% year-over-year with continued strong cash conversion. For the first half of the year, we delivered $788 million of operating cash flow, up 129% year-over-year and $717 million of free cash flow, up 143% year-over-year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. On the back of that strong cash flow performance, we ended June 30 with approximately $2.3 billion in cash and investments, of which roughly 1/3 was held domestically. We also paid down $816 [ph] million of our outstanding debt in the quarter, bringing the total pay down so far this year to $1.3 billion. We ended the quarter with $5.1 billion in aggregate debt outstanding. 
Please note that our $1.5 billion of 2021 notes become callable during the third quarter of 2016. 
In light of our recent upgrade to investment-grade, we believe it will be advantageous to call the bonds and refinance that debt during the quarter. As such, we've included call premium and estimated transaction cost in our GAAP guidance for Q3. 
On the dividend front, in Q2, we paid a $0.26 per share cash dividend or approximately $195 million in aggregate to shareholders of record as of March 30, 2016. 
So in summary, Q2 and our first half were an incredibly strong start to the year for the company and set us up well for the upcoming quarters and years ahead. 
Now let's turn to our slate and our outlook for Q3 and full year 2016. Blizzard is launching Hearthstone's next adventure, One Night in Karazhan, next week and launching World of Warcraft's next expansion, Legion, globally on August 30. Activision is launching Destiny's Rise of Iron expansion on September 20 at a $30 price point as well as the Map Pack for Call of Duty Black Ops III in Q3. We expect Skylanders Imaginators to launch on October 16, followed by Skylanders Academy, an animated show, which is expected to debut on Netflix. 
In Q4, Activision also plans to release the fourth Map Pack for Call of Duty Black Ops III as well as Call of Duty Infinite Warfare and Modern Warfare Remastered on November 4. 
King launched Farm Heroes Super Saga in the last few days of Q2 and has one more non-Candy Crush franchise released coming towards the end of the year, along with continued live operations across key games and franchises. 
For Q3, on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.49 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $45 million, product cost of 23% and operating expenses of 64%. We expect GAAP interest expense of $138 million, which includes the potential payment of a call premium and related debt refinancing costs, a GAAP tax rate of 18%; GAAP and non-GAAP share count of $760 [ph] million and EPS of $0.06. 
For Q3, on a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we expect product cost of 23% and operating expenses 47%. We expect a non-GAAP interest expense of $53 million, a tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.39, including a GAAP deferral of $0.01. Note that you can reference our accompanying materials for the FX rate that we use in our guidance. 
Now let's turn to our full year 2016 numbers. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.4 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $75 million; product cost of 24%; and operating expenses of 58%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $311 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 18%, including tax rate impacts resulting from the adoption of the new accounting standard for simplification for share-based compensation. Please see our outlook tables in the earnings release for additional details. We expect $765 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP redefined, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.87, up $0.18 versus our previous guidance. As we said on our prior and earnings calls, our GAAP earnings are expected to be down in 2016 versus prior year as our expected results will be impacted by additional accounting charges associated with the King transaction, which include, among other things, transaction-related adjustments, cost and amortization of intangibles resulting from purchase price accounting adjustments. The majority of these GAAP accounting charges will not impact the economics of our business or our cash flows, although they will have a material impact on our 2016 GAAP earnings results. 
For 2016, on a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we expect product cost of 24%, operating expenses of 44%, operating margin of 32% and a tax rate of 24%. Our non-GAAP interest expense is expected to be $223 million. 
Based on the information we disclosed in May, our non-GAAP redefined outlook was $1.64, including $0.14 of deferrals. We are now raising our non-GAAP redefined EPS outlook to $1.83, which includes $0.07 of GAAP deferrals. 
If you would like to calculate non-GAAP as previously defined revenues and EPS in order to do year-over-year comparisons, you would add the impact of GAAP deferrals to GAAP revenues and the non-GAAP redefined EPS using the numbers I just quoted. 
So in summary, our performance in Q2 and in the first half of the year, once again, proved our ability to achieve 3 important things: First, to launch new content that can appeal to millions of players around the world; second, to consistently keep our large audiences engaged as we offer them more frequent digital content and services to enhance their experiences; and third, to deliver solid financial results, which further sets us up for long-term success. As such, as a team, we are very pleased with our first half momentum and couldn't be more excited as we head into the back half of the year.

I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our 15 million players around the world who have joined Overwatch so far. We really appreciate all their support and their incredible enthusiasm for the game. We've seen great momentum with the game across all the different engagement models, including digital and box sales, Korean Internet Game Rooms, which are time-based; and cosmetic content, which can be earned or purchased. As Tom has mentioned, altogether, the game has generated about $0.5 billion life-to-date, excluding deferrals. But more importantly, in the past 2 months, since launch, we've already provided some great content to the Overwatch community, including a competitive play mode, a new hero, the recently launched Summer Games content, which drove record engagement yesterday as well as customization items. So we're very excited about creating even more content for players moving forward. I also want to point out that, while we had a great start with the game release, we really view this as just the beginning. We think we've created a strong character-driven universe with big opportunities beyond just the game. We think Overwatch has strong potential as word. The recently announced Overwatch World Cup, which will take place at BlizzCon this year is a good first taste of that, but we'll talking more about our Overwatch eSports plans later in the year. We also look forward to telling more stores about the characters and the world of Overwatch through other media. You've seen some of this through animated shorts and comics, but there's still more to come."

And this is really testimony to the, not only to the longevity, but also to the strength of the brand. In terms of learnings, Pokemon Go has been very successful in expanding the mobile games audience. They have brought the large Pokémon fan base mobile, and I believe this is very good for the whole gaming industry. What it has also proven is that when you pair innovation to very strong branded IP, there's a huge potential, and so I think this is actually very good and is a great opportunity for Activision Blizzard on mobile."

I'll take the question. So first of all, on the quality, both of the games, both in MR are really looking amazing and we're very decided that we find a way to deliver both the breakthrough innovation that has been such an important part of Call of Duty success over the years as well as a return to the classic gameplay that people love so much in one amazing package at an incredible value. And that combination, that value has really led to the performance that we're seeing in the preorders for both the legacy addition and the Digital Deluxe edition, both of which are kind of registering higher percentages for our higher-priced SKUs than we've ever seen before. So the way we think about it is that Modern Warfare Remastered is the best bonus content we've ever offered in  one of our collectors editions, and we think that's driving that player performance for both the Legacy edition and the Digital Deluxe edition. On Infinite Warfare, specifically, the team is just tremendously passionate about the game and that passion is really showing through and how the games closing. It's inventive, it looks great and it has a ton of new game mechanics for the franchise. There's often initial skepticism when you push for bold innovations in the context of something that's so well establish such as Call of Duty but the good news is the more people are seeing that the game, the more they're getting really excited about it. We showed 8 uninterrupted moments of gameplay at East 3 and that generated the highest positive sentiment from the usually hard to please game or press that we've ever seen on the franchise since we've been measuring it, and we showed another 12 minutes of gameplay at Comic Con, and again, got the highest positive sentiment from the press we've ever seen for Call of Duty at that event. The reason that's particularly good news is because people actually haven't seen that much of this game yet relative to previous years. As Tom has mentioned, we're taking a little bit of a different approach to marking this year's around Call of Duty XP and that bodes well is the focus on Black Ops III which help us deliver that record first half of the year that Tom has mentioned, but it's also a long all eyes on our launch titles in September at XP where we will have a pretty incredible list of reveals and first hands on and putting things like Multiplayer and Infinite Warfare, multiplayer Master, the first zombies mode in the main game that we've had in a non title with Infinite Warfare as well as more reveals on campaign as well. And for content, all of the modes have been revealed at this time last year. So we think we've got a winning combination. We've got a great game of Infinite Warfare and a second great game with Modern Warfare Remastered."

On a consolidated basis, we had Q2 record 37% operating margin, which is non-GAAP as previously defined. And in fact, Activision Publishing and Blizzard, those 2 segments combined, were above that at 39% in terms of operating margin this past quarter. So you have, and can see, some of the sight lines to how we might get there and then try to sustain that over time. I try call out maybe 3 things that are really key for that and that are going to be really important for us to get to those levels and to sustain them going forward. The first one is just scale. In our business, we have a large opportunity to drive upside once we're covered the fixed spend that we have to bring our games and our content to market, being very focused on how we do that and all the costs enable us to really scale those incremental margins as we do that. And it's the combination of those that once you get past that fixed cost base, really drives margin accretion for every incremental sale that you have. The second part beyond scale is just digital growth, which really has 2 aspects. The first is just the trend that we're going to continue to see around the shift from retail to digital on full game sales, and that will continue. But even more importantly, and a bigger driver, as you saw on Q2, is the deeper the investment that we see once you have players inside of our experience and new opportunities to add micro transactions, advertisings other things into those experiences, which are all really contribution margin and accretive to the overall margin of the company. And then lastly, I'll just say as a competitive point relative to others, obviously owning our own IP is a huge factor and scaling those margins. That gives us a huge structural margin advantage relative to others and really gives us the flexibility to respond quickly as business models evolve, and we can help us build long-term value around our margin structure. So I think those are probably the 3 things that are most important to driving that."

It's a longer-term vision for what we're trying to accomplish, there's a lot of investment that's still going to be required.

They live event competitions are providing greater price rules, greater recognition, greater opportunities for players, and we think that this is one of the areas that present great opportunities for us for the long-term.

In Q2, Blizzard had its highest MAUs in history, up 13% year-over-year and 29% quarter-over-quarter, driven by increases in players from Overwatch, World of Warcraft and Hearthstone. Important to take a step back and review Blizzard's continued growth over the past few years. Blizzard has doubled its number of franchises, expanding into new genres, business models and platforms. And as a result, they have doubled the size of their audience over a relatively short period of time. This performance is due to the strength of the team at Blizzard and their strategic focus on building epic entertainment experiences that capture the imagination of tens of millions of people globally. 
Overwatch has had incredible momentum and has now reached over 15  million players globally, achieving this milestone more quickly than any game in Blizzard's history. In China, Overwatch broke Diablo III's record as the fastest-selling PC game in the market's history. Additionally, Overwatch has claimed the #1 position in Korean IGRs with over 30% share of playtime. This global success has led to a roughly even player split between the East and West. 
World of Warcraft momentum continues to build ahead of the August launch of Legions. MAUs have seen double-digit growth both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, and Legion pre-purchases are tracking in line with the last expansion in 2014. In particular, we've had strong momentum in China following the launch of the Warcraft movie, which is now one of the highest-grossing Hollywood releases ever in China and the biggest game-based movie released worldwide. 
Activation MAUs were also a Q2 record and were up 11% year-over-year. This was largely driven by the continued strength of Call of Duty. Black Ops III continues to be the top-selling current-gen game life-to-date and, again, overperformed the prior year's game across every key metric: MAUs, full game sales, in-game content and engagement. 
Destiny also saw month-to-month growth in MAUs with the launch of our April update, the June announce of Destiny's next expansion, Rise of Iron. The continued hunger for great new content from this passionate community bodes well for the September launch of Rise of Iron. Digital prepurchases so far are very strong and tracking ahead of last year's Taken King. 
That leads me to our second strategic pillar. Once again, our compelling game worlds drove not only large communities but also deep engagement with nearly 10 billion hours of playtime during the second quarter. Blizzard's franchises continue to display the depths of gameplay that they are known for. As Bobby mentioned, players spent about 500 million hours playing Overwatch. Since launch, Blizzard has added a competitive playbook to the game in June and  new hero in mid-July and just introduced this week Summer Games content, which includes an exciting new soccer-like game mode. Both the new hero and Summer Games also added what was [indiscernible] Loot Boxes that players can earn or purchase. In just the first day, we saw record engagement with the new Summer Games mode and its customization items. Blizzard is pleased with the strong adoption of all these releases and plans to continue adding new content and improving existing features to deliver a great ongoing experience to Overwatch players. 
Hearthstone had its highest MAUs and highest quarterly time spent in the game's history this quarter on the back of the launch of the Whispers of the Old Gods expansion. This deep engagement drove a double-digit revenue increase year-over-year. Just last week in the ChinaJoy, Blizzard announced its fourth adventure set for release on August 11. One Night in Karazhan, continuous Hearthstone's tradition of bringing a charming and accessible approach to some of the most popular Warcraft settings. As with our other adventures, players will be able to experience a single-player storyline and earn cards with a player-versus-player deck. 
The strong engagement around our franchises also serves our initiatives outside of our games. Our eSports and film and TV initiatives are not only a driver of audience expansion but drives deeper engagement, which will lead to longer franchise lives with greater profitability.
First, on eSports. Last year, BlizzCon had its highest live spring viewership ever with over 10 million people around the world tuning in, higher than the viewership for this year's NBA and MLB All-Star games. This November, Blizzard will be hosting its 10th BlizzCon. One of the biggest attractions there will be the culmination of the Road to BlizzCon tournaments with global champions across a number of franchises being crowned, including the champion for the just announced Overwatch World Cup. 
They've also made a lot of progress in the launch of our eSports network, Major League Gaming. MLG presented to advertisers the  NewFronts in New York in May where they showcased a significant new product innovation that provides an enhanced viewing experience, offering real-time statistics, leaderboards and insights based on the competition you're watching, making the viewing experience far more accessible and rich. MLG also announced a partnership with Facebook to broadcast live competition as well as to Esports Report, providing broad reach for our premium content. Since the acquisition in December, MLG's reach has increased by more than 700% on Facebook. MLG is also working closely with our internal teams to build out our eSports leagues and events for key franchises. MLG and the Call of Duty World League hosted the Anaheim Open in June and are preparing for the upcoming Orlando Open as well. 
With the growth of the Call of Duty World League, Call of Duty East West viewership has increased by more than 5x year-over-year to 33 million views of our Stage 1 event this year, and there are still major events to come, including the championships at Call of Duty XP this September, which we anticipate will be our most viewed Call of Duty eSports event in history by a wide margin. 
Our film and TV unit announced that the first 2 seasons of their first initiative, Skylanders Academy, have been sold to Netflix for global distribution. Skylanders Academy is an extremely high-quality animated TV show, coming on the heels of the release of our innovative new game this fall, Skylanders Imaginators, which was developed by the investors of the toys' loved category, Toys for Bob. 
Now turning to our third pillar of our strategy: providing increased opportunities for player investment. This quarter, excluding deferrals, we drove a record $1 billion in digital in-game content sales, a rapidly growing part of our business. A big driver of that performance was King, which continued to drive large audiences of over 400 million monthly active users, who invest increasing amount in our games because of the incredibly compelling content King continues to deliver. As expected, due to seasonality and launch timing, King MAUs were down this quarter, but deeper engagement and play investment, in part due to the new initiatives around ongoing live operations and events, led again to Candy Crush franchise growth with gross bookings up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. King's time spent per MAU and average revenue per paying user across their network were both up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Mobile gross bookings for King also increased year-over-year. King has had at least 3 of the top 15 grossing games in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in the U.S. for 10 quarters in a row, showing the durability of top mobile franchises over time. King has also continued with its in-network advertising tests, which we expect to expand to Candy Crush later this year. The tests are critical to ensuring that engagement and value-added offers can be a virtuous cycle, as we've seen with new in-game content in our core games. We believe advertising is an attractive opportunity given the size and quality of King's network, and store testing is critical to ensure we preserve a high-quality play experience and player investment opportunities. 
Turning to our core game experiences. We see continued evidence of this virtuous cycle. Strong engagement leads to strong play investment, which, in turn, fuels strong engagement. Blizzard is a testimony to that. Record engagement in Q2 led to Blizzard's biggest revenue quarter ever. This strong performance was driven by Overwatch successful launch, now with life-to-date franchise revenue, excluding deferral, at about $0.5 billion, World of Warcraft's strong pre-expansion momentum with Legion III purchases tracking in line with the previous expansion, and Hearthstone's double-digit revenue growth behind the successful launch of the Old Gods expansion. 
The teams at Activision and Bungie continued to successfully introduce new earned and purchased in-game content into Destiny. We have seen strong community response to this content with no reduction in engagement. 
Finally, Call of Duty has seen strong performance across-the-board.  In-game content purchases, including Season Pass, map packs and micro-transactions, continued to deliver at record levels for the franchise. In fact, on the back of the strength as well as strong catalog sales, the first half of the year was the best in terms of both non-GAAP operating income and revenue in the franchise's history. Activision also doubled the number of in-game purchases in Call of Duty with no degradation to average revenue per user. Most importantly, this was accomplished by actually improving overall engagement. 
The bold innovations in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare earned exceptionally positive media sentiment at E3, including being named Best Shooter by Game Informer and receiving 25 other awards and distinctions. 
Activision is taking a different approach to the Collector's Editions this year with the best bonus content we have ever offered, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered. The Legacy Edition and Digital Deluxe Edition offer an amazing value and incredible breadth and variety of gameplay. Infinite Warfare offers 3 full modes, which will deliver bold, new innovations for the franchise, and the beautiful Remastered Modern Warfare (sic) [ Modern Warfare Remastered ] will return fans to the classic gameplay of one of the most beloved games in history. It seems to be a winning combination since we are seeing as strong higher percentage of our preorders in our higher-value premium SKUs than ever before. 
While it's expected overall preorders are down versus last year, Activision is taking a different approach to the marketing cadence this year, which is more back loaded. This has allowed for increased focus on driving Black Ops III engagement, which, given the record first half of the year for the franchise, has been a fruitful strategy.  As a result, the majority of the assets for this year's launch, including Infinite Warfare's multiplayer reveal and hands-on, zombies reveal and hands-on and Modern Warfare Remastered multiplayer and hands-on are all yet to be revealed. This sets the stage for next month's Call of Duty XP, which will provide the perfect stage to showcase all of this incredible content to drive momentum as we enter the launch season and, of course, to celebrate Call of Duty's amazing fame.. 
In summary, our strong performance in the first half of the year confirms that execution against our strategic pillars is paying off, and we have a great schedule of content for the balance of the year. Dennis?"

It's been an incredible first half of the year, and across nearly all parts of our business, we saw strong performance in the quarter. This performance further validates many of the important growth themes we've discussed around opportunities in mobile, digital, deeper player investment and our ability to launch new world-class intellectual property. 
Before we go into the results, as a reminder, we hosted a quick call last week to discuss changes to our external non-GAAP reporting in response to the SEC staff's updated interpretations, and I'd encourage you to review those materials if you haven't done so already. These interpretations affect external reporting for numerous companies but do not affect our strong underlying business fundamentals or cash flows. 
As we explained, starting this quarter, we will be sharing some new reporting metrics and we will continue to provide you with supplemental disclosure to help you calculate relevant metrics for year-over-year comparisons. Our disclosures can be found in the tables in our earnings press release and the Excel model posted to the IR website following this call. 
Turning to our Q2 results and highlights, we will now, for one last time, refer to our non-GAAP results, as we had previously defined them, excluding deferrals. We generated revenues of $1.61 billion in the quarter, $234 million above May guidance and $850 million or 112% above Q2 last year. We generated EPS of $0.54, $0.16 above guidance and $0.41 or 315% above Q2 last year. The overperformance versus guidance was composed of $0.04 of cost timing and $0.12 of business overperformance with the key drivers being the successful launch of our newest franchise, Overwatch, which is obviously off to a resounding start; continued momentum of the Call of Duty digital business; and continued growth of the Candy Crush franchise. 
In addition, digital momentum continued to be a strong business driver in Q2, producing record quarterly digital revenues and operating margins for the company. Digital revenues were $1.4 billion, growing 129% year-over-year and 76% quarter-over-quarter. And as Thomas mentioned, a remarkable $1 billion of this came from in-game content sales. Excluding King, digital revenues were also up a record, up over 50% year-over-year. 
Our digital performance drove operating margins to a Q2 record of 37%, up from 28% operating margin last quarter and 23% in Q2 of last year. So we have continued strong tailwinds on the digital front, which bodes well for the future across the business. 
Now let's take a look at the business results for each of our 3 segments. Let's start with Blizzard. The launch of Overwatch drove engagement to record highs, leading to their biggest revenue quarter ever with quarterly operating income that was nearly triple Q2 of last year. Blizzard also had its biggest quarter in China with a meaningful increase in revenues versus the previous high last year. World of Warcraft, Hearthstone and Overwatch success in Asia shows the depth of Blizzard's resonance in important growth markets. Overwatch was the fastest-selling PC game ever in China, and the Warcraft film had the biggest Hollywood launch ever in China as well. 
On the Activision front, the team delivered record MAUs and operating income for both Q2 and the first half of the year, driven by the continued strength of Call of Duty and, in particular, digital in-game content. 
Turning to King. The Candy Crush franchise continues to perform well, showing growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. King's Q2 segment operating income was also up quarter-over-quarter on a full quarter basis. 
With all that as a backdrop, let's now turn to our detailed financial results and to our updated external reporting format. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. Please note non-GAAP, redefined, includes deferrals. 
For the quarter, on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.57 billion, up 50% year-over-year, and operating margin of 15% and EPS of $0.17. 
For the quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, as redefined to include deferrals, we generated an operating margin of 31% and EPS of $0.45, up 45% year-over-year. 
Turning to the specific P&L items, please note that all percentages are based on revenues except for the tax rate for Q2, GAAP product costs were 25%, operating expenses were 60% , interest expense was $65 million and our GAAP tax rate was 24%. 
Our GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average share count was 753 million shares, including participating securities. 
On a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, which includes deferrals, product costs were 25%, operating expenses were 45%, interest expense was $64 million and our non-GAAP tax rate was 18%. 
In terms of cash flow, in Q2, we generated strong cash flow with non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $511 million, up 37% year-over-year; operating cash flow of $479 million, up 255% year-over-year; and free cash flow of $435 million after CapEx, up 307% year-over-year with continued strong cash conversion. For the first half of the year, we delivered $788 million of operating cash flow, up 129% year-over-year and $717 million of free cash flow, up 143% year-over-year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. On the back of that strong cash flow performance, we ended June 30 with approximately $2.3 billion in cash and investments, of which roughly 1/3 was held domestically. We also paid down $816  million of our outstanding debt in the quarter, bringing the total paydown so far this year to $1.3 billion. We ended the quarter with $5.1 billion in aggregate debt outstanding. Please note that our $1.5 billion of 2021 notes become callable during the third quarter of 2016. In light of our recent upgrade to investment grade, we believe it will be advantageous to call the bonds and refinance that debt during the quarter. As such, we've included the call premium and estimated transaction costs in our GAAP guidance for Q3. 
On the dividend front, in Q2, we paid a $0.26 per share cash dividend or approximately $195 million in aggregate to shareholders of record as of March 30, 2016. 
So in summary, Q2 and our first half were an incredibly strong start to the year for the company and set us up well for the upcoming quarters and years ahead. 
Now let's turn to our slate and our outlook for Q3 and the full year 2016. Blizzard is launching Hearthstone's next adventure, One Night in Karazhan, next week and launching World of Warcraft's next expansion, Legion, globally on August 30. Activision is launching Destiny's Rise of Iron expansion on September 20 at a $30 price point, as well as a map pack for Call of Duty: Black Ops III in Q3. We expect Skylanders Imaginators to launch on October 16, followed by Skylanders Academy, an animated show which is expected to debut on Netflix. 
In Q4, Activision also plans to release the fourth map pack for Call of Duty: Black Ops III as well as Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare and Modern Warfare Remastered on November 4. 
King launched Farm Heroes Super Saga in the last few days of Q2 and has one more non-Candy Crush franchise release coming towards the end of the year, along with continued live operations across key games and franchises. 
For Q3 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.49 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $45 million; product costs of 23%; and operating expenses of 64%. We expect GAAP interest expense of $138 million, which includes the potential payment of a call premium and related debt refinancing costs; a GAAP tax rate of 18%; GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 760 million; and EPS of $0.06. 
For Q3 on a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we expect product costs of 23% and operating expenses of 47%. We expect a non-GAAP interest expense of $53 million, a tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.39, including a GAAP deferral of $0.01. Note that you can reference our accompanying materials for the FX rates we use in our guidance. 
Now let's turn to our full year 2016 numbers. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.4 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $75 million; product costs of 24%; and operating expenses of 58%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $311 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 18%, including tax rate impacts resulting from the adoption of the new accounting standard for simplification for share-based compensation. Please see our outlook tables in the earnings release for additional detail. 
We expect 765 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP redefined; and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.87, up $0.18 versus our previous guidance. 
As we said on our prior earnings calls, our GAAP earnings are expected to be down in 2016 versus prior year as our expected results will be impacted by additional accounting charges associated with the King transaction, which include, among other things, transaction-related adjustments, costs and amortization of intangibles resulting from purchase price accounting adjustments. The majority of these GAAP accounting charges will not impact the economics of our business or our cash flows, although they will have a material impact on our 2016 GAAP earnings results. 
For 2016 on a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we expect product costs of 24%, operating expenses of 44%, operating margin of 32% and a tax rate of 24%. Our non-GAAP interest expense is expected to be $223 million. 
Based on the information we disclosed in May, our non-GAAP redefined outlook was $1.64, including $0.14 of deferrals. We are now raising our non-GAAP redefined EPS outlook to $1.83, which includes $0.07 of GAAP deferrals. 
If you would like to calculate non-GAAP as previously defined revenues and EPS in order to do year-over-year comparisons, you would add the impact of GAAP deferrals to GAAP revenues and to non-GAAP redefined EPS using the numbers I just quoted. 
So in summary, our performance in Q2 and in the first half of the year once again proved our ability to achieve 3 important things: first, to launch new content that can appeal to millions of players around the world; second, to consistently keep our large audiences engaged as we offer them more frequent digital content and services to enhance their experiences; and third, to deliver solid financial results, which further sets us up for long-term success. As such, as a team, we are very pleased with our first half momentum and couldn't be more excited as we head into the back half of the year. 
Now I welcome our business leaders, Eric, Mike and Riccardo, as they join as for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?"

We really appreciate all their support and their incredible enthusiasm for the game. We've seen great momentum with the game across all the different engagement models, including digital and box sales, Korean Internet Game Rooms, which are time-based, and cosmetic content, which can be earned or purchased. As Thomas mentioned, altogether, the game has generated about $0.5 billion life-to-date, excluding deferrals. But more importantly, in the past 2 months since launch, we've already provided some great content to the Overwatch community, including a competitive play mode, a new hero, the recently launched Summer Games content, which drove record engagement yesterday, as well as customization items. So we're very excited about creating even more content for players moving forward. I also want to point out that while we had a great start with the game release, we really view this as just the beginning. We think we've created a strong, character-driven universe with big opportunities beyond just the game. We think Overwatch has strong potential as an eSport. The recently announced Overwatch World Cup, which will take place at BlizzCon this year, is a good first taste of that, but we'll talking more about our Overwatch eSports plans later in the year. We also look forward to telling more stories about the characters in the world of Overwatch through other media. You've seen some of this through the animated shorts and comics, but there's still more to come."

And that combination, that value, has really led to the performance that we're seeing in the preorders for both the Legacy Edition and the Digital Deluxe Edition, both of which are kind of registering far higher percentages for our higher-priced SKUs than we've ever seen before. So the way we think about it is that Modern Warfare Remastered is the best bonus content we've ever offered in  one of our Collector's Editions, and we think that's driving that player performance for both the Legacy Edition and the Digital Deluxe Edition. On Infinite Warfare specifically, the team of Vinnie Ward [ph] is just tremendously passionate about the game, and that passion is really showing through in how the game is closing. It's fresh. It's inventive. It looks great and it has a ton of new gameplay mechanics for the franchise. There's often initial skepticism when you push for bold innovations in the context of something that's so well established such as Call of Duty. But the good news is the more people are seeing the game, the more they're getting really excited about it. We showed 8 uninterrupted moments of gameplay at E3, and that generated the highest positive sentiment from the usually hard-to-please gamer press that we've ever seen on the franchise at E3 since we've been measuring it. And we showed another 12 minutes of gameplay at Comic-Con and, again, got the highest positive sentiment from the press we've ever seen for Call of Duty at that event. The reason that's particularly good news is because people actually haven't seen that much of this game yet relative to previous years. As Thomas mentioned, we're taking a little bit of a different approach to marking this year centered around Call of Duty XP, and that emboldened [ph] us to focus on Black Ops III, which helped us deliver that record first half of the year that Thomas mentioned, but it's also, along it, put all eyes on our launch titles in September at XP where we will have a pretty incredible list of reveals and first hands-on, including things like multiplayer in Infinite Warfare, multiplayer in Modern Warfare Remastered, the first Zombies mode in the main game that we've had in an entree or title with Infinite Warfare as well as more reveals on campaign as well. And for context, all of the modes had been revealed at this time last year. So we think we've got a winning combination. We think we've got a great game of Infinite Warfare and a second great game with Modern Warfare Remastered."

And we also have more updates planned for this year to continue to keep people engaged. As for the future, the majority of the team at Bungie is actually focused entirely on creating Destiny II, which is still on track for release next year, and it's going to be awesome."

On a consolidated basis, we had a Q2 record 37% operating margin, which is non-GAAP, as previously defined. And in fact, Activision Publishing and Blizzard, those 2 segments combined were above that at 39% in terms of operating margin this past quarter. So you have and can see some of the sight lines to how we might get there and then try to sustain that over time. I'd try to call out maybe 3 things that are really key for that and that are going to be really important for us to get to those levels and to sustain them going forward. The first one is just scale. In our business, we have a large opportunity to drive upside once we recover the fixed spend that we have to bring our games and our content to market, being very focused on how we do that, and all the costs enable us to really scale those incremental margins as we do that. And it's the combination of those that, once you get past that fixed cost base, really drives margin accretion for every incremental sale that you have. The second part beyond scale is just digital growth, which really has 2 aspects. The first is just the trend that we're going to continue to see around the shift from retail to digital on full game sales, and that will continue. But even more importantly and a bigger driver, as you saw in Q2, is the deeper player investment that we see once we have players inside of our experience and new opportunities to add micro-transactions, advertising, other things into those experiences, which are all really contribution margin and accretive to the overall margin of the company. And then lastly, I'll just say as a competitive point relative to others, obviously owning our own IP is a huge factor in scaling those margins. That gives us a huge structural margin advantage relative to others and really gives us the flexibility to respond quickly as business models evolve. And we can -- it'll help us build long-term value around our margin structure. So I'd say those are probably the 3 things that are most important to driving that. Thanks for the question."

And you think about the investment and the commitment that our players make in our games, this is a great way for us to really recognize, through organized competition, that investment. When you look at all the opportunities that present themselves, they're very franchise specific, there's a lot of work that needs to be done to get to a place where you have broad appeal watching, where you have the ability to broadcast content in an effective and successful way. And we are investing again all the various opportunities that we think eSports [indiscernible] with that. It's a longer-term vision for what we're trying to accomplish. There's a lot of investment that's still going to be required. Having said that, more people are spectating on video games than ever before. There are more opportunities for spectators than ever before. The live event competitions are providing greater price pools, greater recognition, greater opportunities for players. And we think that this is one of the areas that'll present great opportunities for us for the long term. Getting from here to a place that will allow our franchises to resemble the NFL, the NBA and Major League Baseball is going to take some time, but I could tell you the best minds at the company, the people in this room are all committed to continuing the efforts that we've made, and I think we have a genuine belief that in all of these sports we've been the most successful, I think most of what you see is organized competition started out with Blizzard games a long time ago. And so we have a lot of belief and a lot of expectation at the promise that eSports will continue to be something that we will excel at."

Our continued success comes from the efforts of our over 10,000 employees. Their passion, dedication and focus are the reasons we're able to entertain hundreds of millions of players around the world and deliver value to our stakeholders. 
This quarter was a record quarter in large measure because of the unique capability we have as a company to create new franchises. The truly extraordinary team at Blizzard launched Overwatch to incredible audience success. Overwatch already has over 15 million players, who have spent about 0.5 billion hours playing the game, and has achieved success throughout the world, including in China and Korea where Overwatch is now the #1 game in terms of share of playtime.

Our creative and commercial teams across our 5 operating divisions delivered a very strong first half of 2016 with broad-based record results.  To expand on what Bobby mentioned, our results are driven by focus and execution against our 3 strategic pillars: first, expanding our audiences; second, deepening engagement; and third, providing opportunities for more play investment. Let's start with audience reach, which was nearly 0.5 billion monthly active players in what is typically a seasonally softer quarter. 
In Q2, Blizzard had its highest MAUs in history, up 13% year-over-year and 29% quarter-over-quarter, driven by increases in players from Overwatch, World of Warcraft and Hearthstone. Important to take a step back and review Blizzard's continued growth over the past few years. Blizzard has doubled its number of franchises, expanding into new genres, business models and platforms. And as a result, they have doubled the size of their audience over a relatively short period of time. This performance is due to the strength of the team at Blizzard and their strategic focus on building epic entertainment experiences that capture the imagination of tens of millions of people globally. 
Overwatch has had incredible momentum and has now reached over 15  million players globally, achieving this milestone more quickly than any game in Blizzard's history. In China, Overwatch broke Diablo III's record as the fastest-selling PC game in the market's history. Additionally, Overwatch has claimed the #1 position in Korean IGRs with over 30% share of playtime. This global success has led to a roughly even player split between the East and West. 
World of Warcraft momentum continues to build ahead of the August launch of Legions. MAUs have seen double-digit growth both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, and Legion pre-purchases are tracking in line with the last expansion in 2014. In particular, we've had strong momentum in China following the launch of the Warcraft movie, which is now one of the highest-grossing Hollywood releases ever in China and the biggest game-based movie released worldwide. 
Activation MAUs were also a Q2 record and were up 11% year-over-year. This was largely driven by the continued strength of Call of Duty. Black Ops III continues to be the top-selling current-gen game life-to-date and, again, overperformed the prior year's game across every key metric: MAUs, full game sales, in-game content and engagement. 
Destiny also saw month-to-month growth in MAUs with the launch of our April update, the June announce of Destiny's next expansion, Rise of Iron. The continued hunger for great new content from this passionate community bodes well for the September launch of Rise of Iron. Digital prepurchases so far are very strong and tracking ahead of last year's Taken King. 
That leads me to our second strategic pillar. Once again, our compelling game worlds drove not only large communities but also deep engagement with nearly 10 billion hours of playtime during the second quarter. Blizzard's franchises continue to display the depths of gameplay that they are known for. As Bobby mentioned, players spent about 500 million hours playing Overwatch. Since launch, Blizzard has added a competitive playbook to the game in June and  new hero in mid-July and just introduced this week Summer Games content, which includes an exciting new soccer-like game mode. Both the new hero and Summer Games also added what was mainly guided as Loot Boxes that players can earn or purchase. In just the first day, we saw record engagement with the new Summer Games mode and its customization items. Blizzard is pleased with the strong adoption of all these releases and plans to continue adding new content and improving existing features to deliver a great ongoing experience to Overwatch players. 
Hearthstone had its highest MAUs and highest quarterly time spent in the game's history this quarter on the back of the launch of the Whispers of the Old Gods expansion. This deep engagement drove a double-digit revenue increase year-over-year. Just last week in the ChinaJoy, Blizzard announced its fourth adventure set for release on August 11. One Night in Karazhan, continues the Hearthstone's tradition of bringing a charming and accessible approach to some of the most popular Warcraft settings. As with our other adventures, players will be able to experience a single-player storyline and earn cards with a player-versus-player deck. 
The strong engagement around our franchises also serves our initiatives outside of our games. Our eSports and film and TV initiatives are not only a driver of audience expansion but drives deeper engagement, which will lead to longer franchise lives with greater profitability.
First, on eSports. Last year, BlizzCon had its highest live spring viewership ever with over 10 million people around the world tuning in, higher than the viewership for this year's NBA and MLB All-Star games. This November, Blizzard will be hosting its 10th BlizzCon. One of the biggest attractions there will be the culmination of the Road to BlizzCon tournaments with global champions across a number of franchises being crowned, including the champion for the just announced Overwatch World Cup. 
We've also made a lot of progress in the launch of our eSports network, Major League Gaming. MLG presented to advertisers the  NewFronts in New York in May where they showcased a significant new product innovation that provides an enhanced viewing experience, offering real-time statistics, leaderboards and insights based on the competition you're watching, making the viewing experience far more accessible and rich. MLG also announced a partnership with Facebook to broadcast live competition as well as to Esports Report, providing broad reach for our premium content. Since the acquisition in December, MLG's reach has increased by more than 700% on Facebook. MLG is also working closely with our internal teams to build out our eSports leagues and events for key franchises. MLG and the Call of Duty World League hosted the Anaheim Open in June and are preparing for the upcoming Orlando Open as well. 
With the growth of the Call of Duty World League, Call of Duty East West viewership has increased by more than 5x year-over-year to 33 million views of our Stage 1 event this year, and there are still major events to come, including the championships at Call of Duty XP this September, which we anticipate will be our most viewed Call of Duty eSports event in history by a wide margin. 
Our film and TV unit announced that the first 2 seasons of their first initiative, Skylanders Academy, have been sold to Netflix for global distribution. Skylanders Academy is an extremely high-quality animated TV show, coming on the heels of the release of our innovative new game this fall, Skylanders Imaginators, which was developed by the inventors of the toys' loved[ph] category, Toys for Bob. 
Now turning to our third pillar of our strategy: providing increased opportunities for player investment. This quarter, excluding deferrals, we drove a record $1 billion in digital in-game content sales, a rapidly growing part of our business. A big driver of that performance was King, which continued to drive large audiences of over 400 million monthly active users, who invest increasing amount in our games because of the incredibly compelling content King continues to deliver. As expected, due to seasonality and launch timing, King MAUs were down this quarter, but deeper engagement and play investment, in part due to the new initiatives around ongoing live operations and events, led again to Candy Crush franchise growth with gross bookings up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. King's time spent per MAU and average revenue per paying user across their network were both up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Mobile gross bookings for King also increased year-over-year. King has had at least 3 of the top 15 grossing games in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in the U.S. for 10 quarters in a row, showing the durability of top mobile franchises over time. King has also continued with its in-network advertising tests, which we expect to expand to Candy Crush later this year. The tests are critical to ensuring that engagement and value-added offers can be a virtuous cycle, as we've seen with new in-game content in our core games. We believe advertising is an attractive opportunity given the size and quality of King's network, and store testing is critical to ensure we preserve a high-quality play experience and player investment opportunities. 
Turning to our core game experiences. We see continued evidence of this virtuous cycle. Strong engagement leads to strong play investment, which, in turn, fuels strong engagement. Blizzard is a testimony to that. Record engagement in Q2 led to Blizzard's biggest revenue quarter ever. This strong performance was driven by Overwatch's successful launch, now with life-to-date franchise revenue, excluding deferral, at about $0.5 billion, World of Warcraft's strong pre-expansion momentum with Legion III purchases tracking in line with the previous expansion, and Hearthstone's double-digit revenue growth behind the successful launch of the Old Gods expansion. 
The teams at Activision and Bungie continue to successfully introduce new earned and purchased in-game content into Destiny. We have seen strong community response to this content with no reduction in engagement. 
Finally, Call of Duty has seen strong performance across-the-board.  In-game content purchases, including Season Pass, map packs and micro-transactions, continued to deliver at record levels for the franchise. In fact, on the back of the strength as well as strong catalog sales, the first half of the year was the best in terms of both non-GAAP operating income and revenue in the franchise's history. Activision also doubled the number of in-game purchases in Call of Duty with no degradation to average revenue per user. Most importantly, this was accomplished by actually improving overall engagement. 
The bold innovations in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare earned exceptionally positive media sentiment at E3, including being named Best Shooter by Game Informer and receiving 25 other awards and distinctions. 
Activision is taking a different approach to the Collector's Editions this year with the best bonus content we have ever offered, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered. The Legacy Edition and Digital Deluxe Edition offer an amazing value and incredible breadth and variety of gameplay. Infinite Warfare offers 3 full modes, which will deliver bold, new innovations for the franchise, and the beautiful Remastered Modern Warfare (sic) [ Modern Warfare Remastered ] will return fans to the classic gameplay of one of the most beloved games in history. It seems to be a winning combination since we are seeing as strong higher percentage of our preorders in our higher-value premium SKUs than ever before. 
While it's expected overall preorders are down versus last year, Activision is taking a different approach to the marketing cadence this year, which is more back loaded. This has allowed for increased focus on driving Black Ops III engagement, which, given the record first half of the year for the franchise, has been a fruitful strategy.  As a result, the majority of the assets for this year's launch, including Infinite Warfare's multiplayer reveal and hands-on, zombies reveal and hands-on and Modern Warfare Remastered multiplayer and hands-on are all yet to be revealed. This sets the stage for next month's Call of Duty XP, which will provide the perfect stage to showcase all of this incredible content to drive momentum as we enter the launch season and, of course, to celebrate Call of Duty's amazing fame. 
In summary, our strong performance in the first half of the year confirms that execution against our strategic pillars is paying off, and we have a great schedule of content for the balance of the year. Dennis?"

It's been an incredible first half of the year, and across nearly all parts of our business, we saw strong performance in the quarter. This performance further validates many of the important growth themes we've discussed around opportunit",1760,"Thanks, Thomas. It's been an incredible first half of the year, and across nearly all parts of our business, we saw strong performance in the quarter. This performance further validates many of the important growth themes we've discussed around opportunities in mobile, digital, deeper player investment and our ability to launch new world-class intellectual property. 
Before we go into the results, as a reminder, we hosted a quick call last week to discuss changes to our external non-GAAP reporting in response to the SEC staff's updated interpretations, and I'd encourage you to review those materials if you haven't done so already. These interpretations affect external reporting for numerous companies but do not affect our strong underlying business fundamentals or cash flows. 
As we explained, starting this quarter, we will be sharing some new reporting metrics and we will continue to provide you with supplemental disclosure to help you calculate relevant metrics for year-over-year comparisons. Our disclosures can be found in the tables in our earnings press release and the Excel model posted to the IR website following this call. 
Turning to our Q2 results and highlights, we will now, for one last time, refer to our non-GAAP results, as we had previously defined them, excluding deferrals. We generated revenues of $1.61 billion in the quarter, $234 million above May guidance and $850 million or 112% above Q2 last year. We generated EPS of $0.54, $0.16 above guidance and $0.41 or 315% above Q2 last year. The overperformance versus guidance was composed of $0.04 of cost timing and $0.12 of business overperformance with the key drivers being the successful launch of our newest franchise, Overwatch, which is obviously off to a resounding start; continued momentum of the Call of Duty digital business; and continued growth of the Candy Crush franchise. 
In addition, digital momentum continued to be a strong business driver in Q2, producing record quarterly digital revenues and operating margins for the company. Digital revenues were $1.4 billion, growing 129% year-over-year and 76% quarter-over-quarter. And as Thomas mentioned, a remarkable $1 billion of this came from in-game content sales. Excluding King, digital revenues were also up a record, up over 50% year-over-year. 
Our digital performance drove operating margins to a Q2 record of 37%, up from 28% operating margin last quarter and 23% in Q2 of last year. So we have continued strong tailwinds on the digital front, which bodes well for the future across the business. 
Now let's take a look at the business results for each of our 3 segments. Let's start with Blizzard. The launch of Overwatch drove engagement to record highs, leading to their biggest revenue quarter ever with quarterly operating income that was nearly triple Q2 of last year. Blizzard also had its biggest quarter in China with a meaningful increase in revenues versus the previous high last year. World of Warcraft, Hearthstone and Overwatch success in Asia shows the depth of Blizzard's resonance in important growth markets. Overwatch was the fastest-selling PC game ever in China, and the Warcraft film had the biggest Hollywood launch ever in China as well. 
On the Activision front, the team delivered record MAUs and operating income for both Q2 and the first half of the year, driven by the continued strength of Call of Duty and, in particular, digital in-game content. 
Turning to King. The Candy Crush franchise continues to perform well, showing growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. King's Q2 segment operating income was also up quarter-over-quarter on a full quarter basis. 
With all that as a backdrop, let's now turn to our detailed financial results and to our updated external reporting format. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. Please note non-GAAP, redefined, includes deferrals. 
For the quarter, on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.57 billion, up 50% year-over-year, and operating margin of 15% and EPS of $0.17. 
For the quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, as redefined to include deferrals, we generated an operating margin of 31% and EPS of $0.45, up 45% year-over-year. 
Turning to the specific P&L items, please note that all percentages are based on revenues except for the tax rate. For Q2, GAAP product costs were 25%, operating expenses were 60% , interest expense was $65 million and our GAAP tax rate was 24%. 
Our GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average share count was 753 million shares, including participating securities. 
On a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, which includes deferrals, product costs were 25%, operating expenses were 45%, interest expense was $64 million and our non-GAAP tax rate was 18%. 
In terms of cash flow, in Q2, we generated strong cash flow with non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $511 million, up 37% year-over-year; operating cash flow of $479 million, up 255% year-over-year; and free cash flow of $435 million after CapEx, up 307% year-over-year with continued strong cash conversion. For the first half of the year, we delivered $788 million of operating cash flow, up 129% year-over-year and $717 million of free cash flow, up 143% year-over-year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. On the back of that strong cash flow performance, we ended June 30 with approximately $2.3 billion in cash and investments, of which roughly 1/3 was held domestically. We also paid down $816  million of our outstanding debt in the quarter, bringing the total paydown so far this year to $1.3 billion. We ended the quarter with $5.1 billion in aggregate debt outstanding. Please note that our $1.5 billion of 2021 notes become callable during the third quarter of 2016. In light of our recent upgrade to investment grade, we believe it will be advantageous to call the bonds and refinance that debt during the quarter. As such, we've included the call premium and estimated transaction costs in our GAAP guidance for Q3. 
On the dividend front, in Q2, we paid a $0.26 per share cash dividend or approximately $195 million in aggregate to shareholders of record as of March 30, 2016. 
So in summary, Q2 and our first half were an incredibly strong start to the year for the company and set us up well for the upcoming quarters and years ahead. 
Now let's turn to our slate and our outlook for Q3 and the full year 2016. Blizzard is launching Hearthstone's next adventure, One Night in Karazhan, next week and launching World of Warcraft's next expansion, Legion, globally on August 30. Activision is launching Destiny's Rise of Iron expansion on September 20 at a $30 price point, as well as a map pack for Call of Duty: Black Ops III in Q3. We expect Skylanders Imaginators to launch on October 16, followed by Skylanders Academy, an animated show which is expected to debut on Netflix. 
In Q4, Activision also plans to release the fourth map pack for Call of Duty: Black Ops III as well as Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare and Modern Warfare Remastered on November 4. 
King launched Farm Heroes Super Saga in the last few days of Q2 and has one more non-Candy Crush franchise release coming towards the end of the year, along with continued live operations across key games and franchises. 
For Q3 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.49 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $45 million; product costs of 23%; and operating expenses of 64%. We expect GAAP interest expense of $138 million, which includes the potential payment of a call premium and related debt refinancing costs; a GAAP tax rate of 18%; GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 760 million; and EPS of $0.06. 
For Q3 on a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we expect product costs of 23% and operating expenses of 47%. We expect a non-GAAP interest expense of $53 million, a tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.39, including a GAAP deferral of $0.01. Note that you can reference our accompanying materials for the FX rates we use in our guidance. 
Now let's turn to our full year 2016 numbers. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.4 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $75 million; product costs of 24%; and operating expenses of 58%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $311 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 18%, including tax rate impacts resulting from the adoption of the new accounting standard for simplification for share-based compensation. Please see our outlook tables in the earnings release for additional detail. 
We expect 765 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP redefined; and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.87, up $0.18 versus our previous guidance. 
As we said on our prior earnings calls, our GAAP earnings are expected to be down in 2016 versus prior year as our expected results will be impacted by additional accounting charges associated with the King transaction, which include, among other things, transaction-related adjustments, costs and amortization of intangibles resulting from purchase price accounting adjustments. The majority of these GAAP accounting charges will not impact the economics of our business or our cash flows, although they will have a material impact on our 2016 GAAP earnings results. 
For 2016 on a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we expect product costs of 24%, operating expenses of 44%, operating margin of 32% and a tax rate of 24%. Our non-GAAP interest expense is expected to be $223 million. 
Based on the information we disclosed in May, our non-GAAP redefined outlook was $1.64, including $0.14 of deferrals. We are now raising our non-GAAP redefined EPS outlook to $1.83, which includes $0.07 of GAAP deferrals. 
If you would like to calculate non-GAAP as previously defined revenues and EPS in order to do year-over-year comparisons, you would add the impact of GAAP deferrals to GAAP revenues and to non-GAAP redefined EPS using the numbers I just quoted. 
So in summary, our performance in Q2 and in the first half of the year once again proved our ability to achieve 3 important things: first, to launch new content that can appeal to millions of players around the world; second, to consistently keep our large audiences engaged as we offer them more frequent digital content and services to enhance their experiences; and third, to deliver solid financial results, which further sets us up for long-term success. As such, as a team, we are very pleased with our first half momentum and couldn't be more excited as we head into the back half of the year. 
Now I welcome our business leaders, Eric, Mike and Riccardo, as they join as for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?"

Thanks for the question. First, we're very pleased with Overwatch's launch results. I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our 15 million players around the world who've joined Overwatch so far. We really appreciate all their support and their incredible enthusiasm for the game. We've seen great momentum with the game across all the different engagement models, including digital and box sales, Korean Internet Game Rooms, which are time-based, and cosmetic content, which can be earned or purchased. As Thomas mentioned, altogether, the game has generated about $0.5 billion life-to-date, excluding deferrals. But more importantly, in the past 2 months since launch, we've already provided some great content to the Overwatch community, including a competitive play mode, a new hero, the recently launched Summer Games content, which drove record engagement yesterday, as well as customization items. So we're very excited about creating even more content for players moving forward. I also want to point out that while we had a great start with the game release, we really view this as just the beginning. We think we've created a strong, character-driven universe with big opportunities beyond just the game. We think Overwatch has strong potential as an eSport. The recently announced Overwatch World Cup, which will take place at BlizzCon this year, is a good first taste of that, but we'll talking more about our Overwatch eSports plans later in the year. We also look forward to telling more stories about the characters in the world of Overwatch through other media. You've seen some of this through the animated shorts and comics, but there's still more to come."

And this is really a testimony to the -- not only to the longevity, yes, but also to the strength of the brand. In terms of learnings, Pokemon Go has been very successful in expanding the mobile games audience. They have brought the large Pokemon fan base to mobile, and I believe this is very good for the whole gaming industry. What it has also proven is that when you pair innovation to very strong branded IP, there's a huge potential. And so I think this is actually very good and is a great opportunity for Activision Blizzard on mobile."

I'll take the questions. So first of all, on the quality, both of the games, both Infinite Warfare and Modern Warfare Remastered,  are really looking amazing, and we're very excited that we found a way to deliver both the break-through innovation that has been such an important part of Call of Duty's success over the years, as well as a return to the classic gameplay that people love so much in one amazing package at an incredible value. And that combination, that value, has really led to the performance that we're seeing in the preorders for both the Legacy Edition and the Digital Deluxe Edition, both of which are kind of registering far higher percentages for our higher-priced SKUs than we've ever seen before. So the way we think about it is that Modern Warfare Remastered is the best bonus content we've ever offered in  one of our Collector's Editions, and we think that's driving that player performance for both the Legacy Edition and the Digital Deluxe Edition. On Infinite Warfare specifically, the team of Vinnie Ward [ph] is just tremendously passionate about the game, and that passion is really showing through in how the game is closing. It's fresh. It's inventive. It looks great and it has a ton of new gameplay mechanics for the franchise. There's often initial skepticism when you push for bold innovations in the context of something that's so well established such as Call of Duty. But the good news is the more people are sitting at the game, the more they're getting really excited about it. We showed 8 uninterrupted moments of gameplay at E3, and that generated the highest positive sentiment from the usually hard-to-please gamer press that we've ever seen on the franchise at E3 since we've been measuring it. And we showed another 12 minutes of gameplay at Comic-Con and, again, got the highest positive sentiment from the press we've ever seen for Call of Duty at that event. The reason that's particularly good news is because people actually haven't seen that much of this game yet relative to previous years. As Thomas mentioned, we're taking a little bit of a different approach to marking this year centered around Call of Duty XP, and that bodes well for us to focus on Black Ops III, which helped us deliver that record first half of the year that Thomas mentioned, but it's also, along it, put all eyes on our launch titles in September at XP where we will have a pretty incredible list of reveals and first hands-on, including things like multiplayer in Infinite Warfare, multiplayer in Modern Warfare Remastered, the first Zombies mode in the main game that we've had in an entree or title with Infinite Warfare as well as more reveals on campaign as well. And for context, all of the modes had been revealed at this time last year. So we think we've got a winning combination. We think we've got a great game of Infinite Warfare and a second great game with Modern Warfare Remastered."

On a consolidated basis, we had a Q2 record 37% operating margin, which is non-GAAP, as previously defined. And in fact, Activision Publishing and Blizzard, those 2 segments combined were above that at 39% in terms of operating margin this past quarter. So you have and can see some of the sight lines to how we might get there and then try to sustain that over time. I'd probably call out maybe 3 things that are really key for that and that are going to be really important for us to get to those levels and to sustain them going forward. The first one is just scale. In our business, we have a large opportunity to drive upside once we recover the fixed spend that we have to bring our games and our content to market, being very focused on how we do that, and all the costs enable us to really scale those incremental margins as we do that. And it's the combination of those that, once you get past that fixed cost base, really drives margin accretion for every incremental sale that you have. The second part beyond scale is just digital growth, which really has 2 aspects. The first is just the trend that we're going to continue to see around the shift from retail to digital on full game sales, and that will continue. But even more importantly and a bigger driver, as you saw in Q2, is the deeper player investment that we see once we have players inside of our experience and new opportunities to add micro-transactions, advertising, other things into those experiences, which are all really contribution margin and accretive to the overall margin of the company. And then lastly, I'll just say as a competitive point relative to others, obviously owning our own IP is a huge factor in scaling those margins. That gives us a huge structural margin advantage relative to others and really gives us the flexibility to respond quickly as business models evolve. And we can -- it'll help us build long-term value around our margin structure. So I'd say those are probably the 3 things that are most important to driving that. Thanks for the question."

And currently, we're testing in 2 games and we expect to test also in Candy Crush later this year, as Thomas was saying earlier. Besides testing, we are also hiring and we are hiring as selectively as we are hiring in the company. And we are hiring to bring the right experience to build this business for the long term.

And you think about the investment and the commitment that our players make in our games, this is a great way for us to really recognize, through organized competition, that investment. When you look at all the opportunities that present themselves, they're very franchise specific, there's a lot of work that needs to be done to get to a place where you have broad appeal watching, where you have the ability to broadcast content in an effective and successful way. And we are investing against all the various opportunities that we think eSports [indiscernible] with that. It's a longer-term vision for what we're trying to accomplish. There's a lot of investment that's still going to be required. Having said that, more people are spectating on video games than ever before. There are more opportunities for spectators than ever before. The live event competitions are providing greater prize pools, greater recognition, greater opportunities for players. And we think that this is one of the areas that'll present great opportunities for us for the long term. Getting from here to a place that will allow our franchises to resemble the NFL, the NBA and Major League Baseball is going to take some time, but I could tell you the best minds at the company, the people in this room are all committed to continuing the efforts that we've made, and I think we have a genuine belief that in all of eSports we've been the most successful. I think most of what you see is organized competition started out with Blizzard games a long time ago. And so we have a lot of belief and a lot of expectation at the promise that eSports will continue to be something that we will excel at."

Our continued success comes from the efforts of our over 10,000 employees. Their passion, dedication and focus are the reasons we're able to entertain hundreds of millions of players around the world and deliver value to our stakeholders. 
This quarter was a record quarter in large measure because of the unique capability we have as a company to create new franchises. The truly extraordinary team at Blizzard launched Overwatch to incredible audience success. Overwatch already has over 15 million players, who have spent about 0.5 billion hours playing the game, and has achieved success throughout the world, including in China and Korea where Overwatch is now the #1 game in terms of share of playtime. 
We remain focused on the priorities that we have outlined to you before: building our audiences around the world, growing engagement by continuously investing in new content for our audiences, celebrating our players through initiatives like competitive gaming and making certain we continue to be a great place to work.

Our creative and commercial teams across our 5 operating divisions delivered a very strong first half of 2016 with broad-based record results.  To expand on what Bobby mentioned, our results are driven by focus and execution against our 3 strategic pillars: first, expanding our audiences; second, deepening engagement; and third, providing opportunities for more play investment. Let's start with audience reach, which was nearly 0.5 billion monthly active players in what is typically a seasonally softer quarter. 
In Q2, Blizzard had its highest MAUs in history, up 13% year-over-year and 29% quarter-over-quarter, driven by increases in players from Overwatch, World of Warcraft and Hearthstone. Important to take a step back and review Blizzard's continued growth over the past few years. Blizzard has doubled its number of franchises, expanding into new genres, business models and platforms. And as a result, they have doubled the size of their audience over a relatively short period of time. This performance is due to the strength of the team at Blizzard and their strategic focus on building epic entertainment experiences that capture the imagination of tens of millions of people globally. 
Overwatch has had incredible momentum and has now reached over 15  million players globally, achieving this milestone more quickly than any game in Blizzard's history. In China, Overwatch broke Diablo III's record as the fastest-selling PC game in the market's history. Additionally, Overwatch has claimed the #1 position in Korean IGRs with over 30% share of playtime. This global success has led to a roughly even player split between the East and West. 
World of Warcraft momentum continues to build ahead of the August launch of Legions. MAUs have seen double-digit growth both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, and Legion pre-purchases are tracking in line with the last expansion in 2014. In particular, we've had strong momentum in China following the launch of the Warcraft movie, which is now one of the highest-grossing Hollywood releases ever in China and the biggest game-based movie released worldwide. 
Activation MAUs were also a Q2 record and were up 11% year-over-year. This was largely driven by the continued strength of Call of Duty. Black Ops III continues to be the top-selling current-gen game life-to-date and, again, overperformed the prior year's game across every key metric: MAUs, full game sales, in-game content and engagement. 
Destiny also saw month-to-month growth in MAUs with the launch of our April update, the June announce of Destiny's next expansion, Rise of Iron. The continued hunger for great new content from this passionate community bodes well for the September launch of Rise of Iron. Digital prepurchases so far are very strong and tracking ahead of last year's Taken King. 
That leads me to our second strategic pillar. Once again, our compelling game worlds drove not only large communities but also deep engagement with nearly 10 billion hours of playtime during the second quarter. Blizzard's franchises continue to display the depths of gameplay that they are known for. As Bobby mentioned, players spent about 500 million hours playing Overwatch. Since launch, Blizzard has added a competitive playbook to the game in June and  new hero in mid-July and just introduced this week Summer Games content, which includes an exciting new soccer-like game mode. Both the new hero and Summer Games also added what was mainly guided as Loot Boxes that players can earn or purchase. In just the first day, we saw record engagement with the new Summer Games mode and its customization items. Blizzard is pleased with the strong adoption of all these releases and plans to continue adding new content and improving existing features to deliver a great ongoing experience to Overwatch players. 
Hearthstone had its highest MAUs and highest quarterly time spent in the game's history this quarter on the back of the launch of the Whispers of the Old Gods expansion. This deep engagement drove a double-digit revenue increase year-over-year. Just last week in the ChinaJoy, Blizzard announced its fourth adventure set for release on August 11. One Night in Karazhan, continues the Hearthstone's tradition of bringing a charming and accessible approach to some of the most popular Warcraft settings. As with our other adventures, players will be able to experience a single-player storyline and earn cards with a player-versus-player deck. 
The strong engagement around our franchises also serves our initiatives outside of our games. Our eSports and film and TV initiatives are not only a driver of audience expansion but drives deeper engagement, which will lead to longer franchise lives with greater profitability.
First, on eSports. Last year, BlizzCon had its highest live spring viewership ever with over 10 million people around the world tuning in, higher than the viewership for this year's NBA and MLB All-Star games. This November, Blizzard will be hosting its 10th BlizzCon. One of the biggest attractions there will be the culmination of the Road to BlizzCon tournaments with global champions across a number of franchises being crowned, including the champion for the just announced Overwatch World Cup. 
We've also made a lot of progress in the launch of our eSports network, Major League Gaming. MLG presented to advertisers the  NewFronts in New York in May where they showcased a significant new product innovation that provides an enhanced viewing experience, offering real-time statistics, leaderboards and insights based on the competition you're watching, making the viewing experience far more accessible and rich. MLG also announced a partnership with Facebook to broadcast live competition as well as to Esports Report, providing broad reach for our premium content. Since the acquisition in December, MLG's reach has increased by more than 700% on Facebook. MLG is also working closely with our internal teams to build out our eSports leagues and events for key franchises. MLG and the Call of Duty World League hosted the Anaheim Open in June and are preparing for the upcoming Orlando Open as well. 
With the growth of the Call of Duty World League, Call of Duty East West viewership has increased by more than 5x year-over-year to 33 million views of our Stage 1 event this year, and there are still major events to come, including the championships at Call of Duty XP this September, which we anticipate will be our most viewed Call of Duty eSports event in history by a wide margin. 
Our film and TV unit announced that the first 2 seasons of their first initiative, Skylanders Academy, have been sold to Netflix for global distribution. Skylanders Academy is an extremely high-quality animated TV show, coming on the heels of the release of our innovative new game this fall, Skylanders Imaginators, which was developed by the inventors of the toys' loved[ph] category, Toys for Bob. 
Now turning to our third pillar of our strategy: providing increased opportunities for player investment. This quarter, excluding deferrals, we drove a record $1 billion in digital in-game content sales, a rapidly growing part of our business. A big driver of that performance was King, which continued to drive large audiences of over 400 million monthly active users, who invest increasing amount in our games because of the incredibly compelling content King continues to deliver. As expected, due to seasonality and launch timing, King MAUs were down this quarter, but deeper engagement and play investment, in part due to the new initiatives around ongoing live operations and events, led again to Candy Crush franchise growth with gross bookings up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. King's time spent per MAU and average revenue per paying user across their network were both up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Mobile gross bookings for King also increased year-over-year. King has had at least 3 of the top 15 grossing games in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in the U.S. for 10 quarters in a row, showing the durability of top mobile franchises over time. King has also continued with its in-network advertising tests, which we expect to expand to Candy Crush later this year. The tests are critical to ensuring that engagement and value-added offers can be a virtuous cycle, as we've seen with new in-game content in our core games. We believe advertising is an attractive opportunity given the size and quality of King's network, and store testing is critical to ensure we preserve a high-quality play experience and player investment opportunities. 
Turning to our core game experiences. We see continued evidence of this virtuous cycle. Strong engagement leads to strong play investment, which, in turn, fuels strong engagement. Blizzard is a testimony to that. Record engagement in Q2 led to Blizzard's biggest revenue quarter ever. This strong performance was driven by Overwatch's successful launch, now with life-to-date franchise revenue, excluding deferral, at about $0.5 billion, World of Warcraft's strong pre-expansion momentum with Legion III purchases tracking in line with the previous expansion, and Hearthstone's double-digit revenue growth behind the successful launch of the Old Gods expansion. 
The teams at Activision and Bungie continue to successfully introduce new earned and purchased in-game content into Destiny. We have seen strong community response to this content with no reduction in engagement. 
Finally, Call of Duty has seen strong performance across-the-board.  In-game content purchases, including Season Pass, map packs and micro-transactions, continued to deliver at record levels for the franchise. In fact, on the back of the strength as well as strong catalog sales, the first half of the year was the best in terms of both non-GAAP operating income and revenue in the franchise's history. Activision also doubled the number of in-game purchases in Call of Duty with no degradation to average revenue per user. Most importantly, this was accomplished by actually improving overall engagement. 
The bold innovations in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare earned exceptionally positive media sentiment at E3, including being named Best Shooter by Game Informer and receiving 25 other awards and distinctions. 
Activision is taking a different approach to the Collector's Editions this year with the best bonus content we have ever offered, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered. The Legacy Edition and Digital Deluxe Edition offer an amazing value and incredible breadth and variety of gameplay. Infinite Warfare offers 3 full modes, which will deliver bold, new innovations for the franchise, and the beautiful Remastered Modern Warfare (sic) [ Modern Warfare Remastered ] will return fans to the classic gameplay of one of the most beloved games in history. It seems to be a winning combination since we are seeing as strong higher percentage of our preorders in our higher-value premium SKUs than ever before. 
While it's expected overall preorders are down versus last year, Activision is taking a different approach to the marketing cadence this year, which is more back loaded. This has allowed for increased focus on driving Black Ops III engagement, which, given the record first half of the year for the franchise, has been a fruitful strategy.  As a result, the majority of the assets for this year's launch, including Infinite Warfare's multiplayer reveal and hands-on, zombies reveal and hands-on and Modern Warfare Remastered multiplayer and hands-on are all yet to be revealed. This sets the stage for next month's Call of Duty XP, which will provide the perfect stage to showcase all of this incredible content to drive momentum as we enter the launch season and, of course, to celebrate Call of Duty's amazing fame. 
In summary, our strong performance in the first half of the year confirms that execution against our strategic pillars is paying off, and we have a great schedule of content for the balance of the year. Dennis?"

It's been an incredible first half of the year, and across nearly all parts of our business, we saw strong performance in the quarter. This performance further validates many of the important growth themes we've discussed around opportunities in mobile, digital, deeper player investment and our ability to launch new world-class intellectual property. 
Before we go into the results, as a reminder, we hosted a quick call last week to discuss changes to our external non-GAAP reporting in response to the SEC staff's updated interpretations, and I'd encourage you to review those materials if you haven't done so already. These interpretations affect external reporting for numerous companies but do not affect our strong underlying business fundamentals or cash flows. 
As we explained, starting this quarter, we will be sharing some new reporting metrics and we will continue to provide you with supplemental disclosure to help you calculate relevant metrics for year-over-year comparisons. Our disclosures can be found in the tables in our earnings press release and the Excel model posted to the IR website following this call. 
Turning to our Q2 results and highlights, we will now, for one last time, refer to our non-GAAP results, as we had previously defined them, excluding deferrals. We generated revenues of $1.61 billion in the quarter, $234 million above May guidance and $850 million or 112% above Q2 last year. We generated EPS of $0.54, $0.16 above guidance and $0.41 or 315% above Q2 last year. The overperformance versus guidance was composed of $0.04 of cost timing and $0.12 of business overperformance with the key drivers being the successful launch of our newest franchise, Overwatch, which is obviously off to a resounding start; continued momentum of the Call of Duty digital business; and continued growth of the Candy Crush franchise. 
In addition, digital momentum continued to be a strong business driver in Q2, producing record quarterly digital revenues and operating margins for the company. Digital revenues were $1.4 billion, growing 129% year-over-year and 76% quarter-over-quarter. And as Thomas mentioned, a remarkable $1 billion of this came from in-game content sales. Excluding King, digital revenues were also up a record, up over 50% year-over-year. 
Our digital performance drove operating margins to a Q2 record of 37%, up from 28% operating margin last quarter and 23% in Q2 of last year. So we have continued strong tailwinds on the digital front, which bodes well for the future across the business. 
Now let's take a look at the business results for each of our 3 segments. Let's start with Blizzard. The launch of Overwatch drove engagement to record highs, leading to their biggest revenue quarter ever with quarterly operating income that was nearly triple Q2 of last year. Blizzard also had its biggest quarter in China with a meaningful increase in revenues versus the previous high last year. World of Warcraft, Hearthstone and Overwatch success in Asia shows the depth of Blizzard's resonance in important growth markets. Overwatch was the fastest-selling PC game ever in China, and the Warcraft film had the biggest Hollywood launch ever in China as well. 
On the Activision front, the team delivered record MAUs and operating income for both Q2 and the first half of the year, driven by the continued strength of Call of Duty and, in particular, digital in-game content. 
Turning to King. The Candy Crush franchise continues to perform well, showing growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. King's Q2 segment operating income was also up quarter-over-quarter on a full quarter basis. 
With all that as a backdrop, let's now turn to our detailed financial results and to our updated external reporting format. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. Please note non-GAAP, redefined, includes deferrals. 
For the quarter, on a GAAP basis, we generated revenues of $1.57 billion, up 50% year-over-year, and operating margin of 15% and EPS of $0.17. 
For the quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, as redefined to include deferrals, we generated an operating margin of 31% and EPS of $0.45, up 45% year-over-year. 
Turning to the specific P&L items, please note that all percentages are based on revenues except for the tax rate. For Q2, GAAP product costs were 25%, operating expenses were 60% , interest expense was $65 million and our GAAP tax rate was 24%. 
Our GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average share count was 753 million shares, including participating securities. 
On a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, which includes deferrals, product costs were 25%, operating expenses were 45%, interest expense was $64 million and our non-GAAP tax rate was 18%. 
In terms of cash flow, in Q2, we generated strong cash flow with non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $511 million, up 37% year-over-year; operating cash flow of $479 million, up 255% year-over-year; and free cash flow of $435 million after CapEx, up 307% year-over-year with continued strong cash conversion. For the first half of the year, we delivered $788 million of operating cash flow, up 129% year-over-year and $717 million of free cash flow, up 143% year-over-year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. On the back of that strong cash flow performance, we ended June 30 with approximately $2.3 billion in cash and investments, of which roughly 1/3 was held domestically. We also paid down $816  million of our outstanding debt in the quarter, bringing the total paydown so far this year to $1.3 billion. We ended the quarter with $5.1 billion in aggregate debt outstanding. Please note that our $1.5 billion of 2021 notes become callable during the third quarter of 2016. In light of our recent upgrade to investment grade, we believe it will be advantageous to call the bonds and refinance that debt during the quarter. As such, we've included the call premium and estimated transaction costs in our GAAP guidance for Q3. 
On the dividend front, in Q2, we paid a $0.26 per share cash dividend or approximately $195 million in aggregate to shareholders of record as of March 30, 2016. 
So in summary, Q2 and our first half were an incredibly strong start to the year for the company and set us up well for the upcoming quarters and years ahead. 
Now let's turn to our slate and our outlook for Q3 and the full year 2016. Blizzard is launching Hearthstone's next adventure, One Night in Karazhan, next week and launching World of Warcraft's next expansion, Legion, globally on August 30. Activision is launching Destiny's Rise of Iron expansion on September 20 at a $30 price point, as well as a map pack for Call of Duty: Black Ops III in Q3. We expect Skylanders Imaginators to launch on October 16, followed by Skylanders Academy, an animated show which is expected to debut on Netflix. 
In Q4, Activision also plans to release the fourth map pack for Call of Duty: Black Ops III as well as Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare and Modern Warfare Remastered on November 4. 
King launched Farm Heroes Super Saga in the last few days of Q2 and has one more non-Candy Crush franchise release coming towards the end of the year, along with continued live operations across key games and franchises. 
For Q3 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.49 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $45 million; product costs of 23%; and operating expenses of 64%. We expect GAAP interest expense of $138 million, which includes the potential payment of a call premium and related debt refinancing costs; a GAAP tax rate of 18%; GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 760 million; and EPS of $0.06. 
For Q3 on a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we expect product costs of 23% and operating expenses of 47%. We expect a non-GAAP interest expense of $53 million, a tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.39, including a GAAP deferral of $0.01. Note that you can reference our accompanying materials for the FX rates we use in our guidance. 
Now let's turn to our full year 2016 numbers. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.4 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $75 million; product costs of 24%; and operating expenses of 58%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $311 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 18%, including tax rate impacts resulting from the adoption of the new accounting standard for simplification for share-based compensation. Please see our outlook tables in the earnings release for additional detail. 
We expect 765 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP redefined; and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.87, up $0.18 versus our previous guidance. 
As we said on our prior earnings calls, our GAAP earnings are expected to be down in 2016 versus prior year as our expected results will be impacted by additional accounting charges associated with the King transaction, which include, among other things, transaction-related adjustments, costs and amortization of intangibles resulting from purchase price accounting adjustments. The majority of these GAAP accounting charges will not impact the economics of our business or our cash flows, although they will have a material impact on our 2016 GAAP earnings results. 
For 2016 on a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we expect product costs of 24%, operating expenses of 44%, operating margin of 32% and a tax rate of 24%. Our non-GAAP interest expense is expected to be $223 million. 
Based on the information we disclosed in May, our non-GAAP redefined outlook was $1.64, including $0.14 of deferrals. We are now raising our non-GAAP redefined EPS outlook to $1.83, which includes $0.07 of GAAP deferrals. 
If you would like to calculate non-GAAP as previously defined revenues and EPS in order to do year-over-year comparisons, you would add the impact of GAAP deferrals to GAAP revenues and to non-GAAP redefined EPS using the numbers I just quoted. 
So in summary, our performance in Q2 and in the first half of the year once again proved our ability to achieve 3 important things: first, to launch new content that can appeal to millions of players around the world; second, to consistently keep our large audiences engaged as we offer them more frequent digital content and services to enhance their experiences; and third, to deliver solid financial results, which further sets us up for long-term success. As such, as a team, we are very pleased with our first half momentum and couldn't be more excited as we head into the back half of the year. 
Now I welcome our business leaders, Eric, Mike and Riccardo, as they join as for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?"

Thanks for the question. First, we're very pleased with Overwatch's launch results. I want to take this opportunity to thank all of our 15 million players around the world who've joined Overwatch so far. We really appreciate all their support and their incredible enthusiasm for the game. We've seen great momentum with the game across all the different engagement models, including digital and box sales, Korean Internet Game Rooms, which are time-based, and cosmetic content, which can be earned or purchased. As Thomas mentioned, altogether, the game has generated about $0.5 billion life-to-date, excluding deferrals. But more importantly, in the past 2 months since launch, we've already provided some great content to the Overwatch community, including a competitive play mode, a new hero, the recently launched Summer Games content, which drove record engagement yesterday, as well as customization items. So we're very excited about creating even more content for players moving forward. I also want to point out that while we had a great start with the game release, we really view this as just the beginning. We think we've created a strong, character-driven universe with big opportunities beyond just the game. We think Overwatch has strong potential as an eSport. The recently announced Overwatch World Cup, which will take place at BlizzCon this year, is a good first taste of that, but we'll talking more about our Overwatch eSports plans later in the year. We also look forward to telling more stories about the characters in the world of Overwatch through other media. You've seen some of this through the animated shorts and comics, but there's still more to come."

And this is really a testimony to the -- not only to the longevity, yes, but also to the strength of the brand. In terms of learnings, Pokemon Go has been very successful in expanding the mobile games audience. They have brought the large Pokemon fan base to mobile, and I believe this is very good for the whole gaming industry. What it has also proven is that when you pair innovation to very strong branded IP, there's a huge potential. And so I think this is actually very good and is a great opportunity for Activision Blizzard on mobile."

I'll take the questions. So first of all, on the quality, both of the games, both Infinite Warfare and Modern Warfare Remastered,  are really looking amazing, and we're very excited that we found a way to deliver both the break-through innovation that has been such an important part of Call of Duty's success over the years, as well as a return to the classic gameplay that people love so much in one amazing package at an incredible value. And that combination, that value, has really led to the performance that we're seeing in the preorders for both the Legacy Edition and the Digital Deluxe Edition, both of which are kind of registering far higher percentages for our higher-priced SKUs than we've ever seen before. So the way we think about it is that Modern Warfare Remastered is the best bonus content we've ever offered in  one of our Collector's Editions, and we think that's driving that player performance for both the Legacy Edition and the Digital Deluxe Edition. On Infinite Warfare specifically, the team of Vinnie Ward [ph] is just tremendously passionate about the game, and that passion is really showing through in how the game is closing. It's fresh. It's inventive. It looks great and it has a ton of new gameplay mechanics for the franchise. There's often initial skepticism when you push for bold innovations in the context of something that's so well established such as Call of Duty. But the good news is the more people are sitting at the game, the more they're getting really excited about it. We showed 8 uninterrupted moments of gameplay at E3, and that generated the highest positive sentiment from the usually hard-to-please gamer press that we've ever seen on the franchise at E3 since we've been measuring it. And we showed another 12 minutes of gameplay at Comic-Con and, again, got the highest positive sentiment from the press we've ever seen for Call of Duty at that event. The reason that's particularly good news is because people actually haven't seen that much of this game yet relative to previous years. As Thomas mentioned, we're taking a little bit of a different approach to marking this year centered around Call of Duty XP, and that bodes well for us to focus on Black Ops III, which helped us deliver that record first half of the year that Thomas mentioned, but it's also, along it, put all eyes on our launch titles in September at XP where we will have a pretty incredible list of reveals and first hands-on, including things like multiplayer in Infinite Warfare, multiplayer in Modern Warfare Remastered, the first Zombies mode in the main game that we've had in an entree or title with Infinite Warfare as well as more reveals on campaign as well. And for context, all of the modes had been revealed at this time last year. So we think we've got a winning combination. We think we've got a great game of Infinite Warfare and a second great game with Modern Warfare Remastered."

On a consolidated basis, we had a Q2 record 37% operating margin, which is non-GAAP, as previously defined. And in fact, Activision Publishing and Blizzard, those 2 segments combined were above that at 39% in terms of operating margin this past quarter. So you have and can see some of the sight lines to how we might get there and then try to sustain that over time. I'd probably call out maybe 3 things that are really key for that and that are going to be really important for us to get to those levels and to sustain them going forward. The first one is just scale. In our business, we have a large opportunity to drive upside once we recover the fixed spend that we have to bring our games and our content to market, being very focused on how we do that, and all the costs enable us to really scale those incremental margins as we do that. And it's the combination of those that, once you get past that fixed cost base, really drives margin accretion for every incremental sale that you have. The second part beyond scale is just digital growth, which really has 2 aspects. The first is just the trend that we're going to continue to see around the shift from retail to digital on full game sales, and that will continue. But even more importantly and a bigger driver, as you saw in Q2, is the deeper player investment that we see once we have players inside of our experience and new opportunities to add micro-transactions, advertising, other things into those experiences, which are all really contribution margin and accretive to the overall margin of the company. And then lastly, I'll just say as a competitive point relative to others, obviously owning our own IP is a huge factor in scaling those margins. That gives us a huge structural margin advantage relative to others and really gives us the flexibility to respond quickly as business models evolve. And we can -- it'll help us build long-term value around our margin structure. So I'd say those are probably the 3 things that are most important to driving that. Thanks for the question."

Besides testing, we are also hiring and we are hiring as selectively as we are hiring in the company. And we are hiring to bring the right experience to build this business for the long term.

And you think about the investment and the commitment that our players make in our games, this is a great way for us to really recognize, through organized competition, that investment. When you look at all the opportunities that present themselves, they're very franchise specific, there's a lot of work that needs to be done to get to a place where you have broad appeal watching, where you have the ability to broadcast content in an effective and successful way. And we are investing against all the various opportunities that we think eSports [indiscernible] with that. It's a longer-term vision for what we're trying to accomplish. There's a lot of investment that's still going to be required. Having said that, more people are spectating on video games than ever before. There are more opportunities for spectators than ever before. The live event competitions are providing greater prize pools, greater recognition, greater opportunities for players. And we think that this is one of the areas that'll present great opportunities for us for the long term. Getting from here to a place that will allow our franchises to resemble the NFL, the NBA and Major League Baseball is going to take some time, but I could tell you the best minds at the company, the people in this room are all committed to continuing the efforts that we've made, and I think we have a genuine belief that in all of eSports we've been the most successful. I think most of what you see is organized competition started out with Blizzard games a long time ago. And so we have a lot of belief and a lot of expectation at the promise that eSports will continue to be something that we will excel at."

Many of you may notice the voice reading you the safe harbor is a different voice than usual, and that's because Amrita is out on maternity leave and we're happy to say she had a beautiful baby a few weeks ago and she's doing well, but we're looking forward to her being back to a company, Colin, on the next call. 
We delivered another record quarter, and we continue to focus on building enduring franchises for our nearly 500 million monthly players around the world, continuous innovation within existing franchises and the creation of new franchises like Overwatch, helps broaden our audiences, deepening engagement and increase player investment. 
We believe gaming is the most engaging form of media and players spend tens of billions of hours a year with our franchises. In fact, this quarter alone, our players spent over 10 billion hours playing our games. This strong engagement and the social experiences is such an important part of game playing have a been the catalyst for our new opportunities in enhanced game monetization, expansion of our franchises into linear media and consumer products and greater involvement in advertising supported spectator gaming like we have with MLG. 
It's estimated that as many as 225 million people are now watching organized gaming competitions. Competitions between videogame players is becoming thrilling to watch as traditional professional sports. With the launch of Professional Global Leagues, we believe game spectating will grow significantly as an opportunity for us and for our players. The increased popularity of spectator gaming will enable us to celebrate and reward our players and recognize their accomplishments. Professional gamers will eventually be a celebrated, honored and recognized as professional athletes. 
Professional gamers will be the role models and goodwill ambassadors of the digital generation, and we believe great new business opportunities are emerging throughout the eSports ecosystem, which we helped pioneer more than a decade ago with games like StarCraft. 
In May, Blizzard released Overwatch, which in about 4 months, has already eclipsed 20 million registered players making it Blizzard’s fastest new intellectual property to reach that mark. And Overwatch was specifically designed to be the definitive competitive game. 
We're uniquely positioned to realize the full potential of eSports. We have a some of the most successful iconic franchises in gaming, and direct relationships with nearly 0.5 billion monthly active users, a powerful combination that distinguishes us from the rest of our competitors. And we have unmatched commercial capabilities that have served our shareholders extremely well over the last 25 years. 
Before I hand off the call, I want to take this opportunity to thank talented people who drive the success that our company every day, they are our greatest asset inspiring play, competition and community by creating the most engaging entertainment in the world. 
Thomas and Dennis will now share the details of our record quarter."

Thanks for the efforts of our creative and commercial teams, 2016 has continued to be a record-setting year. We overperformed our plan, delivering record third quarter revenues, up almost 60% and EPS more than doubling year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis. On the back of the strong momentum, we are raising our full year guidance once again. 
As we've discussed before, our results are driven by focus and execution against our 3 strategic pillars: First, expanding our audiences; second, deepening engagement; and third, providing opportunities for more play investment. Let's start with audience reach, which was nearly 0.5 billion monthly active players this quarter. 
In Q3, Blizzard had its highest MAUs in history, up 50% year-over-year and 25% over the previous record in Q2. This increase was driven, in particular, by Overwatch and World of Warcraft. Blizzard's MAUs has more than doubled from 2 years ago, thanks to compelling new content and the broadening of the portfolio to new franchises and new platforms, including mobile. 
World of Warcraft Legion launched on August 30 and has reenergized players worldwide. The expansion sold through 3.3 million copies on launch day, matching the all-time record achieved by previous expansions and making it one of the fastest-selling PC games ever. The exciting new Legion content led to an almost 30% quarter-over-quarter increase in MAUs, building on momentum established earlier in the year. 
Overwatch's strong momentum carried into the third quarter and it player base continue to grow. In fact, Overwatch became Blizzard’s faster game to reach 20 million players. Overwatch also continues to have strong global appeal with a roughly even player split between East and West and the #1 position in Korean IGRs from launch all the way through Q3. 
Hearthstone continues to add players and also had record MAUs this quarter, increasing by double-digit percentage year-over-year, thanks to great gameplay, regular content updates and accessibility across platforms, including mobile. 
Activision also had record Q3 MAUs driven by continued strength of Call of Duty and strong reengagement in Destiny. Activision has increased MAUs 18% over the last 2 year's on the back of a more focused yet broadly appealing slate of content. 
Call of Duty Black Ops III continues to be the best-selling current [indiscernible] life-to-date. And its follow-on content has led to continued strength in the player base with record franchise MAUs for the third quarter. 
Destiny's new expansion, Rise of Iron, released on September 20, addressed the passionate community eager for new content and drove an increase in MAUs quarter-over-quarter. 
Activision and talented partners at Bungie are hard at work on the sequel to Destiny, which should energize both Destiny's passion fan base and bring millions of new fans to the franchise next year. 
Turning to our second strategic pillar, deepening engagement. Each time we offer our players an opportunity to engage with our franchises, whether in or outside of gameplay, they respond passionately. These opportunities include not only additional in-game content, which drove over 10 billion hours of playtime in Q3 alone, but also out-of-game experiences, including eSports and fan events like Call of Duty XP and BlizzCon. 
An expanding player base and strong engagement across a number of franchises led to all-time Blizzard engagement record virtually across-the-board, including monthly, weekly and daily active users, unique users and playtime. This is a testament to the epic compelling content that Blizzard team has been creating. 
For World of Warcraft, Blizzard’s priority was the recent Legion expansion was to provide meaningful content and features that supported strong ongoing engagement. Blizzard has already released Legion's first patch, Return to Caravan, making it the fastest post expansion content patch in franchise history. In addition, Blizzard has offered players a new to interact with World of Warcraft by releasing a companion mobile app. For the first time, players can manage select in-game activities and continue their gameplay even whey they're away from their PC. Millions of players have already used the app and are logging in an average of 4 to 5x every day. 
eSports overall, continues to draw large and growing audiences and our Major League Gaming division keeps innovating to celebrate the best players and most exciting gameplay. During the quarter, MLG held tournament events for Call of Duty, Gears of War Destiny and World of Warcraft developing deep industry relationships. Our eSports support and premium content recorded about 50 million video views on Facebook, growing 67% quarter-over-quarter and reached a record 11 million users in a single day. In our games, our proprietary video player and game ballots will soon be integrated with Call of Duty Infinite Warfare and will allow fans easy access to Call of Duty [indiscernible] and professional the as well as amateur competitions. 
We're also looking forward to the MLG Las Vegas event held over 3 days in December, which will feature the first Call of Duty World League event for Infinite Warfare and an Overwatch invitational. eSports also feature prominently at this weekend's BlizzCon, which, again, sold out in minutes with millions more expected to join the action through live streaming or virtual tickets. Over 200 top players from around the world will compete in global finals across 5 Blizzard franchises. The participants started off matchplay last week and the unprecedented 8 days of competition will culminate and will promises to be a weekend of epic sports action. This year's event, which marks the 10th BlizzCon and commemorates Blizzard’s 25th anniversary, will also feature community event and contests, hand-on-play with Blizzard games, discussion panels throughout developers and audience and more. It's going to be a very exciting weekend, and we look for to seeing some of you there. 
Also during the quarter, Activision held Call of Duty XP, their largest fan event ever. The event showcased the passion and commitment of Call of Duty fans with the franchise broadly and for Call of Duty World League eSports event as well. More than 1,000 teams participated in the Call of Duty World League during the 2016 season, which recorded 121 million views. 
We also launched our first TV show, Skylanders Academy on Netflix. It is the first initiative for our film and TV division and offers a brand-new way for fans to interact with our franchises. We think the combination of the TV series and opportunity to create your very own Skylanders is part of our recently launched games Skylanders Imaginators is a compelling one for kids around the world. 
And finally, we recently announced a new live-action game show based on the Candy Crush franchise to be distributed domestically by SBS and internationally by Lion's Gate. This is just one more example of the strength of our IP and engagement and our franchises outside of core gameplay. These additional opportunities to engage also reinforce our franchises with our existing players and introduces them to potentially new players. 
Turning next to the third pillar of our strategy, providing opportunities for more player investment. Our [indiscernible] digital connection to our players, development of new analytical capability and new business models all support our efforts to offer great content to our players to invest in. Digital in-game content increased to another record this quarter. Actual in-game digital player purchases were a record at more than $1 billion of this quarter and a record $2.8 billion year-to-date. This was driven by broad-based strength, including record participation in World of Warcraft value-added services. 
In Overwatch, customization items continue to perform well, thanks to a consistent flow of new content, including time-limited seasonal events. Summer Games, Overwatch's first seasonal event, spent several weeks in August and drove record engagement as well as record participation in the advanced unique in-game customization items. In October, Blizzard unveiled its Halloween Terror event, which included Overwatch's first-ever play versus environment mode and players responded with even higher engagement and participation. Also Hearthstone released a new adventure in the quarter, One Night in Karazhan, which performed even better than the last adventure. 
Turning to King whose top franchises continues to perform well despite slightly lower MAUs this quarter. The Candy Crush franchise continued its momentum of increased gross bookings year-over-year. 
Farm Heroes, King's second-largest franchise, also increased mobile gross bookings year-over-year driven by a launch of Farm Heroes Super Saga. 
Strength in top titles led to growth in mobile overall, with mobile gross bookings up year-over-year. Time spent per user and average revenue per paying user also increased year-over-year showing strong engagement from King's core players, in fact, King continues to have 3 of the top 20 grossing games in the U.S. for now the 11th limited quarter in a row. King has also made progress against its ever tightening initiatives and large opportunity given the size of King's player community, and its strong engagement. We have now been testing advertising in Candy for close to 3 months, and we are progressing well against our internal milestones. We continue to believe this can be a positive contributor to EPS starting in 2017 and scaling up into 2018. 
For Activision, in-game revenue was driven by Destiny's expansion as well as Call of Duty, which continues to deliver record performance for the quarter and the year. Year-to-date, the number of purchases with Call of Duty in-game content grew more than 100% and along with robust participation Season Pass and à la carte [indiscernible] drove an increase in average revenue per user as well. It's also exciting time for Activision as Call of Duty Infinite Warfare is set to release tomorrow. It's both new settings has opened up numerous meaningful innovations for gameplay, paid with a classic feel that Call of Duty is known for. And with 3 modes, including campaign, multiplayer and zombies, it is a complete package for every type of fan. Also included in Call of Duty Infinite Warfare's Legacy edition is the ultimate bonus content, Modern Warfare Remastered. The game has been faithfully updated for current gen to look better than ever based on the excitement around Modern Warfare remastered and the preorders, we expect to sell a higher percentage of our higher value premium SKUs than ever before. 
So in summary, our record performance year-to-date has confirmed that execution against our strategic pillars is paying off and will set us up for success in the holiday quarter and beyond. And now, I hand it over to Dennis."
4222231,404017948,1072753,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Thomas. Q3 was another great quarter as we continue to see strong performance across our broad portfolio of leading franchises. Before we go into results, as we mentioned on our Q2 call, we have made changes to how we report non-GAAP financials. A",1934,"Thanks, Thomas. Q3 was another great quarter as we continue to see strong performance across our broad portfolio of leading franchises. Before we go into results, as we mentioned on our Q2 call, we have made changes to how we report non-GAAP financials. As reminder, our non-GAAP results no longer exclude the impact of deferrals. If you would like to calculate metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals to our non-GAAP as redefined figures. Our segment results, however, are still presented, excluding the impact of deferrals like they always have been. This aligns with how Bobby, our management team and our board continues to review the business and our overall performance. With that backdrop, I'd like to first start with our segments as they are the engine behind our consolidated financial results. 
Starting with Activision. On the back of strong Call of Duty engagement and the successful launch of Destiny's Rise of Iron in September, Activision delivered record Q3 operating income of $123 million and also achieved record year-to-date operating income of $309 million, up 27% versus last year. Blizzard delivered Q3 segment revenues of $727 million, which were nearly doubled last year's Q3 performance. This also helped fuel record third quarter segment operating income of $321 million, which is up 2.5x versus Q3 of last year. And year-to-date Blizzard segment revenue of $1.8 billion is up 59% versus last year and operating income of $740 million is up 93% versus last year. 
I want to pause here for a second and mention that just the Activision Blizzard segments, so including King, also set a Q3 and year-to-date record for our combined segment revenue and operating income. Notably, this performance drove year-over-year organic growth for Activision and Blizzard segments of 15% for the quarter and 22% year-to-date. Operating income grew even faster year-over-year, increasing 78% for the quarter and 67% year-to-date. 
Turning to King. As expected, revenues were down slightly quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. But as Thomas noted, importantly, the Candy Crush franchise and mobile overall went well [ph] with bookings growth year-over-year. King's operating income was down this quarter, mainly due to marketing cost related to the launch of Farm Heroes Super Saga as well we are investments remaking in our promising advertising business. 
Let's now turn to our consolidated results and raised outlook for the full year of 2016. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP as redefined measures. Please to our earnings release for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. 
For the quarter, we generated record Q3 GAAP revenues of $1.57 billion, $78 million above our August guidance and $578 million, or 58% above Q3 last year. The net effect of deferred revenue was $62 million for the quarter and also above guidance of $45 million. We generated GAAP EPS of $0.26. That is $0.20 above guidance, of which $0.10 related to timing of our call premium, which I'll discuss in more detail later when I cover the balance sheet. 
We generated record Q3 non-GAAP as redefined EPS of $0.49, $0.10 above guidance and more than doubled the $0.20 we generated in Q3 of last year. The impact of deferrals on non-GAAP as redefined, EPS, was $0.03 and above guidance of $0.01. The overperformance in the quarter versus guidance was driven by multiple factors, including Overwatch full game sales and in-game content, the strong performance of the World of Warcraft Legion expansion, as well as the continued strength in Call of Duty in-game content. 
Turning to specific P&L items. Please note that all percentages are based on revenues, except for the tax rate. For Q3, GAAP product cost were 22%, operating expenses were 59%. Interest expense was $63 million, including a $10 million GAAP loss upon refinancing of our term loans and our GAAP tax rate was 14%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average share count was 758 million shares, including participating securities. 
On a non-GAAP basis as redefined, product costs were 22%, operating expenses were 43%, interest expense was $52 million and our non-GAAP tax rate was 24%. For the year-to-date, on a GAAP basis, we generated record revenues of $4.59 billion, up 39% year-over-year and operating margin of 21%, and EPS of $0.94. On a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we generated operating margin of 36% and record EPS of $1.52, up 45% year-over-year. 
Digital momentum continued to be a strong business driver for yet another quarter, producing record Q3 digital revenues of $1.3 billion, growing 114% year-over-year and 18% quarter-over-quarter. As Thomas mentioned, nearly $1 billion of this came from in-game content sales alone and year-to-date, digital player purchases were a record $2.8 billion. 
Our strong overall digital performance drove non-GAAP operating margins to Q3 record of 35%, up from 23% operating margin in Q3 of last year. The continued strength in digital provides not only a source of growth for our business, but also will continue to benefit future operating margins as well as cash flow performance. 
In terms of cash flow, our strong business performance has led to record cash flow generation. In addition, our ability to directly engage our customers with continued content updates has helped shift our business to more recurring and less seasonal revenue streams with Q3 and year-to-date records for EBITDA as well as operating and free cash flow. This quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $456 million, and free cash flow of $428 million after capital expenditures. Year-to-date, we delivered $1.3 billion of operating cash flow and $1.2 billion of free cash flow, both up dramatically year-over-year. Q3 non-GAAP, as redefined, adjusted EBITDA of $574 million was up 131% year-over-year. 
Turning to the balance sheet. I'd like to start with a quick summary of the positive refinancing activity we completed this quarter. In August, we restructured our term loans, which not only allowed us relies interest rate savings but move us to a completely unsecured capital structure, which is more consistent with our investment grade rating. In addition, our positive credit rating trajectory continue to improve with yet another 1 notch upgrade for Moody's. This was our second upgrade from Moody's in less than 12 months on the back of our spring upgrade from S&P. All of these has served tailwind as we head into our debut investment great debt offering, which we completed on September 19. We issued new 5- and 10-year notes, which will replaced our existing 2021 notes. Subsequent to closing, we exercised our call right on our 2021 notes, which had a 30-day notice period. Because of this, our Q3 balance sheet reflects a temporary increase in both cash and debt as the call notice to redeem our legacy 2021 notes rattled the quarter end. Subsequent to quarter end, on October 19, we redeemed our legacy 2021 notes inclusive of the call premium, which reduced both our cash and debt positions by approximately $1.5 bilk. Also, please note that the call premium expense drove a $0.10 timing difference between Q3 and Q4 versus our guidance for GAAP EPS. This will not impact the full year and is merely a shift from Q3 to Q4 for GAAP only based on the settlement date. 
We are very pleased with reception of our new investment-grade notes and the overall progress we have on our capital structure since we first issued debt as part of the buyback transaction 3 years ago. To put that progress in perspective, our gross debt levels are nearly equivalent to when we first issued debt in 2013 but since then, we have paid down more than $2.1 billion of debt, added King to our portfolio, moved to a fully unsecured investment great capital structure and decreased our blended cost of debt under 3%, thanks, our strong performance and improved credit rating, the great progress on this front as well. 
Regarding liquidity and cash, as adjusted for the subsequent $1.5 billion redemption of our legacy 2021 notes in October, we had approximately $2.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet with over $600 million held domestically. 
Now let's turn to look forward to our outlook for Q4 and full year quarter 2016. For Q4, on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.86 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $522 million, product costs of 27%, and operating expenses of 61%. We expect GAAP interest expense of $129 million. GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 765 million and EPS of $0.05. For Q4 on a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we expect product costs of 27% and operating expenses of 47%. We expect the non-GAAP interest expense of $45 million, a tax rate of 30% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.40, including GAAP deferrals of $0.34. 
Now let's take a look at our full year 2016 outlook. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.45 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $75 million. Product costs of 24% and operating expenses of 57%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $313 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 17%, including tax rate impact resulting from the adoption of the new accounting standards for simplification per share-based compensation. We expect 762 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP redefined and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.98, up $0.11 versus our previous guidance. 
As we said on prior earnings calls, our GAAP earnings are expected to be down in 2016 versus prior year as our expected results will be impacted by additional accounting charges associated with the King transaction, which include, among other things, transaction-related costs and the amortization of intangibles resulting from purchase price accounting adjustments. The majority of these GAAP accounting charges will not impact the economics of our business or our cash flows, although they will have a material impact on our 2016 GAAP earnings results. 
For 2016, on the non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we expect product costs of 24% and operating expenses of 43%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $213 million, a tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.92, up $0.09 from our previous guidance, including a GAAP deferral of $0.10, which is $0.03 higher than our previous guidance. 
Again, if you would like to about it non-GAAP as we previously defined it, revenues and EPS, you would simply add the impact of GAAP deferrals to GAAP revenues and to non-GAAP redefined EPS using the numbers I just quoted. 
So on the back of our strong business momentum, from an EPS perspective, we're essentially passing all of our Q3 overperformance for the full year in actuals and increased deferrals, whereas for revenue we're passing through roughly half of the Q3 beat largely due to small variations and FX rates versus our last guidance, particularly in Europe. Please see our press release for current FX assumptions. 
In summary, as you can see, 2016 is shaping up to be a record year on the back of strong performance across our diversed franchise portfolio. Our underlying business fundamentals remain incredibly strong with our direct digital consumer connection, towering deeper engagement and more opportunities for player investment in our franchises than ever before. In addition, we have great call options on promising long-term opportunities like eSports, advertising and consumer products. 
So it's a great time to be in our business with so much opportunity in front of us. As always, we will continue to attack each other opportunity with an emphasis on world-class execution and business excellence across all aspects of our organization. 
Now I welcome our business leaders, Eric, Mike and Riccardo, as they join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?"

And first, I'd probably add one thing to your list which is probably biggest the near-term opportunity, which is additional in-game content. As you've seen in our numbers, we've seen incredible growth in this area over the past several years, but we really think we're still only in the early stages here. And if you can do it right, and not only drive additional player investment, it can also drive additional engagement as we deliver content affiants were frequently and consistently as we saw in Q3. So this is really an enormous opportunity just based on current engagement that we have across our portfolio. We're also excited about many of the opportunities that you mentioned. We are making good progress in our advertising business with King. And as Thomas mentioned earlier, we expected to contribute next year and scale up in 2018. We're off every the to start with our first TV show, Skylanders Academy, which just launched next week on Netflix, extremely high-quality and is nice progress in that initiative. And as you heard Bobby say at the beginning of the call, we're incredibly excited about eSports and the opportunities we have in this space given our strong and known IP portfolio. You only have to look as far as BlizzCon this weekend to sort of see that in action. And this longer term is an enormous opportunity for the company. So across all these areas, we'll continue to manage our investments with the same discipline and prudent in all parts of our business but undoubtedly more opportunity in front us than we've ever had before."

We worked very hard to make Legion our best expansion, and we're pleased and gratified by the player reaction so far. We no longer report subscribers but as Thomas mentioned, our MAUs were up 30% quarter-over-quarter and that builds on the momentum we saw earlier in the year. In terms of Legion performance, it has matched or exceeded our prior expansion launch performance across metrics like sales, player base and participation in value-added services. So we're very excited to see how players are reacting and engaging in new content, including our new Legion mobile companion app. We're seeing players spend their time across a whole variety of activities and with all the content that's available to them, hope will have a lot to do for a long time. It is a big priority to us to continue to provide new content to Legion players. Last week, we released our first content patch for Legion, less than 2 months after the launch. This is the fastest that we've added a new major patch to overall World of Warcraft expansion in the game's history, and it's also bigger than the initial content patch that we released for the last few expansion. Our players have reacted very positively so far. And we're looking forward to furthering the momentum that Legion has generated, into BlizzCon, the holidays and beyond and following up with more content next year."

We put together a very smart approach that will allow us to deliver that steady stream of great content to keep our players engaged and keep the universe sort of alive and growing in the wake of that sequel."

And as we noted, while we see that we saw slight decline in MAUs quarter-on-quarter, the mobile gross bookings had grown or we managed to grow gross bookings year-on-year. And very importantly, the Candy Crush saga franchise overall gross bookings also grew year-on-year. This is the result of hard work from the teams in the last titles, focusing on creating fresh new content, both through live operations, as we described in the past, and through launching new features. So this has resulted in #1, in increased engagement and time spent for player has grown year-on-year, it's now over 30 minutes per day. And secondly, we had increased also the monetization per player. The average revenues per paying player have increased substantially year-on-year. So looking forward, the plan is to continue with the investment in the live games, creating more content, both through live ops and features. So we expect to focus not only, and have an impact, not only on retention of players, but also monetization. So both monetization and retention are key targets for those expansions. And secondly, we are also focusing on new games. We have a pipeline of new franchise titles to attract new and last players, and we have one game in final stages of polish. It's shaping up well, and it's slated for a Q1 release."

First of all, I think it's obviously too early to make any comments on our annual recent title release yet within [indiscernible] but I think that it's important that we think about Call of Duty as a year-round business, which is designed to have a steady stream of content throughout the year to keep our players engage. And obviously, our annual release, which is part of that engagement driving strategy. But when you do our jobs right on this franchise, we managed to keep people engaged year-around and easily have definitely achieved that with record operating income, which Thomas mentioned for the franchise year-to-date. And I think probably the best company with also a record in monthly active users. so in this case, engagement and the business are going hand in hand, and helping one another. So on the annual release, as you know, we've modeled Warcraft because a new sub-brand down versus Black Ops III, which our best established sub-brand that only makes sense given our historical patters, but we think that you've delivered a great game other things can to get the great over the holiday quarter. Huge innovation for fans keeping a franchise that's been on top of personalized Call of Duty has fresh ever year is no easy task and definitely done that with Infinite Warfare, which is a ton of new experiences and game time mechanics for plans while also feeling giving that classic Call of Duty feel that our fans loved. Second, Thomas mentioned, we think it's the most complete entertainment package in the industry. We've got a full campaign, the multiplayer builds up on one of the stickiest and most played multiplayer games in the world. And it's the first time that we've had people Zombies mode on the disc, the main release in a non-layer title there's a lot of things appreciate that. And of course, we have Modern Warfare remastered for those who want the classic Call of Duty gameplay with the best bonus content ever in our collector's edition, so overall, we feel really good about both the quality and the breadth and a variety of the content that we are putting in the marketplace. With people are going to have a strong quarter."

But we're looking forward to her being back to accompany Colin on the next call.
We delivered another record quarter, and we continue to focus on building enduring franchises for our nearly 500 million monthly players around the world. Continuous innovation within existing franchises and the creation of new franchises like Overwatch helps broaden our audiences, deepen engagement and increase player investment.
We believe gaming is the most engaging form of media, and players spend tens of billions of hours a year with our franchises. In fact, this quarter alone, our players spent over 10 billion hours playing our games. This strong engagement and the social experiences that are such an important part of gameplaying have been the catalyst for our new opportunities in enhanced game monetization, expansion of our franchises into linear media and consumer products and greater involvement in advertising-supported spectator gaming like we have with MLG.
It's estimated that as many as 225 million people are now watching organized gaming competitions. Competition between video gameplayers is becoming as thrilling to watch as traditional professional sports. With the launch of professional global leagues, we believe game spectating will grow significantly as an opportunity for us and for our players.
The increased popularity of spectator gaming will enable us to celebrate and reward our players and recognize their accomplishments. Professional gamers will eventually be celebrated, honored and recognized as professional athletes.
Professional gamers will be the role models and goodwill ambassadors of the digital generation, and we believe great new business opportunities are emerging throughout the eSports ecosystem, which we helped pioneer more than a decade ago with games like StarCraft.
In May, Blizzard released Overwatch, which, in about 4 months, has already eclipsed 20 million registered players, making it Blizzard’s fastest new intellectual property to reach that mark. And Overwatch was specifically designed to be the definitive competitive game.
We're uniquely positioned to realize the full potential of eSports. We have some of the most successful iconic franchises in gaming and direct relationships with nearly 0.5 billion monthly active users, a powerful combination that distinguishes us from the rest of our competitors. And we have unmatched commercial capabilities that have served our shareholders extremely well over the last 25 years.
Before I hand off the call, I want to take this opportunity to thank the talented people who drive to success at our company every day. They are our greatest asset, inspiring play, competition and community by creating the most engaging entertainment in the world.
Thomas and Dennis will now share the details of our record quarter."

Thanks for the efforts of our creative and commercial teams, 2016 has continued to be a record-setting year. We overperformed our plan, delivering record third quarter revenues, up almost 60%, and EPS more than doubling year-over-year on",1744,"Thank you, Bobby. Thanks for the efforts of our creative and commercial teams, 2016 has continued to be a record-setting year. We overperformed our plan, delivering record third quarter revenues, up almost 60%, and EPS more than doubling year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis. On the back of this strong momentum, we are raising our full year guidance once again.
As we've discussed before, our results are driven by focus and execution against our 3 strategic pillars: first, expanding our audiences; second, deepening engagement; and third, providing opportunities for more player investment.
Let's start with audience reach, which was nearly 0.5 billion monthly active players this quarter. In Q3, Blizzard had its highest MAUs in history, up 50% year-over-year and 25% over the previous record in Q2. This increase was driven in particular by Overwatch and World of Warcraft. Blizzard's MAUs have more than doubled from 2 years ago, thanks to compelling new content and a broadening of the portfolio to new franchises and new platforms, including mobile.
World of Warcraft Legion launched on August 30 and has reenergized players worldwide. The expansion sold through 3.3 million copies on launch day, matching the all-time record achieved by previous expansions and making it one of the fastest-selling PC games ever. The exciting new Legion content led to an almost 30% quarter-over-quarter increase in MAUs, building on momentum established earlier in the year.
Overwatch's Strong momentum carried into the third quarter and its player base continues to grow. In fact, Overwatch became Blizzard's fastest game ever to reach 20 million players. Overwatch also continues to have strong global appeal with a roughly even player split between East and West and the #1 position in Korean IGRs from launch all the way through Q3.
Hearthstone continues to add players and also had record MAUs this quarter, increasing by double-digit percentage year-over-year, thanks to great gameplay, regular content updates and accessibility across platforms, including mobile. 
Activision also had record Q3 MAUs, driven by continued strength of Call of Duty and strong reengagement in Destiny. Activision has increased MAUs 18% over the last 2 years on the back of a more focused yet broadly appealing slate of content.
Call of Duty: Black Ops III continues to be the best-selling current chain [ph] game life-to-date. And its follow-on content has led to continued strength in the player base with record franchise MAUs for the third quarter.
Destiny's new expansion, Rise of Iron, released on September 20, addressed the passionate community eager for new content and drove an increase in MAUs quarter-over-quarter.
Activision and our talented partners at Bungie are hard at work on a sequel to Destiny, which should energize both Destiny's passionate fan base and bring millions of new fans to the franchise next year.
Turning to our second strategic pillar, deepening engagement. Each time we offer our players an opportunity to engage with our franchises, whether in or outside of gameplay, they respond passionately. These opportunities include not only additional in-game content, which drove over 10 billion hours of play time in Q3 alone but also out-of-game experiences, including eSports and fan events like Call of Duty XP and BlizzCon.
An expanding player base and strong engagement across a number of franchises led to all-time Blizzard engagement records virtually across the board, including monthly, weekly and daily active users, unique users and play time. This is a testament to the epic compelling content that Blizzard team has been creating.
For World of Warcraft, Blizzard's priority with the recent Legion expansion was to provide meaningful content and features that supported stronger ongoing engagement. Blizzard has already released Legion's first patch, Return to Caravan, making it the fastest post-expansion content patch in franchise history.
In addition, Blizzard has offered players a new way to interact with World of Warcraft by releasing a companion mobile app. For the first time, players can manage select in-game activities and continue their gameplay even when away from their PC. Millions of players have already used the app and are logging in an average of 4 to 5x every day.
eSports overall continues to draw large and growing audiences and our Major League Gaming division keeps innovating to celebrate the best players and most exciting gameplay. During the quarter, MLG held tournament events for Call of Duty, Gears of War, Destiny and World of Warcraft, developing deep industry relationships.
Our eSports support and premium content recorded about 50 million video views on Facebook, growing 67% quarter-over-quarter and reached a record 11 million users in a single day. In our games, our proprietary video player and game battles will soon be integrated with Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare and will allow fans easy access to Call of Duty World League in its professional play as well as amateur competitions.
We're also looking forward to the MLG Las Vegas event held over 3 days in December, which will feature the first Call of Duty World League event for Infinite Warfare and an Overwatch invitational. eSports is also featured prominently at this weekend's BlizzCon, which, again, sold out in minutes with millions more expected to join the action through live streaming or virtual tickets. Over 200 top players from around the world will compete in global finals across 5 Blizzard franchises. The participants started off match play last week, and the unprecedented 8 days of competition will culminate and we promise this to be a weekend of epic sports action.
This year's event, which marks the 10th BlizzCon and commemorates Blizzard's 25th anniversary, will also feature community events and contests, hands-on play and -- hands-on play with previous releases of Blizzard games, discussion panels with developers and artists and more. It's going to be a very exciting weekend, and we look for to seeing some of you there.
Also during the quarter, Activision held Call of Duty XP, their largest fan event ever. The event showcased the passion and commitment of Call of Duty fans with the franchise broadly [ph] and for Call of Duty World League eSports events as well. More than 1,000 teams participated in the Call of Duty World League during the 2016 season, which recorded 121 million views. 
We also launched our first TV show, Skylanders Academy on Netflix. It is the first initiative for our film and TV division and offers a brand-new way for fans to interact with our franchises. We think the combination of the TV series and opportunity to create your very own Skylanders, as part of our recently launched game, Skylanders Imaginators, is a compelling one for kids around the world.
And finally, we recently announced a new live-action game show based on the Candy Crush franchise to be distributed domestically by CBS and internationally by Lionsgate. This is just one more example of the strength of our IP and engagement with our franchises outside of core gameplay. These additional opportunities to engage also reinforce our franchises with our existing players and introduces them to potentially new players.
Turning next to the third pillar of our strategy, providing opportunities for more player investment. Our direct digital connection to our players, development of new analytical capabilities and new business models all support our efforts to offer great content to our players to invest in. Digital in-game content increased to another record this quarter. Actual in-game digital player purchases were a record at more than $1 billion this quarter and a record $2.8 billion year-to-date. This was driven by broad-based strength, including record participation in World of Warcraft value-added services.
In Overwatch, customization items continue to perform well, thanks to a consistent flow of new content, including time-limited seasonal events. Summer Games, Overwatch's first seasonal event, spent several weeks in August and drove record engagement as well as record participation in the event's unique in-game customization items. In October, Blizzard unveiled its Halloween Terror event, which included Overwatch's first-ever player versus environment mode, and players responded with even higher engagement and participation. Also, Hearthstone released a new adventure in the quarter, One Night in Karazhan, which performed even better than the last adventure.
Turning to King, whose top franchises continues to perform well despite slightly lower MAUs this quarter. The Candy Crush franchise continued its momentum of increased gross bookings year-over-year. Farm Heroes, King's second-largest franchise, also increased mobile gross bookings year-over-year, driven by the launch of Farm Heroes Super Saga.
Strength in top titles led to growth in mobile overall, with mobile gross bookings up year-over-year. Time spent per user and average revenue per paying user also increased year-over-year, showing strong engagement from King's core players. In fact, King continues to have 3 of the top 20 grossing games in the U.S. for now the 11th limited quarter in a row.
King has also made progress against its advertising initiatives and large opportunity given the size of King's player community and its strong engagement. We have now been testing advertising in Candy for close to 3 months, and we are progressing well against our internal milestones. We continue to believe this can be a positive contributor to EPS starting in 2017 and scaling up into 2018.
For Activision, in-game revenue was driven by Destiny's expansion as well as Call of Duty, which continues to deliver record performance for the quarter and the year. Year-to-date, the number of purchases of Call of Duty in-game content grew more than 100% and along with robust participation in Season Pass and à la carte Map Packs, drove an increase in average revenue per user as well.
It also is an exciting time for Activision as Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare is set to release tomorrow. It's bold new setting has opened up numerous meaningful innovations for gameplay, paired with a classic feel that Call of Duty is known for. And with 3 modes, including campaign, multiplayer and zombies, it is a complete package for every type of fan. Also included in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare's Legacy Edition is the ultimate bonus content, Modern Warfare Remastered. The game has been faithfully updated for current gen to look better than ever. Based on the excitement around Modern Warfare Remastered and the preorders, we expect to sell a higher percentage of our higher-value premium SKUs than ever before.
So in summary, our record performance year-to-date has confirmed that execution against our strategic pillars is paying off and will set us up for success in the holiday quarter and beyond. And now, I hand it over to Dennis."
4222231,404017948,1073178,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Thomas. Q3 was another great quarter as we continue to see strong performance across our broad portfolio of leading franchises. Before we go into results, as we mentioned on our Q2 call, we have made changes to how we report non-GAAP financials. A",1941,"Thanks, Thomas. Q3 was another great quarter as we continue to see strong performance across our broad portfolio of leading franchises. Before we go into results, as we mentioned on our Q2 call, we have made changes to how we report non-GAAP financials. As reminder, our non-GAAP results no longer exclude the impact of deferrals. If you would like to calculate metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals to our non-GAAP as redefined figures.
Our segment results, however, are still presented, excluding the impact of deferrals like they always have been. This aligns with how Bobby, our management team and our board continues to review the business and our overall performance. With that backdrop, I'd like to first start with our segments as they are the engine behind our consolidated financial results.
Starting with Activision. On the back of strong Call of Duty engagement and the successful launch of Destiny's Rise of Iron in September, Activision delivered record Q3 operating income of $123 million and also achieved record year-to-date operating income of $309 million, up 27% versus last year. Blizzard delivered Q3 segment revenues of $727 million, which were nearly double last year's Q3 performance. This also helped fuel record third quarter segment operating income of $321 million, which is up 2.5x versus Q3 of last year. And year-to-date Blizzard segment revenue of $1.8 billion is up 59% versus last year and operating income of $740 million is up 93% versus last year.
I want to pause here for a second and mention that, just the Activision Blizzard segments, so excluding King, also set a Q3 and year-to-date record for our combined segment revenue and operating income. Notably, this performance drove year-over-year organic growth for Activision and Blizzard segments of 15% for the quarter and 22% year-to-date. Operating income grew even faster year-over-year, increasing 78% for the quarter and 67% year-to-date.
Turning to King. As expected, revenues were down slightly quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. But as Thomas noted, importantly, the Candy Crush franchise and mobile overall performed well with bookings growth year-over-year. King's operating income was down this quarter, mainly due to marketing costs related to the launch of Farm Heroes Super Saga as well investments we are making in our promising advertising business.
Let's now turn to our consolidated results and raised outlook for the full year of 2016. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP as redefined measures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.
For the quarter, we generated record Q3 GAAP revenues of $1.57 billion, $78 million above our August guidance and $578 million or 58% above Q3 last year. The net effect of deferred revenue was $62 million for the quarter and also above guidance of $45 million. We generated GAAP EPS of $0.26. That is $0.20 above guidance, of which $0.10 is related to the timing of our call premium, which I will discuss in more detail later when I cover the balance sheet.
We generated record Q3 non-GAAP as redefined EPS of $0.49, $0.10 above guidance and more than double the $0.20 we generated in Q3 of last year. The impact of deferrals on non-GAAP as redefined EPS was $0.03 and above guidance of $0.01. The overperformance in the quarter versus guidance was driven by multiple factors, including Overwatch full game sales and in-game content, the strong performance of the World of Warcraft Legion expansion, as well as the continued strength in Call of Duty in-game content.
Turning to the specific P&L items. Please note that all percentages are based on revenues, except for the tax rate. For Q3, GAAP product cost were 22%, operating expenses were 59%. Interest expense was $63 million, including a $10 million GAAP loss upon refinancing of our term loan and our GAAP tax rate was 14%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average share count was 758 million shares, including participating securities.
On a non-GAAP basis as redefined, product costs were 22%, operating expenses were 43%, interest expense was $52 million and our non-GAAP tax rate was 24%. For the year-to-date, on a GAAP basis, we generated record revenues of $4.59 billion, up 39% year-over-year and operating margin of 21%, and EPS of $0.94. On a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we generated operating margin of 36% and record EPS of $1.52, up 45% year-over-year.
Digital momentum continued to be a strong business driver for yet another quarter, producing record Q3 digital revenues of $1.3 billion, growing 114% year-over-year and 18% quarter-over-quarter. As Thomas mentioned, nearly $1 billion of this came from in-game content sales alone and year-to-date digital player purchases were a record $2.8 billion.
Our strong overall digital performance drove non-GAAP operating margins to a Q3 record of 35%, up from 23% operating margin in Q3 of last year. The continued strength in digital provides not only a source of growth for our business, but also will continue to benefit future operating margins as well as cash flow performance.
In terms of cash flow, our strong business performance has led to record cash flow generation. In addition, our ability to directly engage our customers with continued content updates has helped further shift our business to more recurring and less seasonal revenue streams with Q3 and year-to-date records for EBITDA as well as operating and free cash flow.
This quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $456 million and free cash flow of $428 million after capital expenditures. Year-to-date, we delivered $1.3 billion of operating cash flow and $1.2 billion of free cash flow, both up dramatically year-over-year. Q3 non-GAAP, as redefined, adjusted EBITDA of $574 million was up 131% year-over-year.
Turning to the balance sheet. I'd like to start with a quick summary of the positive refinancing activity we completed this quarter. In August, we restructured our term loans, which not only allowed us realize interest rate savings but moved us to a completely unsecured capital structure, which is more consistent with our investment-grade rating.
In addition, our positive credit rating trajectory continued to improve with yet another 1 notch upgrade for Moody's. This was our second upgrade from Moody's in less than 12 months on the back of our spring upgrade from S&P. All of this served as great tailwind as we headed into our debut investment-grade debt offering, which we completed on September 19.
We issued new 5- and 10-year notes which will replace our existing 2021 notes. Subsequent to closing, we exercised our call right on our 2021 notes, which had a 30-day notice period. Because of this, our Q3 balance sheet reflects a temporary increase in both cash and debt as the call notice to redeem our legacy 2021 notes rattled [ph] the quarter end.
Subsequent to quarter end, on October 19, we redeemed our legacy 2021 notes, inclusive of the call premium, which reduced both our cash and debt positions by approximately $1.5 billion. Also, please note that the call premium expense drove a $0.10 timing difference between Q3 and Q4 versus our guidance for GAAP EPS. This will not impact the full year and is merely a shift from Q3 to Q4 for GAAP only based on the settlement date.
We are very pleased with reception of our new investment-grade notes and the overall progress we have on our capital structure since we first issued debt as part of the Vivendi buyback transaction 3 years ago. To put that progress in perspective, our gross debt levels are nearly equivalent to when we first issued debt in 2013. But since then, we have paid down more than $2.1 billion of debt, added King to our portfolio, moved to a fully unsecured investment-grade capital structure and decreased our blended cost of debt under 3%, thanks to our strong performance and improved credit rating, the great progress on this front as well.
Regarding liquidity and cash, as adjusted for the subsequent $1.5 billion redemption of our legacy 2021 notes in October, we had approximately $2.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet with over $600 million held domestically.
Now let's turn and look forward to our outlook for Q4 and full year 2016. For Q4, on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.86 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $522 million, product costs of 27% and operating expenses of 61%. We expect GAAP interest expense of $129 million, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 765 million and EPS of $0.05. For Q4 on a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we expect product costs of 27% and operating expenses of 47%. We expect a non-GAAP interest expense of $45 million, a tax rate of 30% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.40, including GAAP deferrals of $0.34.
Now let's take a look at our full year 2016 outlook. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.45 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $75 million, product costs of 24% and operating expenses of 57%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $313 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 17%, including tax rate impacts resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standards for simplification for share-based compensation. We expect 762 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP redefined, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.98, up $0.11 versus our previous guidance.
As we said on prior earnings calls, our GAAP earnings are expected to be down in 2016 versus prior year as our expected results will be impacted by additional accounting charges associated with the King transaction, which include, among other things, transaction-related costs and the amortization of intangibles resulting from purchase price accounting adjustments. The majority of these GAAP accounting charges will not impact the economics of our business or our cash flows, although they will have a material impact on our 2016 GAAP earnings results.
For 2016, on the non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we expect product costs of 24% and operating expenses of 43%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $213 million, a tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.92, up $0.09 from our previous guidance, including a GAAP deferral of $0.10, which is $0.03 higher than our previous guidance.
Again, if you would like to calculate non-GAAP as we previously defined it, revenues and EPS, you would simply add the impact of GAAP deferrals to GAAP revenues and to non-GAAP redefined EPS using the numbers I just quoted.
So on the back of our strong business momentum, from an EPS perspective, we're essentially passing through all of our Q3 overperformance for the full year in actuals and increased deferrals, whereas for revenue we are passing through roughly half of the Q3 beat [ph] largely due to small variations and FX rates versus our last guidance, particularly in Europe. Please see our press release for current FX assumptions.
In summary, as you can see, 2016 is shaping up to be a record year on the back of strong performance across our diverse franchise portfolio. Our underlying business fundamentals remain incredibly strong with our direct digital consumer connection, towering deeper engagement and more opportunities for player investment in our franchises than ever before. In addition, we have great call options on promising long-term opportunities like eSports, advertising and consumer products.
So it's a great time to be in our business with so much opportunity in front of us. As always, we will continue to attack each other opportunity with an emphasis on world-class execution and business excellence across all aspects of our organization.
Now I welcome our business leaders, Eric, Mike and Riccardo, as they join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?"

You hit on one of the hardest things in our business right now, which is really the prioritization of all the great opportunities we have in front of us. And first, I'd probably add one thing to your list which is probably biggest near-term opportunity, which is additional in-game content. As you've seen in our numbers, we've seen incredible growth in this area over the past several years, but we really think we're still only in the early stages here. And if we can do it right and not only drive additional player investment, it can also drive additional engagement as you deliver content to fans more frequently and consistently as we saw in Q3. So this is really an enormous opportunity just based on the current engagement that we have across our portfolio. We're also excited about many of the new opportunities that you mentioned. We are making good progress in our advertising business with King. And as Thomas mentioned earlier, we expect it to contribute next year and scale up in 2018. We're off to a very good start with our first TV show, Skylanders Academy, which just launched next weekend on Netflix, extremely high quality and is nice progress in that initiative. And as you heard Bobby say at the beginning of the call, we're incredibly excited about eSports and the opportunities we have in this space given our strong and known IP portfolio. You only have to look as far as BlizzCon this weekend to sort of see that in action. And this longer term is an enormous opportunity for the company. So across all these areas, we'll continue to manage our investments with the same discipline and prudence that we do in all parts of our business, but undoubtedly more opportunity in front us than we've ever had before. Thanks for the question, Mike."

In terms of Legion performance, it has matched or exceeded our prior expansion's launch performance across metrics like sales, player base and participation in value-added services. So we're very excited to see how players are reacting and engaging in new content, including our new Legion mobile companion app. We're seeing players spend their time across a whole variety of activities. And with all the content that's available to them, we hopeful they'll have a lot to do for a long time. It is a big priority for us to continue to provide new content to Legion players. Last week, we released our first content patch for Legion, less than 2 months after the launch. This is the fastest that we've added a new major patch to a World of Warcraft expansion in the game's history. And it's also bigger than the initial content patch that we released for the last few expansions. Our players have reacted very positively so far. And we're looking forward to furthering the momentum that Legion has generated into BlizzCon, the holidays and beyond and following up with more content next year."

And as we noted, while we see that with just slight decline in MAUs quarter-on-quarter, the mobile gross booking had grown or we managed to grow gross bookings year-on-year. And very importantly, the Candy Crush Saga franchise overall gross bookings also grew year-on-year. This is the result of hard work from the teams in the last titles, focusing on creating fresh new content, both through live operations, as we described in the past, and through launching new features. So this has resulted in #1, in increased engagement. And time spent per player has grown year-on-year, it's now over 30 minutes per day. And secondly, we had increased also the monetization per player. The average revenues per paying player have increased substantially year-on-year. So looking forward, the plan is to continue the investment in the live games, creating more content, both through live ops and features. So we expect to focus not only, and have an impact, not only on retention of players, but also monetization. So both monetization and retention are key targets for those expansions. And secondly, we are also focusing on new games. We have a pipeline of new franchise titles to attract new and last players, and we have one game in final stages of polish. It's shaping up well, and it's slated for a Q1 release."

First of all, I think it's obviously too early to make any comments on our annual release which hasn't released yet with Infinite Warfare. But I think that it is important that we think about Call of Duty as a year-round business, which is designed to have a steady stream of content throughout the year to keep our players engaged and obviously, our annual release, which is part of that engagement driving strategy. But when you do our jobs right on this franchise, we manage to keep people engaged year-round. And this year, we have definitely achieved that with record operating income, which Thomas mentioned for the franchise year-to-date. And I think probably the best is that's going to accompany with also a record in monthly active users. So in this case, engagement and the business are going hand in hand and helping one another. So on the annual release, as you know, we've modeled Infinite Warfare, which is a new sub-brand, down versus Black Ops III, which is our best established sub-brand, and that only makes sense given our historical patterns. But we think that we've delivered a great game that we think is going to do great over the holiday quarter. And it's huge innovation for our fans, and as you know, keeping a franchise that's been on top of -- for as long as Call of Duty has fresh ever year is no easy task, and Infinity War has done that with Infinite Warfare, which is a ton of new experiences and game play mechanics for our fans while also feeling -- giving that classic Call of Duty feel that our fans love. Second, Thomas mentioned, we think it's the most complete entertainment package in the industry. It's got a full campaign, the multiplayer builds upon one of the stickiest and most played multiplayer games in the world. And it's the first time that we've had  a full Zombies mode on the disc of the main release in a non-trailer [ph] title. We know there's a lot of fans who appreciate that. And of course, we have Modern Warfare Remastered for those who -- for those of our fans who wanted the classic Call of Duty gameplay with our best bonus content ever in our collector's edition. So overall, we feel really good about both the quality and the breadth and the variety of the content that we're putting in the marketplace. We think we're going to have a strong quarter."

As I said in the past, we believe that advertising is an attractive opportunity to monetize nonpaying players. And we see that because of the size of the network, and also because the players are so engaged on our network, that the interest from high-quality brand advertisers is very strong. So we want to take this opportunity. There's a lot to do to take this opportunity. And the teams are working hard as we speak, on one side, on building the infantry, and on the other side, we are building the team and the infrastructure required to take this opportunity.

We've already had several new content releases since launch and player participation continues to build momentum. As promised, that engagement and participation in the Halloween event in October exceeded the one for the Summer Games event in August. So, so far, we've released a new hero, new map, competitive play mode and have more content and development. We're very excited about player reactions, see the Overwatch short and the plans we have for Overwatch in eSports, which we'll discuss more at BlizzCon tomorrow. It's too early for me to discuss our plans for 2017. But what I can say is that the 2 events that we've had so far have shown us we have a great model for follow-on content. We found that it stimulates our audience and drives record engagement. So you should expect to see more events like Summer Games and Halloween and additional content, which we'll discuss in more detail later. So as the community continues to grow and our player base continues to react positively to the content we're creating, we're very excited about the prospects for the future."

But we're looking forward to her being back to accompany Colin on the next call.
We delivered another record quarter, and we continue to focus on building enduring franchises for our nearly 500 million monthly players around the world. Continuous innovation within existing franchises and the creation of new franchises like Overwatch helps broaden our audiences, deepen engagement and increase player investment.
We believe gaming is the most engaging form of media, and players spend tens of billions of hours a year with our franchises. In fact, this quarter alone, our players spent over 10 billion hours playing our games. This strong engagement and the social experiences that are such an important part of gameplaying have been the catalyst for our new opportunities in enhanced game monetization, expansion of our franchises into linear media and consumer products and greater involvement in advertising-supported spectator gaming like we have with MLG.
It's estimated that as many as 225 million people are now watching organized gaming competitions. Competition between video gameplayers is becoming as thrilling to watch as traditional professional sports. With the launch of professional global leagues, we believe game spectating will grow significantly as an opportunity for us and for our players.
The increased popularity of spectator gaming will enable us to celebrate and reward our players and recognize their accomplishments. Professional gamers will eventually be as celebrated, honored and recognized as professional athletes.
Professional gamers will be the role models and goodwill ambassadors of the digital generation, and we believe great new business opportunities are emerging throughout the eSports ecosystem, which we helped pioneer more than a decade ago with games like StarCraft.
In May, Blizzard released Overwatch, which, in about 4 months, has already eclipsed 20 million registered players, making it Blizzard’s fastest new intellectual property to reach that mark. And Overwatch was specifically designed to be the definitive competitive game.
We're uniquely positioned to realize the full potential of eSports. We have some of the most successful iconic franchises in gaming and direct relationships with nearly 0.5 billion monthly active users, a powerful combination that distinguishes us from the rest of our competitors. And we have unmatched commercial capabilities that have served our shareholders extremely well over the last 25 years.
Before I hand off the call, I want to take this opportunity to thank the talented people who drive the success at our company every day. They are our greatest asset, inspiring play, competition and community by creating the most engaging entertainment in the world.
Thomas and Dennis will now share the details of our record quarter."

Thanks for the efforts of our creative and commercial teams, 2016 has continued to be a record-setting year. We overperformed our plan, delivering record third quarter revenues, up almost 60%, and EPS more than doubling year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis. On the back of this strong momentum, we are raising our full year guidance once again.
As we've discussed before, our results are driven by focus and execution against our 3 strategic pillars: first, expanding our audiences; second, deepening engagement; and third, providing opportunities for more player investment.
Let's start with audience reach, which was nearly 0.5 billion monthly active players this quarter. In Q3, Blizzard had its highest MAUs in history, up 50% year-over-year and 25% over the previous record in Q2. This increase was driven in particular by Overwatch and World of Warcraft. Blizzard's MAUs have more than doubled from 2 years ago, thanks to compelling new content and a broadening of the portfolio to new franchises and new platforms, including mobile.
World of Warcraft Legion launched on August 30 and has reenergized players worldwide. The expansion sold through 3.3 million copies on launch day, matching the all-time record achieved by previous expansions and making it one of the fastest-selling PC games ever. The exciting new Legion content led to an almost 30% quarter-over-quarter increase in MAUs, building on momentum established earlier in the year.
Overwatch's Strong momentum carried into the third quarter and its player base continues to grow. In fact, Overwatch became Blizzard's fastest game ever to reach 20 million players. Overwatch also continues to have strong global appeal with a roughly even player split between East and West and the #1 position in Korean IGRs from launch all the way through Q3.
Hearthstone continues to add players and also had record MAUs this quarter, increasing by double-digit percentage year-over-year, thanks to great gameplay, regular content updates and accessibility across platforms, including mobile. 
Activision also had record Q3 MAUs, driven by continued strength of Call of Duty and strong reengagement in Destiny. Activision has increased MAUs 18% over the last 2 years on the back of a more focused yet broadly appealing slate of content.
Call of Duty: Black Ops III continues to be the best-selling current chain [ph] game live to date. And its follow-on content has led to continued strength in the player base with record franchise MAUs for the third quarter.
Destiny's new expansion, Rise of Iron, released on September 20, addressed the passionate community eager for new content and drove an increase in MAUs quarter-over-quarter.
Activision and our talented partners at Bungie are hard at work on a sequel to Destiny, which should energize both Destiny's passionate fan base and bring millions of new fans to the franchise next year.
Turning to our second strategic pillar, deepening engagement. Each time we offer our players an opportunity to engage with our franchises, whether in or outside of gameplay, they respond passionately. These opportunities include not only additional in-game content, which drove over 10 billion hours of play time in Q3 alone but also out-of-game experiences, including eSports and fan events like Call of Duty XP and BlizzCon.
An expanding player base and strong engagement across a number of franchises led to all-time Blizzard engagement records virtually across the board, including monthly, weekly and daily active users, unique users and play time. This is a testament to the epic compelling content that Blizzard team has been creating.
For World of Warcraft, Blizzard's priority with the recent Legion expansion was to provide meaningful content and features that supported stronger ongoing engagement. Blizzard has already released Legion's first patch, Return to Caravan, making it the fastest post-expansion content patch in franchise history.
In addition, Blizzard has offered players a new way to interact with World of Warcraft by releasing a companion mobile app. For the first time, players can manage select in-game activities and continue their gameplay even when away from their PC. Millions of players have already used the app and are logging in an average of 4 to 5x every day.
eSports overall continues to draw large and growing audiences and our Major League Gaming division keeps innovating to celebrate the best players and most exciting gameplay. During the quarter, MLG held tournament events for Call of Duty, Gears of War, Destiny and World of Warcraft, developing deep industry relationships.
Our eSports support and premium content recorded about 50 million video views on Facebook, growing 67% quarter-over-quarter and reached a record 11 million users in a single day. In our games, our proprietary video player and game battles will soon be integrated with Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare and will allow fans easy access to Call of Duty World League in its professional play as well as amateur competitions.
We're also looking forward to the MLG Las Vegas event held over 3 days in December, which will feature the first Call of Duty World League event for Infinite Warfare and an Overwatch invitational. eSports is also featured prominently at this weekend's BlizzCon, which, again, sold out in minutes with millions more expected to join the action through live streaming or virtual tickets. Over 200 top players from around the world will compete in global finals across 5 Blizzard franchises. The participants started off match play last week, and the unprecedented 8 days of competition will culminate in what promises to be a weekend of epic sports action.
This year's event, which marks the 10th BlizzCon and commemorates Blizzard's 25th anniversary, will also feature community events and contests, hands-on play and -- hands-on play with previous releases of Blizzard games, discussion panels with developers and artists and more. It's going to be a very exciting weekend, and we look for to seeing some of you there.
Also during the quarter, Activision held Call of Duty XP, their largest fan event ever. The event showcased the passion and commitment of Call of Duty fans with the franchise broadly [ph] and for Call of Duty World League eSports events as well. More than 1,000 teams participated in the Call of Duty World League during the 2016 season, which recorded 121 million views. 
We also launched our first TV show, Skylanders Academy on Netflix. It is the first initiative for our film and TV division and offers a brand-new way for fans to interact with our franchises. We think the combination of the TV series and opportunity to create your very own Skylanders as part of our recently launched game, Skylanders Imaginators, is a compelling one for kids around the world.
And finally, we recently announced a new live-action game show based on the Candy Crush franchise to be distributed domestically by CBS and internationally by Lionsgate. This is just one more example of the strength of our IP and engagement with our franchises outside of core gameplay. These additional opportunities to engage also reinforce our franchises with our existing players and introduces them to potentially new players.
Turning next to the third pillar of our strategy, providing opportunities for more player investment. Our direct digital connection to our players, development of new analytical capabilities and new business models all support our efforts to offer great content to our players to invest in. Digital in-game content increased to another record this quarter. Actual in-game digital player purchases were a record at more than $1 billion this quarter and a record $2.8 billion year-to-date. This was driven by broad-based strength, including record participation in World of Warcraft value-added services.
In Overwatch, customization items continue to perform well, thanks to a consistent flow of new content, including time-limited seasonal events. Summer Games, Overwatch's first seasonal event, spent several weeks in August and drove record engagement as well as record participation in the event's unique in-game customization items. In October, Blizzard unveiled its Halloween Terror event, which included Overwatch's first-ever player versus environment mode, and players responded with even higher engagement and participation. Also, Hearthstone released a new adventure in the quarter, One Night in Karazhan, which performed even better than the last adventure.
Turning to King, whose top franchises continues to perform well despite slightly lower MAUs this quarter. The Candy Crush franchise continued its momentum of increased gross bookings year-over-year. Farm Heroes, King's second-largest franchise, also increased mobile gross bookings year-over-year, driven by the launch of Farm Heroes Super Saga.
Strength in top titles led to growth in mobile overall, with mobile gross bookings up year-over-year. Time spent per user and average revenue per paying user also increased year-over-year, showing strong engagement from King's core players. In fact, King continues to have 3 of the top 20 grossing games in the U.S. for now the 11th limited quarter in a row.
King has also made progress against its advertising initiatives and large opportunity given the size of King's player community and its strong engagement. We have now been testing advertising in Candy for close to 3 months, and we are progressing well against our internal milestones. We continue to believe this can be a positive contributor to EPS starting in 2017 and scaling up into 2018.
For Activision, in-game revenue was driven by Destiny's expansion as well as Call of Duty, which continues to deliver record performance for the quarter and the year. Year-to-date, the number of purchases of Call of Duty in-game content grew more than 100% and along with robust participation in Season Pass and à la carte Map Packs, drove an increase in average revenue per user as well.
It also is an exciting time for Activision as Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare is set to release tomorrow. It's bold new setting has opened up numerous meaningful innovations for gameplay, paired with a classic feel that Call of Duty is known for. And with 3 modes, including campaign, multiplayer and zombies, it is a complete package for every type of fan. Also included in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare's Legacy Edition is the ultimate bonus content, Modern Warfare Remastered. The game has been faithfully updated for current gen to look better than ever. Based on the excitement around Modern Warfare Remastered and the preorders, we expect to sell a higher percentage of our higher-value premium SKUs than ever before.
So in summary, our record performance year-to-date has confirmed that execution against our strategic pillars is paying off and will set us up for success in the holiday quarter and beyond. And now, I hand it over to Dennis."
4222231,404017948,1073350,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Thomas. Q3 was another great quarter as we continue to see strong performance across our broad portfolio of leading franchises. Before we go into results, as we mentioned on our Q2 call, we have made changes to how we report non-GAAP financials. A",1942,"Thanks, Thomas. Q3 was another great quarter as we continue to see strong performance across our broad portfolio of leading franchises. Before we go into results, as we mentioned on our Q2 call, we have made changes to how we report non-GAAP financials. As reminder, our non-GAAP results no longer exclude the impact of deferrals. If you would like to calculate metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals to our non-GAAP as redefined figures.
Our segment results, however, are still presented, excluding the impact of deferrals like they always have been. This aligns with how Bobby, our management team and our board continues to review the business and our overall performance. With that backdrop, I'd like to first start with our segments as they are the engine behind our consolidated financial results.
Starting with Activision. On the back of strong Call of Duty engagement and the successful launch of Destiny's Rise of Iron in September, Activision delivered record Q3 operating income of $123 million and also achieved record year-to-date operating income of $309 million, up 27% versus last year. Blizzard delivered Q3 segment revenues of $727 million, which were nearly double last year's Q3 performance. This also helped fuel record third quarter segment operating income of $321 million, which is up 2.5x versus Q3 of last year. And year-to-date Blizzard segment revenue of $1.8 billion is up 59% versus last year and operating income of $740 million is up 93% versus last year.
I want to pause here for a second and mention that, just the Activision Blizzard segments, so excluding King, also set a Q3 and year-to-date record for our combined segment revenue and operating income. Notably, this performance drove year-over-year organic growth for Activision and Blizzard segments of 15% for the quarter and 22% year-to-date. Operating income grew even faster year-over-year, increasing 78% for the quarter and 67% year-to-date.
Turning to King. As expected, revenues were down slightly quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. But as Thomas noted, importantly, the Candy Crush franchise and mobile overall performed well with bookings growth year-over-year. King's operating income was down this quarter, mainly due to marketing costs related to the launch of Farm Heroes Super Saga as well investments we are making in our promising advertising business.
Let's now turn to our consolidated results and raised outlook for the full year of 2016. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP as redefined measures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.
For the quarter, we generated record Q3 GAAP revenues of $1.57 billion, $78 million above our August guidance and $578 million or 58% above Q3 last year. The net effect of deferred revenue was $62 million for the quarter and also above guidance of $45 million. We generated GAAP EPS of $0.26. That is $0.20 above guidance, of which $0.10 is related to the timing of our call premium, which I will discuss in more detail later when I cover the balance sheet.
We generated record Q3 non-GAAP as redefined EPS of $0.49, $0.10 above guidance and more than double the $0.20 we generated in Q3 of last year. The impact of deferrals on non-GAAP as redefined EPS was $0.03 and above guidance of $0.01. The overperformance in the quarter versus guidance was driven by multiple factors, including Overwatch full game sales and in-game content, the strong performance of the World of Warcraft Legion expansion, as well as the continued strength in Call of Duty in-game content.
Turning to the specific P&L items. Please note that all percentages are based on revenues, except for the tax rate. For Q3, GAAP product cost were 22%, operating expenses were 59%. Interest expense was $63 million, including a $10 million GAAP loss upon refinancing of our term loan and our GAAP tax rate was 14%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average share count was 758 million shares, including participating securities.
On a non-GAAP basis as redefined, product costs were 22%, operating expenses were 43%, interest expense was $52 million and our non-GAAP tax rate was 24%. For the year-to-date, on a GAAP basis, we generated record revenues of $4.59 billion, up 39% year-over-year and operating margin of 21%, and EPS of $0.94. On a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we generated operating margin of 36% and record EPS of $1.52, up 45% year-over-year.
Digital momentum continued to be a strong business driver for yet another quarter, producing record Q3 digital revenues of $1.3 billion, growing 114% year-over-year and 18% quarter-over-quarter. As Thomas mentioned, nearly $1 billion of this came from in-game content sales alone and year-to-date digital player purchases were a record $2.8 billion.
Our strong overall digital performance drove non-GAAP operating margins to a Q3 record of 35%, up from 23% operating margin in Q3 of last year. The continued strength in digital provides not only a source of growth for our business, but also will continue to benefit future operating margins as well as cash flow performance.
In terms of cash flow, our strong business performance has led to record cash flow generation. In addition, our ability to directly engage our customers with continued content updates has helped further shift our business to more recurring and less seasonal revenue streams with Q3 and year-to-date records for EBITDA as well as operating and free cash flow.
This quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $456 million and free cash flow of $428 million after capital expenditures. Year-to-date, we delivered $1.3 billion of operating cash flow and $1.2 billion of free cash flow, both up dramatically year-over-year. Q3 non-GAAP, as redefined, adjusted EBITDA of $574 million was up 131% year-over-year.
Turning to the balance sheet. I'd like to start with a quick summary of the positive refinancing activity we completed this quarter. In August, we restructured our term loans, which not only allowed us to realize interest rate savings but moved us to a completely unsecured capital structure, which is more consistent with our investment-grade rating.
In addition, our positive credit rating trajectory continued to improve with yet another 1 notch upgrade for Moody's. This was our second upgrade from Moody's in less than 12 months on the back of our spring upgrade from S&P. All of this served as great tailwind as we headed into our debut investment-grade debt offering, which we completed on September 19.
We issued new 5- and 10-year notes which will replace our existing 2021 notes. Subsequent to closing, we exercised our call right on our 2021 notes, which had a 30-day notice period. Because of this, our Q3 balance sheet reflects a temporary increase in both cash and debt as the call notice to redeem our legacy 2021 notes straddled the quarter end.
Subsequent to quarter end, on October 19, we redeemed our legacy 2021 notes, inclusive of the call premium, which reduced both our cash and debt positions by approximately $1.5 billion. Also, please note that the call premium expense drove a $0.10 timing difference between Q3 and Q4 versus our guidance for GAAP EPS. This will not impact the full year and is merely a shift from Q3 to Q4 for GAAP only based on the settlement date.
We are very pleased with the reception of our new investment-grade notes and the overall progress we have on our capital structure since we first issued debt as part of the Vivendi buyback transaction 3 years ago. To put that progress in perspective, our gross debt levels are nearly equivalent to when we first issued debt in 2013. But since then, we have paid down more than $2.1 billion of debt, added King to our portfolio, moved to a fully unsecured investment-grade capital structure and decreased our blended cost of debt to under 3%, thanks to our strong performance and improved credit rating, the great progress on this front as well.
Regarding liquidity and cash, as adjusted for the subsequent $1.5 billion redemption of our legacy 2021 notes in October, we had approximately $2.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet with over $600 million held domestically.
Now let's turn and look forward to our outlook for Q4 and full year 2016. For Q4, on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.86 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $522 million, product costs of 27% and operating expenses of 61%. We expect GAAP interest expense of $129 million, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 765 million and EPS of $0.05. For Q4 on a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we expect product costs of 27% and operating expenses of 47%. We expect a non-GAAP interest expense of $45 million, a tax rate of 30% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.40, including GAAP deferrals of $0.34.
Now let's take a look at our full year 2016 outlook. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.45 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $75 million, product costs of 24% and operating expenses of 57%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $313 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 17%, including tax rate impacts resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standards for simplification for share-based compensation. We expect 762 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP redefined, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.98, up $0.11 versus our previous guidance.
As we said on prior earnings calls, our GAAP earnings are expected to be down in 2016 versus prior year as our expected results will be impacted by additional accounting charges associated with the King transaction, which include, among other things, transaction-related costs and the amortization of intangibles resulting from purchase price accounting adjustments. The majority of these GAAP accounting charges will not impact the economics of our business or our cash flows, although they will have a material impact on our 2016 GAAP earnings results.
For 2016, on the non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we expect product costs of 24% and operating expenses of 43%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $213 million, a tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.92, up $0.09 from our previous guidance, including a GAAP deferral of $0.10, which is $0.03 higher than our previous guidance.
Again, if you would like to calculate non-GAAP as we previously defined it, revenues and EPS, you would simply add the impact of GAAP deferrals to GAAP revenues and to non-GAAP redefined EPS using the numbers I just quoted.
So on the back of our strong business momentum, from an EPS perspective, we're essentially passing through all of our Q3 overperformance for the full year in actuals and increased deferrals, whereas for revenue we are passing through roughly half of the Q3 beat [ph] largely due to small variations and FX rates versus our last guidance, particularly in Europe. Please see our press release for current FX assumptions.
In summary, as you can see, 2016 is shaping up to be a record year on the back of strong performance across our diverse franchise portfolio. Our underlying business fundamentals remain incredibly strong with our direct digital consumer connection powering deeper engagement and more opportunities for player investment in our franchises than ever before. In addition, we have great call options on promising long-term opportunities like eSports, advertising and consumer products.
So it's a great time to be in our business with so much opportunity in front of us. As always, we will continue to attack each opportunity with an emphasis on world-class execution and business excellence across all aspects of our organization.
Now I welcome our business leaders, Eric, Mike and Riccardo, as they join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?"

You hit on one of the hardest things in our business right now, which is really the prioritization of all the great opportunities we have in front of us. And first, I'd probably add one thing to your list which is probably biggest near-term opportunity, which is additional in-game content. As you've seen in our numbers, we've seen incredible growth in this area over the past several years, but we really think we're still only in the early stages here. And if we can do it right and not only drive additional player investment, it can also drive additional engagement as you deliver content to fans more frequently and consistently as we saw in Q3. So this is really an enormous opportunity just based on the current engagement that we have across our portfolio. We're also excited about many of the new opportunities that you mentioned. We are making good progress in our advertising business with King. And as Thomas mentioned earlier, we expect it to contribute next year and scale up in 2018. We're off to a very good start with our first TV show, Skylanders Academy, which just launched next weekend on Netflix, extremely high quality and is nice progress in that initiative. And as you heard Bobby say at the beginning of the call, we're incredibly excited about eSports and the opportunities we have in this space given our strong and known IP portfolio. You only have to look as far as BlizzCon this weekend to sort of see that in action. And this longer term is an enormous opportunity for the company. So across all these areas, we'll continue to manage our investments with the same discipline and prudence that we do in all parts of our business, but undoubtedly more opportunity in front us than we've ever had before. Thanks for the question, Mike."

We worked very hard to make Legion our best expansion, and we're pleased and gratified by the player reaction so far. We no longer report subscribers. But as Thomas mentioned, our MAUs were up 30% quarter-over-quarter, and that builds on the momentum we saw earlier in the year. In terms of Legion performance, it has matched or exceeded our prior expansion's launch performance across metrics like sales, player base and participation in value-added services. So we're very excited to see how players are reacting and engaging in the new content, including our new Legion mobile companion app. We're seeing players spend their time across a whole variety of activities. And with all the content that's available to them, we hopeful they'll have a lot to do for a long time. It is a big priority for us to continue to provide new content to Legion players. Last week, we released our first content patch for Legion, less than 2 months after the launch. This is the fastest that we've added a new major patch to a World of Warcraft expansion in the game's history. And it's also bigger than the initial content patch that we released for the last few expansions. Our players have reacted very positively so far. And we're looking forward to furthering the momentum that Legion has generated into BlizzCon, the holidays and beyond and following up with more content next year."

So that's our primary focus right now. Beyond that, in the past, I've mentioned that the incredible demand for Destiny content has somewhat outpaced our ability to deliver upon that demand. And going forward, along with our partners at Bungie, we've put together what we believe is a very smart approach that will allow us to deliver that steady stream of great content to keep our players engaged and keep the universe sort of alive and growing in the wake of that sequel."

Well, first of all, I think in terms of strategy, I think that we see that our focus on the top franchises is really paying off. And as we noted, while we see that with just slight decline in MAUs quarter-on-quarter, the mobile gross booking had grown or we managed to grow gross bookings year-on-year. And very importantly, the Candy Crush Saga franchise overall gross bookings also grew year-on-year. This is the result of hard work from the teams in the last titles, focusing on creating fresh new content, both through live operations, as we described in the past, and through launching new features. So this has resulted in #1, in increased engagement. And time spent per player has grown year-on-year, it's now over 30 minutes per day. And secondly, we have increased also the monetization per player. The average revenues per paying player has increased substantially year-on-year. So looking forward, the plan is to continue the investment in live games, creating more content, both through live ops and features. So we expect to focus not only, and have an impact, not only on retention of players, but also monetization. So both monetization and retention are key targets for those expansions. And secondly, we are also focusing on new games. We have a pipeline of new franchise titles to attract new and lapsed players, and we have one game in final stages of polish. It's shaping up well, and it's slated for a Q1 release."

First of all, I think it's obviously too early to make any comments on our annual release which hasn't released yet with Infinite Warfare. But I think that it is important that we think about Call of Duty as a year-round business, which is designed to have a steady stream of content throughout the year to keep our players engaged and obviously, our annual release, which is part of that engagement driving strategy. But when you do our jobs right on this franchise, we manage to keep people engaged year-round. And this year, we have definitely achieved that with record operating income, which Thomas mentioned for the franchise year-to-date. And I think probably the best is that's been accompanied with also a record in monthly active users. So in this case, engagement and the business are going hand in hand and helping one another. So on the annual release, as you know, we've modeled Infinite Warfare, which is a new sub-brand, down versus Black Ops III, which is our best established sub-brand, and that only makes sense given our historical patterns. But we think that we've delivered a great game that we think is going to do great over the holiday quarter. And it's huge innovation for our fans, and as you know, keeping a franchise that's been on top of -- for as long as Call of Duty has, fresh ever year is no easy task, and Infinity War has done that with Infinite Warfare, which is a ton of new experiences and game playing mechanics for our fans while also feeling -- giving that classic Call of Duty feel that our fans love. Second, Thomas mentioned, we think it's the most complete entertainment package in the industry. It's got a full campaign, the multiplayer builds upon one of the stickiest and most played multiplayer games in the world. And it's the first time that we've had  a full Zombies mode on the disc with the main release in a non-trailer title. We know there's a lot of fans who appreciate that. And of course, we have Modern Warfare Remastered for those who -- for those of our fans who wanted the classic Call of Duty gameplay with our best bonus content ever in our collector's edition. So overall, we feel really good about both the quality and the breadth and the variety of the content that we're putting in the marketplace. We think we're going to have a strong quarter."

So we want to take this opportunity. There's a lot to do to take this opportunity.

It's too early for me to discuss our plans for 2017. But what I can say is that the 2 events that we've had so far have shown us we have a great model for follow-on content.

However, as discussed on our July 29 conference call, due to updated compliance and disclosure interpretations issued by the SEC staff on May 17, 2016, we are no longer able to present non-GAAP financial measures, excluding the impact of deferrals.
On this call in the future, we will continue to provide non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of expenses related to stock-based compensation; the amortization of intangible assets; expenses, including legal fees, costs, expenses and accruals related to acquisitions, including the acquisition of King Digital Entertainment; expenses related to debt financings and refinancings and the associated tax expenses.
These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision.
Please refer to our earnings release, which is posted on www.activisionblizzard.com, for a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and further explanation with respect to our non-GAAP measures.

And now, I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick."

Many of you may notice the voice reading you the safe harbor is a different voice than usual, and that's because Amrita is out on maternity leave, and we're happy to say she had a beautiful baby a few weeks ago and she's doing well. But we're looking forward to her being back to accompany Colin on the next call.
We delivered another record quarter, and we continue to focus on building enduring franchises for our nearly 500 million monthly players around the world. Continuous innovation within existing franchises and the creation of new franchises like Overwatch helps broaden our audiences, deepen engagement and increase player investment.
We believe gaming is the most engaging form of media, and players spend tens of billions of hours a year with our franchises. In fact, this quarter alone, our players spent over 10 billion hours playing our games. This strong engagement and the social experiences that are such an important part of gameplaying have been the catalyst for our new opportunities in enhanced game monetization, expansion of our franchises into linear media and consumer products and greater involvement in advertising-supported spectator gaming like we have with MLG.
It's estimated that as many as 225 million people are now watching organized gaming competitions. Competition between video gameplayers is becoming as thrilling to watch as traditional professional sports. With the launch of professional global leagues, we believe game spectating will grow significantly as an opportunity for us and for our players.
The increased popularity of spectator gaming will enable us to celebrate and reward our players and recognize their accomplishments. Professional gamers will eventually be as celebrated, honored and recognized as professional athletes.
Professional gamers will be the role models and goodwill ambassadors of the digital generation, and we believe great new business opportunities are emerging throughout the eSports ecosystem, which we helped pioneer more than a decade ago with games like StarCraft.
In May, Blizzard released Overwatch, which, in about 4 months, has already eclipsed 20 million registered players, making it Blizzard’s fastest new intellectual property to reach that mark. And Overwatch was specifically designed to be the definitive competitive game.
We're uniquely positioned to realize the full potential of eSports. We have some of the most successful iconic franchises in gaming and direct relationships with nearly 0.5 billion monthly active users, a powerful combination that distinguishes us from the rest of our competitors. And we have unmatched commercial capabilities that have served our shareholders extremely well over the last 25 years.
Before I hand off the call, I want to take this opportunity to thank the talented people who drive the success at our company every day. They are our greatest asset, inspiring play, competition and community by creating the most engaging entertainment in the world.
Thomas and Dennis will now share the details of our record quarter."

Thanks for the efforts of our creative and commercial teams, 2016 has continued to be a record-setting year.

Thanks for the efforts of our creative and commercial teams, 2016 has continued to be a record-setting year. We overperformed our plan, delivering record third quarter revenues, up almost 60%, and EPS more than doubling year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis. On the back of this strong momentum, we are raising our full year guidance once again.
As we've discussed before, our results are driven by focus and execution against our 3 strategic pillars: first, expanding our audiences; second, deepening engagement; and third, providing opportunities for more player investment.
Let's start with audience reach, which was nearly 0.5 billion monthly active players this quarter. In Q3, Blizzard had its highest MAUs in history, up 50% year-over-year and 25% over the previous record in Q2. This increase was driven in particular by Overwatch and World of Warcraft. Blizzard's MAUs have more than doubled from 2 years ago, thanks to compelling new content and a broadening of the portfolio to new franchises and new platforms, including mobile.
World of Warcraft Legion launched on August 30 and has reenergized players worldwide. The expansion sold through 3.3 million copies on launch day, matching the all-time record achieved by previous expansions and making it one of the fastest-selling PC games ever. The exciting new Legion content led to an almost 30% quarter-over-quarter increase in MAUs, building on momentum established earlier in the year.
Overwatch's Strong momentum carried into the third quarter and its player base continues to grow. In fact, Overwatch became Blizzard's fastest game ever to reach 20 million players. Overwatch also continues to have strong global appeal with a roughly even player split between East and West and the #1 position in Korean IGRs from launch all the way through Q3.
Hearthstone continues to add players and also had record MAUs this quarter, increasing by double-digit percentage year-over-year, thanks to great gameplay, regular content updates and accessibility across platforms, including mobile. 
Activision also had record Q3 MAUs, driven by continued strength of Call of Duty and strong reengagement in Destiny. Activision has increased MAUs 18% over the last 2 years on the back of a more focused yet broadly appealing slate of content.
Call of Duty: Black Ops III continues to be the best-selling current chain [ph] game live to date. And its follow-on content has led to continued strength in the player base with record franchise MAUs for the third quarter.
Destiny's new expansion, Rise of Iron, released on September 20, addressed the passionate community eager for new content and drove an increase in MAUs quarter-over-quarter.
Activision and our talented partners at Bungie are hard at work on a sequel to Destiny, which should energize both Destiny's passionate fan base and bring millions of new fans to the franchise next year.
Turning to our second strategic pillar, deepening engagement. Each time we offer our players an opportunity to engage with our franchises, whether in or outside of gameplay, they respond passionately. These opportunities include not only additional in-game content, which drove over 10 billion hours of play time in Q3 alone but also out-of-game experiences, including eSports and fan events like Call of Duty XP and BlizzCon.
An expanding player base and strong engagement across a number of franchises led to all-time Blizzard engagement records virtually across the board, including monthly, weekly and daily active users, unique users and play time. This is a testament to the epic compelling content that Blizzard team has been creating.
For World of Warcraft, Blizzard's priority with the recent Legion expansion was to provide meaningful content and features that supported stronger ongoing engagement. Blizzard has already released Legion's first patch, Return to Caravan, making it the fastest post-expansion content patch in franchise history.
In addition, Blizzard has offered players a new way to interact with World of Warcraft by releasing a companion mobile app. For the first time, players can manage select in-game activities and continue their gameplay even when away from their PC. Millions of players have already used the app and are logging in an average of 4 to 5x every day.
eSports overall continues to draw large and growing audiences and our Major League Gaming division keeps innovating to celebrate the best players and most exciting gameplay. During the quarter, MLG held tournament events for Call of Duty, Gears of War, Destiny and World of Warcraft, developing deep industry relationships.
Our eSports support and premium content recorded about 50 million video views on Facebook, growing 67% quarter-over-quarter and reached a record 11 million users in a single day. In our games, our proprietary video player and game battles will soon be integrated with Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare and will allow fans easy access to Call of Duty World League in its professional play as well as amateur competitions.
We're also looking forward to the MLG Las Vegas event held over 3 days in December, which will feature the first Call of Duty World League event for Infinite Warfare and an Overwatch invitational. eSports is also featured prominently at this weekend's BlizzCon, which, again, sold out in minutes with millions more expected to join the action through live streaming or virtual tickets. Over 200 top players from around the world will compete in global finals across 5 Blizzard franchises. The participants started off match play last week, and the unprecedented 8 days of competition will culminate in what promises to be a weekend of epic sports action.
This year's event, which marks the 10th BlizzCon and commemorates Blizzard's 25th anniversary, will also feature community events and contests, hands-on play and -- hands-on play with previous releases of Blizzard games, discussion panels with developers and artists and more. It's going to be a very exciting weekend, and we look for to seeing some of you there.
Also during the quarter, Activision held Call of Duty XP, their largest fan event ever. The event showcased the passion and commitment of Call of Duty fans with the franchise broadly [ph] and for Call of Duty World League eSports events as well. More than 1,000 teams participated in the Call of Duty World League during the 2016 season, which recorded 121 million views. 
We also launched our first TV show, Skylanders Academy on Netflix. It is the first initiative for our film and TV division and offers a brand-new way for fans to interact with our franchises. We think the combination of the TV series and opportunity to create your very own Skylanders as part of our recently launched game, Skylanders Imaginators, is a compelling one for kids around the world.
And finally, we recently announced a new live-action game show based on the Candy Crush franchise to be distributed domestically by CBS and internationally by Lionsgate. This is just one more example of the strength of our IP and engagement with our franchises outside of core gameplay. These additional opportunities to engage also reinforce our franchises with our existing players and introduces them to potentially new players.
Turning next to the third pillar of our strategy, providing opportunities for more player investment. Our direct digital connection to our players, development of new analytical capabilities and new business models all support our efforts to offer great content to our players to invest in. Digital in-game content increased to another record this quarter. Actual in-game digital player purchases were a record at more than $1 billion this quarter and a record $2.8 billion year-to-date. This was driven by broad-based strength, including record participation in World of Warcraft value-added services.
In Overwatch, customization items continue to perform well, thanks to a consistent flow of new content, including time-limited seasonal events. Summer Games, Overwatch's first seasonal event, spent several weeks in August and drove record engagement as well as record participation in the event's unique in-game customization items. In October, Blizzard unveiled its Halloween Terror event, which included Overwatch's first-ever player versus environment mode, and players responded with even higher engagement and participation. Also, Hearthstone released a new adventure in the quarter, One Night in Karazhan, which performed even better than the last adventure.
Turning to King, whose top franchises continues to perform well despite slightly lower MAUs this quarter. The Candy Crush franchise continued its momentum of increased gross bookings year-over-year. Farm Heroes, King's second-largest franchise, also increased mobile gross bookings year-over-year, driven by the launch of Farm Heroes Super Saga.
Strength in top titles led to growth in mobile overall, with mobile gross bookings up year-over-year. Time spent per user and average revenue per paying user also increased year-over-year, showing strong engagement from King's core players. In fact, King continues to have 3 of the top 20 grossing games in the U.S. for now the 11th limited quarter in a row.
King has also made progress against its advertising initiatives and large opportunity given the size of King's player community and its strong engagement. We have now been testing advertising in Candy for close to 3 months, and we are progressing well against our internal milestones. We continue to believe this can be a positive contributor to EPS starting in 2017 and scaling up into 2018.
For Activision, in-game revenue was driven by Destiny's expansion as well as Call of Duty, which continues to deliver record performance for the quarter and the year. Year-to-date, the number of purchases of Call of Duty in-game content grew more than 100% and along with robust participation in Season Pass and à la carte Map Packs, drove an increase in average revenue per user as well.
It also is an exciting time for Activision as Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare is set to release tomorrow. It's bold new setting has opened up numerous meaningful innovations for gameplay, paired with a classic feel that Call of Duty is known for. And with 3 modes, including campaign, multiplayer and zombies, it is a complete package for every type of fan. Also included in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare's Legacy Edition is the ultimate bonus content, Modern Warfare Remastered. The game has been faithfully updated for current gen to look better than ever. Based on the excitement around Modern Warfare Remastered and the preorders, we expect to sell a higher percentage of our higher-value premium SKUs than ever before.
So in summary, our record performance year-to-date has confirmed that execution against our strategic pillars is paying off and will set us up for success in the holiday quarter and beyond. And now, I hand it over to Dennis."
4222231,404017948,1075437,"Activision Blizzard, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Activision Blizzard, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Thomas. Q3 was another great quarter as we continue to see strong performance across our broad portfolio of leading franchises. Before we go into results, as we mentioned on our Q2 call, we have made changes to how we report non-GAAP financials. A",1942,"Thanks, Thomas. Q3 was another great quarter as we continue to see strong performance across our broad portfolio of leading franchises. Before we go into results, as we mentioned on our Q2 call, we have made changes to how we report non-GAAP financials. As reminder, our non-GAAP results no longer exclude the impact of deferrals. If you would like to calculate metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals to our non-GAAP as redefined figures.
Our segment results, however, are still presented, excluding the impact of deferrals like they always have been. This aligns with how Bobby, our management team and our board continues to review the business and our overall performance. With that backdrop, I'd like to first start with our segments as they are the engine behind our consolidated financial results.
Starting with Activision. On the back of strong Call of Duty engagement and the successful launch of Destiny's Rise of Iron in September, Activision delivered record Q3 operating income of $123 million and also achieved record year-to-date operating income of $309 million, up 27% versus last year. Blizzard delivered Q3 segment revenues of $727 million, which were nearly double last year's Q3 performance. This also helped fuel record third quarter segment operating income of $321 million, which is up 2.5x versus Q3 of last year. And year-to-date Blizzard segment revenue of $1.8 billion is up 59% versus last year and operating income of $740 million is up 93% versus last year.
I want to pause here for a second and mention that, just the Activision Blizzard segments, so excluding King, also set a Q3 and year-to-date record for our combined segment revenue and operating income. Notably, this performance drove year-over-year organic growth for Activision and Blizzard segments of 15% for the quarter and 22% year-to-date. Operating income grew even faster year-over-year, increasing 78% for the quarter and 67% year-to-date.
Turning to King. As expected, revenues were down slightly quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. But as Thomas noted, importantly, the Candy Crush franchise and mobile overall performed well with bookings growth year-over-year. King's operating income was down this quarter, mainly due to marketing costs related to the launch of Farm Heroes Super Saga as well investments we are making in our promising advertising business.
Let's now turn to our consolidated results and raised outlook for the full year of 2016. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP as redefined measures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations.
For the quarter, we generated record Q3 GAAP revenues of $1.57 billion, $78 million above our August guidance and $578 million or 58% above Q3 last year. The net effect of deferred revenue was $62 million for the quarter and also above guidance of $45 million. We generated GAAP EPS of $0.26. That is $0.20 above guidance, of which $0.10 is related to the timing of our call premium, which I will discuss in more detail later when I cover the balance sheet.
We generated record Q3 non-GAAP as redefined EPS of $0.49, $0.10 above guidance and more than double the $0.20 we generated in Q3 of last year. The impact of deferrals on non-GAAP as redefined EPS was $0.03 and above guidance of $0.01. The overperformance in the quarter versus guidance was driven by multiple factors, including Overwatch full game sales and in-game content, the strong performance of the World of Warcraft Legion expansion, as well as the continued strength in Call of Duty in-game content.
Turning to the specific P&L items. Please note that all percentages are based on revenues, except for the tax rate. For Q3, GAAP product cost were 22%, operating expenses were 59%. Interest expense was $63 million, including a $10 million GAAP loss upon refinancing of our term loan and our GAAP tax rate was 14%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average share count was 758 million shares, including participating securities.
On a non-GAAP basis as redefined, product costs were 22%, operating expenses were 43%, interest expense was $52 million and our non-GAAP tax rate was 24%. For the year-to-date, on a GAAP basis, we generated record revenues of $4.59 billion, up 39% year-over-year and operating margin of 21%, and EPS of $0.94. On a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we generated operating margin of 36% and record EPS of $1.52, up 45% year-over-year.
Digital momentum continued to be a strong business driver for yet another quarter, producing record Q3 digital revenues of $1.3 billion, growing 114% year-over-year and 18% quarter-over-quarter. As Thomas mentioned, nearly $1 billion of this came from in-game content sales alone and year-to-date digital player purchases were a record $2.8 billion.
Our strong overall digital performance drove non-GAAP operating margins to a Q3 record of 35%, up from 23% operating margin in Q3 of last year. The continued strength in digital provides not only a source of growth for our business, but also will continue to benefit future operating margins as well as cash flow performance.
In terms of cash flow, our strong business performance has led to record cash flow generation. In addition, our ability to directly engage our customers with continued content updates has helped further shift our business to more recurring and less seasonal revenue streams with Q3 and year-to-date records for EBITDA as well as operating and free cash flow.
This quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $456 million and free cash flow of $428 million after capital expenditures. Year-to-date, we delivered $1.3 billion of operating cash flow and $1.2 billion of free cash flow, both up dramatically year-over-year. Q3 non-GAAP, as redefined, adjusted EBITDA of $574 million was up 131% year-over-year.
Turning to the balance sheet. I'd like to start with a quick summary of the positive refinancing activity we completed this quarter. In August, we restructured our term loans, which not only allowed us to realize interest rate savings but moved us to a completely unsecured capital structure, which is more consistent with our investment-grade rating.
In addition, our positive credit rating trajectory continued to improve with yet another 1 notch upgrade for Moody's. This was our second upgrade from Moody's in less than 12 months on the back of our spring upgrade from S&P. All of this served as great tailwind as we headed into our debut investment-grade debt offering, which we completed on September 19.
We issued new 5- and 10-year notes which will replace our existing 2021 notes. Subsequent to closing, we exercised our call right on our 2021 notes, which had a 30-day notice period. Because of this, our Q3 balance sheet reflects a temporary increase in both cash and debt as the call notice to redeem our legacy 2021 notes straddled the quarter end.
Subsequent to quarter end, on October 19, we redeemed our legacy 2021 notes, inclusive of the call premium, which reduced both our cash and debt positions by approximately $1.5 billion. Also, please note that the call premium expense drove a $0.10 timing difference between Q3 and Q4 versus our guidance for GAAP EPS. This will not impact the full year and is merely a shift from Q3 to Q4 for GAAP only based on the settlement date.
We are very pleased with the reception of our new investment-grade notes and the overall progress we have on our capital structure since we first issued debt as part of the Vivendi buyback transaction 3 years ago. To put that progress in perspective, our gross debt levels are nearly equivalent to when we first issued debt in 2013. But since then, we have paid down more than $2.1 billion of debt, added King to our portfolio, moved to a fully unsecured investment-grade capital structure and decreased our blended cost of debt to under 3%, thanks to our strong performance and improved credit rating, the great progress on this front as well.
Regarding liquidity and cash, as adjusted for the subsequent $1.5 billion redemption of our legacy 2021 notes in October, we had approximately $2.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet with over $600 million held domestically.
Now let's turn and look forward to our outlook for Q4 and full year 2016. For Q4, on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.86 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $522 million, product costs of 27% and operating expenses of 61%. We expect GAAP interest expense of $129 million, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 765 million and EPS of $0.05. For Q4 on a non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we expect product costs of 27% and operating expenses of 47%. We expect a non-GAAP interest expense of $45 million, a tax rate of 30% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.40, including GAAP deferrals of $0.34.
Now let's take a look at our full year 2016 outlook. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.45 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $75 million, product costs of 24% and operating expenses of 57%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $313 million. Our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 17%, including tax rate impacts resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standards for simplification for share-based compensation. We expect 762 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP redefined, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.98, up $0.11 versus our previous guidance.
As we said on prior earnings calls, our GAAP earnings are expected to be down in 2016 versus prior year as our expected results will be impacted by additional accounting charges associated with the King transaction, which include, among other things, transaction-related costs and the amortization of intangibles resulting from purchase price accounting adjustments. The majority of these GAAP accounting charges will not impact the economics of our business or our cash flows, although they will have a material impact on our 2016 GAAP earnings results.
For 2016, on the non-GAAP basis, as redefined, we expect product costs of 24% and operating expenses of 43%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $213 million, a tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.92, up $0.09 from our previous guidance, including a GAAP deferral of $0.10, which is $0.03 higher than our previous guidance.
Again, if you would like to calculate non-GAAP as we previously defined it, revenues and EPS, you would simply add the impact of GAAP deferrals to GAAP revenues and to non-GAAP redefined EPS using the numbers I just quoted.
So on the back of our strong business momentum, from an EPS perspective, we're essentially passing through all of our Q3 overperformance for the full year in actuals and increased deferrals, whereas for revenue we are passing through roughly half of the Q3 beat [ph] largely due to small variations and FX rates versus our last guidance, particularly in Europe. Please see our press release for current FX assumptions.
In summary, as you can see, 2016 is shaping up to be a record year on the back of strong performance across our diverse franchise portfolio. Our underlying business fundamentals remain incredibly strong with our direct digital consumer connection powering deeper engagement and more opportunities for player investment in our franchises than ever before. In addition, we have great call options on promising long-term opportunities like eSports, advertising and consumer products.
So it's a great time to be in our business with so much opportunity in front of us. As always, we will continue to attack each opportunity with an emphasis on world-class execution and business excellence across all aspects of our organization.
Now I welcome our business leaders, Eric, Mike and Riccardo, as they join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?"

You hit on one of the hardest things in our business right now, which is really the prioritization of all the great opportunities we have in front of us. And first, I'd probably add one thing to your list which is probably biggest near-term opportunity, which is additional in-game content. As you've seen in our numbers, we've seen incredible growth in this area over the past several years, but we really think we're still only in the early stages here. And if we can do it right and not only drive additional player investment, it can also drive additional engagement as you deliver content to fans more frequently and consistently as we saw in Q3. So this is really an enormous opportunity just based on the current engagement that we have across our portfolio. We're also excited about many of the new opportunities that you mentioned. We are making good progress in our advertising business with King. And as Thomas mentioned earlier, we expect it to contribute next year and scale up in 2018. We're off to a very good start with our first TV show, Skylanders Academy, which just launched next weekend on Netflix, extremely high quality and is nice progress in that initiative. And as you heard Bobby say at the beginning of the call, we're incredibly excited about eSports and the opportunities we have in this space given our strong and known IP portfolio. You only have to look as far as BlizzCon this weekend to sort of see that in action. And this longer term is an enormous opportunity for the company. So across all these areas, we'll continue to manage our investments with the same discipline and prudence that we do in all parts of our business, but undoubtedly more opportunity in front us than we've ever had before.

In terms of Legion performance, it has matched or exceeded our prior expansion's launch performance across metrics like sales, player base and participation in value-added services. So we're very excited to see how players are reacting and engaging in the new content, including our new Legion mobile companion app. We're seeing players spend their time across a whole variety of activities. And with all the content that's available to them, we hopeful they'll have a lot to do for a long time. It is a big priority for us to continue to provide new content to Legion players. Last week, we released our first content patch for Legion, less than 2 months after the launch. This is the fastest that we've added a new major patch to a World of Warcraft expansion in the game's history. And it's also bigger than the initial content patch that we released for the last few expansions. Our players have reacted very positively so far. And we're looking forward to furthering the momentum that Legion has generated into BlizzCon, the holidays and beyond and following up with more content next year."

So as we mentioned, we're on track and really excited about what we think is going to be an awesome sequel for Destiny in 2017. No announcements today on timing just yet. But what I will say, that sequel is designed to both excite our highly engaged current players, but also to broaden the appeal even further, bringing in new fans and bringing back last fans as well. So that's our primary focus right now. Beyond that, in the past, I've mentioned that the incredible demand for Destiny content has somewhat outpaced our ability to deliver upon that demand. And going forward, along with our partners at Bungie, we've put together what we believe is a very smart approach that will allow us to deliver that steady stream of great content to keep our players engaged and keep the universe sort of alive and growing in the wake of that sequel."

Well, first of all, I think in terms of strategy, I think that we see that our focus on the top franchises is really paying off. And as we noted, while we see that with just slight decline in MAUs quarter-on-quarter, the mobile gross booking had grown or we managed to grow gross bookings year-on-year. And very importantly, the Candy Crush Saga franchise overall gross bookings also grew year-on-year. This is the result of hard work from the teams in the last titles, focusing on creating fresh new content, both through live operations, as we described in the past, and through launching new features. So this has resulted in #1, in increased engagement. And time spent per player has grown year-on-year, it's now over 30 minutes per day. And secondly, we have increased also the monetization per player. The average revenues per paying player has increased substantially year-on-year. So looking forward, the plan is to continue the investment in live games, creating more content, both through live ops and features. So we expect to focus not only, and have an impact, not only on retention of players, but also monetization. So both monetization and retention are key targets for those expansions. And secondly, we are also focusing on new games. We have a pipeline of new franchise titles to attract new and lapsed players, and we have one game in final stages of polish. It's shaping up well, and it's slated for a Q1 release."

First of all, I think it's obviously too early to make any comments on our annual release which hasn't released yet with Infinite Warfare. But I think that it is important that we think about Call of Duty as a year-round business, which is designed to have a steady stream of content throughout the year to keep our players engaged and obviously, our annual release, which is part of that engagement driving strategy. But when you do our jobs right on this franchise, we manage to keep people engaged year-round. And this year, we have definitely achieved that with record operating income, which Thomas mentioned for the franchise year-to-date. And I think probably the best is that's been accompanied with also a record in monthly active users. So in this case, engagement and the business are going hand in hand and helping one another. So on the annual release, as you know, we've modeled Infinite Warfare, which is a new sub-brand, down versus Black Ops III, which is our best established sub-brand, and that only makes sense given our historical patterns. But we think that we've delivered a great game that we think is going to do great over the holiday quarter. And it's huge innovation for our fans, and as you know, keeping a franchise that's been on top of -- for as long as Call of Duty has, fresh ever year is no easy task, and Infinity War has done that with Infinite Warfare, which is a ton of new experiences and game playing mechanics for our fans while also feeling -- giving that classic Call of Duty feel that our fans love. Second, Thomas mentioned, we think it's the most complete entertainment package in the industry. It's got a full campaign, the multiplayer builds upon one of the stickiest and most played multiplayer games in the world. And it's the first time that we've had  a full Zombies mode on the disc with the main release in a non-trailer title. We know there's a lot of fans who appreciate that. And of course, we have Modern Warfare Remastered for those who -- for those of our fans who wanted the classic Call of Duty gameplay with our best bonus content ever in our collector's edition. So overall, we feel really good about both the quality and the breadth and the variety of the content that we're putting in the marketplace. We think we're going to have a strong quarter."

As I said in the past, we believe that advertising is an attractive opportunity to monetize nonpaying players. And we see that because of the size of the network, and also because the players are so engaged on our network, that the interest from high-quality brand advertisers is very strong. So we want to take this opportunity. There's a lot to do to take this opportunity. And the teams are working hard as we speak, on one side, on building the inventory, and on the other side, we are building the team and the infrastructure required to take this opportunity.

So, so far, we've released a new hero, new map, competitive play mode and we have more content in development. We're very excited about player reactions to the Overwatch shorts and the plans we have for Overwatch in eSports, which we'll discuss more at BlizzCon tomorrow. It's too early for me to discuss our plans for 2017. But what I can say is that the 2 events that we've had so far have shown us we have a great model for follow-on content. We found that it stimulates our audience and drives record engagement.
