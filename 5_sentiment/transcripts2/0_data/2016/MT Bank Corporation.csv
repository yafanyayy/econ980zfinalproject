The overall financial performance, the",2955,"Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call this morning. As noted on this morning's press release, we were pleased with our progress in what proved to be a very pleasing quarter. The overall financial performance, the strong, and we completed the -- we completed the merger with Hudson City Bancorp, which was immediately accretive to M&T's net operating earnings, with [indiscernible] capital ratios and tangible book value per share, in sync with our earlier projection. I'll review a few highlights of the quarter and the year including some perspective on how the merger impacted our results for the quarter. And then we'll share our thoughts on the outlook, after which, Don and I will be happy to take your questions. 
Turning to the results. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $1.65 for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with $1.93 in the third quarter and $1.92 a year earlier. The decline came as a result of merger-related charges in connection with the Hudson City transaction. Net income for the quarter was $271 million compared with $280 million in the linked quarter and $278 million in the year-ago quarter.
In order to insist -- assist investors in understanding the impact of merger activity on its financial results, M&T provided supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis in which we exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as expenses and gains associated with mergers and acquisitions. After-tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets were $6 million or $0.04 per share per common share in the recent quarter compared with $3 million and $0.02 per common share in the prior quarter and $4 million and $0.03 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase in the recent quarter reflects amortization associated with the $132 million of additional core deposit intangible created through the Hudson City merger.
Included in the fourth quarter results were significant merger-related charges, including $76 million of noninterest expenses and a $21 million provision for credit losses for the acquired Hudson City loan portfolio. I'll discuss the accounting for the acquired loans in a few moment. Combined, these items amounted to $61 million after-tax or $0.40 per common share. There were no such charges in the previous quarter or the year-earlier quarter.
M&T's net operating income for the fourth quarter, which excludes merger-related items in the intangible of amortization that I just mentioned, was $338 million, increased from $283 million in the linked quarter and $282 million in last year's fourth quarter. Diluted net opening earnings per share were $2.09 for the recent quarter, an increase of 7% from $1.95 in both the previous quarter and the year-ago quarter. 
Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible shareholders' equity, common shareholders' equity of 1.21% and 13.26% for the recent quarter. Comparable returns were 1.18% and 12.98% in the third quarter of 2015. 
In accordance with the SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity. 
Looking to the balance sheet and the income statement. Hudson City added about $24 billion of total assets after our restructuring, which included $19 billion of loans and $18 billion of deposits. 
Over the 4 days immediately after the closing, we retired $10.6 billion of Hudson City's borrowings, which was funded by the sale of $5.8 billion of investment securities and the remainder by Hudson City's cash on hand. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $813 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, up from $699 million in the linked quarter and $688 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase includes approximately $110 million of net interest income attributable to Hudson City. The net interest margin was 3.12% during the quarter, down 2 basis points from 3.14% in the third quarter. Our explanation of the decline is relatively simple this quarter. We estimates that the inclusion of Hudson City diminished the margin by about 3 basis points. 
On the core side -- on the core M&T side, we estimate there was 1 basis point expansion as pressure on the core margin was more than offset by rising short-term interest rates, which included an increase in short-term LIBOR rates in advance of the Fed's December action. 
Average total loans increased by $13.3 billion the from the linked quarter, primarily reflecting the partial quarter impact from Hudson City. 
Substantially all of the Hudson City loans are residential mortgage loans, thus the acquisition had limited impact on growth in the other loan categories. 
Growth in each of those other loan categories was solid. On an average basis compared to the linked quarter, C&I, commercial, and industrial loans increased an annualized 6%, aided by the seasonal rebound in auto footprint [ph], commercial real estate loans increased by about 9% annualized. Consumer loans grew an annualized 10%, reflecting continued growth in indirect auto. 
While lending conditions on the commercial side remain very competitive, with precious from both bank and nonbank lenders, loan demand remains healthy bolstered by repeat business with existing customers, who value our relationship approach to lending. 
We continue to see strong results in the commercial bank in our metropolitan region, which includes New York City as well as Pennsylvania and Baltimore, as well as Pennsylvania and Baltimore. Growth was somewhat softer in upstate and Western New York. 
Average core customer deposits, which excludes deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office, CDs over 250,000 in brokered deposits, increased 16% unannualized from the third quarter, primarily reflecting the impact from the acquisition. 
Noninterest income, referring to fees. Noninterest income or fee income totaled $448 million in the fourth quarter, up from $440 million in the linked quarter, contributing to fees from the contribution to fees from Hudson City was not significant. 
Mortgage banking revenues were $88 million in the fourth quarter compared with $84 million in the third quarter. Residential mortgage banking revenues declined by $6 million. The majority of which is attributable to a 23% reduction in residential mortgage loans originated for sale. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were up $10 million from the prior quarter, booking a solid quarter of multifamily FHA origination. 
Service charges on deposit accounts were $106 million, little change from $107 million in the third quarter. And trust income was $115 million in the recent quarter, slightly improved from $114 million from the previous quarter. 
All other revenues from operation were $144 million, up from $138 million in the third quarter. Both the third and fourth quarters of 2015 were characterized by particularly strong commercial lending-related fees. The recent quarter's results included higher levels of syndication fees, while the previous quarter's results included a sizable gain on previously leased equipment, which did not reoccur.
Turning to expenses. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter, which excludes the expense from the amortization of intangibles and merger-related expenses, was $701 million compared to $615 million in the third quarter. Those operating expenses included approximately $40 million attributable to Hudson City. The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization of merger-related expenses, improved to 55.5%, reflecting the 2-month impact from Hudson City. 
It is notable that on a full year-on-year basis, adjusting for the merger in the sizable contribution to the M&T Charitable Foundation made in this year's second -- the last year's second quarter, total operating expenses were down slightly from 2014. 
Next, let's turn to credit. Overall, credit quality remains strong. Nonaccrual loans at the end of 2015 were $799 million, up slightly from $787 million at September 30. The ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans was 91 basis points at year-end. A significant decline in that ratio from September 30 reflects the addition of Hudson City's loan portfolio. 
Net charge-offs for the fourth quarter were $36 million, improved from $40 million in the third quarter. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 18 basis points for the period, with the ratio also benefiting from the addition of the Hudson City portfolio total loans. The provision for credit losses was $58 million for the recent quarter, which includes the $21 million merger-related version I mentioned earlier. The allowance for credit losses was $956 million at the end of 2015 and reflects our assessment of the loss content in the loan portfolio. 
The ratio of allowance to total loans was 1.09%, which also reflects the addition of the Hudson City loan portfolio.
The loan loss allowance as of December 31 was 17x 2015 -- I'm sorry, was 7x 2015's net charge-offs. Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest, including loans acquired at a discount, were $273 million at the end of 2015. Of these loans, $232 million or 85% are guaranteed by government-related entities.
Before I leave credit, I would like to provide you with some background of the accounting for the loans that we acquired with Hudson City. As you know, GAAP requires acquired loans to be recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition with no carryover of the acquired entities' allowance for loan loss. 
Net fair value reflects the use of interest rate credit losses assumption in connection with Hudson City -- the Hudson City merger, we recorded $19 billion of Hudson City loans held for investment at their estimated fair value. Approximately $1 billion of those loans are classified as purchased impaired loans. We recorded a discount at par and are being accounted for under SOP 03-3. 
The fair value of the remaining $18 billion of acquired loans exceeded the outstanding loan balance, resulting in a net premium, which will be amortized over the remaining life of the loans as a reduction of interest income. GAAP does not allow the credit loss component of that premium to be bifurcated and accounted for as a nonaccreting difference, as was the case in previous acquisitions when all loans were deemed acquired at discount. 
GAAP also provided an allowance for credit losses and loans acquired at premium be recognized for incurred losses in that portfolio, even though in a homogeneous portfolio residential mortgage, loans to specific loans to to which those losses relate cannot be easily identified. M&T believes that this accounting requirement results in an additional provision for loan losses that was already factored in to the fair value of the loan at the date of acquisition -- at the acquisition date. As a result, the $21 million incremental provision has been characterized as a merger-related expense.
Hopefully, that's helpful. Turning to capital. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio under the transitional Basel III capital rules currently in effect was an estimated 11.06% and the end of the recent quarter, up from 10.08% at the end of September. Completion of the Hudson City merger added an estimated 80 basis points to that ratio. 
Tangible book value per share was 64.2 -- $64.28 at the end of 2015, up 5% from $61.22 at the end of September and up 13% from $57.06 at the end of 2014. 
As a point of comparison, over the past 5 years, M&T has grown tangible book outlook value per share at a compounded annual growth rate of over 14% through a combination of organic growth and prudently priced expansion. 
Next, I'd like to take a moment to cover the key highlights of 2015's results. GAAP-based diluted earnings per common share were $7.18 compared with $7.42 in 2014. Net income was $1.08 billion, up slightly from $1.07 billion in the prior year. And operating income, which excludes intangible amortization and the merger-related expenses, was $1.2 billion, improved from $1.1 billion in the prior year. Diluted net operating earnings per common share was $7.74, up from $7.57 in 2014. 
The net operating income for 2015 expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets average tangible common equity shareholders' equity was 1.18 and 13%, respectively. 
Before I turn to the outlook, as many of you have seen, January 6, the U.S. attorney in Delaware took an action -- took action against Wilmington Trust Corporation related to alleged conduct prior to M&T's acquisition of Wilmington Trust Corporation in 2011. As we the U.S. attorneys noted in his press release, this alleged activity relates solely to Wilmington Trust commercial banking operation during that time period. 
While we are limited in our ability to discuss this matter, it is important to note that we strongly believe that this unprecedented action is unjustified and Wilmington Trust intends to vigorously defend itself. 
Now turning to the outlook. Don and I were saying yesterday at the daunting pass, we undertake every January to offer you a projection of what we think would unfold over the coming year, but in retrospect, the thoughts we offered you on this call last year weren't too far off from what actually occurred. So here we go again. I should first note that the end-of-period balance sheet is more representative of our run rate balance sheet than the averages for the fourth quarter given the November 1 perspective date of the merger. 
During the fourth quarter, we saw a steady deposit of momentum in the lending environment. And as a result, including the newly acquired loans from Hudson City, we would expect low to mid-single-digit growth in total loans in 2016, with a slightly higher pace of growth in commercial and consumer loans, partially offset by contraction in the residential mortgage loans as we expect that the Hudson City portfolio will continue to pay down. 
The pace of payoff will obviously depend on interest rates. Our outlook for the net interest margin is dependent on further actions by the Federal Reserve. Given what the implied forward rate curve is telling us, we would expect the net -- net interest margin for the full year of 2016 to be stable or slightly better than what we reported in the fourth quarter. The full run rate impact from the addition to the -- of Hudson City's balance sheet will be a modest source of pressure early in the year. As we've seen over the past several years, the impact of cash balances brought in to Wilmington Trust could have an effect on the reported margin but will be additive to revenue.
Excluding the impact from the sale of the trade processing business in 2015's second quarter, both the $45 million gain and the single quarter of revenue we earned prior to the divestiture, we would expect flat to modest growth in noninterest expense and fees. We expect pressure on mortgage banking revenues in a higher rate environment. And continued industry-wide pressure on consumer service charges to be offset by growth and other fees, assisted, of course, by higher short-term rates. Regarding expenses, in light of the limited revenue opportunities, we're looking to the core expenses relatively contained, continued investment spending including technology investment offset with savings elsewhere as other projects are reaching completion. Our goal is to strive for positive operating leverage over the course of 2016.
As to Hudson City, we'd estimate that an additional $40 million to $50 million of expense reduction will result from further actions we expect to take over the first half of 2016, particularly the branch of systems conversion. This should also ultimately result in realizing the majority of our expense save -- our expected expense savings by June or, let's say, the first half of the year. 
Separately, we'd estimate that there are about $40 million of merger-related expenses remaining to be incurred, the majority coming over the first half of 2016. Aside from the national news on energy lending, which shouldn't have a material impact on us, we see no indication of a change in the credit cycle. Net charge-offs amounted to just 19 basis points for the second year in a row, which is roughly half the long-term average. But as we said on this call last year, our conservatism won't let us count on beating that figure in 2016.
Income tax expense in the fourth quarter included 4.6 --  a $4.6 million benefit from technology research credits related to the prior years grew 2014, which were accrued by the IRS in December. We'd note that, that provision in the tax code provided for such credits was extended by Congress in December. Any additional benefits in the future will depend on the size and type of technology investments that we make. 
As you know, the capital we submitted in connection with the 2015 CCAR process, which received no objection from the Fed, included $200 million of share repurchases in the first half of 2016. We expect to begin implementing that program shortly. 
Lastly, we will review our capital position with our board on both the nominal basis and under stress as we prepare our CCAR 2016 capital plan and stress test for submission to the regulators in early April. 
We have another year of earnings retention under our belts as well as the capital accretion from the merger. Looking forward, our expectation is that the Hudson City loan portfolio will continue to pay down, moderating our overall loan growth and thus, our pace of internal capital generation will remain high. Those are our thoughts. Hope you will find them helpful as the year unfolds. Let's now see what happens. 
Of course, as you are aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties, regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates and credit spreads, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future. 
Now let's open up the call, before, which, the instructor will briefly review the instructions."

At the end of the day, we'll put the money back into IT spending regardless of how much progress we make in other areas because we think it's really important. So we've talked about that for some time. When you think of the efficiency ratio and we think first of Hudson City, I've done the math, but you got one more -- one more month of Hudson City, right? So there's probably some additional impact on the efficiency ratio when you have full 3 months in the quarter. And then we have work to do to reduce the cost saves that we talked about. The one thing I would point out is it's not as if we're getting those cost saves on January 1, so you get the full year impact of $40 million to $50 million. That's the run rate impact that you're going to get on an annualized basis after you've taken the action. So that also should have an impact on the efficiency ratio. When I looked at our performance this past year, I think we did a pretty good job of managing expenses, but I also think quite frankly, that the improvements we saw on efficiency ratio comes from the fact that we did have growth in revenue in a pretty tough environment, and that's spread wide. And when you think about it, if you adjust for the charitable contribution and the gain from the divestiture, we were 57-something in the second quarter. We were 57 1 in the third quarter, and I think it's about 2 percentage points that Hudson City benefited in our average efficiency ratio. So we're running pretty well. We had a pretty good year on both sides of the equation."

I have a couple of lenders myself already, I have people introducing them to me, and they clearly fit the profile of people we would love to have a more full service banking relationship with. So I think that will take little time and I don't think we'll be hasty to do that at the outset of this year. But then separately, we do think there's a very large opportunity for full-service checking account relationships that we would typically hold and most of those relationships aren't just a checking account, they tend to have multiple products and services as we roll out our relationship baking approach.

I mean, I characterized it as strong because I think the numbers were pretty decent growth. But I also know that if I look to our loan committees, I think we had the second highest loan production in the fourth quarter on the commercial side that we've seen in several years before fourth quarter. So if things looked relatively healthy, and as a way of reference, and of course, I'm going to get this wrong, but I think year-over-year, we're going to be running at 4% and 4.5% loan growth or something like that. So I think there's really no sign that it's growing. In terms of the market, it's kind of interesting. So we characterized it to still be intensely competitive. And as other banks are really offering better pricing and then sometimes, structure then we're able to. But on the whole, pricing in most markets, like it's still coming down slightly. It's not stable, but it's still coming down. Smaller banks are routinely below 200 basis points in terms of margin, maybe 150 to 160 basis points. We're seeing places where there's no recourse, limited covenants and in some cases, people leaving due diligence. And so for us, when we look at the growth, a lot of times, what we're seeing is that we're able to do fairly well, but that's coming primarily from existing clients. And they really focus on the fact that we're relatively proactive. We spend a lot of time with them. We know their businesses, and we're fairly consistent regardless of what's happening in the environment. So those -- that's where most of our loans are coming from. And each market is a little different. And we're trying to sort of make sure that we avoid any pitfalls from that -- we're not chasing people in a particular market without the knowledge to take on that customer. I think I talked a little bit about -- I don't know if I have, I have the numbers somewhere, but we saw growth in -- primarily in Philadelphia, Tarrytown, New York region. We had growth that was above 4% [ph] annualized. On a year-over-year basis, that was about 6. We also saw Pennsylvania, it was about 4%. And Baltimore, Washington was about 2%. And remember, that Baltimore have been relatively slow for us. So we're pleased that that's actually conid to do pretty well. The opportunity is different in every market. In Upstate New York, which has been relatively slow, there's a huge construction boom and that's where most of the job energy is coming from. There's not in the other businesses, but that's what's driving it. But if you get down to Washington, D.C, it's a different set of factors. So it varies by region."

And obviously, we have to do a really good job of making sure that as we put Hudson City on to our systems, that all those capabilities at the conversion extend over too. So we're focused heavily on that. The other piece that I would put into perspective, which is not directly related to the agreement per se, is that we continue to just focus on all or the rest of our risk management. We think it's really important whether it be in compliance areas or whether it be in sort of modernizing or continuing to elevate our CCAR process. So that's where our focus is on.

We had an annual update that we do on our real estate and our board meeting in November before all that stuff came out. And it's sort of married. Everything we said and talked about are sort of mirroring what the Fed is saying, so those trends are definitely out there. I think one of the things that's clearly happening at this point in time, is that there's still not -- in the overall market, some markets may be different, but there's not yet an oversupply and to us, it's a bit of a warning that you got to keep -- you go to watch out for your underwriting. As you know, I mean, it's a great question to ask us, because we definitely have a concentration there, particularly in the New York City area. But we tend to not change our underwriting standards. So for example, if you look at our entire real estate book today, total CRE, whether it's in an owner-occupied or IRE, our loan to value is 59.5%. And in investment real estate, it's 58.3%. So our intention is to remain really conservative. We stress cap rate as we -- as we begin to -- as we underwrite --  as we start to look at what happened in that space. But having said that, if you were less sophisticated, if you were smaller, it does -- and given some of the things that we're seeing, I think that everybody's right to be concerned. You have to be very prudent. Having said that, there's a lot of great customers out there who are doing great projects, which can be underwritten at the right amount of risk and for the right price and those tend to be customers that we've known for a fairly long time."

We're obviously looking at our own statistics in terms of delinquencies including delinquent -- early stage of delinquencies, which have all been pretty quiet on the front. One of the things that we've -- that sort of piqued our interest is that obviously, you see in the market, the spreads for -- the high yield spreads are going up. And so when you take those out X-energy, one of the things we noticed that sort of that lower level -- lower tranches of the CMBS market since June of last year, they're up 200 basis points. And so actually, if you take high-yield bonds X-energy, they're up 200 basis points in that period. If you take CMBS there, up 200 basis pointes. The bank spreads are up a little over that same period, too. So we particularly look at that and then take a look at the underlying credit measure. The only place -- and it's not on M&T's book on a national level, where you see both higher spreads and higher delinquencies, is in the indirect auto space, and when we look at our book, maybe because it's so concentrated in the 700 FICO space up front plus, we've actually seen no deterioration there.

I think that you are -- our MO has typically been to be more cautious, which has resulted in slower growth when times are great and everybody's available to lend. And when you look at the market today, the one thing that I would say that we're saying is not only are all banks, large and small, but you've got the debt funds in the market, you got insurance companies back in the market, and you saw some of the trends that we are talking about. So in our minds, when we look at our reserves, for example, we tend to look at the idea that these loans are being underwritten, right, at historically -- there's more pressure on people to do deals in lower structure and those types of things. So that means the loss is inherent and all books are probably growing a little bit and when you get to these spaces. I guess, the other thing that I would say is what sometimes gives us pause, and then this year, we saw a couple of these things, when we look and we see that we've lost a customer and someone has taken our loan out that was actually a classified loan for us, right, that tends to worry us. So I take myself all the way back to the '80s. I remember lots of banks that were reporting no delinquency -- low delinquencies and no foreclosures, but when you look at the underlying reason, it was because somebody was willing to refinance that buyer out. And so all the losses were hidden. I don't think that changes. I don't think you can always see in the statistics, so you have to be very careful when times are good because that's when the difficult loans are made."

So we'll have to work our way through the CCAR and go through that process. Having said that, when you look at this, to us, it's one of the more important things.

As noted on this morning's press release, we were pleased with our progress in what proved to be a very busy quarter. The overall financial performance was strong, and we completed the merger with Hudson City Bancorp, which was immediately accretive to M&T's net operating earnings, risk-based capital ratios and tangible book value per share, in sync with our earlier projection. I'll review a few highlights of the quarter and the year, including some perspective on how the merger impacted our results for the quarter. And then we'll share our thoughts on the outlook. After which, Don and I would be happy to take your questions.
Turning to the results. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $1.65 for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with $1.93 in the third quarter and $1.92 a year earlier. The decline came as a result of merger-related charges in connection with the Hudson City transaction.
Net income for the quarter was $271 million compared with $280 million in the linked quarter and $278 million in the year ago quarter.
In order to insist -- assist investors in understanding the impact of merger activity on its financial results, M&T provided supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis in which we exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as expenses and gains associated with mergers and acquisitions.
After-tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets was $6 million or $0.04 per share -- per common share in the recent quarter compared with $3 million and $0.02 per common share in the prior quarter and $4 million and $0.03 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase in the recent quarter reflects amortization associated with $132 million of additional core deposit intangible created through the Hudson City merger.
Included in the fourth quarter results were significant merger-related charges, including $76 million of noninterest expenses and a $21 million provision for credit losses for the acquired Hudson City loan portfolio. I'll discuss the accounting for the acquired loans in a few moment. Combined, these items amounted to $61 million after tax or $0.40 per common share. There were no such charges in the previous quarter or the year earlier quarter.
M&T's net operating income for the fourth quarter, which excludes merger-related items in the intangible amortization that I just mentioned, was $338 million, increased from $283 million in the linked quarter and $282 million in last year's fourth quarter.
Diluted net operating earnings per share were $2.09 for the recent quarter, an increase of 7% from $1.95 in both the previous quarter and the year ago quarter.
Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible shareholders' equity -- common shareholders' equity of 1.21% and 13.26% for the recent quarter. Comparable returns were 1.18% and 12.98% in the third quarter of 2015.
In accordance with the SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.
Looking to the balance sheet and the income statement. Hudson City added about $24 billion of total assets after our restructuring, which included $19 billion of loans and $18 billion of deposits.
Over the 4 days immediately after the closing, we retired $10.6 billion of Hudson City's borrowings, which was funded by the sale of $5.8 billion of investment securities and the remainder by Hudson City's cash on hand.
Taxable equivalent net interest income was $813 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, up from $699 million in the linked quarter and $688 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase includes approximately a $110 million of net interest income attributable to Hudson City.
The net interest margin was 3.12% during the quarter, down 2 basis points from 3.14% in the third quarter. Our explanation of the decline is relatively simple this quarter: we estimate that the inclusion of Hudson City diminished the margin by about 3 basis points.
On the core side -- on the core M&T side, we estimate there was 1 basis point expansion as pressure on the core margin was more than offset by rising short-term interest rates, which included an increase in short-term LIBOR rates in advance of the fed's December action.
Average total loans increased by $13.3 billion the from the linked quarter, primarily reflecting the partial quarter impact from Hudson City. Substantially, all of the Hudson City loans are residential mortgage loans, thus, the acquisition had limited impact on growth in the other loan categories.
Growth in each of those other loan categories was solid. On an average basis compared to the linked quarter, C&I, commercial and industrial, loans increased an annualized 6% aided by the seasonal rebound in auto floor plan. Commercial real estate loans increased by about 9% annualized. Consumer loans grew an annualized 10%, reflecting continued growth in indirect auto.
While lending conditions on the commercial side remain very competitive, with pressures from both bank and nonbank lenders, loan demand remained healthy bolstered by repeat business with existing customers who value our relationship approach to lending.
We continue to see strong results in the commercial bank in our metropolitan region, which includes New York City as well as Pennsylvania and Baltimore. Growth was somewhat softer in Upstate and Western New York.
Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office, CDs over $250,000 in brokered deposits, increased 16% on annualized from the third quarter, primarily reflecting the impact from the acquisition.
Noninterest income -- referring to fees, noninterest income or fee income totaled $448 million in the fourth quarter, up from $440 million in the linked quarter. Contributing to fees from -- the contribution to fees from Hudson City was not significant.
Mortgage banking revenues were $88 million in the fourth quarter compared with $84 million in the third quarter. Residential mortgage banking revenues declined by $6 million. The majority of which is attributable to a 23% reduction in residential mortgage loans originated for sale. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were up $10 million from the prior quarter, reflecting solid -- a solid quarter of multifamily FHA origination.
Service charges on deposit accounts were $106 million, little change from $107 million in the third quarter. And trust income was $115 million in the recent quarter, slightly improved from $114 million in the previous quarter.
All other revenues from operation were $144 million, up from $138 million in the third quarter. Both the third and fourth quarters of 2015 were characterized by particularly strong commercial lending-related fees. The recent quarter's results included a higher -- higher levels of syndication fees, while the previous quarter's results included a sizable gain on previously leased equipment, which did not reoccur.
Turning to expenses. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter, which exclude the expense from the amortization of intangibles and merger-related expenses, was $701 million compared to $615 million in the third quarter. Those operating expenses included approximately $40 million attributable to Hudson City.
The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related expenses, improved to 55.5%, reflecting the 2-month impact from Hudson City.
It is notable that on a full year-on-year basis, adjusting for the merger and the sizable contribution to the M&T Charitable Foundation made in this year's second -- last year's second quarter, total operating expenses were down slightly from 2014.
Next, let's turn to credit. Overall, credit quality remained strong. Nonaccrual loans at the end of 2015 were $799 million, up slightly from $787 million at September 30. The ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans was 91 basis points at year end. The significant decline in that ratio from September 30 reflects the addition of Hudson City's loan portfolio.
Net charge-offs for the fourth quarter were $36 million, improved from $40 million in the third quarter. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 18 basis points for the period with the ratio also benefiting from the addition of the Hudson City portfolio to total loans. The provision for credit losses was $58 million for the recent quarter, which includes the $21 million merger-related provision I mentioned earlier. The allowance for credit losses was $956 million at the end of 2015 and reflects our assessment of the loss content in the loan portfolio. The ratio of allowance to total loans was 1.09%, which also reflects the addition of the Hudson City loan portfolio.
The loan loss allowance as of December 31 was 17x 2015 -- I'm sorry, was 7x 2015's net charge-offs. Loans 90 days past due, on which we continue to accrue interest, including loans acquired at a discount, were $273 million at the end of 2015. Of these loans, $232 million or 85% are guaranteed by government-related entities.
Before I leave credit, I'd like to provide you with some background on the accounting for the loans that we acquired with Hudson City. As you know, GAAP requires acquired loans to be recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition with no carryover of the acquired entities' allowance for loan losses. Net fair value reflects the use of interest rate and credit loss assumption. And in connection with Hudson City -- the Hudson City merger, we recorded $19 billion of Hudson City loans held for investment at their estimated fair value. Approximately $1 billion of those loans are classified as purchased impaired loans, were recorded at a discount to par and are being accounted for under SOP 03-3.
The fair value of the remaining $18 billion of acquired loans exceeded the outstanding loan balance, resulting in a net premium, which will be amortized over the remaining lives of the loans as a reduction of interest income. GAAP does not allow the credit loss component of that premium to be bifurcated and accounted for as a nonaccreting difference, as was the case in previous acquisitions when all loans were deemed acquired at discount.
GAAP also provides that an allowance for credit losses on loans acquired at premium be recognized for incurred losses in that portfolio, even though in a homogeneous portfolio residential mortgages, loans -- the specific loans to which those losses relate cannot be easily identified. M&T believes that this accounting requirement results in an additional provision for loan losses that was already factored in to the fair value of the loans at the date of acquisition -- at the acquisition date. As a result, the $21 million incremental provision has been characterized as a merger-related expense.
Hopefully, that's helpful. Turning to capital. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio under the transitional Basel III capital rules currently in effect was an estimated 11.06% at the end of the recent quarter, up from 10.08% at the end of September. Completion of the Hudson City merger added an estimated 80 basis points to that ratio.
Tangible book value per share was 64.2 -- $64.28 at the end of 2015, up 5% from $61.22 at the end of September and up 13% from $57.06 at the end of 2014.
As a point of comparison, over the past 5 years, M&T has grown tangible book value per share at a compounded annual growth rate of over 14% through a combination of organic growth and prudently priced expansion.
Next, I'd like to take a moment to cover the key highlights of 2015's results. GAAP-based diluted earnings per common share were $7.18 compared with $7.42 in 2014. Net income was $1.08 billion, up slightly from $1.07 billion in the prior year. Net operating income, which excludes intangible amortization and the merger-related expenses, was $1.2 billion, improved from $1.1 billion in the prior year. Diluted net operating earnings per common share was $7.74, up from $7.57 in 2014. Net operating income for 2015 expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common equity -- shareholders' equity was 1.18% and 13%, respectively.
Before I turn to the outlook, as many of you have seen, on January 6, the U.S. attorney in Delaware took an action -- took action against Wilmington Trust Corporation related to alleged conduct prior to M&T's acquisition of Wilmington Trust Corporation in 2011. As the U.S. attorney noted in his press release, this alleged activity relates solely to Wilmington Trust commercial banking operations during that time period.
While we are limited in our ability to discuss this matter, it is important to note that we strongly believe that this unprecedented action is unjustified and Wilmington Trust intends to vigorously defend itself.
Now turning to the outlook. As Don and I were saying yesterday at the daunting pass, we undertake every January to offer you a projection of what we think will unfold over the coming year. But in retrospect, the thoughts we offered you on this call last year weren't too far off from what actually occurred. So here we go again. I should first note that the end-of-period balance sheet is more representative of our run rate balance sheet than the averages for the fourth quarter given the November 1 effective date of the merger.
During the fourth quarter, we saw a steady deposit of momentum in the lending environment. And as a result, including the newly acquired loans from Hudson City, we would expect low to mid-single-digit growth in total loans in 2016 with a slightly higher pace of growth in commercial and consumer loans, partially offset by contraction in the residential mortgage loans as we expect that the Hudson City portfolio will continue to pay down.
The pace of payoff will obviously depend on interest rates. Our outlook for the net interest margin is dependent on further actions by the Federal Reserve. Given what the implied forward rate curve is telling us, we'd expect the net  interest margin for the full year of 2016 to be stable or slightly better than what we reported in the fourth quarter. The full run rate impact from the addition to the -- of Hudson City's balance sheet will be a modest source of pressure early in the year. As we have -- as we've seen over the past several years, the impact of cash balances brought into Wilmington Trust could have an effect on the reported margin but would be additive to revenue.
Excluding the impact from the sale of the trade processing business in 2015's second quarter, both the $45 million gain and the single quarter of revenue we earned prior to the divestiture, we would expect flat to modest growth in noninterest expense and fees. We expect pressure on mortgage banking revenues in a higher rate environment and continued industry-wide pressure on consumer service charges to be offset by growth in other fees, assisted, of course, by higher short-term rates.
Regarding expenses, in light of the limited revenue opportunities, we're looking to keep core expenses relatively contained, continued investment spending, including technology investment, offset with savings elsewhere as other projects reached completion. Our goal is to strive for positive operating leverage over the course of 2016.
As to Hudson City, we had estimate that an additional $40 million to $50 million of expense reductions will result from further actions we expect to take over the first half of 2016, particularly the branch and systems conversion. These should also ultimately result in realizing the majority of our expense save -- our expected expense savings by June or, let's say, the first half of the year.
Separately, we'd estimate that there are about $40 million of merger-related expenses remaining to be incurred, the majority coming over the first half of 2016.
Aside from the national news on energy lending, which shouldn't have a material impact on us, we see no indication of a change in the credit cycle. Net charge-offs amounted to just 19 basis points for the second year in a row, which is roughly half the long-term average. But as we said on this call last year, our conservatism won't let us count on beating that figure in 2016.
Income tax expense in the fourth quarter included 4.6 --  a $4.6 million benefit from technology research credits related to prior years through 2014, which were approved by the IRS in December. We'd note that, that -- that the provision in the tax code providing from such credits was extended by Congress in December. Any additional benefits in the future will depend on the size and type of technology investments that we make.
As you know, the capital plan we submitted in connection with the 2015 CCAR process, which received no objection from the fed, included $200 million of share repurchases in the first half of 2016. We expect to begin implementing that program shortly.
Lastly, we will review our capital position with our board on a -- on both a nominal basis and under stress as we prepare our CCAR 2016 capital plan and stress test for submission to the regulators in early April. We've got another year of earnings retention under our belts as well as the capital accretion from the merger. Looking forward, our expectation is that the Hudson City loan portfolio will continue to pay down, moderating our overall loan growth, and thus, our pace of internal capital generation will remain high.
Those are our thoughts. Hope you'll find them helpful as you -- as the year unfolds. Let's see what's -- let's now see what happens.
Of course, as you're aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties, various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates and credit spreads, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.
Now let's open up the call, before which, the instructor will briefly review the instructions."

At the end of the day, we'll put the money back into IT spending regardless of how much progress we make in other areas because we think it's really important. So we've talked about that for some time. On the -- when you think of the efficiency ratio and you think first of Hudson City, I haven't done the math, but you got one more -- one more month of Hudson City, right? So there's probably some additional impact on the efficiency ratio when you have full 3 months in the quarter. And then we have work to do to reduce -- get the cost saves that we talked about. The one thing I would point out is that it's not as if we're getting those cost saves on January 1, right, so you get the full year impact of $40 million to $50 million. That's the run rate impact that you're going to get on an annualized basis after you've taken the action. So that also should have an impact on the efficiency ratio. When I look at our performance this past year, I think we did a pretty good job of managing expenses, but I also think quite frankly, the improvements we saw on efficiency ratio come from the fact that we did have growth in revenue in a pretty tough environment, and that spread widened. And when you think about it, if you adjust for the charitable contribution and the gain from the divestiture, we were 57-something in the second quarter. We were 57.1 in the third quarter, and I think it's about 2 percentage points that Hudson City benefited our efficiency ratio. So we're running pretty well.

So we've got this very, very large base of deposit customers who are primarily, hold the CDs. So they're single service households for us. And in that group, we don't have a big interest in necessarily rationalizing the pricing, so to speak, because we really would like to get to know those customers. I've got a couple of lenders myself already, a couple of people introducing them to me, and they just clearly fit the profile of people we would love to have a more full-service banking relationship with. So I think that will take little time, and I don't think we'll be hasty to do that at the outset of this year. But then separately, we do think there's a very large opportunity for full-service checking account relationships that we would typically hold and most of those relationships aren't just a checking account, they tend to have multiple products and services as we roll out our relationship banking approach. So it's sort of 2 and quite frankly, really what we're trying to do is we get a nice shot of an introduction to those customers, and we will be trying to convince them that we should be their primary bank for all of their deposit services. So that means you can't move too quickly to just -- to treat it as a financial asset. It's -- they're customers."

So that's a little different than what we've seen so far with that accounting with the discounts that were in prior discounting. As you bring it over the premium, like you said, you already had the negative accounted for, but now you also had to put an allowance.

I mean, I characterized it as strong because I think the numbers were pretty decent growth. But I also know that if I look to our loan committees, I think we had the second highest loan production in the fourth quarter on the commercial side that we've seen in several years before fourth quarter. So things look relatively healthy, and as a way of reference, and of course, I'm going to get this wrong, but I think year-over-year, we're been running at 4% or 4.5% loan growth or something like that. So I think there's really no sign that it's growing. In terms of the market, it's kind of interesting. So we characterize it to still be intensely competitive, as other banks are really offering better pricing and then sometimes, structure than we're able to. But on the whole, pricing in most markets, like it's still coming down slightly. It's not stable, but it's still coming down. Smaller banks are routinely below 200 basis points in terms of margin, maybe 150 to 160 basis points. We're seeing crisis where there's no recourse, limited covenants and in some cases, people waiving due diligence. And so for us, when we look at the growth, a lot of times what we're seeing is that we're able to do fairly well, but that's coming primarily from existing clients. And they really focus on the fact that we're relatively proactive. We spend a lot of time with them. We know their businesses, and we're fairly consistent regardless of what's happening in the environment. So those -- that's where most of our loans are coming from. And each market is a little different. And we're trying to sort of make sure that we avoid any pitfalls from that like we're not chasing people in a particular market without the knowledge to take on that customer. I think I talked a little bit about -- I don't know if I have, I have the numbers somewhere, but we saw growth in -- primarily in Philadelphia, Tarrytown, New York region. We had growth that was about 4% annualized. On a year-over-year basis, that was about 6. We also saw Pennsylvania, it was about 4%. And Baltimore, Washington was about 2%. And remember that Baltimore had been relatively slow for us. So we're pleased that that's actually continued to do pretty well. The opportunity is different in every market. In Upstate New York, which has been relatively slow, there's a huge construction boom and that's where most of the job energy is coming from. There's knock-on effects in the other businesses, but that's what's driving it. But if you get down to Washington, D.C, it's a different set of factors. So it varies by region."

And obviously, we have to do a really good job of making sure that as we put Hudson City on to our systems, that all those capabilities at the conversion extend over too. So we're focused heavily on that. The other piece that I would put into perspective, which is not directly related to the written agreement per se, is that we continue to just focus on all of the rest of our risk management. We think it's really important whether it be in the compliance areas or whether it be in sort of modernizing or continuing to elevate our CCAR process. So that's where our focus is on.

We had an annual update that we do on our real estate and our board meeting in November before all that stuff came out. And it sort of mirrored. Everything we said and talked about sort of mirrored what the Fed is saying, so those trends are definitely out there. I think one of the things that's clearly happening at this point in time, is that there's still not -- in the overall market, some markets may be different, but there's not yet an oversupply and to us, it's a bit of a warning that you got to keep -- you go to watch out for your underwriting. As you know, I mean, it's a great question to ask us, because we definitely have a concentration there, particularly in the New York City area. But we tend to not change our underwriting standards. So for example, if you look at our entire real estate book today, total CRE, whether it's in an owner-occupied or IRE, our loan to value is 59.5%. And in investment real estate, it's 58.3%. So our intention is to remain really conservative. We stress cap rates as we -- as we begin to -- as we underwrite to look at what might happen in that space. But having said that, I think, if you were less sophisticated, if you were smaller, it does -- and given some of the things that we're seeing, I think everybody's right to be concerned. You've got to be very prudent. Having said that, there are a lot of great customers out there who are doing great projects, which can be underwritten at the right amount of risk and for the right price and those tend to be customers that we've known for a fairly long time."

One of the things that we've -- that sort of piqued our interest is that obviously, you see in the market, the spreads for -- the high-yield spreads going up. And so when you take those out ex energy, one of the things we noted is that sort of in that lower level -- lower tranches of the CMBS market since June of last year, they're up 200 basis points. And so actually, if you take high-yield bonds ex energy, they're up 200 basis points in that period. If you take CMBS, they're up 200 basis points. Bank spreads are up a little over that same period, too. So we particularly look at that and then take a look at the underlying credit metrics. The only place -- and it's not in M&T's book, on a national level, where you see both higher spreads and higher delinquencies, is in the indirect auto space, and when we look at our book, maybe because it's so concentrated in the 700 FICO space up plus, we've actually seen no deterioration there.

I think -- look, I think that you -- our MO has typically been to be more cautious, which has resulted in slower growth when times are great and everybody's available to lend. And when you look at the market today, the one thing that I would say that we're seeing is not only are all banks healthy, large and small, but you've got the debt funds in the market, you've got the insurance companies back in the market, and you saw some of the trends that we're talking about. So in our minds, when we look at our reserves, for example, we tend to look at the idea that these loans are being underwritten, right, at historically -- there's more pressure on people to do deals in lower structure and those types of things. So that means the loss is inherent and all books are probably growing a little bit when you get to these spaces. I guess, the other thing that I would say is what sometimes gives us pause, and this year, we saw a couple of these things. When we look and we see that we've lost a customer and someone has taken our loan out that was actually a classified loan for us, right, that tends to worry us. If I take myself all the way back to the '80s, I remember lots of banks that were reporting no -- low delinquencies and no foreclosures, but when you look at the underlying reason, it was because somebody was willing to refinance that buyer out. And so all the losses were hidden. I don't think that changes. I don't think you can always see in your statistics. So you have to be very careful when times are good because that's when the difficult loans are made."

But as you can see, we're well above that. We're above that because of a couple of things. Obviously, the transaction. But now, we're generating capital at very, very high rate and so our thought process is that our optimal capital structure is definitely lower than where it's at today.

And I guess the reason for that is that when we think about technology, we've kind of shortcut it a bit. We've talked about just IT, but it's not just sort of buying a system and putting it in. We're doing a lot of process change. So for example, in the wealth and institutional services division in Wilmington, we're looking a lot at the different capture systems when a customer gets onboarded and going from that end and streamlining and changing the process, which involves automation. So it's not like you just sort of turn the spigot on very fast. It will be a gradual rise, and we've been focusing on that a couple of quarters. So I don't know, so I don't think huge jump, tens of millions, maybe, but not a huge jump, and we'll probably talk about it more as we get through 2016."

The overall financial performance was stro",2965,"Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call this morning. As noted on this morning's press release, we were pleased with our progress in what proved to be a very busy quarter. The overall financial performance was strong, and we completed the merger with Hudson City Bancorp, which was immediately accretive to M&T's net operating earnings, risk-based capital ratios and tangible book value per share, in sync with our earlier projection. I'll review a few highlights of the quarter and the year, including some perspective on how the merger impacted our results for the quarter. And then we'll share our thoughts on the outlook. After which, Don and I would be happy to take your questions.
Turning to the results. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $1.65 for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with $1.93 in the third quarter and $1.92 a year earlier. The decline came as a result of merger-related charges in connection with the Hudson City transaction. Net income for the quarter was $271 million compared with $280 million in the linked quarter and $278 million in the year ago quarter. In order to insist -- assist investors in understanding the impact of merger activity on its financial results, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis in which we exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as expenses and gains associated with mergers and acquisitions.
After-tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets was $6 million or $0.04 per share -- per common share in the recent quarter compared with $3 million and $0.02 per common share in the prior quarter and $4 million and $0.03 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase in the recent quarter reflects amortization associated with $132 million of additional core deposit intangible created through the Hudson City merger.
Included in the fourth quarter results were significant merger-related charges, including $76 million of noninterest expenses and a $21 million provision for credit losses for the acquired Hudson City loan portfolio. I'll discuss the accounting for the acquired loans in a few moment. Combined, these items amounted to $61 million after tax or $0.40 per common share. There were no such charges in the previous quarter or the year earlier quarter.
M&T's net operating income for the fourth quarter, which excludes merger-related items and the intangible amortization that I just mentioned, was $338 million, increased from $283 million in the linked quarter and $282 million in last year's fourth quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per share were $2.09 for the recent quarter, an increase of 7% from $1.95 in both the previous quarter and the year ago quarter. Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible shareholders' equity -- common shareholders' equity of 1.21% and 13.26% for the recent quarter. Comparable returns were 1.18% and 12.98% in the third quarter of 2015. In accordance with the SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.
Looking to the balance sheet and the income statement. Hudson City added about $24 billion of total assets after our restructuring, which included $19 billion of loans and $18 billion of deposits. Over the 4 days immediately after the closing, we retired $10.6 billion of Hudson City's borrowings, which was funded by the sale of $5.8 billion of investment securities and the remainder by Hudson City's cash on hand. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $813 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, up from $699 million in the linked quarter and $688 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase includes approximately $110 million of net interest income attributable to Hudson City. The net interest margin was 3.12% during the quarter, down 2 basis points from 3.14% in the third quarter. Our explanation of the decline is relatively simple this quarter: we estimate that the inclusion of Hudson City diminished the margin by about 3 basis points.
On the core side -- on the core M&T side, we estimate there was 1 basis point expansion as pressure on the core margin was more than offset by rising short-term interest rates, which included an increase in short-term LIBOR rates in advance of the Fed's December action. Average total loans increased by $13.3 billion from the linked quarter, primarily reflecting the partial quarter impact from Hudson City. Substantially all of the Hudson City loans are residential mortgage loans, thus the acquisition had limited impact on growth in the other loan categories. Growth in each of those other loan categories was solid. On an average basis compared to the linked quarter, C&I, commercial and industrial loans increased an annualized 6% aided by the seasonal rebound in auto floor plan; commercial real estate loans increased by about 9% annualized; consumer loans grew an annualized 10%, reflecting continued growth in indirect auto.
While lending conditions on the commercial side remain very competitive, with pressures from both bank and nonbank lenders, loan demand remained healthy bolstered by repeat business with existing customers who value our relationship approach to lending. We continue to see strong results in the commercial bank in our metropolitan region, which includes New York City as well as Pennsylvania and Baltimore. Growth was somewhat softer in Upstate and Western New York. Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office, CDs over $250,000 in brokered deposits, increased 16% on annualized from the third quarter, primarily reflecting the impact from the acquisition.
Noninterest income -- referring to fees, noninterest income or fee income totaled $448 million in the fourth quarter, up from $440 million in the linked quarter. Contributing to fees from -- the contribution to fees from Hudson City was not significant. Mortgage banking revenues were $88 million in the fourth quarter compared with $84 million in the third quarter. Residential mortgage banking revenues declined by $6 million, the majority of which is attributable to a 23% reduction in residential mortgage loans originated for sale. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were up $10 million from the prior quarter, reflecting solid -- a solid quarter of multifamily FHA origination.
Service charges on deposit accounts were $106 million, little change from $107 million in the third quarter. And trust income was $115 million in the recent quarter, slightly improved from $114 million in the previous quarter. All other revenues from operation were $144 million, up from $138 million in the third quarter. Both the third and fourth quarters of 2015 were characterized by particularly strong commercial lending-related fees. The recent quarter's results included a -- higher levels of syndication fees, while the previous quarter's results included a sizable gain on previously leased equipment, which did not reoccur.
Turning to expenses. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter, which exclude the expense from the amortization of intangibles and merger-related expenses, was $701 million compared to $650 million in the third quarter. Those operating expenses included approximately $40 million attributable to Hudson City. The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization and the merger-related expenses, improved to 55.5%, reflecting the 2-month impact from Hudson City. It is notable that on a full year-on-year basis, adjusting for the merger and the sizable contribution to the M&T Charitable Foundation made in this year's second -- last year's second quarter, total operating expenses were down slightly from 2014.
Next, let's turn to credit. Overall, credit quality remained strong. Nonaccrual loans at the end of 2015 were $799 million, up slightly from $787 million at September 30. The ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans was 91 basis points at year end. The significant decline in that ratio from September 30 reflects the addition of Hudson City's loan portfolio. Net charge-offs for the fourth quarter were $36 million, improved from $40 million in the third quarter. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 18 basis points for the period with the ratio also benefiting from the addition of the Hudson City portfolio to total loans. 
The provision for credit losses was $58 million for the recent quarter, which includes the $21 million merger-related provision I mentioned earlier. The allowance for credit losses was $956 million at the end of 2015 and reflects our assessment of the loss content in the loan portfolio. The ratio of allowance to total loans was 1.09%, which also reflects the addition of the Hudson City loan portfolio. The loan loss allowance as of December 31 was 17x 2015 -- I'm sorry, was 7x 2015's net charge-offs. Loans 90 days past due, on which we continue to accrue interest, including loans acquired at a discount, were $273 million at the end of 2015. Of these loans, $232 million or 85% are guaranteed by government-related entities.
Before I leave credit, I'd like to provide you with some background on the accounting for the loans that we acquired with Hudson City. As you know, GAAP requires acquired loans to be recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition with no carryover of the acquired entities' allowance for loan losses. Net fair value reflects the use of interest rate and credit loss assumption. And in connection with Hudson City -- the Hudson City merger, we recorded $19 billion of Hudson City loans held for investment at their estimated fair value. Approximately $1 billion of those loans are classified as purchased impaired loans, were recorded at a discount to par and are being accounted for under SOP 03-3.
The fair value of the remaining $18 billion of acquired loans exceeded the outstanding loan balance, resulting in a net premium, which will be amortized over the remaining lives of the loans as a reduction of interest income. GAAP does not allow the credit loss component of that premium to be bifurcated and accounted for as a non-accreting difference, as was the case in previous acquisitions when all loans were deemed acquired at discount.
GAAP also provides that an allowance for credit losses on loans acquired at premium be recognized for incurred losses in that portfolio, even though in a homogeneous portfolio residential mortgages, loans -- the specific loans to which those losses relate cannot be easily identified. M&T believes that this accounting requirement results in an additional provision for loan losses that was already factored in to the fair value of the loans at the date of acquisition -- at the acquisition date. As a result, the $21 million incremental provision has been characterized as a merger-related expense. Hopefully, that's helpful. 
Turning to capital. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio under the transitional Basel III capital rules currently in effect was an estimated 11.06% at the end of the recent quarter, up from 10.08% at the end of September. Completion of the Hudson City merger added an estimated 80 basis points to that ratio. Tangible book value per share was 64.2 -- $64.28 at the end of 2015, up 5% from $61.22 at the end of September and up 13% from $57.06 at the end of 2014. As a point of comparison, over the past 5 years, M&T has grown tangible book value per share at a compounded annual growth rate of over 14% through a combination of organic growth and prudently priced expansion.
Next, I'd like to take a moment to cover the key highlights of 2015's results. GAAP-based diluted earnings per common share were $7.18 compared with $7.42 in 2014. Net income was $1.08 billion, up slightly from $1.07 billion in the prior year. Net operating income, which excludes intangible amortization and the merger-related expenses, was $1.2 billion, improved from $1.1 billion in the prior year. Diluted net operating earnings per common share was $7.74, up from $7.57 in 2014. Net operating income for 2015 expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common equity -- shareholders' equity was 1.18% and 13%, respectively.
Before I turn to the outlook, as many of you have seen, on January 6, the U.S. attorney in Delaware took an action -- took action against Wilmington Trust Corporation related to alleged conduct prior to M&T's acquisition of Wilmington Trust Corporation in 2011. As the U.S. attorney noted in his press release, this alleged activity relates solely to Wilmington Trust commercial banking operations during that time period. While we are limited in our ability to discuss this matter, it is important to note that we strongly believe that this unprecedented action is unjustified and Wilmington Trust intends to vigorously defend itself.
Now turning to the outlook. As Don and I were saying yesterday, it's a daunting task we undertake every January to offer you a projection of what we think will unfold over the coming year. But in retrospect, the thoughts we offered you on this call last year weren't too far off from what actually occurred. So here we go again. I should first note that the end-of-period balance sheet is more representative of our run rate balance sheet than the averages for the fourth quarter given the November 1 effective date of the merger.
During the fourth quarter, we saw a steady deposit of momentum in the lending environment. And as a result, including the newly acquired loans from Hudson City, we would expect low to mid-single-digit growth in total loans in 2016 with a slightly higher pace of growth in commercial and consumer loans, partially offset by contraction in the residential mortgage loans as we expect that the Hudson City portfolio will continue to pay down. The pace of payoff will obviously depend on interest rates. 
Our outlook for the net interest margin is dependent on further actions by the Federal Reserve. Given what the implied forward rate curve is telling us, we'd expect the net interest margin for the full year of 2016 to be stable or slightly better than what we reported in the fourth quarter. The full run rate impact from the addition to the -- of Hudson City's balance sheet will be a modest source of pressure early in the year. As we've seen over the past several years, the impact of cash balances brought into Wilmington Trust could have an effect on the reported margin but would be additive to revenue.
Excluding the impact from the sale of the trade processing business in 2015's second quarter, both the $45 million gain and the single quarter of revenue we earned prior to the divestiture, we would expect flat to modest growth in noninterest expense and fees. We expect pressure on mortgage banking revenues in a higher rate environment and continued industry-wide pressure on consumer service charges to be offset by growth in other fees, assisted, of course, by higher short-term rates.
Regarding expenses, in light of the limited revenue opportunities, we're looking to keep core expenses relatively contained, continued investment spending, including technology investment, offset with savings elsewhere as other projects reach completion. Our goal is to strive for positive operating leverage over the course of 2016. As to Hudson City, we had estimate that an additional $40 million to $50 million of expense reductions will result from further actions we expect to take over the first half of 2016, particularly the branch and systems conversion. These should ultimately result in realizing the majority of our expense save -- our expected expense savings by June or, let's say, the first half of the year. 
Separately, we'd estimate that there are about $40 million of merger-related expenses remaining to be incurred, the majority coming over the first half of 2016. Aside from the national news on energy lending, which shouldn't have a material impact on us, we see no indication of a change in the credit cycle. Net charge-offs amounted to just 19 basis points for the second year in a row, which is roughly half the long-term average. But as we said on this call last year, our conservatism won't let us count on beating that figure in 2016.
Income tax expense in the fourth quarter included 4.6 --  a $4.6 million benefit from technology research credits related to prior years through 2014, which were approved by the IRS in December. We'd note that the provision in the tax code providing from such credits was extended by Congress in December. Any additional benefits in the future will depend on the size and type of technology investments that we make. As you know, the capital plan we submitted in connection with the 2015 CCAR process, which received no objection from the Fed, included $200 million of share repurchases in the first half of 2016. We expect to begin implementing that program shortly.
Lastly, we will review our capital position with our board on a -- on both a nominal basis and under stress as we prepare our CCAR 2016 capital plan and stress test for submission to the regulators in early April. We've got another year of earnings retention under our belts as well as the capital accretion from the merger. Looking forward, our expectation is that the Hudson City loan portfolio will continue to pay down, moderating our overall loan growth, and thus, our pace of internal capital generation will remain high.
Those are our thoughts. Hope you'll find them helpful as you -- as the year unfolds. Let's see what's -- let's now see what happens. Of course, as you're aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties, various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates and credit spreads, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.
Now let's open up the call, before which, the instructor will briefly review the instructions."

That's the run rate impact that you're going to get on an annualized basis after you've taken the action. So that also should have an impact on the efficiency ratio. When I look at our performance this past year, I think we did a pretty good job of managing expenses, but I also think, quite frankly, the improvements we saw on efficiency ratio come from the fact that we did have growth in revenue in a pretty tough environment, and that spread widened. And when you think about it, if you adjust for the charitable contribution and the gain from the divestiture, we were 57-something in the second quarter. We were 57.1 in the third quarter, and I think it's about 2 percentage points that Hudson City benefited our efficiency ratio. So we're running pretty well. We had a pretty good year on both sides of the equation."

So we've got this very, very large base of deposit customers who are primarily, hold a CD. So they're single service households for us. And in that group, we don't have a big interest in necessarily rationalizing pricing, so to speak, because we really would like to get to know those customers. I've got a couple letters myself already of a couple people introducing them to me, and they just clearly fit the profile of people we would love to have a more full-service banking relationship with. So I think that will take little time, and I don't think we'll be hasty to do that at the outset of this year. But then separately, we do think there's a very large opportunity for full-service checking account relationships that we would typically hold. And most of those relationships aren't just a checking account, they tend to have multiple products and services as we roll out our relationship banking approach. So it's sort of 2 and quite frankly, really what we're trying to do is we got a nice shot of an introduction to those customers, and we will be trying to convince them that we should be their primary bank for all of their deposit services. So that means you can't move too quickly to just treat it as a financial asset. It's -- they're customers."

I mean, I characterized it as strong because I think the numbers were pretty decent growth. But I also know that if I look to our loan committees, I think we had the second highest loan production in the fourth quarter on the commercial side that we've seen in several years for fourth quarter. So things look relatively healthy. And as a way of reference, and of course, I'm going to get this wrong, but I think year-over-year, we've been running at 4% or 4.5% loan growth or something like that. So I think there's really no sign that it's slowing. In terms of the market, it's kind of interesting. So we characterize it to still be intensely competitive, as other banks are really offering better pricing and sometimes, structure than we're able to. But on the whole, pricing in most markets, right, is still coming down slightly. It's not stable, but it's still coming down. Smaller banks are routinely below 200 basis points in terms of margin, maybe 150 to 160 basis points. We're seeing places where there's no recourse, limited covenants and in some cases, people waiving due diligence. And so for us, when we look at the growth, a lot of times what we're seeing is that we're able to do fairly well, but that's coming primarily from existing clients. And they really focus on the fact that we're relatively proactive. We spend a lot of time with them. We know their businesses, and we're fairly consistent regardless of what's happening in the environment. So those -- that's where most of our loans are coming from. And each market is a little different. And we're trying to sort of make sure that we avoid any pitfalls from that, like we're not chasing people in a particular market without the knowledge to take on that customer. I think I talked a little bit about -- I don't know if I have, I have the numbers somewhere, but we saw growth in -- primarily in our Philadelphia, Tarrytown, New York region. We had growth that was about 4% annualized. On a year-over-year basis, that was about 6%. We also saw Pennsylvania, it was about 4%. And Baltimore, Washington was about 2%. And remember that Baltimore had been relatively slow for us. So we're pleased that that's actually continued to do pretty well. The opportunity is different in every market. In Upstate New York, which has been relatively slow, there's a huge construction boom and that's where most of the job energy is coming from. There's knock-on effects in the other businesses, but that's what's driving it. But if you get down to Washington, D.C, it's a different set of factors. So it varies by region."

And obviously, we have to do a really good job of making sure that as we put Hudson City onto our systems, that all those capabilities at the conversion extend over too. So we're focused heavily on that. The other piece that I would put into perspective, which is not directly related to the written agreement per se, is that we continue to just focus on all of the rest of our risk management. We think it's really important whether it be in the compliance areas or whether it be in sort of modernizing or continuing to elevate our CCAR process. So that's where our focus is on.

I think one of the things that's clearly happening at this point in time, is that there's still not -- in the overall market, some markets may be different, but there's not yet an oversupply. And to us, it's a bit of a warning that you got to keep -- you go to watch out for your underwriting. As you know, I mean, it's a great question to ask us, because we definitely have a concentration there, particularly in the New York City area. But we tend to not change our underwriting standards. So for example, if you look at our entire real estate book today, total CRE, whether it's in an owner-occupied or IRE, our loan to value is 59.5%. And in investment real estate, it's 58.3%, right. So our intention is to remain really conservative. We stress cap rates as we begin to -- as we underwrite to look at what might happen in that space. But having said that, I think if you were less sophisticated, if you were smaller, it does -- and given some of the things that we're seeing, I think everybody's right to be concerned. You've got to be very prudent. Having said that, there are a lot of great customers out there who are doing great projects, which can be underwritten at the right amount of risk and for the right price and those tend to be customers that we've known for a fairly long time."

One of the things that we've -- that sort of piqued our interest is that obviously, you see in the market, the spreads for -- the high-yield spreads going up. And so when you take those out ex energy, one of the things we noted is that sort of in that lower level -- lower tranches of the CMBS market since June of last year, they're up 200 basis points. And so actually, if you take high-yield bonds ex energy, they're up 200 basis points in that period. If you take CMBS, they're up 200 basis points. Bank spreads are up a little over that same period, too. So we particularly look at that and then take a look at the underlying credit metrics. The only place -- and it's not in M&T's book, on a national level, where you see both higher spreads and higher delinquencies, is in the indirect auto space, and when we look at our book, maybe because it's so concentrated in the 700 FICO space plus, we've actually seen no deterioration there.

I think -- look, I think that you -- our MO has typically been to be more cautious, which has resulted in slower growth when times are great and everybody's available to lend. And when you look at the market today, the one thing that I would say that we're seeing is not only are all banks healthy, large and small, but you've got the debt funds in the market, you've got the insurance companies back in the market, and you saw some of the trends that we're talking about. So in our minds, when we look at our reserves, for example, we tend to look at the idea that these loans are being underwritten, right, at historically -- there's more pressure on people to do deals in lower structure and those types of things. So that means the loss is inherent and all books are probably growing a little bit when you get to these spaces. I guess, the other thing that I would say is what sometimes gives us pause, and this year, we saw a couple of these things. When we look and we see that we've lost a customer and someone has taken our loan out that was actually a classified loan for us, right, that tends to worry us. If I take myself all the way back to the '80s, I remember lots of banks that were reporting no -- low delinquencies and no foreclosures, but when you look at the underlying reason, it was because somebody was willing to refinance that buyer out. And so all the losses were hidden. I don't think that changes. I don't think you can always see in your statistics. So you have to be very careful when times are good because that's when the difficult loans are made."

But as you can see, we're well above that. We're above that because of a couple of things. Obviously, the transaction. But now, we're generating capital at a very, very high rate and so our thought process is that our optimal capital structure is definitely lower than where it's at today. So we'll have to work our way through the CCAR and go through that process. Having said that, when you look at this, to us, it's one of the more important things. I mean, it's why we would go to pretty heavy lengths to continue to invest and make the CCAR process like, perfectly linked with the rest of our processes in the bank because it's so important to be able to do well and to be able to show your risk profile so you can return that capital.

We're doing a lot of process change. So for example, in the wealth and institutional services division in Wilmington, we're looking a lot at the different capture systems when a customer gets onboarded and going from that end and streamlining and changing the process, which involves automation. So it's not like you just sort of turn the spigot on very fast. It'll be a gradual rise, and we've been focusing on that a couple of quarters.

As noted in this morning's press release, we were pleased with our progress in what proved to be a very busy quarter. The overall financial performance was strong, and we completed the merger with Hudson City Bancorp, which was immediately accretive to M&T's net operating earnings, risk-based capital ratios and tangible book value per share, in sync with our earlier projection. I'll review a few highlights of the quarter and the year, including some perspective on how the merger impacted our results for the quarter. And then we'll share our thoughts on the outlook. After which, Don and I would be happy to take your questions.
Turning to the results. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $1.65 for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with $1.93 in the third quarter and $1.92 a year earlier. The decline came as a result of merger-related charges in connection with the Hudson City transaction. Net income for the quarter was $271 million compared with $280 million in the linked quarter and $278 million in the year ago quarter. In order to insist -- assist investors in understanding the impact of merger activity on its financial results, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis in which we exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as expenses and gains associated with mergers and acquisitions.
After-tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets was $6 million or $0.04 per share -- per common share in the recent quarter compared with $3 million and $0.02 per common share in the prior quarter and $4 million and $0.03 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase in the recent quarter reflects amortization associated with $132 million of additional core deposit intangible created through the Hudson City merger.
Included in the fourth quarter results were significant merger-related charges, including $76 million of noninterest expenses and a $21 million provision for credit losses for the acquired Hudson City loan portfolio. I'll discuss the accounting for the acquired loans in a few moments. Combined, these items amounted to $61 million after tax or $0.40 per common share. There were no such charges in the previous quarter or the year earlier quarter.
M&T's net operating income for the fourth quarter, which excludes merger-related items and the intangible amortization that I just mentioned, was $338 million, increased from $283 million in the linked quarter and $282 million in last year's fourth quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per share were $2.09 for the recent quarter, an increase of 7% from $1.95 in both the previous quarter and the year ago quarter. Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible shareholders' equity -- common shareholders' equity of 1.21% and 13.26% for the recent quarter. Comparable returns were 1.18% and 12.98% in the third quarter of 2015. In accordance with the SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.
Looking to the balance sheet and the income statement. Hudson City added about $24 billion of total assets after our restructuring, which included $19 billion of loans and $18 billion of deposits. Over the 4 days immediately after the closing, we retired $10.6 billion of Hudson City's borrowings, which was funded by the sale of $5.8 billion of investment securities and the remainder by Hudson City's cash on hand. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $813 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, up from $699 million in the linked quarter and $688 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase includes approximately $110 million of net interest income attributable to Hudson City. The net interest margin was 3.12% during the quarter, down 2 basis points from 3.14% in the third quarter. Our explanation of the decline is relatively simple this quarter: we estimate that the inclusion of Hudson City diminished the margin by about 3 basis points.
On the core side -- on the core M&T side, we estimate there was 1 basis point expansion as pressure on the core margin was more than offset by rising short-term interest rates, which included an increase in short-term LIBOR rates in advance of the Fed's December action. Average total loans increased by $13.3 billion from the linked quarter, primarily reflecting the partial quarter impact from Hudson City. Substantially all of the Hudson City loans are residential mortgage loans, thus the acquisition had limited impact on growth in the other loan categories. Growth in each of those other loan categories was solid. On an average basis compared to the linked quarter, C&I, commercial and industrial loans increased an annualized 6% aided by the seasonal rebound in auto floor plan; commercial real estate loans increased by about 9% annualized; consumer loans grew an annualized 10%, reflecting continued growth in indirect auto.
While lending conditions on the commercial side remain very competitive, with pressures from both bank and nonbank lenders, loan demand remained healthy bolstered by repeat business with existing customers who value our relationship approach to lending. We continue to see strong results in the commercial bank in our metropolitan region, which includes New York City as well as Pennsylvania and Baltimore. Growth was somewhat softer in Upstate and Western New York. Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office, CDs over $250,000 and brokered deposits, increased 16% unannualized from the third quarter, primarily reflecting the impact from the acquisition.
Noninterest income -- now turning to fees, noninterest income or fee income totaled $448 million in the fourth quarter, up from $440 million in the linked quarter. Contributing to fees from -- the contribution to fees from Hudson City was not significant. Mortgage banking revenues were $88 million in the fourth quarter compared with $84 million in the third quarter. Residential mortgage banking revenues declined by $6 million, the majority of which is attributable to a 23% reduction in residential mortgage loans originated for sale. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were up $10 million from the prior quarter, reflecting solid -- a solid quarter of multifamily FHA origination.
Service charges on deposit accounts were $106 million, little change from $107 million in the third quarter. And trust income was $115 million in the recent quarter, slightly improved from $114 million in the previous quarter. All other revenues from operation were $144 million, up from $138 million in the third quarter. Both the third and fourth quarters of 2015 were characterized by particularly strong commercial lending-related fees. The recent quarter's results included a -- higher levels of syndication fees, while the previous quarter's results included a sizable gain on previously leased equipment, which did not reoccur.
Turning to expenses. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter, which exclude the expense from the amortization of intangibles and merger-related expenses, was $701 million compared to $650 million in the third quarter. Those operating expenses included approximately $40 million attributable to Hudson City. The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization and the merger-related expenses, improved to 55.5%, reflecting the 2-month impact from Hudson City. It is notable that on a full year-on-year basis, adjusting for the merger and the sizable contribution to the M&T Charitable Foundation made in this year's second -- last year's second quarter, total operating expenses were down slightly from 2014.
Next, let's turn to credit. Overall, credit quality remained strong. Nonaccrual loans at the end of 2015 were $799 million, up slightly from $787 million at September 30. The ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans was 91 basis points at year end. The significant decline in that ratio from September 30 reflects the addition of Hudson City's loan portfolio. Net charge-offs for the fourth quarter were $36 million, improved from $40 million in the third quarter. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 18 basis points for the period with the ratio also benefiting from the addition of the Hudson City portfolio to total loans. 
The provision for credit losses was $58 million for the recent quarter, which includes the $21 million merger-related provision I mentioned earlier. The allowance for credit losses was $956 million at the end of 2015 and reflects our assessment of the loss content in the loan portfolio. The ratio of allowance to total loans was 1.09%, which also reflects the addition of the Hudson City loan portfolio. The loan loss allowance as of December 31 was 17x 2015 -- I'm sorry, was 7x 2015's net charge-offs. Loans 90 days past due, on which we continue to accrue interest, including loans acquired at a discount, were $273 million at the end of 2015. Of these loans, $232 million or 85% are guaranteed by government-related entities.
Before I leave credit, I'd like to provide you with some background on the accounting for the loans that we acquired with Hudson City. As you know, GAAP requires acquired loans to be recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition with no carryover of the acquired entity's allowance for loan losses. Net fair value reflects the use of interest rate and credit loss assumption. And in connection with Hudson City -- the Hudson City merger, we recorded $19 billion of Hudson City loans held for investment at their estimated fair value. Approximately $1 billion of those loans are classified as purchased impaired loans, were recorded at a discount to par and are being accounted for under SOP 03-3.
The fair value of the remaining $18 billion of acquired loans exceeded the outstanding loan balance, resulting in a net premium, which will be amortized over the remaining lives of the loans as a reduction of interest income. GAAP does not allow the credit loss component of that premium to be bifurcated and accounted for as a non-accreting difference, as was the case in previous acquisitions when all loans were deemed acquired at discount.
GAAP also provides that an allowance for credit losses on loans acquired at premium be recognized for incurred losses in that portfolio, even though in a homogeneous portfolio of residential mortgages, loans -- the specific loans to which those losses relate cannot be easily identified. M&T believes that this accounting requirement results in an additional provision for loan losses that was already factored into the fair value of the loans at the date of acquisition -- at the acquisition date. As a result, the $21 million incremental provision has been characterized as a merger-related expense. Hopefully, that's helpful. 
Turning to capital. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio under the transitional Basel III capital rules currently in effect was an estimated 11.06% at the end of the recent quarter, up from 10.08% at the end of September. Completion of the Hudson City merger added an estimated 80 basis points to that ratio. Tangible book value per share was 64.2 -- $64.28 at the end of 2015, up 5% from $61.22 at the end of September and up 13% from $57.06 at the end of 2014. As a point of comparison, over the past 5 years, M&T has grown tangible book value per share at a compounded annual growth rate of over 14% through a combination of organic growth and prudently priced expansion.
Next, I'd like to take a moment to cover the key highlights of 2015's results. GAAP-based diluted earnings per common share were $7.18 compared with $7.42 in 2014. Net income was $1.08 billion, up slightly from $1.07 billion in the prior year. Net operating income, which excludes intangible amortization and the merger-related expenses, was $1.2 billion, improved from $1.1 billion in the prior year. Diluted net operating earnings per common share was $7.74, up from $7.57 in 2014. Net operating income for 2015 expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common equity -- shareholders' equity was 1.18% and 13%, respectively.
Before I turn to the outlook, as many of you have seen, on January 6, the U.S. attorney in Delaware took an action -- took action against Wilmington Trust Corporation related to alleged conduct prior to M&T's acquisition of Wilmington Trust Corporation in 2011. As the U.S. attorney noted in his press release, this alleged activity relates solely to Wilmington Trust's commercial banking operations during that time period. While we are limited in our ability to discuss this matter, it is important to note that we strongly believe that this unprecedented action is unjustified and Wilmington Trust intends to vigorously defend itself.
Now turning to the outlook. As Don and I were saying yesterday, it's a daunting task we undertake every January to offer you a projection of what we think will unfold over the coming year. But in retrospect, the thoughts we offered you on this call last year weren't too far off from what actually occurred. So here we go again. I should first note that the end-of-period balance sheet is more representative of our run rate balance sheet than the averages for the fourth quarter given the November 1 effective date of the merger.
During the fourth quarter, we saw a steady to positive momentum in the lending environment. And as a result, including the newly acquired loans from Hudson City, we would expect low to mid-single-digit growth in total loans in 2016 with a slightly higher pace of growth in commercial and consumer loans, partially offset by contraction in the residential mortgage loans as we expect that the Hudson City portfolio will continue to pay down. The pace of payoff will obviously depend on interest rates. 
Our outlook for the net interest margin is dependent on further actions by the Federal Reserve. Given what the implied forward rate curve is telling us, we'd expect the net interest margin for the full year of 2016 to be stable or slightly better than what we reported in the fourth quarter. The full run rate impact from the addition to the -- of Hudson City's balance sheet will be a modest source of pressure early in the year. As we've seen over the past several years, the impact of cash balances brought in through Wilmington Trust could have an impact on the reported margin but would be additive to revenue.
Excluding the impact from the sale of the trade processing business in 2015's second quarter, both the $45 million gain and the single quarter of revenue we earned prior to the divestiture, we would expect flat to modest growth in noninterest expense and fees. We expect pressure on mortgage banking revenues in a higher rate environment and continued industry-wide pressure on consumer service charges to be offset by growth in other fees, assisted, of course, by higher short-term rates.
Regarding expenses, in light of the limited revenue opportunities, we're looking to keep core expenses relatively contained, continued investment spending, including technology investment, offset with savings elsewhere as other projects reach completion. Our goal is to strive for positive operating leverage over the course of 2016. 
As to Hudson City, we'd estimate that an additional $40 million to $50 million of expense reductions will result from further actions we expect to take over the first half of 2016, particularly the branch and systems conversion. These should ultimately result in realizing the majority of our expense save -- our expected expense savings by June or, let's say, the first half of the year. 
Separately, we'd estimate that there are about $40 million of merger-related expenses remaining to be incurred, the majority coming over the first half of 2016. Aside from the national news on energy lending, which shouldn't have a material impact on us, we see no indication of a change in the credit cycle. Net charge-offs amounted to just 19 basis points for the second year in a row, which is roughly half the long-term average. But as we said on this call last year, our conservatism won't let us count on beating that figure in 2016.
Income tax expense in the fourth quarter included 4.6 --  a $4.6 million benefit from technology research credits related to prior years through 2014, which were approved by the IRS in December. We'd note that the provision in the tax code providing from such credits was extended by Congress in December. Any additional benefits in the future will depend on the size and type of technology investments that we make. As you know, the capital plan we submitted in connection with the 2015 CCAR process, which received no objection from the Fed, included $200 million of share repurchases in the first half of 2016. We expect to begin implementing that program shortly.
Lastly, we will review our capital position with our board on a -- on both a nominal basis and under stress as we prepare our CCAR 2016 capital plan and stress test for submission to the regulators in early April. We've got another year of earnings retention under our belts as well as the capital accretion from the merger. Looking forward, our expectation is that the Hudson City loan portfolio will continue to pay down, moderating our overall loan growth, and thus, our pace of internal capital generation will remain high.
Those are our thoughts. Hope you'll find them helpful as you -- as the year unfolds. Let's see what's -- let's now see what happens. Of course, as you're aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties, various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates and credit spreads, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.
Now let's open up the call, before which, the instructor will briefly review the instructions."

Or are we more likely to see that benefit sort of show up in investment elsewhere, all else equal?"

In that, we've got a number of things that we're doing to sort of optimize our operations, and we're hoping to put that money back into IT spending. At the end of the day, we'll put the money back into IT spending regardless of how much progress we make in other areas because we think it's really important. So we've talked about that for some time. On the -- when you think of the efficiency ratio and you think first of Hudson City, I haven't done the math, but you got one more -- one more month of Hudson City, right? So there's probably some additional impact on the efficiency ratio when you have full 3 months in the quarter. And then we have work to do to reduce -- get the cost saves that we talked about. One thing I would point out is that it's not as if we're getting those cost saves on January 1, right, so you get the full year impact of $40 million to $50 million. That's the run rate impact that you're going to get on an annualized basis after you've taken the action. So that also should have an impact on the efficiency ratio. When I look at our performance this past year, I think we did a pretty good job of managing expenses, but I also think, quite frankly, the improvements we saw in the efficiency ratio come from the fact that we did have growth in revenue in a pretty tough environment, and that spread widened. And when you think about it, if you adjust for the charitable contribution and the gain from the divestiture, we were 57-something in the second quarter. We were 57.1 in the third quarter, and I think it's about 2 percentage points that Hudson City benefited our efficiency ratio. So we're running pretty well. We had a pretty good year on both sides of the equation."

I've got a couple letters myself already of a couple people introducing them to me, and they just clearly fit the profile of people we would love to have a more full-service banking relationship with. So I think that will take little time, and I don't think we'll be hasty to do that at the outset of this year. But then separately, we do think there's a very large opportunity for full-service checking account relationships that we would typically hold. And most of those relationships aren't just a checking account, they tend to have multiple products and services as we roll out our relationship banking approach. So it's sort of 2 and quite frankly, really what we're trying to do is we got a nice shot of an introduction to those customers, and we will be trying to convince them that we should be their primary bank for all of their deposit services. So that means you can't move too quickly to just treat it as a financial asset. It's -- they're customers."

I mean, I characterized it as strong because I think the numbers were pretty decent growth. But I also know that if I look to our loan committees, I think we had the second highest loan production in the fourth quarter on the commercial side that we've seen in several years for fourth quarter. So things look relatively healthy. And as a way of reference, and of course, I'm going to get this wrong, but I think year-over-year, we've been running at 4% or 4.5% loan growth or something like that. So I think there's really no sign that it's slowing. In terms of the market, it's kind of interesting. So we characterize it to still be intensely competitive, as other banks are really offering better pricing and sometimes, structure than we're able to. But on the whole, pricing in most markets, right, is still coming down slightly. It's not stable, but it's still coming down. Smaller banks are routinely below 200 basis points in terms of margin, maybe 150 to 160 basis points. We're seeing places where there's no recourse, limited covenants and in some cases, people waiving due diligence. And so for us, when we look at the growth, a lot of times what we're seeing is that we're able to do fairly well, but that's coming primarily from existing clients. And they really focus on the fact that we're relatively proactive. We spend a lot of time with them. We know their businesses, and we're fairly consistent regardless of what's happening in the environment. So those -- that's where most of our loans are coming from. And each market is a little different. And we're trying to sort of make sure that we avoid any pitfalls from that, like we're not chasing people in a particular market without the knowledge to take on that customer. I think I talked a little bit about -- I don't know if I have, I have the numbers somewhere, but we saw growth in -- primarily in our Philadelphia, Tarrytown, New York region. We had growth that was about 4% annualized. On a year-over-year basis, that was about 6%. We also saw Pennsylvania, it was about 4%. And Baltimore, Washington was about 2%. And remember that Baltimore had been relatively slow for us. So we're pleased that that's actually continued to do pretty well. The opportunity is different in every market. In Upstate New York, which has been relatively slow, there's a huge construction boom and that's where most of the job energy is coming from. There's knock-on effects in the other businesses, but that's what's driving it. But if you get down to Washington, D.C, it's a different set of factors. So it varies by region."

And obviously, we have to do a really good job of making sure that as we put Hudson City onto our systems, that all those capabilities at the conversion extend over too. So we're focused heavily on that. The other piece that I would put into perspective, which is not directly related to the written agreement per se, is that we continue to just focus on all of the rest of our risk management. We think it's really important whether it be in the compliance areas or whether it be in sort of modernizing or continuing to elevate our CCAR process. So that's where our focus is on.

I think one of the things that's clearly happening at this point in time, is that there's still not -- in the overall market, some markets may be different, but there's not yet an oversupply. And to us, it's a bit of a warning that you got to keep -- you got to watch out for your underwriting. As you know, I mean, it's a great question to ask us, because we definitely have a concentration there, particularly in the New York City area. But we tend to not change our underwriting standards. So for example, if you look at our entire real estate book today, total CRE, whether it's in an owner-occupied or IRE, our loan to value is 59.5%. And in investment real estate, it's 58.3%, right. So our intention is to remain really conservative. We stress cap rates as we begin to -- as we underwrite to look at what might happen in that space. But having said that, I think if you were less sophisticated, if you were smaller, it does -- and given some of the things that we're seeing, I think everybody's right to be concerned. You've got to be very prudent.

One of the things that we've -- that sort of piqued our interest is that obviously, you see in the market, the spreads for -- the high-yield spreads going up. And so when you take those out ex energy, one of the things we noted is that sort of in that lower level -- lower tranches of the CMBS market since June of last year, they're up 200 basis points. And so actually, if you take high-yield bonds ex energy, they're up 200 basis points in that period. If you take CMBS, they're up 200 basis points. Bank spreads are up a little over that same period, too. So we particularly look at that and then take a look at the underlying credit metrics. The only place -- and it's not in M&T's book, on a national level, where you see both higher spreads and higher delinquencies, is in the indirect auto space. And when we look at our book, maybe because it's so concentrated in the 700 FICO space plus, we've actually seen no deterioration there.

I think -- look, I think that you -- our MO has typically been to be more cautious, which has resulted in slower growth when times are great and everybody's available to lend. And when you look at the market today, the one thing that I would say that we're seeing is not only are all banks healthy, large and small, but you've got the debt funds in the market, you've got the insurance companies back in the market, and you saw some of the trends that we're talking about. So in our minds, when we look at our reserves, for example, we tend to look at the idea that these loans are being underwritten, right, at historically -- there's more pressure on people to do deals in lower structure and those types of things. So that means the loss is inherent and all books are probably growing a little bit when you get to these spaces. I guess, the other thing that I would say is what sometimes gives us pause, and this year, we saw a couple of these things. When we look and we see that we've lost a customer and someone has taken our loan out that was actually a classified loan for us, right, that tends to worry us. If I take myself all the way back to the '80s, I remember lots of banks that were reporting no -- low delinquencies and no foreclosures, but when you look at the underlying reason, it was because somebody was willing to refinance that buyer out. And so all the losses were hidden. I don't think that changes. I don't think you can always see in your statistics. So you have to be very careful when times are good because that's when the difficult loans are made."

But as you can see, we're well above that. We're above that because of a couple of things. Obviously, this transaction. But now, we're generating capital at a very, very high rate and so our thought process is that our optimal capital structure is definitely lower than where it's at today. So we'll have to work our way through the CCAR and go through that process. Having said that, when you look at this, to us, it's one of the more important things.

But the most important thing also is we're generating capital, probably at a faster rate as well. So there's nothing that would suggest, once you get through your stress test, you look at your risks, one of the risks we'll be looking at is our new concentration risk with mortgages in New Jersey. But as we -- as I should point out to you, when we ran the last 2 CCAR tests, we had New Jersey in it, and we had those presumed-to-be acquired loans in our stress test. So we'll focus on that. But to your point, there's nothing that would suggest that we shouldn't be able to return capital at a rate consistent -- at least consistent with others."

We're doing a lot of process change. So for example, in the wealth and institutional services division in Wilmington, we're looking a lot at the different capture systems when a customer gets onboarded and going from that end and streamlining and changing the process, which involves automation.

272285,330444349,959128,"M&T Bank Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 18, 2016",2016-04-18,"Earnings Calls","M&T Bank Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone.

As noted in this morning's press release, M&T's results for the first quarter reflected strong growth in net interest income, which was driven by expansion of the net interest margin and solid loan growth, controlled operating expenses and stable provided performance. All of these contributed to an 11% growth in diluted net operating earnings per share over last year's first quarter. 
As we noted on the January call, we closed the merger with Hudson City and restructured its balance sheet in last year's fourth quarter. 
In the first quarter, we completed the migration of Hudson City's customers to M&T's products and services as well as the conversion of its branches, systems and operations onto M&T's platform.
Hudson City's risk management framework has been fully integrated into M&T's governance structure, and our task now is to continue to evolve the Hudson City -- continue the evolution of Hudson City from what was essentially a monoline drift into a real commercial bank, which will, of course, take some time. Overall, we feel the first quarter was a productive one. 
As we usually do, I'll start by reviewing a few of the haves from M&T's first quarter results, after which, Don and I will be happy to take your questions. 
Turning to the results. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $1.73 for the first quarter of 2016, improved from $1.65 in both the first quarter and the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Net income for the quarter was $299 million, up 10% from $271 million in the linked quarter and up to 24% from $242 million in the year-ago quarter.
Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides a supplementary reporting of this results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions. After tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets was $7 million or $0.05 per common share in the recent quarter compared with $4 million or $0.03 per share in last year's first quarter and $6 million or $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter.
Also included in the first quarter results were $23 million of pretax merger-related charges in the form of noninterest expense incurred in connection with the Hudson City acquisition. This equates to $14 million after-tax or $0.09 per common share. 
Merger-related charges in the fourth quarter included $76 million of noninterest expense and $21 million of loan-loss provision. Combined, those amounted to $61 million after-tax or $0.40 per common share. There were no such charges in the first quarter of 2015.
Net operating -- M&T's net operating income for the first quarter, which includes intangible amortization and the merger-related expenses, was $320 million compared with $246 million in last year's first quarter and $338 million in the linked quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $1.87 for the recent quarter, up 11% from $1.68 in the year-ago quarter. That figure was $2.09 in last year's fourth quarter.
Net operating income annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholder's equity of 1.09% and 11.62% for the recent quarter and the comparable returns were 1.21% and 13.26% in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
And in accordance with SEC guidance, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP, non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.
Turning to the balance sheet and the income statement. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $878 million for the first quarter of 2016, improved by $65 million or approximately 8% from a linked quarter. About $45 million or some 70% of that increase reflects the full quarter of Hudson City's results compared with 2 months in last year's fourth quarter. Contributing to the growth in net interest income was a 6-basis-point expansion of the net interest margin to 3.18%, up from 312 basis points in the fourth quarter. The primary driver of that increase was the full quarter effect from the Fed's mid-December action to increase short-term interest rates, while the benefit from the day count in the shorter quarter was largely offset by the dilutive impact from a higher level of deposits at -- placed at the Fed.
Average loans increased by 8% or $6.5 billion compared to the linked quarter. This included a 27% or $5.5 billion increase in residential mortgage loans, which primarily reflects the impact from the full quarter of Hudson City results. 
Looking at the other loan categories on an average basis compared with the linked; quarter, commercial and industrial loans increased $497 million or an annualized 10%. Commercial real estate loans increased $452 million or about 6% annualized. Consumer loans grew at an annualized 1% with growth in indirect loans offset by decline in other consumer loan categories. 
The loan growth was broad based, including the impact from -- excuse me, excluding the impact from Hudson City mortgage loans, we saw a 6% annualized growth in Upstate New York; 5% annualized growth in our Metro region, which includes New York City and New Jersey; 9% annualized growth in Pennsylvania; and 4% annualized growth in Baltimore-Washington Delaware regions.
I'd note that end-of-period loans grew by 2% annualized, with a 15% annualized decline in residential mortgages offset -- more than offset by 9% annualized growth in other loan categories. 
Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received in M&T's Cayman Islands office and CDs over $250,000 increased by an annualized 32% from the fourth quarter, also reflecting the impact from Hudson City.
Turning to noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $421 million in the first quarter compared with $448 million in the prior quarter. Mortgage banking revenues were $82 million in the first quarter compared with $88 million in the prior quarter, largely the result of a $5 million decline in the commercial mortgage banking revenues to about $22 million, down from $27 million at what was a solid fourth quarter.
Similarly, credit-related fees were lower by $14 million coming off what was also a very strong fourth quarter. That decline is largely related to fees that are often event driven, such as a syndication fee and can carry somewhat -- can vary somewhat from quarter-to-quarter.
Several fee categories were impacted by the typical seasonal factors that we see. For example, fee income from deposit service charges provided was $102 million during the first quarter compared to $106 million in the linked quarter and trust income was also down modestly.
Turning to expenses. Operating expenses for the first quarter, which exclude merger-related expenses and the amortization of intangible assets, were $741 million compared with $701 million in the prior quarter. We continue to be pleased that we've kept expenses relatively stable, while observing Hudson City as well as funding our technology and other initiatives. This is reflected in our efficiency ratio, which was 57.0% for the first quarter, improved by 450 basis points from 61.5% in the year-ago quarter. We estimate that approximately 280 basis points of that improvement is attributable to the merger and 170 basis points is from M&T's legacy operations. The result of our ability to grow revenues at a faster pace than expenses following several years of strengthening our infrastructure. The efficiency ratio was 55.5% in last year's fourth quarter.
As usual, the first quarter comparison with the fourth quarter reflects our normal seasonal increase in salaries and benefits relating to accelerated recognition of equity compensation expense for certain retirement-eligible employees, the 401(k) match and the annual reset in Social Security or FICA payments and similar items. Those items accounted for an approximate $40 million increase in salaries and benefits from the fourth quarter similar to last year. 
As usual, those seasonal factors will decline by some $30 million to $35 million as we entered the second quarter. One item worth noting is the increase in FDIC assessment to $25 million in the first quarter from $20 million in the fourth. This reflects, in part, the fact that one component of the FDIC's assessment calculator looks back at Hudson City's earnings and treats them as if the Hudson City merger had been in place for the entire year instead of just the final 2 months of 2015. And notwithstanding the fact that Hudson City its own FDIC assessment as an independent company through the first 3  quarters of 2015. This factor will normalize as we move later into the year. 
Also, as you know, the FDIC has imposed a surcharge in large banks to recapitalize the Deposit Insurance Fund more quickly, likely starting in the third quarter. We estimate that this will add about $5 million per quarter to our assessment expense, starting, as I said, in the third quarter.
Next, let's turn to credit. Our credit quality remains in line with our expectations, which is to stay strong with continued low levels of nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs. Nonaccrual loans increased to $877 million and the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans was 1% at the end of the recent quarter. The $77 million increase from the end of the fourth quarter is primarily attributable to Hudson City mortgages. As you know, loans obtained from Hudson City that were 90 days past due as of the acquisition date were recorded as purchased impaired loans. And in accordance with GAAP, interest continues to accrue on those loans despite their delinquency status. Appropriately, those specific acquired loans were not in the nonaccrual balances as of either March 31, 2016, or December 31, 2015. The higher level of nonaccrual loans at the end of the first quarter reflects the normal migration of approximately $80 million of previously performing loans that became more than 90 days past due during the recent quarter and which could not be deemed as impaired at the acquisition date because they were paying at the time of the merger. As our result, we should continue to see a migration of the Hudson City loans acquired at a premium into, and eventually, out of nonaccrual status as this process normalizes to a more steady state through the passage of time. 
Net charge-offs for the first quarter were $42 million compared with $36 million in the fourth quarter. During the first quarter of 2016, M&T charge-offs loans associated with consumers who were either deceased or filed for bankruptcy. That, in accordance with GAAP, had previously been considered when determining the level of allowance for credit losses. Such charge-offs totaled $14 million in the recent quarter and included $11 million of loan balances with a current payments status.
Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 19 basis points for the first quarter, up slightly from 18 basis points in the previous quarter and matching the figure we reported for each of the past 2 calendar years. The provision for credit losses was $49 million for the recent quarter, exceeding net charge-offs by $7 million and the allowance for credit losses was $963 million, amounting to 1.10% of total loans at the end of March. 
Loans 90 days past due, which continue to accrue interest including acquired loans that have been marked the fair value -- excuse me, excluding the acquired loans that have been marked the fair value at the acquisition, were $336 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these loans, $279 million or 83% are guaranteed by government-related entities.
Turning to capital, M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio under the current transitional Basel III capital rules was an estimated 11.06%, little change from 11.08% at the end of 2015. Recall that the capital plan M&T submitted in connection with the 2015 CCAR process in which we received no objection from the Federal Reserve included repurchase -- the repurchase of $200 million of common stock over the first half of 2016. We began execution of that buyback program in January and expect to complete it by the end of the second quarter. 
In addition, because the completion of the Hudson City merger occurred later than contemplated in the capital plan submission, we did not pay all of the projected dividends associated with the M&T common stock that was issued as merger consideration. As disclosed previously, the distribution of that capital, some $54 million, is being redirected into the repurchase program for the second quarter of 2016.
Now turning to the outlook. As is our usual practice, without giving specific earnings guidance, we'd like to offer our thoughts as to how we're tracking against the outlook for the full year that we gave to you on the January call.
Loan growth this past quarter was largely in line, or slightly better than our expectations, with solid growth in commercial loans in both commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by slower growth in consumer loans and in the expected decline in residential real estate loans.
We were pleased with the strong performance of our noninterest margin. Our outlook on the January call for stable net interest margin was predicated on 2 increases in the Fed's funds target in the calendar year 2016. More recently, the forward curve is implying 1 increase in mid-year, which would still be a benefit. To some extent, the margin is dampened by our decision to maintain pricing on Hudson City's time deposits, which we will revisit overtime.
Fee revenues are in line with our expectations given to normal seasonal effects that we talked about. As is normally the case, we would expect the seasonal increase in salaries and benefits during the first quarter to reverse itself again to the tune of some $30 million to $35 million in the second quarter, and we remain on track with realizing our expected cost savings from the merger. 
Over all, our basic outlook for expenses is unchanged, and we remain focused on producing modest positive operating leverage on the year-over-year basis. Our outlook for credit is little changed over the short term. While we've had a little or no impact from the energy-related credit headwinds that others are seeing, the current low level of losses has persisted for over 2 years. 
Overall, our areas of focus for 2016 are fairly straightforward and relatively consistent with what we've talked about in the past predict to continue to improve the efficiency of our balance sheet with an emphasis on building out our commercial banking profile in New Jersey, to manage the revenue expense dynamic; to produce positive operating leverage; to capitalize on the M-A driven disruptions within our footprint; and optimize our capital structure, while conforming with both regulatory capital thresholds as well as the annual stress test.
Of course, as you are aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties in the various steps regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other micro economic factors, which may differ materially what actually unfolds in the future.
So now let's open up the call to questions before, which, Laurie will briefly review the instructions."

I think the thing that impressed me the most, we get our results when we look of them. But then in preparing for the call, we tend to look at the quality. So what is the quality of the loan book? What's the pricing? And we were able to get the growth without seeing any deterioration in the margins and the total returns that we were getting on that population of loans. And one of the other things that I think was interesting is that in some of our markets, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, Upstate New York, and to some extent, in Washington, D.C. and New York City, we saw this -- the margins actually on new deals come up maybe 20 to 25 basis points, which we, I guess, estimate that, that had to do with the widening spreads that we saw on the capital markets and the slow than on the CMBS market. It had some small effect.
So I was very encouraged by what we saw. I thought the pace was pretty even, and I t think our pipeline continue to remain fairly robust."

And I think we will need more time comes, some part of this a year, to make sure that those balances stick around and that we had the opportunity to interact with those customers over time. One of the things that you're seeing inside that we're getting about our prepayments piece on the mortgage book of 15%, so say, $300 million a month. But we haven't really seen the similar run off in the time deposit book because we're maintaining those prices in an effort to reach out to contact those customers through the course of the year.  When we talk about some diminishment of our margin, that's embedded in our margins at the top of the house. So I mean, while we're calling for stable margin for the full year, I wouldn't be surprised to see a couple of basis point decline next year, and you'll see that will be solely the effect of maintaining those -- that sort of higher time account balances and pricing. But that's totally in our control. So at some point, as we target the customers that we're very focused on getting and there's a high probability that we can convert, the rest of the book will just revert that process to normal rational pricing that we want to do in New Jersey and that should give us some benefit.

And so what we've been focused on and I believe are starting to make really good traction on is sort of streamlining the back office, which comes in a couple of forms, right? It's sort of now that we've got all of our controls in place, we're beginning to change our statement process, we're beginning to change our on-boarding process, which has an impact of freeing up expenses, but it also improves the service quality. And so I think we'll be at that at least another year or so and it should, from a bottom-line perspective, continue to grow. Bottom line, both of those businesses have grown every year since we brought them on board, so we're pretty pleased with where they're going."

So I think one of the shifts, because of the way the process works now, the idea of anybody doing simultaneous merger conversions is long gone. We are sad about that from a standpoint that it limits your risk, so you need a much more robust process now that you're going to -- if you going to own the institution in a convert it right away. And that was something that we added this time, which I think went very, very smoothly."

That evolution is this should be our third CCAR and we before that. In the last 2 CCARs, we were about 9, 10 in our Tier 1 common ratio and then maybe 9 70 and we faired pretty well. But at that time, we weren't thinking about distributing any capital because we're in the space where we still have the transaction to do. And so just out of that normal principle, we would it be doing that. Because there's some risk when you enter a transaction of maybe a recession happens when you do been that we're there's some operational issues. So because that took so long, it allowed us to build up that capital over time. Also think about the idea that when we first announced that deal, we had about $28 billion in mortgages, and that's down, down to $17 billion, right? So we have all the capital, but -- that we expected to have, but the book has run done over that period of time also as we expected. So over time, we've got to distribute that capital back to the shareholders or put it to a decent use. And that's sort of our task what we're trying to do. We've, to date, been lower than everybody in the total payout ratios, probably half of what the industry's been. And I think I've said that we our intention would be to normalize that. And over long periods of time, because we run a model that's not based on growth but is based on profitability, I think we will always be having a lot of excess capital relative to the average in the industry. And we'll try to do the right thing. But we've got a history so far, but I think one of the things that you won't see us doing is necessarily point impact because we have excess capacity.

So I provided more color. I would say the feedback I'm getting from the commercial bankers is that the larger or more complex transactions is where you were able to see slight moving pricing.

I don't think that's necessarily positive thing. I think it tells you how sensitive the market can be, the mood swings of those capital markets. Having said that, at the same time, I think what's interesting Jeffrey is so that competition didn't change an ounce with the smaller institutions.

Is that merger-related expense line item? Any color on that would be helpful."

As noted in this morning's press release, M&T's results for the first quarter reflected strong growth in net interest income, which was driven by an expansion of the net interest margin and solid loan growth, controlled operating expenses and stable credit performance. All of these contributed to an 11% growth in diluted net operating earnings per share over last year's first quarter.
As we noted on the January call, we closed the merger with Hudson City and restructured its balance sheet in last year's fourth quarter. 
In the first quarter, we completed the migration of Hudson City's customers to M&T's products and services as well as the conversion of its branches, systems and operations onto M&T's platform.
Hudson City's risk management framework has been fully integrated into M&T's risk governance structure, and our task now is to continue to evolve the Hudson City -- continue the evolution of Hudson City from what was essentially a monoline drift into a real commercial bank, which will, of course, take some time. Overall, we feel the first quarter was a productive one. 
As we usually do, I'll start by reviewing a few of the highlights from M&T's first quarter results, after which, Don and I will be happy to take your questions. 
Turning to the results. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $1.73 for the first quarter of 2016, improved from $1.65 in both the first quarter and the fourth quarter of 2015.
Net income for the quarter was $299 million, up 10% from $271 million in the linked quarter and up 24% from $242 million in the year ago quarter.
Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplementary reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as expenses associated with mergers and acquisition. After tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets was $7 million or $0.05 per common share in the recent quarter compared with $4 million or $0.03 per share in last year's first quarter and $6 million or $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter.
Also included in the first quarter results were $23 million of pretax merger-related charges in the form of noninterest expense incurred in connection with the Hudson City acquisition. This equates to $14 million after-tax or $0.09 per common share.
Merger-related charges in the fourth quarter included $76 million of noninterest expense and $21 million of loan loss provision. Combined, those amounted to $61 million after-tax or $0.40 per common share. There were no such charges in the first quarter of 2015.
Net operating -- M&T's net operating income for the first quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and the merger-related expenses, was $320 million compared with $246 million in last year's first quarter and $338 million in the linked quarter. 
Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $1.87 for the recent quarter, up 11% from $1.68 in the year ago quarter. That figure was $2.09 in last year's fourth quarter.
Net operating income yields annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholder's equity of 1.09% and 11.62% for the recent quarter and the comparable returns were 1.21% and 13.26% in the fourth quarter of 2015.
And in accordance with the SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP, non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.
Turning to the balance sheet and the income statement. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $878 million for the first quarter of 2016, improved by $65 million or approximately 8% from the linked quarter. About $45 million or some 70% of that increase reflects the full quarter of Hudson City's results compared with 2 months in last year's fourth quarter. 
Contributing to the growth in net interest income was a 6 basis point expansion of the net interest margin to 3.18%, up from 312 basis points in the fourth quarter. The primary driver of that increase was the full quarter effect from the Fed's mid-December action to increase short-term interest rates, while the benefit from the day count in the shorter quarter was largely offset by the dilutive impact from a higher level of deposits at -- placed at the Fed.
Average loans increased by 8% or $6.5 billion compared to the linked quarter. This included a 27% or $5.5 billion increase in residential mortgage loans, which primarily reflects the impact from the full quarter of Hudson City results.
Looking at the other loan categories, on an average basis compared with the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans increased $497 million or an annualized 10%. Commercial real estate loans increased $452 million or about 6% annualized. Consumer loans grew at an annualized 1% with growth in indirect auto loans offset by a decline in other consumer loan categories.
The loan growth was broad based, including the impact from -- excuse me, excluding the impact from Hudson City mortgage loans, we saw a 6% annualized growth in Upstate New York; 5% annualized growth in our Metro region, which includes New York City and New Jersey; 9% annualized growth in Pennsylvania; and 4% annualized growth in Baltimore, Washington, Delaware regions.
I'd note that end-of-period loans grew by 2% annualized, with a 15% annualized decline in residential mortgages offset -- more than offset by 9% annualized growth in other loan categories.
Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received in M&T's Cayman Islands office and CDs over $250,000 increased by an annualized 32% from the fourth quarter, also reflecting the impact from Hudson City.
Turning to noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $421 million in the first quarter compared with $448 million in the prior quarter. Mortgage banking revenues were $82 million in the first quarter compared with $88 million in the prior quarter, largely the result of a $5 million decline in commercial mortgage banking revenues to about $22 million, down from $27 million in what was a solid fourth quarter.
Similarly, credit-related fees were lower by $14 million coming off what was also a very strong fourth quarter. That decline is largely related to fees that are often event driven, such as a syndication fee and can carry somewhat -- can vary somewhat from quarter-to-quarter.
Several fee categories were impacted by the typical seasonal factors that we see. For example, fee income from deposit service charges provided was $102 million during the first quarter compared to $106 million in the linked quarter. Trust income was also down modestly.
Turning to expenses. Operating expenses for the first quarter, which exclude merger-related expenses and the amortization of intangible assets, were $400 million -- excuse me were $741 million compared with $701 million in the prior quarter. We continue to be pleased that we've kept expenses relatively stable while absorbing Hudson City as well as funding our technology and other initiatives. This is reflected in our efficiency ratio, which was 57.0% for the first quarter, improved by 450 basis points from 61.5% in the year ago quarter. We estimate that approximately 280 basis points of that improvement is attributable to the merger and 170 basis points is from M&T's legacy operation. The result of our ability to grow revenues at a faster pace than expenses following several years of strengthening our infrastructure. The efficiency ratio was 55.5% in last year's fourth quarter.
As usual, the first quarter comparison with the fourth quarter reflects our normal seasonal increase in salaries and benefits relating to accelerated recognition of equity compensation expense for certain retirement eligible employees, the 401(k) match and the annual reset in Social Security or FICA payments and similar items. Those items accounted for an approximate $40 million increase in salaries and benefits from the fourth quarter similar to last year.
As usual, those seasonal factors will decline by some $30 million to $35 million as we enter the second quarter. One item worth noting is the increase in FDIC assessment to $25 million in the first quarter from $20 million in the fourth. This reflects, in part, the fact that one component of the FDIC's assessment calculator looks back at Hudson City's earnings and treats them as if the Hudson City merger had been in place for the entire year instead of just the final 2 months of 2015. And notwithstanding the fact that Hudson City fared its own FDIC assessment as an independent company through the first 3 quarters of 2015. This factor will normalize as we move later into the year.
Also, as you know, the FDIC has imposed a surcharge on large banks to recapitalize the Deposit Insurance fund more quickly, likely starting in the third quarter. We estimate that this will add about $5 million per quarter to our assessment expense, starting in the -- as I said in the third quarter.
Next let's turn to credit. Our credit quality remains in line with our expectations, which is to say strong with continued low levels of nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs. Nonaccrual loans increased to $877 million and the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans was 1% at the end of the recent quarter. The $77 million increase from the end of the fourth quarter is primarily attributable to Hudson City mortgages. As you know, loans obtained from Hudson City that were 90 days past due as of the acquisition date were recorded as purchased impaired loans. And in accordance with GAAP, interest continues to accrue on those loans despite their delinquency status. Appropriately, those specific acquired loans were not in the nonaccrual balances as of either March 31, 2016 or December 31, 2015. The higher level of nonaccrual loans at the end of the first quarter reflects the normal migration of approximately $80 million of previously performing loans that became more than 90 days past due during the recent quarter and which could not be deemed as impaired at the acquisition date because they were paying at the time of the merger. As a result, we should continue to see a migration of the Hudson City loans acquired at a premium into, and eventually, out of nonaccrual status as this process normalizes to a more steady state through the passage of time.
Net charge-offs for the first quarter were $42 million compared with $36 million in the fourth quarter. During the first quarter of 2016, M&T charge -- charged-off loans associated with consumers, who were either deceased or filed for bankruptcy, that, in accordance with GAAP, had previously been considered when determining the level of allowance for credit losses. Such charge-offs totaled $14 million in the recent quarter and included $11 million of loan balances with a current payment status.
Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 19 basis points for the first quarter, up slightly from 18 basis points in the previous quarter and matching the figure we reported for each of the past 2 calendar years. The provision for credit losses was $49 million for the recent quarter, exceeding net charge-offs by $7 million and the allowance for credit losses was $963 million, amounting to 1.10% of total loans at the end of March.
Loans 90 days past due, which continue to accrue interest, including acquired loans that have been marked to fair value at -- excuse me, excluding the acquired loans that have been marked to fair value at the acquisition, were $336 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these loans, $279 million or 83% are guaranteed by government-related entities.
Turning to capital, M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio under the current transitional Basel III capital rules was an estimated 11.06%, little change from 11.08% at the end of 2015. Recall that the capital plan M&T submitted in connection with the 2015 CCAR process, and which received no objection from the Federal Reserve, included repurchase -- the repurchase of $200 million of common stock over the first half of 2016. We began execution of that buyback program in January and expect to complete it by the end of the second quarter.
In addition, because the completion of the Hudson City merger occurred later than contemplated in the capital plan submission, we did not pay all of the projected dividends associated with the M&T common stock that was issued as merger consideration. As disclosed previously, the distribution of that capital, some $54 million, is being redirected into the repurchase program for the second quarter of 2016.
Now turning to the outlook. As is our usual practice, without giving specific earnings guidance, we'd like to offer our thoughts as to how we're tracking against the outlook for the full year that we gave to you on the January call.
Loan growth this past quarter was largely in line with or slightly better than our expectation, with solid growth in commercial loans, in both commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by slower growth in consumer loans and the expected decline in residential real estate loan.
We were pleased with the strong performance of our net interest margin. Our outlook on the January call for stable net interest margin was predicated on 2 increases in the fed's funds target in the calendar year 2016. More recently, the forward curve is implying 1 increase in mid-year, which would still be a benefit. To some extent, the margin is dampened by our decision to maintain pricing on Hudson City's time deposits, which we will revisit over time.
Fee revenues are in line with our expectations given the normal seasonal effects that we talked about. As is normally the case, we would expect the seasonal increase in salaries and benefits during the first quarter to reverse itself again to the tune of some $30 million to $35 million in the second quarter, and we remain track with realizing our expected cost savings from the merger.
Overall, our basic outlook for expenses is unchanged. We remain focused on producing modest positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. Our outlook for credit is little changed over the short term. While we've had a little or no impact from the energy-related credit headwinds that others are seeing, the current low level of losses has persisted for over 2 years.
Overall, our areas of focus for 2016 are fairly straightforward and relatively consistent with what we've talked about in the past, to continue to improve the efficiency of our balance sheet with an emphasis on building out our commercial banking profile in New Jersey, to manage the revenue expense dynamic; to produce positive operating leverage; to capitalize on the M&A driven disruptions within our footprint; and to optimize our capital structure while conforming with both regulatory capital thresholds as well as the annual stress test.
Of course, as you are aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macro economic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.
So now let's open up the call to questions before which Lori will briefly review the instructions."

And it was pretty strong across the board, maybe slightly more leading towards commercial real estate in Western New York. But other than that, C&I growth was strong across the board. I think the thing that impressed me the most was, we get our results when we look at them. But then in preparing for the call, we tend to look at the quality. So what is the quality of the loans book? What's the pricing? And we were able to get the growth without seeing any deterioration in the margins and the total returns that we were getting on that population of loans. And one of the other things that I think was interesting is that in some of our markets, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Upstate New York, and to some extent, in Washington, D.C. and New York City, we saw this -- the margins actually on, new deals come up maybe 20 to 25 basis points, which we, I guess, estimate that, that had to do with the widening spreads that we saw on the capital markets and the slow than on the CMBS market. It had some small effect.
So I was very encouraged by what we saw. I thought the pace was pretty even, and I t think our pipelines continue to remain fairly robust."

You'll see that those came down to $80 million, right? So those would be the ones that are still on accrual status and so you get a normal migration in and normal migration out. So I think what that means is as a percentage, nonperforming as a percent of that book, it will continue to rise. I would expect at about the same pace that it is -- that you saw this quarter."

Because we spent the whole quarter getting ourselves on the same platforms and system. And we spent also the whole quarter with our folks that from legacy M&T in the retail bank sitting side-to-side with the new Hudson City employees. And so that training has been ongoing. And I think, we will need more time, some part of this year, to make sure that those balances stick around, and that we had the opportunity to interact with those customers over time. One of the things that you're seeing is that we're getting about our prepayments piece on the mortgage book of 15%. So say $300 million a month. But we haven't really seen the similar run off in the time deposit book because we're maintaining those prices in an effort to reach out to contact those customers through the course of the year.  When we talk about some diminishment of our margin, that's embedded in our margin at the top of the house. So I mean, while we were calling for stable margin for the full year, I wouldn't be surprised to see a couple of basis point decline next quarter, and you'll see that will be solely the effect of maintaining those -- that sort of higher time account balances and pricing. But that's totally in our control. So at some point, as we target the customers that we're very focused on getting, and that there's a high probability that we can convert, the rest of the book will just revert that process to normal rational pricing that we want to do in New Jersey and that should give us some benefit. But we're not on a rush. We've got the ability to introduce ourselves to those clients and we're going to make sure we do that."

And underneath, things are going very, very well, both in the global capital markets portion of the institutional client service business and as well as on the wealth side. And my sense is that that still has an underlying growth of 4% or 5% in the revenue space. But more importantly, it's a heavy expense business. And so what we've been focused on and I believe, are starting to make really good traction on is sort of streamlining the back office, which -- that comes in a couple of forms, right? It's sort of -- now that we've got all of our controls in place, we're beginning to change our statementing process, we're beginning to change our on-boarding process, which has an impact of freeing up expenses, but it also improves the service quality. And so I think we'll be at that for at least another year or so and it should, from a bottom-line perspective, continue to grow. Bottom line, both of those businesses have grown every year since we brought them on board, so we're pretty pleased with where they're going."

We had a lot of time to think about it, right, and a lot of time to watch the portfolio. So our team is --  I shouldn't say it, but I'll say that our team is really good. They've done a really good job over the years at these integrations. And so with the lack of complexity was what made this go so smoothly I think. Having said that, we did have a much more robust approach to sort of beyond the due diligence to looking at the integration area by area and monitoring the potential areas for risking, closing them down. So for example, as we went into this conversion, specifically focused on set exactly 70 different places where risk could exist and where that risk would exist between the date we acquired it, the portfolio and the date we integrated it. And then we were able to go through and close all of those down by the time we got to sitting here today. So I think one of the shifts is that because of the way the process works now, the idea of anybody doing simultaneous merger conversions is long gone. We are sad about that from the standpoint that it limits your risk, so you need a much more robust process now that you're going to -- if you're going to own the institution and not convert it right away. And that was something that we added this time, which I think went very, very smoothly."

That evolution is this should be our third CCAR and we were to caper before that. In the last 2 CCARs, we were at about 9.10% in our Tier 1 common ratio and then maybe 9.70% and we fared pretty well. But at that time, we weren't thinking about distributing any capital because we're in a space where we still had a transaction to do. And so just out of that normal principle, we wouldn't be doing that. Because there's some risk when you enter a transaction of maybe a recession happens when you're doing it or there's some operational issues. So because that took so long, it allowed us to build up that capital over time. Also think about the idea that when we first announced that deal, we had about $28 billion in mortgages, and that's down, down to $17 billion, right? So we have all the capital, but -- that we expected to have, but the book has run done over that period of time also as we expected. So over time, we've got to know we've got to distribute that capital back to the shareholders or to put it to a decent use. And that's sort of our task what we're trying to do. We've, to date, been lower than everybody in the total payout ratios, probably half of what the industry's been. And I think I've said that we -- our intention would be to normalize that. And over long periods of time, because we run a model that's not based on growth but it's based on profitability, I think we will always be having a lot of excess capital relative to the average of the industry. We'll try to do the right thing. We've got a history so far, but I think one of the things that you won't see us doing is necessarily buying a bank just because we have excess capacity. We think that might be the fastest way to destroy value, depending on what the pricing is. So we'll be cautious and try to get it back to you."

I guess, what I'd say is we've got a pretty granular disciplined process. So if I provided more color. I would say -- the feedback I'm getting from the commercial bankers is that on larger or more complex transactions is where you were able to see slight moving pricing.

And so when you see a hiccup in that space like you saw on the CMBS markets and like you saw with the wider spread, it's interesting to me that you can feel it pretty quickly. I don't think that's necessarily a positive thing. I think it tells you how sensitive the market can be, the mood swings of those capital markets.

They're working on their balance sheets, they're not necessarily looking at the capital markets, and competition on that front remains pretty intense when it comes to pretty smaller institutions."

As noted in this morning's press release, M&T's results for the first quarter reflected strong growth in net interest income, which was driven by an expansion of the net interest margin and solid loan growth, controlled operating expenses and stable credit performance. All of these contributed to an 11% growth in diluted net operating earnings per share over last year's first quarter.
As we noted on the January call, we closed the merger with Hudson City and restructured its balance sheet in last year's fourth quarter. 
In the first quarter, we completed the migration of Hudson City's customers to M&T's products and services as well as the conversion of its branches, systems and operations onto M&T's platform.
Hudson City's risk management framework has been fully integrated into M&T's risk governance structure, and our task now is to continue to evolve the Hudson City -- continue the evolution of Hudson City from what was essentially a monoline drift into a real commercial bank, which will, of course, take some time. Overall, we feel the first quarter was a productive one. 
As we usually do, I'll start by reviewing a few of the highlights from M&T's first quarter results, after which, Don and I will be happy to take your questions. 
Turning to the results. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $1.73 for the first quarter of 2016, improved from $1.65 in both the first quarter and the fourth quarter of 2015.
Net income for the quarter was $299 million, up 10% from $271 million in the linked quarter and up 24% from $242 million in the year ago quarter.
Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplementary reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions. After tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets was $7 million or $0.05 per common share in the recent quarter compared with $4 million or $0.03 per share in last year's first quarter and $6 million or $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter.
Also included in the first quarter results were $23 million of pretax merger-related charges in the form of noninterest expense incurred in connection with the Hudson City acquisition. This equates to $14 million after-tax or $0.09 per common share.
Merger-related charges in the fourth quarter included $76 million of noninterest expense and $21 million of loan loss provision. Combined, those amounted to $61 million after-tax or $0.40 per common share. There were no such charges in the first quarter of 2015.
Net operating -- M&T's net operating income for the first quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and the merger-related expenses, was $320 million compared with $246 million in last year's first quarter and $338 million in the linked quarter. 
Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $1.87 for the recent quarter, up 11% from $1.68 in the year ago quarter. That figure was $2.09 in last year's fourth quarter.
Net operating income yields annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholder's equity of 1.09% and 11.62% for the recent quarter and the comparable returns were 1.21% and 13.26% in the fourth quarter of 2015.
And in accordance with the SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP, non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.
Turning to the balance sheet and the income statement. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $878 million for the first quarter of 2016, improved by $65 million or approximately 8% from the linked quarter. About $45 million or some 70% of that increase reflects the full quarter of Hudson City's results compared with 2 months in last year's fourth quarter. 
Contributing to the growth in net interest income was a 6 basis point expansion of the net interest margin to 3.18%, up from 312 basis points in the fourth quarter. The primary driver of that increase was the full quarter effect from the Fed's mid-December action to increase short-term interest rates, while the benefit from the day count in the shorter quarter was largely offset by the dilutive impact from a higher level of deposits at -- placed at the Fed.
Average loans increased by 8% or $6.5 billion compared to the linked quarter. This included a 27% or $5.5 billion increase in residential mortgage loans, which primarily reflects the impact from the full quarter of Hudson City results.
Looking at the other loan categories, on an average basis compared with the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans increased $497 million or an annualized 10%. Commercial real estate loans increased $452 million or about 6% annualized. Consumer loans grew at an annualized 1% with growth in indirect auto loans offset by a decline in other consumer loan categories.
The loan growth was broad based, including the impact from -- excuse me, excluding the impact from Hudson City mortgage loans, we saw a 6% annualized growth in Upstate New York; 5% annualized growth in our Metro region, which includes New York City and New Jersey; 9% annualized growth in Pennsylvania; and 4% annualized growth in Baltimore, Washington, Delaware regions.
I'd note that end-of-period loans grew by 2% annualized, with a 15% annualized decline in residential mortgages offset -- more than offset by 9% annualized growth in other loan categories.
Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received in M&T's Cayman Islands office and CDs over $250,000 increased by an annualized 32% from the fourth quarter, also reflecting the impact from Hudson City.
Turning to noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $421 million in the first quarter compared with $448 million in the prior quarter. Mortgage banking revenues were $82 million in the first quarter compared with $88 million in the prior quarter, largely the result of a $5 million decline in commercial mortgage banking revenues to about $22 million, down from $27 million in what was a solid fourth quarter.
Similarly, credit-related fees were lower by $14 million coming off what was also a very strong fourth quarter. That decline is largely related to fees that are often event driven, such as a syndication fee and can carry somewhat -- can vary somewhat from quarter-to-quarter.
Several fee categories were impacted by the typical seasonal factors that we see. For example, fee income from deposit service charges provided was $102 million during the first quarter compared to $106 million in the linked quarter. Trust income was also down modestly.
Turning to expenses. Operating expenses for the first quarter, which exclude merger-related expenses and the amortization of intangible assets, were $400 million -- excuse me were $741 million compared with $701 million in the prior quarter. We continue to be pleased that we've kept expenses relatively stable while absorbing Hudson City as well as funding our technology and other initiatives. This is reflected in our efficiency ratio, which was 57.0% for the first quarter, improved by 450 basis points from 61.5% in the year ago quarter. We estimate that approximately 280 basis points of that improvement is attributable to the merger and 170 basis points is from M&T's legacy operations, the result of our ability to grow revenues at a faster pace than expenses following several years of strengthening our infrastructure. The efficiency ratio was 55.5% in last year's fourth quarter.
As usual, the first quarter comparison with the fourth quarter reflects our normal seasonal increase in salaries and benefits relating to accelerated recognition of equity compensation expense for certain retirement eligible employees, the 401(k) match and the annual reset in Social Security or FICA payments and similar items. Those items accounted for an approximate $40 million increase in salaries and benefits from the fourth quarter similar to last year.
As usual, those seasonal factors will decline by some $30 million to $35 million as we enter the second quarter. One item worth noting is the increase in FDIC assessment to $25 million in the first quarter from $20 million in the fourth. This reflects, in part, the fact that one component of the FDIC's assessment calculator looks back at Hudson City's earnings and treats them as if the Hudson City merger had been in place for the entire year instead of just the final 2 months of 2015. And notwithstanding the fact that Hudson City paid its own FDIC assessment as an independent company through the first 3 quarters of 2015. This factor will normalize as we move later into the year.
Also, as you know, the FDIC has imposed a surcharge on large banks to recapitalize the Deposit Insurance fund more quickly, likely starting in the third quarter. We estimate that this will add about $5 million per quarter to our assessment expense, starting in the -- as I said in the third quarter.
Next let's turn to credit. Our credit quality remains in line with our expectations, which is to say strong with continued low levels of nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs. Nonaccrual loans increased to $877 million and the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans was 1% at the end of the recent quarter. The $77 million increase from the end of the fourth quarter is primarily attributable to Hudson City mortgages. As you know, loans obtained from Hudson City that were 90 days past due as of the acquisition date were recorded as purchased impaired loans. And in accordance with GAAP, interest continues to accrue on those loans despite their delinquency status. Appropriately, those specific acquired loans were not in the nonaccrual balances as of either March 31, 2016 or December 31, 2015. The higher level of nonaccrual loans at the end of the first quarter reflects the normal migration of approximately $80 million of previously performing loans that became more than 90 days past due during the recent quarter and which could not be deemed as impaired at the acquisition date because they were paying at the time of the merger. As a result, we should continue to see a migration of the Hudson City loans acquired at a premium into, and eventually, out of nonaccrual status as this process normalizes to a more steady state through the passage of time.
Net charge-offs for the first quarter were $42 million compared with $36 million in the fourth quarter. During the first quarter of 2016, M&T charge -- charged-off loans associated with consumers, who were either deceased or filed for bankruptcy, that, in accordance with GAAP, had previously been considered when determining the level of allowance for credit losses. Such charge-offs totaled $14 million in the recent quarter and included $11 million of loan balances with a current payment status.
Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 19 basis points for the first quarter, up slightly from 18 basis points in the previous quarter and matching the figure we reported for each of the past 2 calendar years. The provision for credit losses was $49 million for the recent quarter, exceeding net charge-offs by $7 million and the allowance for credit losses was $963 million, amounting to 1.10% of total loans at the end of March.
Loans 90 days past due, which continue to accrue interest, including acquired loans that have been marked to fair value at -- excuse me, excluding the acquired loans that have been marked to fair value at the acquisition, were $336 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these loans, $279 million or 83% are guaranteed by government-related entities.
Turning to capital, M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio under the current transitional Basel III capital rules was an estimated 11.06%, little change from 11.08% at the end of 2015. Recall that the capital plan M&T submitted in connection with the 2015 CCAR process, and which received no objection from the Federal Reserve, included repurchase -- the repurchase of $200 million of common stock over the first half of 2016. We began execution of that buyback program in January and expect to complete it by the end of the second quarter.
In addition, because the completion of the Hudson City merger occurred later than contemplated in the capital plan submission, we did not pay all of the projected dividends associated with the M&T common stock that was issued as merger consideration. As disclosed previously, the distribution of that capital, some $54 million, is being redirected into the repurchase program for the second quarter of 2016.
Now turning to the outlook. As is our usual practice, without giving specific earnings guidance, we'd like to offer our thoughts as to how we're tracking against the outlook for the full year that we gave to you on the January call.
Loan growth this past quarter was largely in line with or slightly better than our expectations, with solid growth in commercial loans, in both commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by slower growth in consumer loans and the expected decline in residential real estate loans.
We were pleased with the strong performance of our net interest margin. Our outlook on the January call for stable net interest margin was predicated on 2 increases in the fed's funds target in the calendar year 2016. More recently, the forward curve is implying 1 increase in mid-year, which would still be a benefit. To some extent, the margin is dampened by our decision to maintain pricing on Hudson City's time deposits, which we will revisit over time.
Fee revenues are in line with our expectations given the normal seasonal effects that we talked about. As is normally the case, we would expect the seasonal increase in salaries and benefits during the first quarter to reverse itself again to the tune of some $30 million to $35 million in the second quarter, and we remain track with realizing our expected cost savings from the merger.
Overall, our basic outlook for expenses is unchanged. We remain focused on producing modest positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. Our outlook for credit is little changed over the short term. While we've had a little or no impact from the energy-related credit headwinds that others are seeing, the current low level of losses has persisted for over 2 years.
Overall, our areas of focus for 2016 are fairly straightforward and relatively consistent with what we've talked about in the past, to continue to improve the efficiency of our balance sheet with an emphasis on building out our commercial banking profile in New Jersey, to manage the revenue expense dynamic; to produce positive operating leverage; to capitalize on the M&A driven disruptions within our footprint; and to optimize our capital structure while conforming with both regulatory capital thresholds as well as the annual stress test.
Of course, as you are aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macro economic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.
So now let's open up the call to questions before which Lori will briefly review the instructions."

And it was pretty strong across the board, maybe slightly more leaning towards commercial real estate in Western New York. But other than that, C&I growth was strong across the board. I think the thing that impressed me the most was, we get our results when we look at them. But then in preparing for the call, we tend to look at the quality. So what is the quality of the loans book? What's the pricing? And we were able to get the growth without seeing any deterioration in the margins and the total returns that we were getting on that population of loans. And one of the other things that I think was interesting is that in some of our markets, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Upstate New York, and to some extent, in Washington, D.C. and New York City, we saw this -- the margins actually on, new deals come up maybe 20 to 25 basis points, which we, I guess, estimate that, that had to do with the widening spreads that we saw on the capital markets and the slow down on the CMBS market. It had some small effect.
So I was very encouraged by what we saw. I thought the pace was pretty even, and I think our pipelines continue to remain fairly robust."

And as we went into April here, the volume still remains pretty decent.

Because we spent the whole quarter getting ourselves on the same platforms and system. And we spent also the whole quarter with our folks that from legacy M&T in the retail bank sitting side-to-side with the new Hudson City employees. And so that training has been ongoing. And I think, we will need more time, some part of this year, to make sure that those balances stick around, and that we had the opportunity to interact with those customers over time. One of the things that you're seeing is that we're getting about -- our prepayments speeds on the mortgage book are 15%. So say $300 million a month. But we haven't really seen the similar run off in the time deposit book because we're maintaining those prices in an effort to reach out to contact those customers through the course of the year.  When we talk about some diminishment of our margin, that's embedded in our margin at the top of the house. So I mean, while we're calling for stable margin for the full year, I wouldn't be surprised to see a couple of basis point decline next quarter, and you'll see that will be solely the effect of maintaining those -- that sort of higher time account balances and pricing. But that's totally in our control. So at some point, as we target the customers that we're very focused on getting, and that there's a high probability that we can convert, the rest of the book will just revert that process to normal rational pricing that we want to do in New Jersey and that should give us some benefit. But we're not on a rush. We've got the ability to introduce ourselves to those clients so we're going to make sure we do that."

I'm glad you started that way because we spent, I don't know, a good 18 months, at essentially getting rid of parts of the business that we didn't really think we had a strategic focus on. And -- so you saw that year-over-year with the retirement business -- portion of the retirement business that we got rid of. We've also gotten rid of a number of affiliated managers or those balances have run down. So I think you're starting to get sort of the core of what we would keep going forward. And underneath, things are going very, very well, both in the global capital markets portion of the institutional client service business and as well as on the wealth side. And my sense is that that still has an underlying growth of 4% or 5% in the revenue space. But more importantly, it's a heavy expense business. And so what we've been focused on and I believe, are starting to make really good traction on is sort of streamlining the back office, which -- that comes in a couple of forms, right? It's sort of -- now that we've got all of our controls in place, we're beginning to change our statementing process, we're beginning to change our on-boarding process, which has an impact of freeing up expenses, but it also improves the service quality. And so I think we'll be at that for at least another year or so and it should, from a bottom-line perspective, continue to grow. Bottom line, both of those businesses have grown every year since we brought them on board, so we're pretty pleased with where they're going."

So we'll watch that over time, but no decisions to change anything that we're doing right now."

We had a lot of time to think about it, right, and a lot of time to watch the portfolio. So our team is --  I shouldn't say it, but I'll say that our team is really good. They've done a really good job over the years at these integrations. And so with the lack of complexity was what made this go so smoothly I think. Having said that, we did have a much more robust approach to sort of beyond the due diligence to looking at the integration area by area and monitoring the potential areas for risking, closing them down. So for example, as we went into this conversion, specifically focused on set exactly 70 different places where risk could exist and where that risk would exist between the date we acquired it, the portfolio, and the date we integrated it. And then we were able to go through and close all of those down by the time we got to sitting here today. So I think one of the shifts is that because of the way the process works now, the idea of anybody doing simultaneous merger conversions is long gone. We are sad about that from the standpoint that it limits your risk, so you need a much more robust process now that you're going to -- if you're going to own the institution and not convert it right away. And that was something that we added this time, which I think went very, very smoothly."

That evolution is this should be our third CCAR and we were at a caper before that. In the last 2 CCARs, we were at about 9.10% in our Tier 1 common ratio and then maybe 9.70% and we fared pretty well. But at that time, we weren't thinking about distributing any capital because we were in a space where we still had a transaction to do. And so just out of that normal principle, we wouldn't be doing that. Because there's some risk when you enter a transaction of maybe a recession happens when you're doing it or there's some operational issues. So because that took so long, it allowed us to build up that capital over time. Also think about the idea that when we first announced that deal, we had about $28 billion in mortgages, and that's down, down to $17 billion, right? So we have all the capital, but -- that we expected to have, but the book has run done over that period of time also as we expected. So over time, we've got to know we've got to distribute that capital back to the shareholders or to put it to a decent use. And that's sort of our task what we're trying to do. We've, to date, been lower than everybody in the total payout ratios, probably half of what the industry's been. And I think I've said that we -- our intention would be to normalize that. And over long periods of time, because we run a model that's not based on growth but it's based on profitability, I think we will always be having a lot of excess capital relative to the average of the industry. We'll try to do the right thing. We've got a history so far, but I think one of the things that you won't see us doing is necessarily buying a bank just because we have excess capital. We think that might be the fastest way to destroy value, depending on what the pricing is. So we'll be cautious and try to get it back to you."

I guess, the way I'd say it is we've got a pretty granular disciplined process. So if I provided more color. I would say -- the feedback I'm getting from the commercial bankers is that on larger or more complex transactions is where you were able to see a slight move in pricing. And I think that does tell you a lot because I think the capital markets, along with life companies, have been providing the extra competition that have pushed pricing down. And so when you see a hiccup in that space like you saw on the CMBS markets and like you saw with the wider spread, it's interesting to me that you can feel it pretty quickly. I don't think that's necessarily a positive thing. I think it tells you how sensitive the market can be to mood swings of those capital markets. Having said that, at the same time, I think what's interesting Geoffrey is so that competition didn't change an ounce with the smaller institutions. They're working on their balance sheets, they're not necessarily looking at the capital markets, and competition on that front remains pretty intense when it came to pretty smaller institutions."

Since it this is my first conference call as Chief Financial Officer, I'll ask you to bear with me. 
Ren√© Jones most recently, and Mike Pinto before him, set a high bar for CFOs in general and for M&T Bank in particular and certainly big shoes to fill. 
Before I start, I'd like to take a moment and thank Ren√© for the advice and guidance that he's provided to the company and to me personally over the time that we together, particularly during the last 90 days. I'm looking forward to me working with many of you as well over the coming months and years. Let's get started. 
In the second quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of revenue, net income of $336 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.98. 
Return on assets were 1.09% and return on common equity was 8.38%. 
Looking at the second quarter results on a net operating  basis, which excludes the after-tax effect of merger-related expenses and amortization of intangible assets, earnings per share equal $2.07. 
Return on tangible assets was 1.18% and return on tangible common equity was 12.68%. Every measure noted above, both on a GAAP and net operating basis, improved from the first quarter.
The efficiency ratio also improved to 55.1% in the second quarter, down from 57% in the first quarter and 58.2% in the year-ago quarter. We're able to deliver these results against the headwinds that we and our clients faced, including an uneven economic recovery and growth, persistent low interest rates and volatile financial markets.
There were many highlights from the second quarter that characterize the state of the bank, and before we review the details, I'd like to take a minute to review a few of the more noteworthy developments.
Probably the biggest highlight of the quarter was receiving a nonobjection from the Federal Reserve to our 2016 CCAR capital plan. While we learned our results in the second quarter, the nonobjection was the favorable results for months of hard work by many of our colleagues around the bank as well as the payback on the investments we've made, over the past several years in our risk management governance, processes and technology. 
We know, however, that the CCAR bar keeps rising, and so this quarter will begin the preparations for CCAR 2017. 
Another highlight of the second quarter is the continued growth of our loan portfolio. While on the surface, 3% annualized loan growth isn't particularly exciting, a look at the details reveals that lending to commercial customers increased on an annualized rate of 11% against the decline in the residential mortgage book of an annualized 16%, largely the result of expected runoff in Hudson City mortgage portfolio. 
This is a pretty typical pattern when you're converting a thrift to a commercial bank. Against this backdrop, credit quality and M&T hallmark remains strong.
In the second quarter, as noted in prior calls, we've been reinvesting a portion of the savings from the merger and the BSA/AML savings to position the bank for the future. We launched the brand campaign in New Jersey to introduce ourselves to the new market. We reminded our legacy market who we are in the face of changing competition, and we continued to invest in our technological infrastructure along several dimensions. 
For instance, in foundational elements like data, in employee tools like teller cash recyclers and in customer convenience and security that will be seen in the form of our upcoming new and improved mtb.com website and enhanced security at our ATMs through the upcoming deployment of the MB protocols. 
So while unique unto itself, this quarter reflects the continuous cycle of invest and harvest that has characterized M&T Bank for many years. Overall, we would describe it as a solid quarter. 
Let's take a look at the details. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $1.98 for the second quarter of 2016, improved from $1.73 in the first quarter and equal to last year's second quarter. 
Net income for the quarter was $336 million, up 13% from $299 million in the linked quarter and up 17% from $287 million in the year-ago quarter. 
After tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets was $7 million or $0.04 per common share in the recent quarter compared to $7 million and $0.05 per common share in the first quarter.
Also included in the second quarter results were $13 million of pretax merger-related charges incurred in connection with the Hudson City acquisition. This equates to $8 million after-tax effect or $0.05 per common share. 
Merger-related expenses in the second quarter -- or sorry, excuse me, merger-related expenses in the first quarter totaled $23 million pretax. That amounted to $14 million after-tax effect or $0.09 per common share. 
Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its result on a net operating for tangible basis from which we exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions. 
M&T's net operating income for the second quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related expenses, was $351 million compared with $290 million in last year's second quarter and $320 million in the linked quarter. 
Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $2.07 for the recent quarter, improved from $2.01 in the year-ago quarter and that figure was $1.87 in this year's first quarter. 
Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity of 1.18% and 12.68% for the recent quarter. 
The comparable returns were 1.09% and 11.62% in the first quarter of 2016. 
In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity. 
If we turn our attention to the balance sheet and income statement, taxable net -- the taxable equivalent net interest income was $870 million in the second quarter of 2016, down $8 million from the linked quarter. 
The decline reflected the combination of a narrowing of the net interest margin and a change in the mix of interest earning assets. Let's look at the specifics.
Net interest margin declined to 3.13%, down 5 basis points from 3.18% in the linked quarter. What we'd consider to be core margin pressure accounted for about 3 basis points of the decline. That includes the impact of the slightly more costly mix of deposits, including the impact of the Hudson City time deposits as well as growth in savings deposits associated with our mortgage servicing operations. 
On the noncore side, interest-bearing deposits with banks, which, primarily reflect cash on deposit at The New York Fed, averaged $8.7 billion during the second quarter, up by over $500 million from the prior quarter. That increase, the result of higher balances of trust deposits, decreased the margin by approximately 1 basis point. 
Average Investment Securities declined, reflecting normal principal amortization as well as a step up in prepayments. Those prepayments of higher-yielding securities and a limited amount of reinvestment into lower yielding LCR compliant securities reduced the yield on the portfolio. We estimate these factors diminish the margin by an additional basis point. 
The cost of deposits reflects in part our decision, which we've previously discussed, to maintain pricing for customers in the greater New York area whose accounts were formerly held at Hudson City Savings Banks. We'll offer more thoughts with respect to that pricing in a few moments.
Average loans increased by about 3% annualized or $572 million compared to the linked quarter. 
Looking at the loans by category, on an average basis compared within the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans increased an annualized 14%. 
Commercial real estate loans increased by about 10% annualized. As noted earlier, those 2 categories combined grew an annualized 11%. 
Also as noted, residential mortgage loans declined at an annualized 15% rate. Consumer loans grew an annualized 5%, with growth in indirect loans, including auto loans, partly offset by a decline in home equity lines of credit. 
Loan growth was consistent across most of our footprint, including Upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Greater New York City and New Jersey. Growth in the Mid-Atlantic region was slightly softer.
Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office and CDs over 250,000 increased at an annualized 8% from the first quarter, reflecting the higher level of trust and savings deposits that I mentioned earlier. 
Turning to noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $448 million in the second quarter compared to $421 million from -- in the prior quarter. 
Mortgage banking revenues were $89 million in the recent quarter compared with $82 million in the linked quarter. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $858 million in the quarter, up some 30% compared with first quarter, while the gain on sale margin was relatively stable. 
Our commercial mortgage banking operation had a strong quarter as well, with a slight increase in multi-family commercial mortgages originated for sale combined with a favorable mix of higher margin loans than net prior quarter. 
Trust fees improved to $120 million in the recent quarter, up from $111 million in the previous quarter. That increase reflects about $3 million of seasonal tax-preparation fees that usually occur in the second quarter as well as fees from net new business, particularly on the institutional side.
Service charges on deposit accounts and commercial loan fees also improved from the first quarter.
Turning to expenses. Operating expenses for the second quarter, which exclude merger-related expenses and the amortization of intangible assets were $726 million, improved from $741 million in the prior quarter.
On that same operating basis, salary and benefits declined by $28 million from the seasonally high level in the first quarter. Partially offsetting that decline was a $16 million increase in other cost of operations, including higher Professional Services expenses. 
The efficient -- the operating efficiency ratio improved to 55.1% in the quarter, down from 57% in the first quarter and 58.2% in last year's second quarter. 
Next, let's turn to credit.
Our credit quality remains in line with our expectations, which is to stay strong with continuing low levels of nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs. 
Nonaccrual loans declined to $849 million and the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans was 0.96%, improved from 1% at the end of the first quarter. 
Net charge-offs for the second quarter were $24 million compared with $42 million in the first quarter. Recall that the first quarter's results included $14 million of charge-offs associated with consumer loan customers who are either deceased or filed bankruptcy compared with just $5 million in the recent quarter. 
In addition, the results for the second quarter included a $7 million recovery on a previously charged off commercial loan.
Reflecting the recovery, annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 11 basis points for the second quarter, while the comparable figure was 19 basis points in the previous quarter. The provision for credit losses was $32 million in the recent quarter, exceeding net charge-offs of by $8 million, reflecting overall loan growth as well as the ongoing shift to a higher proportion of commercial loans as the Hudson City mortgage portfolio pace down. 
The allowance for credit losses was $970 million at the end of June. The ratio of  the allowance to total loans was 1.10%, unchanged from the end of the first quarter.
Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest, excluding acquired loans that had been marked to fair value discount at acquisition were $298 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these loans, $270 million or 91% are guaranteed by government-related entities. 
Turning to capital. M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio under the current transitional Basel III capital rules was an estimated 11.01% compared with 11.06% at the end of the first quarter, which reflects our earnings retention, less $154 million of share repurchases during the second quarter as well as loan growth -- net loan growth. I'll offer our thoughts on our 2016 capital plan, which received no objections from the Federal Reserve in a few moments.
Next, I'd like to give you an update on several of the projects we've been working on. As previously announced, we completed the conversion of Hudson City during the first quarter in which we converted them to our systems and operations, including loan and deposit accounting, mortgage servicing and other core applications. 
Although Hudson City's all Hudson City facilities were rebranded to M&T at that time. Speaking of branding, those of you who work and live in the greater New York and New Jersey markets have undoubtedly seen a step up in our advertising as part of this process. 
More recently, we've been working on the longer-term initiative of converting Hudson City from a thrift culture to M&T's commercial bank culture. We are continuing to hire in the New Jersey market, including commercial lenders, business bankers and wealth advisors. We've hired some 49  customer-facing employees since the beginning of 2016. 
To complement our commercial hiring, we've begun an accelerated business banking training initiative for some 30 Hudson City branch managers who are on a fast-track to learn M&T's branch sales practices. Training also continues for other branch base colleagues, increasing their familiarity with the entire suite of commercial bank products and services.
Our investments in technology include continuing to enhance our ability to capture and organize data for risk management and capital planning requirements as well as for improving customer service. These investments paid a dividend in the form of our 2016 CCAR results, but as noted earlier, the bar rises every year, requiring continuous improving in our risk management practices. 
Beyond our data initiative, you should see some tangible results from our technology investment shortly, including a major update to our website within the next several weeks and an updated mobile app that we anticipate rolling out later this year. 
We're also working on enhancing the tools we give to our employees to improve our interactions with customers by simplifying the processes employees must follow to complete their work. These projects are still in the early stages.
Lastly, we've discussed in a general way the opportunities presented to us by the changing competitive environment occurring or about to occur in our footprint. We know from first-hand experience that change brings uncertainty. Whether it's with our personal banking or business banking, customers seek stability when considering their banking options. We are here to help customers in our communities as we have been for over 160 years. 
To offer one example, using checking account acquisition as a proxy for new customer acquisition, year-over-year growth in Greater Buffalo is nearly 19%, almost twice as large as the average across the remainder of the footprint.
Now let's turn to the outlook. As is our usual practice, without giving specific earnings guidance, we'd like to offer our thoughts as to how we are tracking against the outlook for the full year that we gave you on the January call. While our outlook is mostly unchanged from the previous calls, one factor that has changed is the outlook for increases in the Fed funds rate. At the time of our January call, the forward rate curve was implying 2 actions by the Fed in calendar year 2016. There now appears to be little prospect for even 1 increase this year, perhaps not until -- perhaps not even until late -- mid-to late next year. 
But even without any Fed action, the curve is flattened with the 10 -- with the yield on 10-year treasuries touching an all-time low recently. 
Our ability to maintain a stable year-over-year margin will be impacted by that change interest rate outlook, but that would be somewhat offset by our ability to reposition the balanced sheet, particularly with respect to trust deposits and the pricing on Hudson City time deposits.
Loan growth this past quarter was largely in line with, or slightly better than, our expectations, with solid growth in commercial loans, both commercial and industrial and commercial real estate, partially offset by slower growth in consumer loans and the expected decline in residential real estate. Absent rises in interest rates, we don't expect the pace of prepayments to slow.
Fee revenues remain in line with our expectations, given the normal seasonal effects. 
On expenses, our outlook for the second half of 2016 is to be somewhat consistent with the first half. This includes the FDIC surcharge imposed on banks over $50 billion in size, which will add about $5 million per quarter to our FDIC assessment as well as our ongoing investment program. We remain focused on producing positive -- modest-to-positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. We don't expect any additional merger-related expenses in connection with Hudson City. 
Our outlook for credit is little changed over the short term. We're still not seeing pressures on credit, either nonaccrual loans or charge-offs.
Regarding our capital plan, we were delighted to receive no objection from our regulators to the plan we submitted in connection with the 2016 CCAR process. As you know, we plan to repurchase $1.15 billion of M&T common stock over the 4 quarter period beginning July 1. 
In addition, the planned contemplates our Board considering, an increase in the common stock dividend to $0.75 per quarter in January of 2017. Although there is no reason to expect we won't execute on this plan as proposed, I would remind you that all of these capital actions are subject to our normal capital  governance policies and unexpected adverse microeconomic events could impact our actions. 
Of course, as you are aware, our projections are subject to a number of certainty and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually enfolds in the future.

So first of all, we've got the FDIC assessment going up 5 million a quarter right there. What you'll see is that when we look at our other cost of operations, which is really where we're focused, legal expenses are up in the second quarter and will likely continue at that pace in the third and fourth quarter and impossibly increase lately as we go through our defense with some of the Wilmington Trust and out there. And we will be continuing to make the investments that we've been talking about in the franchise, especially continuing on path with technology. So those are probably the big things that you'll see there. And the other thing of course,, which I should mention is we'll be right in the throes of some of the changes that will be happening in our marketplace in the third quarter, and we'll probably spend a little more on advertising as we try to take advantage of the changes that are happening. So some of those things are kind of more permanent in nature. Some of the more permanent is probably bad description.

When we look at pricing, I wouldn't say that it's going up, but it seems to have stabilized somewhat, so we feel better about that. And when we look at the amount of equity that's in the deals, it's still at or above where things were back in '06, '07, so I think the market has learned its lesson as far as that goes.
When we look in our markets and where we're winning business, it doesn't seem to be at the moment coming from any particular competitor that might have reached concentration limits, but I know that's an issue that's out there.

And then for the commercial and business parts of the bank, we've been there actually with M&T bankers pretty much since shortly after the announcement date. So really, our focus there has been to keep that group of people engaged. And since we've got the deal done, they've been excited and have the ability now to work with the branches and offer more confidently the deposit side of the relationship. And then we've been out  recording, and we try to grow that business through people additions. I think the thing that we pay a lot of attention to is just like we pay a lot of attention to credit, and we want to grow in that footprint. We're going to grow under the kind of terms and structure that we know is good business, so we're not going to rush it. And the same thing I'd of applies to people that we know that finding and adding to our teams people that fit our culture and understand how we do business and think about relationship and think about that structure, it's more important to us -- we get the right people on the teams, rather than fill the spots quickly. So I feel like -- I feel really good about where we are. I think we're tracking to where we would expect to be, and we just got to manage that with the pace that we talked about a little bit earlier on, which is the pace at which those mortgages runoff and the pace at which we grow the commercial balances to offset that. But overall, we're very pleased with where things are."

Because it would seem to me that with the recent conversion, you -- one would have thought that you might have at a somewhat stronger pipeline in the second quarter.

One obviously starts with the capital we carry to the bank. And when -- so that's part of our CCAR announcement, our CCAR, and we'll be continuing to look at the volatility of our earnings and our charge-off levels and continuing to work on our capital policies to make sure that we were adequately capital last, but not overly capitalized and that will help. The other thing that, I guess, we think about when we look at our return versus our cost to capital, when you look at the volatility of our charge-offs and you look at the volatility of our earnings, we would kind of think that our cost to capital would be towards the bottom end of the industry because our beta is lower. So when you look at that, we think our cost to capital would be below the average in the industry. And we think that, over time, as we continue to make the changes to the business to improve profitability as well as return capital, that those would be the factors that we would be thinking about as we move the needle on returns up in a positive direction."

Following up on your comments on CCAR, I congratulate you for using the Mulligan. We wish more banks would do that.

I think it was over 600 basis points this year. Last year, it was under -- just under 300 basis points, if I recall. What caused that to be so much greater this time? And second, if it was totally due to the Hudson City deal, should we expect, as you integrate that further, that, that kind of reduction in capital should be reduced in a go-forward basis?"

First  off, if you think about the Mulligan and how people use that, I guess, I feel the need to kind of address that, but we didn't go into the process with the intention of using the Mulligan. We followed process and build our analysis of our PPNR and our capital levels on the stress, and we set our ask based on what we think is the target that we need to run the bank. I think what we saw is that there were some differences between our analysis and the feds, and they built the process and gave people a chance to make an adjustment because they can see that they're looking at things differently than we are. They could to see the industry as we don't, and they built the process that I think is sound in allowing you to make that change. So we were fortunate that it was in place and we used it. I think when you think about our returns over the last 3 years, if you add in this year and the prior 2,  we'd still to be towards the bottom end of returns in the industry. And we were cautious leading into the Hudson City acquisition because there's always uncertainty when you're doing a deal and we didn't want to have any issues. I think if you look on a going forward, we kind of see where our earnings are going, where our PPNR is going. We continue to make progress on our models and in our loss rates. And I think looking at the balance sheet and as the balance sheet changes, we feel like our capital levels, even with this buyback, will be pretty good. And depending on what happens over the course of the next year, we'll be looking to continue to bring those levels down closer to, I guess, closer to what our targets are, which and/or where we were when we pass CCAR over the prior years."

Over the next couple of quarters, it's probably going to be tough to see any growth there just because of the rate or the expected rate of decrease in the residential mortgage portfolio from Hudson City. So that's a big hill for us to climb to get back to flatter positive. I think when you look at the margin itself, we think we've got some opportunity there that's in our control from the Hudson City time deposit book to bring that down to reduce the cost of funding the assets on the balance sheet. And, obviously, we're seeing and expecting to see some continued growth on the commercial loan side. As it relates to trust deposits, I guess we could do something to turn those deposits away. But when we look at it, it's a good deal for us because it requires no equity, and we parked the money at the Fed. And I think Ren√©  had mentioned on prior calls, but I'll just remind you that with some of our business on the trust side, we get paid either in fees or in deposits. And in the current environment, many people are choosing to pay us in deposits. So while it reduces the margin in the short term, it's positive for net interest income and for earnings. So we don't get too fussed about where the margin because of what's going on with the trust demand deposits."

There's may be a little bit to come through the back half of the year, but it might take a little longer on some of those pieces as we work through ORE and expenses like that. When you look at the run rate for the rest of the year, there's change in the deposit charge, the FDIC charge, that will go up in the third quarter. We think it will start to move a little bit down in time as we change the mix of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. We've got some increases for events, I would call them, one of them being the change that we see happening in our marketplace as what we'll spend on some advertising dollars to take advantage of that. And then we've got the other event that is going on in will through the end of the year, which is the legal things that are happening. So those will elevate expenses for the back half of this year. I wouldn't expect them to carry on all through 2017, right? So the advertising we know pretty certain what will happen with that because there's a time limit to that. With the legal stuff, we know we have a trial date in January, but those dates can change. So I don't want to get too crazy on that, but that's probably what's driving some of that expense. When you look at the other places where we're investing, it continues to be in technology, and that will move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter.

So I guess if you think about the conversation with these customers, it probably goes and ends one of 3 ways. So one way as we say to someone who's CD-only customer, here's the rate we're offering the people that on their CDs with us. That rate would be lower than what they were earning today and would be more in line with what we're likely offering in our existing markets. The customer can choose that or they can choose another alternative, which would be to broaden the relationship. Maybe bring a checking account relationship with them where they have their paycheck deposit. And if they bring that to us, then the rate would stay roughly where it is. But we would get a benefit as we add the low-cost deposit from the checking account, and that really opens up some fee income opportunities to debit card  interchange that goes with checking accounts or other maintenance fees that go with those accounts. And then the last option is if they don't like the rate that we're offering them, stand-alone and they choose not to broaden their relationship with us, they may choose to leave and go elsewhere looking for a yield that suits their needs. And so what you see over time is we'll see probably a combination of two things. We'll see a decrease in the rate that we're paying, and we'll also see a decrease in the balances that sit within those time accounts. And  the combination of those 2 things is what we'll help reduce the interest expense and help manage some of that margin compression that we're talking about. So like I said before, I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, but when you look at the book, the vast majority of it, I think it's about a $12 billion book and 3 quarters of it will reprice over the course of the next 12 months. so there, you're talking about $9 billion that will reprice over the course of the next 12 months. And I think there's a little bit of front-loaded to the third quarter based on my recollection, but you think about it fairly evenly split across those quarters, that will be a good way to think about it."

Since this is my first conference call as Chief Financial Officer, I'll ask you to bear with me. 
Ren√© Jones most recently, and Mike Pinto before him, set a high bar for CFOs in general and for M&T Bank in particular. I certainly have big shoes to fill. 
Before I start, I'd like to take a moment and thank Ren√© for the advice and guidance that he's provided to the company and to me personally over the time that we've worked together, particularly the -- during the last 90 days. I'm looking forward to working with many of you as well over the coming months and years. Let's get started. 
In the second quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of revenue, net income of $336 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.98. Return on assets were 1.09% and return on common equity was 8.38%. 
Looking at the second quarter results on a net operating  basis, which excludes the after-tax effect of merger-related expenses and amortization of intangible assets, earnings per share equal $2.07. 
Return on tangible assets was 1.18% and return on tangible common equity was 12.68%. Every measure noted above, both on a GAAP and net operating basis, improved from the first quarter.
The efficiency ratio also improved to 55.1% in the second quarter, down from 57% in the first quarter and 58.2% in the year-ago quarter. We're able to deliver these results against the headwinds that we and our clients faced, including an uneven economic recovery and growth, persistent low interest rates and volatile financial markets.
There are many highlights from the second quarter that characterize the state of the bank. And before we review the details, I'd like to take a minute to review a few of the more noteworthy developments.
Probably the biggest highlight of the quarter was receiving a non-objection from the Federal Reserve to our 2016 CCAR capital plan. While we learned our results in the second quarter, the non-objection was the favorable results for months of hard work by many of our colleagues around the bank as well as the payback on the investments we've made, over the past several years in our risk management governance, processes and technology. 
We know, however, that the CCAR bar keeps rising, and so this quarter will begin the preparations for CCAR 2017. 
Another highlight of the second quarter is the continued growth of our loan portfolio. While on the surface, 3% annualized loan growth isn't particularly exciting, a look at the details reveals that lending to commercial customers increased at an annualized rate of 11% against the decline in the residential mortgage book of an annualized 16%, largely the result of expected runoff in the Hudson City mortgage portfolio. 
This is a pretty typical pattern when you're converting a thrift to a commercial bank. Against this backdrop, credit quality and M&T hallmark remains strong.
In the second quarter, as noted in prior calls, we've been reinvesting a portion of the savings from the merger and the BSA/AML savings to position the bank for the future. We launched the brand campaign in New Jersey to introduce ourselves to the new market. We reminded our legacy market who we are in the face of changing competition, and we continued to invest in our technological infrastructure along several dimensions. 
For instance, in foundational elements like data, in employee tools like teller cash recyclers and in customer convenience and security that will be seen in the form of our upcoming new and improved mtb.com website and enhanced security at our ATMs through the upcoming deployment of the MB [ph] protocols. 
So while unique unto itself, this quarter reflects the continuous cycle of invest and harvest that has characterized M&T Bank for many years. Overall, we would describe it as a solid quarter. 
Let's take a look at the details. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $1.98 for the second quarter of 2016, improved from $1.73 in the first quarter and equal to last year's second quarter. 
Net income for the quarter was $336 million, up 13% from $299 million in the linked quarter and up 17% from $287 million in the year-ago quarter. 
After tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets was $7 million or $0.04 per common share in the recent quarter compared to $7 million and $0.05 per common share in the first quarter.
Also included in the second quarter results were $13 million of pretax merger-related charges incurred in connection with the Hudson City acquisition. This equates to $8 million after-tax effect or $0.05 per common share. 
Merger-related expenses in the second quarter -- or sorry, excuse me, merger-related expenses in the first quarter totaled $23 million pretax. That amounted to $14 million after-tax effect or $0.09 per common share. 
Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions. 
M&T's net operating income for the second quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related expenses, was $351 million compared with $290 million in last year's second quarter and $320 million in the linked quarter. 
Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $2.07 for the recent quarter, improved from $2.01 in the year-ago quarter and that figure was $1.87 in this year's first quarter. 
Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity of 1.18% and 12.68% for the recent quarter. 
The comparable returns were 1.09% and 11.62% in the first quarter of 2016. 
In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity. 
If we turn our attention to the balance sheet and income statement, taxable net -- the taxable equivalent net interest income was $870 million in the second quarter of 2016, down $8 million from the linked quarter. 
The decline reflected the combination of a narrowing of the net interest margin and a change in the mix of interest earning assets. Let's look at the specifics.
Net interest margin declined to 3.13%, down 5 basis points from 3.18% in the linked quarter. What we'd consider to be core margin pressure accounted for about 3 basis points of the decline. That includes the impact of a slightly more costly mix of deposits, including the impact of the Hudson City time deposits as well as growth in savings deposits associated with our mortgage servicing operations. 
On the noncore side, interest-bearing deposits with banks, which primarily reflect cash on deposit at the New York Fed, averaged $8.7 billion during the second quarter, up by over $500 million from the prior quarter. That increase, the result of higher balances of trust deposits, decreased the margin by approximately 1 basis point. 
Average investment securities declined, reflecting normal principal amortization as well as a step-up in prepayments. Those prepayments of higher-yielding securities and a limited amount of reinvestment into lower yielding LCR compliant securities reduced the yield on the portfolio. We estimate these factors diminish the margin by an additional basis point. 
The cost of deposits reflects in part our decision, which we've previously discussed, to maintain pricing for customers in the Greater New York area, whose accounts were formerly held at Hudson City Savings Bank. We'll offer more thoughts with respect to that pricing in a few moments.
Average loans increased by about 3% annualized or $572 million compared to the linked quarter. 
Looking at the loans by category, on an average basis compared within the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans increased an annualized 14%. 
Commercial real estate loans increased by about 10% annualized. As noted earlier, those 2 categories combined grew an annualized 11%. 
Also as noted, residential mortgage loans declined at an annualized 15% rate. Consumer loans grew an annualized 5%, with growth in indirect loans, including auto loans, partly offset by a decline in home equity lines of credit. 
Loan growth was consistent across most of our footprint, including Upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Greater New York City and New Jersey. Growth in the Mid-Atlantic region was slightly softer.
Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office and CDs over 250,000 increased at an annualized 8% from the first quarter, reflecting the higher level of trust and savings deposits that I mentioned earlier. 
Turning to noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $448 million in the second quarter compared to $421 million from -- in the prior quarter. 
Mortgage banking revenues were $89 million in the recent quarter compared with $82 million in the linked quarter. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $858 million in the quarter, up some 30% compared with the first quarter, while the gain on sale margin was relatively stable. 
Our commercial mortgage banking operation had a strong quarter as well, with a slight increase in multi-family commercial mortgages originated for sale combined with a favorable mix of higher margin loans than net prior quarter. 
Trust fees improved to $120 million in the recent quarter, up from $111 million in the previous quarter. That increase reflects about $3 million of seasonal tax-preparation fees that usually occur in the second quarter as well as fees from net new business, particularly on the institutional side.
Service charges on deposit accounts and commercial loan fees also improved from the first quarter.
Turning to expenses. Operating expenses for the second quarter, which exclude merger-related expenses and the amortization of intangible assets were $726 million, improved from $741 million in the prior quarter.
On that same operating basis, salary and benefits declined by $28 million from the seasonally high level in the first quarter. Partially offsetting that decline was a $16 million increase in other cost of operations, including higher professional services expenses. 
The efficient -- the operating efficiency ratio improved to 55.1% in the quarter, down from 57% in the first quarter and 58.2% in last year's second quarter. 
Nextly, let's turn to credit.
Our credit quality remains in line with our expectations, which is to stay strong with continuing low levels of nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs. 
Nonaccrual loans declined to $849 million and the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans was 0.96%, improved from 1% at the end of the first quarter. 
Net charge-offs for the second quarter were $24 million compared with $42 million in the first quarter. Recall that the first quarter's results included $14 million of charge-offs associated with consumer loan customers, who are either deceased or filed bankruptcy, compared with just $5 million in the recent quarter. 
In addition, the results for the second quarter included a $7 million recovery on a previously charged off commercial loan.
Reflecting net recovery, annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 11 basis points for the second quarter, while the comparable figure was 19 basis points in the previous quarter. The provision for credit losses was $32 million in the recent quarter, exceeding net charge-offs by $8 million, reflecting overall loan growth as well as the ongoing shift to a higher proportion of commercial loans as the Hudson City mortgage portfolio pace down. 
The allowance for credit losses was $970 million at the end of June. The ratio of the allowance to total loans was 1.10%, unchanged from the end of the first quarter.
Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest, excluding acquired loans that had been marked to fair value discount at acquisition were $298 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these loans, $270 million or 91% are guaranteed by government-related entities. 
Turning to capital. M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio under the current transitional Basel III capital rules was an estimated 11.01% compared with 11.06% at the end of the first quarter, which reflects earnings retention, less $154 million of share repurchases during the second quarter as well as loan growth -- net loan growth. I'll offer our thoughts on our 2016 capital plan, which received no objections from the Federal Reserve in a few moments.
Next, I'd like to give you an update on several of the projects we've been working on. As previously announced, we completed the conversion of Hudson City during the first quarter in which we converted them to our systems and operations, including loan and deposit accounting, mortgage servicing and other core applications. 
All the Hudson City's-- all the Hudson  City facilities were rebranded to M&T at that time. Speaking of branding, those of you who work and live in the Greater New York/New Jersey market have undoubtedly seen a step-up in our advertising as part of this process. 
More recently, we've been working on the longer-term initiative of converting Hudson City from a thrift culture to M&T's commercial bank culture. We are continuing to hire in the New Jersey market, including commercial lenders, business bankers and wealth advisors. We've hired some 49  customer-facing employees since the beginning of 2016. 
To complement our commercial hiring, we've begun an accelerated business banking training initiative for some 30 Hudson City branch managers who are on a fast-track to learn M&T's branch sales practices. Training also continues for our other branch-based colleagues, increasing their familiarity with our entire suite of commercial bank products and services.
Our investments in technology include continuing to enhance our ability to capture and organize data for risk management and capital planning requirements as well as for improving customer service. These investments paid a dividend in the form of our 2016 CCAR results, but as noted earlier, the bar rises every year, requiring continuous improving in our risk management practices. 
Beyond our data initiative, you should see some tangible results from our technology investment shortly, including a major update to our website within the next several weeks and an updated mobile app that we anticipate rolling out later this year. 
We're also working on enhancing the tools we give to our employees to improve our interactions with customers by simplifying the processes employees must follow to complete their work. These projects are still in the early stages.
Lastly, we've discussed in a general way the opportunities presented to us by the changing competitive environment occurring or about to occur in our footprint. We know from first-hand experience that change brings uncertainty. Whether it's with their personal banking or business banking, customers seek stability when considering their banking options. We are here to help customers in our communities as we have been for over 160 years. 
To offer one example, using checking account acquisition as a proxy for new customer acquisition, year-over-year growth in Greater Buffalo is nearly 19%, almost twice as large as the average across the remainder of the footprint.
Now let's turn to the outlook. As is our usual practice, without giving specific earnings guidance, we'd like to offer our thoughts as to how we're tracking against the outlook for the full year that we gave you on the January call. While our outlook is mostly unchanged from the previous calls, one factor that has changed is the outlook for increases in the Fed funds rate. At the time of our January call, the forward rate curve was implying 2 actions by the Fed in calendar year 2016. There now appears to be little prospect for even 1 increase this year, perhaps not until -- and perhaps not even until late -- mid- to late next year. 
But even without any Fed action, the curve is flattened with the 10 -- with the yield on 10-year treasuries touching an all-time low recently. 
Our ability to maintain a stable year-over-year margin will be impacted by that changed interest rate outlook, but that would be somewhat offset by our ability to reposition the balanced sheet, particularly with respect to trust deposits and the pricing on Hudson City time deposits.
Loan growth this past quarter was largely in line with, or slightly better than our expectations, with solid growth in commercial loans, both commercial and industrial and commercial real estate, partially offset by slower growth in consumer loans and the expected decline in residential real estate. Absent rises in interest rates, we don't expect the pace of repayments to slow.
Fee revenues remain in line with our expectations, given the normal seasonal effects. 
On expenses, our outlook for the second half of 2016 is to be somewhat consistent with the first half. This includes the FDIC surcharge imposed on banks over $50 billion in size, which will add about $5 million per quarter to our FDIC assessment as well as our ongoing investment program. We remain focused on producing positive -- modest-to-positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. We don't expect any additional merger-related expenses in connection with Hudson City. 
Our outlook for credit is little changed over the short term. We're still not seeing pressures on credit, either nonaccrual loans or charge-offs.
Regarding our capital plan, we were delighted to receive no objection from our regulators to the plan we submitted in connection with the 2016 CCAR process. As you know, we plan to repurchase $1.15 billion of M&T common stock over the fourth -- 4-quarter period beginning July 1. 
In addition, the planned contemplates our Board considering, an increase in the common stock dividend to $0.75 per quarter in January of 2017. While there is no reason to expect we won't execute on this plan as proposed, I would remind you that all of these capital actions are subject to our normal capital governance policies and unexpected adverse macroeconomic events could impact our actions. 
Of course, as you're aware, our projections are subject to a number of certainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future. 
Now let's open up the call to questions, before which, Paula will briefly review the instructions."

Some of those things will run their course over the rest of this year and some of them will probably take a little longer."

I guess, I'll offer a couple of thoughts as it relates to CRE. First, when we look at what we've -- where our growth has come from, it's been fairly broad-based across our geographies and across property types. So we're not seeing any concentrations or things that we would point to that we would get worried about. When we look at pricing, I wouldn't say that it's going up, but it seems to have stabilized somewhat. So we feel better about that. And when we look at the amount of equity that's in the deals, it's still at or above where things were back in '06, '07. So I think the market has learned its lesson as far as that goes.
When we look in our markets and where we're winning business, it doesn't seem to be at the moment coming from any particular competitor that might have reached concentration limits, but I know that's an issue that's out there. I think when we do see things that look a little crazy to us, either in terms of pricing or structure, it tends to be the non-bank lenders that are in that space, and we would tend to shy away from that and keep our powder dry."

And then for the commercial and business parts of the bank, we've been there actually with M&T bankers pretty much since shortly after the announcement date. So really, our focus there has been to keep that group of people engaged. And since we got the deal done, they've been excited and have the ability now to work with the branches and offer more confidently the deposit side of the relationship. And then we've been out recruiting, and we're trying to grow that business through people additions. I think the thing that we pay a lot of attention to is just like we pay a lot of attention to credit, and we want to grow in that footprint, we're going to grow under the kind of terms and structure that we know is good business. So we're not going to rush it. And the same thing kind of applies to people that we know that finding and adding to our teams people that fit our culture and understand how we do business and think about relationship and think about good structure, it's more important to us that we get the right people on the teams, rather than fill the spots quickly. So I feel like -- I feel really good about where we are.

One obviously starts with the capital we carry to run the bank. And when -- so that was part of our CCAR announcement, our CCAR ask, and we'll be continuing to look at the volatility of our earnings and our charge-off levels and continuing to work on our capital policies to make sure that we were adequately capitalized, but not overly capitalized and that will help. The other thing that, I guess, we think about when we look at our return versus our cost of capital, when you look at the volatility of our charge-offs and you look at the volatility of our earnings, we would kind of think that our cost of capital will be towards the bottom end of the industry because our beta is lower. So when you look at that, we think our cost of capital would be below the average in the industry.

Following up on your comments on CCAR, I congratulate you for using the Mulligan. We wish more banks would do that. I noticed that, if I recall correctly, the amount of capital that was reduced because of the CCAR process was considerably higher this year than last year. I think it was over 600 basis points this year. Last year, it was under -- just under 300 basis points, if I recall. What caused that to be so much greater this time? And second, if it was totally due to the Hudson City deal, should we expect, as you integrate that further, that, that kind of reduction in capital should be reduced on a go-forward basis?"

I'd be honest with you, I'm not as familiar with the 300 and 600 basis points that you're mentioning but, I guess, a couple of things that I think about. First  off, if you think about the Mulligan and how people use that, I guess, I feel the need to kind of address that, that we didn't go into the process with the intention of using the Mulligan. We followed our process and did our analysis of our PPNR and our capital level under stress, and we set our ask based on what we think is the target that we need to run the bank. I think what we saw is that there were some differences between our analysis and the feds, and they built a process that'll -- that gave people a chance to make an adjustment because they can see that they're looking at things differently than we are. They get to see the industry and we don't, and they built a process that I think is sound in allowing you to make that change. So we were fortunate that it was in place and we used it. I think when you think about our returns over the last 3 years, if you add in this year and the prior 2, we'd still to be towards the bottom end of returns in the industry. And we were cautious leading into the Hudson City acquisition because there's always uncertainty when you're doing a deal and we didn't want to have any issues. I think if you look on a going forward, we kind of see where our earnings are going, where our PPNR is going. We continue to make progress on our models and in our loss rates. And I think looking at the balance sheet and as the balance sheet changes, we feel like our capital levels, even with this buyback, will be pretty good. And depending on what happens over the course of the next year, we'll be looking to continue to bring those levels down closer to, I guess, closer to what our targets are, which and/or where we were when we pass CCAR over the prior years."

So I guess, starting with the net interest income. Over the next couple of quarters, it's probably going to be tough to see any growth there just because of the rate -- or the expected rate of decrease in the residential mortgage portfolio from Hudson City. So that's a big hill for us to climb to get back to flat or positive. I think when you look at the margin itself, we think we've got some opportunity there that's in our control from the Hudson City time deposit book to bring that down to reduce the cost of funding the assets on the balance sheet. And obviously, we're seeing and expecting to see some continued growth on the commercial loan side. As it relates to trust deposits, I guess, we could do something to turn those deposits away. But when we look at it, it's a good deal for us because it requires no equity, and we parked the money at the Fed. And I think Ren√© had mentioned on prior calls, but I'll just remind you that with some of our business in the trust side, we get paid either in fees or in deposits. And in the current environment, many people are choosing to pay us in deposits. So while it reduces the margin in the short term, it's positive for net interest income and for earnings. So we don't get too fussed about where the margin prints because of what's going on with trust demand deposits."

So if we start with savings from Hudson City, we've largely achieved that. There's maybe a little bit to come through the back half of the year, but it might take a little longer on some of those pieces as we work through ORE and expenses like that. When you look at the run rate for the rest of the year, there's change in the deposit charge, the FDIC charge, and that will go up in the third quarter. We think it will start to move a little bit down in time as we change the mix of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. We've got some increases for events, I would call them, one of them being the change that we see happening in our marketplaces and what we'll spend on some advertising dollars to take advantage of that. And then we've got the other event that is going on and wealth through the end of the year, which is the legal things that are happening. So those will elevate expenses for the back half of this year. I wouldn't expect them to carry on all through 2017, right? So the advertising we know, pretty certain what will happen with that because there's a time limit to that. With the legal stuff, we know we have a trial date in January, but those dates can change. So I don't want to get too crazy on that, but that's part of what's driving some of that expense. When you look at the other places where we're investing, it continues to be in technology, and that will move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter. But that's some of where the increase was in this quarter, and some of that will be continuing on through 2016 and 2017."

So I guess, if you think about the conversation with these customers, it probably goes and ends one of 3 ways. So one way is we say to someone who's CD-only customer, here's the rate we're offering to people that only have CDs with us. That rate will be lower than what they're earning today and would be more in line with what we're likely offering in our existing markets. The customer can choose that or they can choose another alternative, which would be to broaden the relationship. Maybe bring a checking account relationship with them where they have their paycheck deposited. And if they bring that to us, then the rate would stay roughly where it is. But we would get the benefit if we add the low-cost deposit from the checking account, and that really opens up some fee income opportunities through debit card  interchange that goes with checking accounts or other maintenance fees that go with those accounts. And then the last option is if they don't like the rate that we're offering them, stand-alone, and they choose not to broaden their relationship with us, they may choose to leave and go elsewhere looking for a yield that suits their needs. And so what we'll see over time is we'll see probably a combination of 2 things. We'll see a decrease in the rate that we're paying and we'll also see a decrease in the balances that sit within those time accounts. And  the combination of those 2 things is what we'll help reduce the interest expense and help manage some of that margin compression that we are talking about. So like I said before, I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, but when you look at the book, the vast majority of it, I think it's about a $12 billion book and 3 quarters of it will reprice over the course of the next 12 months. So there, you're talking about $9 billion that will reprice over the course of the next 12 months. And I think there's a little bit of front-loaded to the third quarter based on my recollection, but if you think about it, fairly evenly split across those quarters. That would be a good way to think about it."

Since this is my first conference call as Chief Financial Officer, I'll ask you to bear with me. 
Ren√© Jones most recently, and Mike Pinto before him, set a high bar for CFOs in general and for M&T Bank in particular. I certainly have big shoes to fill. 
Before I start, I'd like to take a moment and thank Ren√© for the advice and guidance that he's provided to the company and to me personally over the time that we've worked together, particularly the -- during the last 90 days. I'm looking forward to working with many of you as well over the coming months and years. Let's get started. 
In the second quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of revenue, net income of $336 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.98. Return on assets were 1.09% and return on common equity was 8.38%. 
Looking at the second quarter results on a net operating  basis, which excludes the after-tax effect of merger-related expenses and amortization of intangible assets, earnings per share equal $2.07. 
Return on tangible assets was 1.18% and return on tangible common equity was 12.68%. Every measure noted above, both on a GAAP and net operating basis, improved from the first quarter.
The efficiency ratio also improved to 55.1% in the second quarter, down from 57% in the first quarter and 58.2% in the year-ago quarter. We were able to deliver these results against the headwinds that we and our clients faced, including an uneven economic recovery and growth, persistent low interest rates and volatile financial markets.
There are many highlights from the second quarter that characterize the state of the bank. And before we review the details, I'd like to take a minute to review a few of the more noteworthy developments.
Probably the biggest highlight of the quarter was receiving a non-objection from the Federal Reserve to our 2016 CCAR capital plan. While we learned our results in the second quarter, the non-objection was the favorable results for months of hard work by many of our colleagues around the bank as well as the payback on the investments we've made over the past several years in our risk management governance, processes and technology. 
We know, however, that the CCAR bar keeps rising, and so this quarter will begin the preparations for CCAR 2017. 
Another highlight of the second quarter is the continued growth of our loan portfolio. While on the surface, 3% annualized loan growth isn't particularly exciting, a look at the details reveals that lending to commercial customers increased at an annualized rate of 11% against the decline in the residential mortgage book of an annualized 16%, largely the result of expected runoff in the Hudson City mortgage portfolio. 
This is a pretty typical pattern when you're converting a thrift to a commercial bank. Against this backdrop, credit quality and M&T hallmark remains strong.
In the second quarter, as noted in prior calls, we've been reinvesting a portion of the savings from the merger and the BSA/AML savings to position the bank for the future. We launched the brand campaign in New Jersey to introduce ourselves to the new market. We reminded our legacy markets who we are in the face of changing competition, and we continued to invest in our technological infrastructure along several dimensions. 
For instance, in foundational elements like data, in employee tools like teller cash recyclers and in customer convenience and security that will be seen in the form of our upcoming new and improved mtb.com website and enhanced security at our ATMs through the upcoming deployment of the MB [ph] protocols. 
So while unique unto itself, this quarter reflects the continuous cycle of invest and harvest that has characterized M&T Bank for many years. Overall, we would describe it as a solid quarter. 
Let's take a look at the details. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $1.98 for the second quarter of 2016, improved from $1.73 in the first quarter and equal to last year's second quarter. 
Net income for the quarter was $336 million, up 13% from $299 million in the linked quarter and up 17% from $287 million in the year-ago quarter. 
After tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets was $7 million or $0.04 per common share in the recent quarter compared to $7 million and $0.05 per common share in the first quarter.
Also included in the second quarter results were $13 million of pretax merger-related charges incurred in connection with the Hudson City acquisition. This equates to $8 million after-tax effect or $0.05 per common share. 
Merger-related expenses in the second quarter -- or sorry, excuse me, merger-related expenses in the first quarter totaled $23 million pretax. That amounted to $14 million after-tax effect or $0.09 per common share. 
Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions. 
M&T's net operating income for the second quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related expenses, was $351 million compared with $290 million in last year's second quarter and $320 million in the linked quarter. 
Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $2.07 for the recent quarter, improved from $2.01 in the year-ago quarter, and that figure was $1.87 in this year's first quarter. 
Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity of 1.18% and 12.68% for the recent quarter. 
The comparable returns were 1.09% and 11.62% in the first quarter of 2016. 
In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity. 
If we turn our attention to the balance sheet and income statement, taxable net -- the taxable equivalent net interest income was $870 million in the second quarter of 2016, down $8 million from the linked quarter. 
The decline reflected the combination of a narrowing of the net interest margin and a change in the mix of interest earning assets. Let's look at the specifics.
Net interest margin declined to 3.13%, down 5 basis points from 3.18% in the linked quarter. What we'd consider to be core margin pressure accounted for about 3 basis points of the decline. That includes the impact of a slightly more costly mix of deposits, including the impact of the Hudson City time deposits as well as growth in savings deposits associated with our mortgage servicing operations. 
On the noncore side, interest-bearing deposits with banks, which primarily reflect cash on deposit at the New York Fed, averaged $8.7 billion during the second quarter, up by over $500 million from the prior quarter. That increase, the result of higher balances of trust deposits, decreased the margin by approximately 1 basis point. 
Average investment securities declined, reflecting normal principal amortization as well as a step-up in prepayments. Those prepayments of higher-yielding securities and a limited amount of reinvestment into lower yielding LCR compliant securities reduced the yield on the portfolio. We estimate these factors diminish the margin by an additional basis point. 
The cost of deposits reflects in part our decision, which we've previously discussed, to maintain pricing for customers in the Greater New York area, whose accounts were formerly held at Hudson City Savings Bank. We'll offer more thoughts with respect to that pricing in a few moments.
Average loans increased by about 3% annualized or $572 million compared to the linked quarter. 
Looking at the loans by category, on an average basis compared with the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans increased an annualized 14%. 
Commercial real estate loans increased by about 10% annualized. As noted earlier, those 2 categories combined grew an annualized 11%. 
Also as noted, residential mortgage loans declined at an annualized 15% rate. Consumer loans grew an annualized 5%, with growth in indirect loans, including auto loans, partly offset by a decline in home equity lines of credit. 
Loan growth was consistent across most of our footprint, including Upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Greater New York City and New Jersey. Growth in the Mid-Atlantic region was slightly softer.
Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office and CDs over 250,000 increased at an annualized 8% from the first quarter, reflecting the higher level of trust and savings deposits that I mentioned earlier. 
Turning to noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $448 million in the second quarter compared to $421 million from -- in the prior quarter. 
Mortgage banking revenues were $89 million in the recent quarter compared with $82 million in the linked quarter. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $858 million in the quarter, up some 30% compared with the first quarter, while the gain on sale margin was relatively stable. 
Our commercial mortgage banking operation had a strong quarter as well, with a slight increase in multi-family commercial mortgages originated for sale combined with a favorable mix of higher margin loans than net prior quarter. 
Trust fees improved to $120 million in the recent quarter, up from $111 million in the previous quarter. That increase reflects about $3 million of seasonal tax-preparation fees that usually occur in the second quarter as well as fees from net new business, particularly on the institutional side.
Service charges on deposit accounts and commercial loan fees also improved from the first quarter.
Turning to expenses. Operating expenses for the second quarter, which exclude merger-related expenses and the amortization of intangible assets were $726 million, improved from $741 million in the prior quarter.
On that same operating basis, salary and benefits declined by $28 million from the seasonally high level in the first quarter. Partially offsetting that decline was a $16 million increase in other cost of operations, including higher professional services expenses. 
The efficient -- the operating efficiency ratio improved to 55.1% in the quarter, down from 57% in the first quarter and 58.2% in last year's second quarter. 
Nextly, let's turn to credit.
Our credit quality remains in line with our expectations, which is to say strong with continuing low levels of nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs. 
Nonaccrual loans declined to $849 million and the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans was 0.96%, improved from 1% at the end of the first quarter. 
Net charge-offs for the second quarter were $24 million compared with $42 million in the first quarter. Recall that the first quarter's results included $14 million of charge-offs associated with consumer loan customers, who were either deceased or filed bankruptcy, compared with just $5 million in the recent quarter. 
In addition, the results for the second quarter included a $7 million recovery on a previously charged off commercial loan.
Reflecting net recovery, annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 11 basis points for the second quarter, while the comparable figure was 19 basis points in the previous quarter. The provision for credit losses was $32 million in the recent quarter, exceeding net charge-offs by $8 million, reflecting overall loan growth as well as the ongoing shift to a higher proportion of commercial loans as the Hudson City mortgage portfolio pays down. 
The allowance for credit losses was $970 million at the end of June. The ratio of the allowance to total loans was 1.10%, unchanged from the end of the first quarter.
Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest, excluding acquired loans that had been marked to fair value discount at acquisition, were $298 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these loans, $270 million or 91% are guaranteed by government-related entities. 
Turning to capital. M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio under the current transitional Basel III capital rules was an estimated 11.01% compared with 11.06% at the end of the first quarter, which reflects earnings retention, less $154 million of share repurchases during the second quarter as well as loan growth -- net loan growth. I'll offer our thoughts on our 2016 capital plan, which received no objections from the Federal Reserve, in a few moments.
Next, I'd like to give you an update on several of the projects we've been working on. As previously announced, we completed the conversion of Hudson City during the first quarter in which we converted them to our systems and operations, including loan and deposit accounting, mortgage servicing and other core applications. 
All the Hudson City's-- all the Hudson City facilities were rebranded to M&T at that time. Speaking of branding, those of you who work and live in the Greater New York/New Jersey market have undoubtedly seen a step-up in our advertising as part of this process. 
More recently, we've been working on the longer-term initiative of converting Hudson City from a thrift culture to M&T's commercial bank culture. We are continuing to hire in the New Jersey market, including commercial lenders, business bankers and wealth advisors. We've hired some 49  customer-facing employees since the beginning of 2016. 
To complement our commercial hiring, we've begun an accelerated business banking training initiative for some 30 Hudson City branch managers who are on a fast-track to learn M&T's branch sales practices. Training also continues for our other branch-based colleagues, increasing their familiarity with our entire suite of commercial bank products and services.
Our investments in technology include continuing to enhance our ability to capture and organize data for risk management and capital planning requirements, as well as for improving customer service. These investments paid a dividend in the form of our 2016 CCAR results, but as noted earlier the bar rises every year, requiring continuous improvement in our risk management practices. 
Beyond our data initiative, you should see some tangible results from our technology investment shortly, including a major update to our website within the next several weeks and an updated mobile app that we anticipate rolling out later this year. 
We're also working on enhancing the tools we give to our employees to improve our interactions with customers by simplifying the processes employees must follow to complete their work. These projects are still in the early stages.
Lastly, we've discussed in a general way the opportunities presented to us by the changing competitive environment occurring or about to occur in our footprint. We know from first-hand experience that change brings uncertainty. Whether it's with their personal banking or business banking, customers seek stability when considering their banking options. We are here to help customers in our communities as we have been for over 160 years. 
To offer one example, using checking account acquisition as a proxy for new customer acquisition, year-over-year growth in Greater Buffalo is nearly 19%, almost twice as large as the average across the remainder of the footprint.
Now let's turn to the outlook. As is our usual practice, without giving specific earnings guidance, we'd like to offer our thoughts as to how we're tracking against the outlook for the full year that we gave you on the January call. While our outlook is mostly unchanged from the previous calls, one factor that has changed is the outlook for increases in the Fed funds rate. At the time of our January call, the forward rate curve was implying 2 actions by the Fed in calendar year 2016. There now appears to be little prospect for even 1 increase this year, perhaps not until -- and perhaps not even until late -- mid- to late next year. 
But even without any Fed action, the curve is flattened with the 10 -- with the yield on 10-year treasuries touching an all-time low recently. 
Our ability to maintain a stable year-over-year margin will be impacted by that changed interest rate outlook, but that could be somewhat offset by our ability to reposition the balanced sheet, particularly with respect to trust deposits and the pricing on Hudson City time deposits.
Loan growth this past quarter was largely in line with, or slightly better than our expectations, with solid growth in commercial loans, both commercial and industrial and commercial real estate, partially offset by slower growth in consumer loans and the expected decline in residential real estate. Absent rises in interest rates, we don't expect the pace of repayments to slow.
Fee revenues remain in line with our expectations, given the normal seasonal effects. 
On expenses, our outlook for the second half of 2016 is to be somewhat consistent with the first half. This includes the FDIC surcharge imposed on banks over $50 billion in size, which will add about $5 million per quarter to our FDIC assessment as well as our ongoing investment program. We remain focused on producing positive -- modest-to-positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. We don't expect any additional merger-related expenses in connection with Hudson City. 
Our outlook for credit is little changed over the short term. We're still not seeing pressures on credit, either nonaccrual loans or charge-offs.
Regarding our capital plan, we were delighted to receive no objection from our regulators to the plan we submitted in connection with the 2016 CCAR process. As you know, we plan to repurchase $1.15 billion of M&T common stock over the fourth -- 4-quarter period beginning July 1. 
In addition, the plan contemplates our Board considering an increase in the common stock dividend to $0.75 per quarter in January of 2017. While there is no reason to expect we won't execute on this plan as proposed, I would remind you that all of these capital actions are subject to our normal capital governance policies and unexpected adverse macroeconomic events could impact our actions. 
Of course, as you're aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future. 
Now let's open up the call to questions, before which, Paula will briefly review the instructions."

And we will be continuing to make the investments that we've been talking about in the franchise, especially continuing on path with technology. So those are probably the big things that you'll see in there. And the other thing, of course, which I should mention is we'll be right in the throes of some of the changes that will be happening in our marketplace in the third quarter and we'll probably spend a little more on advertising as we try to take advantage of the changes that are happening. So some of those things are kind of more permanent in nature. Some of -- more permanent is probably a bad description. Some of those things will run their course over the rest of this year and some of them will probably take a little longer."

And that's been a conscious decision on our part to maintain that pricing, while we get the branch staff ready to have a different conversation with those customers than they've had in the past.

I think we feel that the spot we're at with Hudson City is about where we expected to be at this point, kind of 120 days post the system conversion. That there's work to be done to get the branch teams up to speed, especially from a thrift, up to speed on the breadth of products that we offer as well as learning the systems and then getting used to a sales environment. So that's kind of proceeding as we would expect. And as we mentioned, that'll -- that's why we feel comfortable that now we're kind of ready to start taking the step that we're ready to take on the deposit pricing. And then for the commercial and business parts of the bank, we've been there actually with M&T bankers pretty much since shortly after the announcement date. So really, our focus there has been to keep that group of people engaged. And since we got the deal done, they've been excited and have the ability now to work with the branches and offer more confidently the deposit side of the relationship. And then we've been out recruiting, and we're trying to grow that business through people additions. I think the thing that we pay a lot of attention to is just like we pay a lot of attention to credit, and we want to grow in that footprint, we're going to grow under the kind of terms and structure that we know is good business. So we're not going to rush it. And the same thing kind of applies to people that we know that finding and adding to our teams people that fit our culture and understand how we do business and think about relationship and think about good structure, it's more important to us that we get the right people on the teams, rather than fill the spots quickly. So I feel like -- I feel really good about where we are. I think we're tracking to where we would expect to be and we've just got to manage that, the pace that we talked about a little bit earlier on, which is the pace at which those mortgages run off and the pace at which we grow the commercial balances to offset that.

One obviously starts with the capital we carry to run the bank. And when -- so that was part of our CCAR announcement, our CCAR ask, and we'll be continuing to look at the volatility of our earnings and our charge-off levels and continuing to work on our capital policies to make sure that we were adequately capitalized, but not overly capitalized and that will help. The other thing that, I guess, we think about when we look at our return versus our cost of capital, when you look at the volatility of our charge-offs and you look at the volatility of our earnings, we would kind of think that our cost of capital will be towards the bottom end of the industry because our beta is lower. So when you look at that, we think our cost of capital would be below the average in the industry. And we think that, over time, as we continue to make the changes to the business to improve profitability as well as return capital, that those would be the factors that we would be thinking about as we move the needle on returns up in a positive direction."

First off, if you think about the Mulligan and how people use that, I guess, I feel the need to kind of address that, that we didn't go into the process with the intention of using the Mulligan. We followed our process and did our analysis of our PPNR and our capital level under stress, and we set our ask based on what we think is the target that we need to run the bank. I think what we saw is that there were some differences between our analysis and the feds, and they built a process that'll -- that gave people a chance to make an adjustment because they can see that they're looking at things differently than we are. They get to see the industry and we don't, and they built a process that I think is sound in allowing you to make that change. So we were fortunate that it was in place and we used it. I think when you think about our returns over the last 3 years, if you add in this year and the prior 2, we'd still to be towards the bottom end of returns in the industry. And we were cautious leading into the Hudson City acquisition because there's always uncertainty when you're doing a deal and we didn't want to have any issues. I think if you look on a going forward, we kind of see where our earnings are going, where our PPNR is going. We continue to make progress on our models and in our loss rates. And I think looking at the balance sheet and as the balance sheet changes, we feel like our capital levels, even with this buyback, will be pretty good. And depending on what happens over the course of the next year, we'll be looking to continue to bring those levels down closer to, I guess, closer to what our targets are, which and/or where we were when we passed CCAR over the prior couple of years."

So that's a big hill for us to climb to get back to flat or positive. I think when you look at the margin itself, we think we've got some opportunity there that's in our control from the Hudson City time deposit book to bring that down to reduce the cost of funding the assets on the balance sheet. And obviously, we're seeing and expecting to see some continued growth on the commercial loan side. As it relates to trust deposits, I guess, we could do something to turn those deposits away. But when we look at it, it's a good deal for us because it requires no equity, and we parked the money at the Fed. And I think Ren√© had mentioned on prior calls, but I'll just remind you that with some of our business in the trust side, we get paid either in fees or in deposits. And in the current environment, many people are choosing to pay us in deposits. So while it reduces the margin in the short term, it's positive for net interest income and for earnings.

So if we start with savings from Hudson City, we've largely achieved that. There was maybe a little bit to come through the back half of the year, but it might take a little longer on some of those pieces as we work through ORE and expenses like that. When you look at the run rate for the rest of the year, there's change in the deposit charge, the FDIC charge, and that will go up in the third quarter. We think it will start to move a little bit down in time as we change the mix of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. We've got some increases for events, I would call them, one of them being the change that we see happening in our marketplaces and what we'll spend on some advertising dollars to take advantage of that. And then we've got the other event that is going on and will through the end of the year, which is the legal things that are happening. So those will elevate expenses for the back half of this year. I wouldn't expect them to carry on all through 2017, right? So the advertising we know, pretty certain what will happen with that because there's a time limit to that. With the legal stuff, we know we have a trial date in January, but those dates can change. So I don't want to get too crazy on that, but that's part of what's driving some of that expense. When you look at the other places where we're investing, it continues to be in technology, and that will move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter. But that's some of where the increase was in this quarter, and some of that will be continuing on through 2016 and 2017."

So I guess, if you think about the conversation with these customers, it probably goes and ends one of 3 ways.

So I guess, if you think about the conversation with these customers, it probably goes and ends one of 3 ways. So one way is we say to someone who's a CD-only customer, here's the rate we're offering to people that only have CDs with us. That rate will be lower than what they're earning today and would be more in line with what we're likely offering in our existing markets. The customer can choose that or they can choose another alternative, which would be to broaden the relationship. Maybe bring a checking account relationship with them where they have their paycheck deposited. And if they bring that to us, then their rate would stay roughly where it is. But we would get the benefit if we add the low-cost deposit from the checking account, and that really opens up some fee income opportunities through debit card interchange that goes with checking accounts or other maintenance fees that go with those accounts. And then the last option is if they don't like the rate that we're offering them, stand-alone, and they choose not to broaden their relationship with us, they may choose to leave and go elsewhere looking for a yield that suits their needs. And so what we'll see over time is we'll see probably a combination of 2 things. We'll see a decrease in the rate that we're paying and we'll also see a decrease in the balances that sit within those time accounts. And the combination of those 2 things is what will help reduce the interest expense and help manage some of that margin compression that we are talking about. So like I said before, I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, but when you look at the book, the vast majority of it, I think it's about a $12 billion book and 3 quarters of it will reprice over the course of the next 12 months. So there, you're talking about $9 billion that will reprice over the course of the next 12 months. And I think there's a little bit of front-loaded to the third quarter based on my recollection, but if you think about it, fairly evenly split across those quarters. That would be a good way to think about it."

Since this is my first conference call as Chief Financial Officer, I'll ask you to bear with me. 
Ren√© Jones most recently, and Mike Pinto before him, set a high bar for CFOs in general and for M&T Bank in particular. I certainly have big shoes to fill. 
Before I start, I'd like to take a moment and thank Ren√© for the advice and guidance that he's provided to the company and to me personally over the time that we've worked together, particularly the -- during the last 90 days. I'm looking forward to working with many of you as well over the coming months and years. Let's get started. 
In the second quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of revenue, net income of $336 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.98. Return on assets were 1.09% and return on common equity was 8.38%. 
Looking at the second quarter results on a net operating  basis, which excludes the after-tax effect of merger-related expenses and amortization of intangible assets, earnings per share equal $2.07. 
Return on tangible assets was 1.18% and return on tangible common equity was 12.68%. Every measure noted above, both on a GAAP and net operating basis, improved from the first quarter.
The efficiency ratio also improved to 55.1% in the second quarter, down from 57% in the first quarter and 58.2% in the year-ago quarter. We were able to deliver these results against the headwinds that we and our clients faced, including an uneven economic recovery and growth, persistent low interest rates and volatile financial markets.
There are many highlights from the second quarter that characterize the state of the bank. And before we review the details, I'd like to take a minute to review a few of the more noteworthy developments.
Probably the biggest highlight of the quarter was receiving a non-objection from the Federal Reserve to our 2016 CCAR capital plan. While we learned our results in the second quarter, the non-objection was the favorable results for months of hard work by many of our colleagues around the bank as well as the payback on the investments we've made over the past several years in our risk management governance, processes and technology. 
We know, however, that the CCAR bar keeps rising, and so this quarter will begin the preparations for CCAR 2017. 
Another highlight of the second quarter is the continued growth of our loan portfolio. While on the surface, 3% annualized loan growth isn't particularly exciting, a look at the details reveals that lending to commercial customers increased at an annualized rate of 11% against the decline in the residential mortgage book of an annualized 16%, largely the result of expected runoff in the Hudson City mortgage portfolio. 
This is a pretty typical pattern when you're converting a thrift to a commercial bank. Against this backdrop, credit quality and M&T hallmark remains strong.
In the second quarter, as noted in prior calls, we've been reinvesting a portion of the savings from the merger and the BSA/AML savings to position the bank for the future. We launched the brand campaign in New Jersey to introduce ourselves to the new market. We reminded our legacy markets who we are in the face of changing competition, and we continued to invest in our technological infrastructure along several dimensions. 
For instance, in foundational elements like data, in employee tools like teller cash recyclers and in customer convenience and security that will be seen in the form of our upcoming new and improved mtb.com website and enhanced security at our ATMs through the upcoming deployment of the MB [ph] protocols. 
So while unique unto itself, this quarter reflects the continuous cycle of invest and harvest that has characterized M&T Bank for many years. Overall, we would describe it as a solid quarter. 
Let's take a look at the details. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $1.98 for the second quarter of 2016, improved from $1.73 in the first quarter and equal to last year's second quarter. 
Net income for the quarter was $336 million, up 13% from $299 million in the linked quarter and up 17% from $287 million in the year-ago quarter. 
After tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets was $7 million or $0.04 per common share in the recent quarter compared to $7 million and $0.05 per common share in the first quarter.
Also included in the second quarter results were $13 million of pretax merger-related charges incurred in connection with the Hudson City acquisition. This equates to $8 million after-tax effect or $0.05 per common share. 
Merger-related expenses in the second quarter -- or sorry, excuse me, merger-related expenses in the first quarter totaled $23 million pretax. That amounted to $14 million after-tax effect or $0.09 per common share. 
Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we exclude the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions. 
M&T's net operating income for the second quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related expenses, was $351 million compared with $290 million in last year's second quarter and $320 million in the linked quarter. 
Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $2.07 for the recent quarter, improved from $2.01 in the year-ago quarter, and that figure was $1.87 in this year's first quarter. 
Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity of 1.18% and 12.68% for the recent quarter. 
The comparable returns were 1.09% and 11.62% in the first quarter of 2016. 
In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity. 
If we turn our attention to the balance sheet and income statement, taxable net -- the taxable equivalent net interest income was $870 million in the second quarter of 2016, down $8 million from the linked quarter. 
The decline reflected the combination of a narrowing of the net interest margin and a change in the mix of interest earning assets. Let's look at the specifics.
Net interest margin declined to 3.13%, down 5 basis points from 3.18% in the linked quarter. What we'd consider to be core margin pressure accounted for about 3 basis points of the decline. That includes the impact of a slightly more costly mix of deposits, including the impact of the Hudson City time deposits as well as growth in savings deposits associated with our mortgage servicing operations. 
On the noncore side, interest-bearing deposits with banks, which primarily reflect cash on deposit at the New York Fed, averaged $8.7 billion during the second quarter, up by over $500 million from the prior quarter. That increase, the result of higher balances of trust deposits, decreased the margin by approximately 1 basis point. 
Average investment securities declined, reflecting normal principal amortization as well as a step-up in prepayments. Those prepayments of higher-yielding securities and a limited amount of reinvestment into lower yielding LCR compliant securities reduced the yield on the portfolio. We estimate these factors diminish the margin by an additional basis point. 
The cost of deposits reflects in part our decision, which we've previously discussed, to maintain pricing for customers in the Greater New York area, whose accounts were formerly held at Hudson City Savings Bank. We'll offer more thoughts with respect to that pricing in a few moments.
Average loans increased by about 3% annualized or $572 million compared to the linked quarter. 
Looking at the loans by category, on an average basis compared with the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans increased an annualized 14%. 
Commercial real estate loans increased by about 10% annualized. As noted earlier, those 2 categories combined grew an annualized 11%. 
Also as noted, residential mortgage loans declined at an annualized 15% rate. Consumer loans grew an annualized 5%, with growth in indirect loans, including auto loans, partly offset by a decline in home equity lines of credit. 
Loan growth was consistent across most of our footprint, including Upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Greater New York City and New Jersey. Growth in the Mid-Atlantic region was slightly softer.
Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office and CDs over 250,000 increased at an annualized 8% from the first quarter, reflecting the higher level of trust and savings deposits that I mentioned earlier. 
Turning to noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $448 million in the second quarter compared to $421 million from -- in the prior quarter. 
Mortgage banking revenues were $89 million in the recent quarter compared with $82 million in the linked quarter. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $858 million in the quarter, up some 30% compared with the first quarter, while the gain on sale margin was relatively stable. 
Our commercial mortgage banking operation had a strong quarter as well, with a slight increase in multi-family commercial mortgages originated for sale combined with a favorable mix of higher margin loans than net prior quarter. 
Trust fees improved to $120 million in the recent quarter, up from $111 million in the previous quarter. That increase reflects about $3 million of seasonal tax-preparation fees that usually occur in the second quarter as well as fees from net new business, particularly on the institutional side.
Service charges on deposit accounts and commercial loan fees also improved from the first quarter.
Turning to expenses. Operating expenses for the second quarter, which exclude merger-related expenses and the amortization of intangible assets were $726 million, improved from $741 million in the prior quarter.
On that same operating basis, salary and benefits declined by $28 million from the seasonally high level in the first quarter. Partially offsetting that decline was a $16 million increase in other cost of operations, including higher professional services expenses. 
The efficient -- the operating efficiency ratio improved to 55.1% in the quarter, down from 57% in the first quarter and 58.2% in last year's second quarter. 
Nextly, let's turn to credit.
Our credit quality remains in line with our expectations, which is to say strong with continuing low levels of nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs. 
Nonaccrual loans declined to $849 million and the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans was 0.96%, improved from 1% at the end of the first quarter. 
Net charge-offs for the second quarter were $24 million compared with $42 million in the first quarter. Recall that the first quarter's results included $14 million of charge-offs associated with consumer loan customers, who were either deceased or filed bankruptcy, compared with just $5 million in the recent quarter. 
In addition, the results for the second quarter included a $7 million recovery on a previously charged off commercial loan.
Reflecting net recovery, annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 11 basis points for the second quarter, while the comparable figure was 19 basis points in the previous quarter. The provision for credit losses was $32 million in the recent quarter, exceeding net charge-offs by $8 million, reflecting overall loan growth as well as the ongoing shift to a higher proportion of commercial loans as the Hudson City mortgage portfolio pays down. 
The allowance for credit losses was $970 million at the end of June. The ratio of the allowance to total loans was 1.10%, unchanged from the end of the first quarter.
Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest, excluding acquired loans that had been marked to fair value discount at acquisition, were $298 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these loans, $270 million or 91% are guaranteed by government-related entities. 
Turning to capital. M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio under the current transitional Basel III capital rules was an estimated 11.01% compared with 11.06% at the end of the first quarter, which reflects earnings retention, less $154 million of share repurchases during the second quarter as well as loan growth -- net loan growth. I'll offer our thoughts on our 2016 capital plan, which received no objections from the Federal Reserve, in a few moments.
Next, I'd like to give you an update on several of the projects we've been working on. As previously announced, we completed the conversion of Hudson City during the first quarter in which we converted them to our systems and operations, including loan and deposit accounting, mortgage servicing and other core applications. 
All the Hudson City's-- all the Hudson City facilities were rebranded to M&T at that time. Speaking of branding, those of you who work and live in the Greater New York/New Jersey market have undoubtedly seen a step-up in our advertising as part of this process. 
More recently, we've been working on the longer-term initiative of converting Hudson City from a thrift culture to M&T's commercial bank culture. We are continuing to hire in the New Jersey market, including commercial lenders, business bankers and wealth advisors. We've hired some 49  customer-facing employees since the beginning of 2016. 
To complement our commercial hiring, we've begun an accelerated business banking training initiative for some 30 Hudson City branch managers who are on a fast-track to learn M&T's branch sales practices. Training also continues for our other branch-based colleagues, increasing their familiarity with our entire suite of commercial bank products and services.
Our investments in technology include continuing to enhance our ability to capture and organize data for risk management and capital planning requirements, as well as for improving customer service. These investments paid a dividend in the form of our 2016 CCAR results, but as noted earlier the bar rises every year, requiring continuous improvement in our risk management practices. 
Beyond our data initiative, you should see some tangible results from our technology investment shortly, including a major update to our website within the next several weeks and an updated mobile app that we anticipate rolling out later this year. 
We're also working on enhancing the tools we give to our employees to improve our interactions with customers by simplifying the processes employees must follow to complete their work. These projects are still in the early stages.
Lastly, we've discussed in a general way the opportunities presented to us by the changing competitive environment occurring or about to occur in our footprint. We know from first-hand experience that change brings uncertainty. Whether it's with their personal banking or business banking, customers seek stability when considering their banking options. We are here to help customers in our communities as we have been for over 160 years. 
To offer one example, using checking account acquisition as a proxy for new customer acquisition, year-over-year growth in Greater Buffalo is nearly 19%, almost twice as large as the average across the remainder of the footprint.
Now let's turn to the outlook. As is our usual practice, without giving specific earnings guidance, we'd like to offer our thoughts as to how we're tracking against the outlook for the full year that we gave you on the January call. While our outlook is mostly unchanged from the previous calls, one factor that has changed is the outlook for increases in the Fed funds rate. At the time of our January call, the forward rate curve was implying 2 actions by the Fed in calendar year 2016. There now appears to be little prospect for even 1 increase this year, perhaps not until -- and perhaps not even until late -- mid- to late next year. 
But even without any Fed action, the curve is flattened with the 10 -- with the yield on 10-year treasuries touching an all-time low recently. 
Our ability to maintain a stable year-over-year margin will be impacted by that changed interest rate outlook, but that could be somewhat offset by our ability to reposition the balanced sheet, particularly with respect to trust deposits and the pricing on Hudson City time deposits.
Loan growth this past quarter was largely in line with, or slightly better than our expectations, with solid growth in commercial loans, both commercial and industrial and commercial real estate, partially offset by slower growth in consumer loans and the expected decline in residential real estate. Absent rises in interest rates, we don't expect the pace of repayments to slow.
Fee revenues remain in line with our expectations, given the normal seasonal effects. 
On expenses, our outlook for the second half of 2016 is to be somewhat consistent with the first half. This includes the FDIC surcharge imposed on banks over $50 billion in size, which will add about $5 million per quarter to our FDIC assessment as well as our ongoing investment program. We remain focused on producing positive -- modest-to-positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. We don't expect any additional merger-related expenses in connection with Hudson City. 
Our outlook for credit is little changed over the short term. We're still not seeing pressures on credit, either nonaccrual loans or charge-offs.
Regarding our capital plan, we were delighted to receive no objection from our regulators to the plan we submitted in connection with the 2016 CCAR process. As you know, we plan to repurchase $1.15 billion of M&T common stock over the fourth -- 4-quarter period beginning July 1. 
In addition, the plan contemplates our Board considering an increase in the common stock dividend to $0.75 per quarter in January of 2017. While there is no reason to expect we won't execute on this plan as proposed, I would remind you that all of these capital actions are subject to our normal capital governance policies and unexpected adverse macroeconomic events could impact our actions. 
Of course, as you're aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future. 
Now let's open up the call to questions, before which, Paula will briefly review the instructions."

So first of all, we've got the FDIC assessment going up $5 million a quarter right there. What you'll see is that when we look at our other cost of operations, which is really where we're focused, legal expenses are up in the second quarter and will likely continue at that pace in the third and fourth quarter and possibly increase slightly as we go through our defense with some of the Wilmington Trust indictments that are out there. And we will be continuing to make the investments that we've been talking about in the franchise, especially continuing on path with technology. So those are probably the big things that you'll see in there. And the other thing, of course, which I should mention is we'll be right in the throes of some of the changes that will be happening in our marketplace in the third quarter and we'll probably spend a little more on advertising as we try to take advantage of the changes that are happening. So some of those things are kind of more permanent in nature. Some of -- more permanent is probably a bad description. Some of those things will run their course over the rest of this year and some of them will probably take a little longer."

And that's been a conscious decision on our part to maintain that pricing, while we get the branch staff ready to have a different conversation with those customers than they've had in the past.

When we look at pricing, I wouldn't say that it's going up, but it seems to have stabilized somewhat. So we feel better about that. And when we look at the amount of equity that's in the deals, it's still at or above where things were back in '06, '07. So I think the market has learned its lesson as far as that goes.
When we look in our markets and where we're winning business, it doesn't seem to be at the moment coming from any particular competitor that might have reached concentration limits, but I know that's an issue that's out there.

So we're not going to rush it. And the same thing kind of applies to people that we know that finding and adding to our teams people that fit our culture and understand how we do business and think about relationship and think about good structure, it's more important to us that we get the right people on the teams, rather than fill the spots quickly.

That's an annualized number, and 18% in commercial real estate in the quarter, which those are higher than what you would see in the footprint, both-- it's off  a small base, right? So I think when you look at the total loan growth, we're pleased with how things are going in New Jersey. We are building the pipeline there and we are getting growth rates that are faster than what you would see across the rest of the footprint. But as -- it takes time for the dollars to build, right? So the percentage of dollars of growth that New Jersey represents is still small and growing compared to the size of the Legacy balances and footprint."

We spend a lot of time thinking about return on tangible, common, because that's one of the key binding constraints in CCAR and we focus a lot on that. When you look at the capital levels of where we were precrisis and where we are now, they're at least double. And so 2 elements to managing or thinking about returns as we go forward. One obviously starts with the capital we carry to run the bank. And when -- so that was part of our CCAR announcement, our CCAR ask, and we'll be continuing to look at the volatility of our earnings and our charge-off levels and continuing to work on our capital policies to make sure that we were adequately capitalized, but not overly capitalized and that will help. The other thing that, I guess, we think about when we look at our return versus our cost of capital, when you look at the volatility of our charge-offs and you look at the volatility of our earnings, we would kind of think that our cost of capital will be towards the bottom end of the industry because our beta is lower. So when you look at that, we think our cost of capital would be below the average in the industry. And we think that, over time, as we continue to make the changes to the business to improve profitability as well as return capital, that those would be the factors that we would be thinking about as we move the needle on returns up in a positive direction."

Following up on your comments on CCAR, I congratulate you for using the Mulligan. We wish more banks would do that. I noticed that, if I recall correctly, the amount of capital that was reduced because of the CCAR process was considerably higher this year than last year. I think it was over 600 basis points this year. Last year, it was under -- just under 300 basis points, if I recall. What caused that to be so much greater this time? And second, if it was totally due to the Hudson City deal, should we expect, as you integrate that further, that, that kind of reduction in capital should be reduced on a go-forward basis?"

I'll be honest with you, I'm not as familiar with the 300 and 600 basis points that you're mentioning but, I guess, a couple of things that I think about. First off, if you think about the Mulligan and how people use that, I guess, I feel the need to kind of address that, that we didn't go into the process with the intention of using the Mulligan. We followed our process and did our analysis of our PPNR and our capital level under stress, and we set our ask based on what we think is the target that we need to run the bank. I think what we saw is that there were some differences between our analysis and the feds, and they built a process that'll -- that gave people a chance to make an adjustment because they can see that they're looking at things differently than we are. They get to see the industry and we don't, and they built a process that I think is sound in allowing you to make that change. So we were fortunate that it was in place and we used it. I think when you think about our returns over the last 3 years, if you add in this year and the prior 2, we'd still to be towards the bottom end of returns in the industry. And we were cautious leading into the Hudson City acquisition because there's always uncertainty when you're doing a deal and we didn't want to have any issues. I think if you look on a going forward, we kind of see where our earnings are going, where our PPNR is going. We continue to make progress on our models and in our loss rates. And I think looking at the balance sheet and as the balance sheet changes, we feel like our capital levels, even with this buyback, will be pretty good. And depending on what happens over the course of the next year, we'll be looking to continue to bring those levels down closer to, I guess, closer to what our targets are, which and/or where we were when we passed CCAR over the prior couple of years."

So I guess, starting with the net interest income. Over the next couple of quarters, it's probably going to be tough to see any growth there just because of the rate -- or the expected rate of decrease in the residential mortgage portfolio from Hudson City. So that's a big hill for us to climb to get back to flat or positive. I think when you look at the margin itself, we think we've got some opportunity there that's in our control from the Hudson City time deposit book to bring that down to reduce the cost of funding the assets on the balance sheet. And obviously, we're seeing and expecting to see some continued growth on the commercial loan side. As it relates to trust deposits, I guess, we could do something to turn those deposits away. But when we look at it, it's a good deal for us because it requires no equity, and we parked the money at the Fed. And I think Ren√© had mentioned on prior calls, but I'll just remind you that with some of our business in the trust side, we get paid either in fees or in deposits. And in the current environment, many people are choosing to pay us in deposits. So while it reduces the margin in the short term, it's positive for net interest income and for earnings. So we don't get too fussed about where the margin prints because of what's going on with trust demand deposits."

So if we start with savings from Hudson City, we've largely achieved that. There was maybe a little bit to come through the back half of the year, but it might take a little longer on some of those pieces as we work through ORE and expenses like that. When you look at the run rate for the rest of the year, there's change in the deposit charge, the FDIC charge, and that will go up in the third quarter. We think it will start to move a little bit down in time as we change the mix of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. We've got some increases for events, I would call them, one of them being the change that we see happening in our marketplaces and what we'll spend on some advertising dollars to take advantage of that. And then we've got the other event that is going on and will through the end of the year, which is the legal things that are happening. So those will elevate expenses for the back half of this year. I wouldn't expect them to carry on all through 2017, right? So the advertising we know, pretty certain what will happen with that because there's a time limit to that. With the legal stuff, we know we have a trial date in January, but those dates can change. So I don't want to get too crazy on that, but that's part of what's driving some of that expense. When you look at the other places where we're investing, it continues to be in technology, and that will move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter. But that's some of where the increase was in this quarter, and some of that will be continuing on through 2016 and 2017."

So I guess, if you think about the conversation with these customers, it probably goes and ends one of 3 ways. So one way is we say to someone who's a CD-only customer, here's the rate we're offering to people that only have CDs with us. That rate will be lower than what they're earning today and would be more in line with what we're likely offering in our existing markets. The customer can choose that or they can choose another alternative, which would be to broaden the relationship. Maybe bring a checking account relationship with them where they have their paycheck deposited. And if they bring that to us, then their rate would stay roughly where it is. But we would get the benefit if we add the low-cost deposit from the checking account, and that really opens up some fee income opportunities through debit card interchange that goes with checking accounts or other maintenance fees that go with those accounts. And then the last option is if they don't like the rate that we're offering them, stand-alone, and they choose not to broaden their relationship with us, they may choose to leave and go elsewhere looking for a yield that suits their needs. And so what we'll see over time is we'll see probably a combination of 2 things. We'll see a decrease in the rate that we're paying and we'll also see a decrease in the balances that sit within those time accounts. And the combination of those 2 things is what will help reduce the interest expense and help manage some of that margin compression that we are talking about. So like I said before, I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, but when you look at the book, the vast majority of it, I think it's about a $12 billion book and 3 quarters of it will reprice over the course of the next 12 months. So there, you're talking about $9 billion that will reprice over the course of the next 12 months. And I think there's a little bit of front-loaded to the third quarter based on my recollection, but if you think about it, fairly evenly split across those quarters. That would be a good way to think about it."

As most of you have no doubt seen in this morning's press release, M&T's results for the third quarter reflect the initiatives we have under way to position the bank for future success. The merger with Hudson City Bancorp was completed almost a year ago, and the ongoing process of converting a thrift to a commercial bank continues. 
During the quarter, we continue to build out the New Jersey consumer bank, both by growing new households as well as taking steps to reprice the acquired deposit base. 
For the New Jersey Commercial Bank, loan balances for the year-to-date have grown at an annualized rate of over 20%, led by loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises. We're pleased to see that our community's focus to approach to banking is starting to take root in the New Jersey marketplace. 
Customer migration arising from the multiple mergers and acquisitions that have occurred within our footprint also continues. We've been advertising and offering incentives to bring in new customers impacted by some of those changes in our markets. Customer growth in the third quarter was the highest we've seen in the past 8 quarters. 
We've also continued our program of investments in operational infrastructure and technology. As we previously signaled, the enhanced mtb.com website went live during the quarter. Other highlights for the quarter include an upgrade to our ATM network, to handle EMV-chip-equipped cards and adding a feature to our payment services capability that enables our customers to send and receive same-day ACH transactions. 
The upgrade to our consumer mobile app is in final testing and we expect it to go live later this quarter. And finally, we took some actions to get ahead of the pending implementation of the so-called Volcker Rule contained within the Dodd-Frank Act by divesting some securities disallowed by the rule. I'll share some more details on each of these actions and how they impacted us in a few minutes.
However, before we proceed, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the recent passing of Richard King, our board member -- I'm sorry, a member of M&T's Board of Directors. 
Mr. King joined M&T's board in 2000, following our acquisition of Pennsylvania-based Keystone Financial. We valued his extensive experience in business and his deep ties to the communities in Pennsylvania. We'll miss his counsel and his friendship. 
Now let's turn to the numbers. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $2.10 for the third quarter of 2016, improved from $1.98 in the second quarter of 2016 and $1.93 in last year's third quarter. 
Net income for the quarter was $350 million, up 4% from $336 million in the linked quarter and up 25% from $280 million in the year-ago quarter. 
Included in GAAP results were after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $6 million or $0.03 per common share in the recent quarter compared with $7 million and $0.04 per common share in the second quarter. There were no merger-related expenses in the third quarter results, however, results for the second quarter included merger-related expenses amounting to $8 million after tax effect or $0.05 per common share.
Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provide supplemental reporting on its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of the amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions.
M&T's net operating income for the third quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related expenses from the relevant periods, was $356 million compared with $351 million in the linked quarter and $283 million in last year's third quarter.
Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $2.13 in the recent quarter, improved from $2.07 in this year's second quarter and $1.95 in the year-ago quarter.
On a GAAP basis, M&T's third quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.12% and an annualized rate of return on average common equity of 8.68%. This compares to 1.09% and 8.38%, respectively in the previous quarter.
Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.81% and 12.77% in the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.18% and 12.68% in the second quarter of 2016.
In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.
Included in both GAAP and net operating results were $28 million of net pretax securities gains. This equates to $17 million after-tax effect or $0.11 per common share. The gains pertain to a variety of TruPS CDOs that M&T obtained during our acquisition of other banks over the past number of years, primarily through the merger with Provident Bankshares in 2009. 
Our marked to fair value through acquisition accounting and under Section 6.19 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly known as the Volcker Rule, divestiture of most of these securities would otherwise have been required prior to July 21, 2017. 
Turning to the balanced sheet and income statement. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $865 million in the third quarter of 2016, down $5 million from the linked quarter. The net interest margin declined to 3.05%, down 8 basis points from 3.13% in the linked quarter. 
During the quarter, we had another increase in average trust deposits, which we placed at the Fed. Average interest-bearing deposits with banks were $9.7 billion during the past quarter compared to $8.7 billion in the second quarter. Those deposits are modestly additive to net interest income, but we estimate a diluted net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points during the quarter. 
Also, with the acquisition of the Hudson City mortgage loans, we have a higher proportion of assets with a 30 over 360-day pricing basis on our balance sheet than we had previously. That has the impact of diminishing the reported margin in a 92-day quarter, such as the one that just ended -- sorry, such as the one that just ended. We estimate the impact on the margin was about 2 basis points. 
Several other items included in net interest income, including prepayment fees and interest on nonaccrual loans, which individually aren't large, in the aggregate reduced the margin by approximately 1 basis point. What we would consider to be core margin pressure accounted for about 3 basis points of the decline.
As we discussed earlier in the third quarter, we began to take action to reprice the Hudson City deposit base to be more in line with the market and we began those efforts in mid-August. This benefits the margin immediately but will take another few quarters for the full impact to be realized as time deposits reach their state of maturity. Average loans increased by about 3% on an annualized basis or $577 million compared to the linked quarter.
Looking at the loans by category. On an average basis compared with the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans were roughly flat with the usual seasonal decline in auto floor plan loans offset by about 4% annualized growth and other C&I loans. 
Commercial real estate loans increased by about $1.1 billion or 15% annualized. Residential mortgage loans declined at a 13% annualized rate and consumer loans grew at an annualized 8%, with growth in indirect loans, including indirect auto loans being offset by a decline in home equity lines of credit.
Regionally, we've seen the highest growth rate in commercial loans in New Jersey coming off what is admittedly a low base. Growth in the adjacent New York City, Tarrytown, Philadelphia markets, continues to be strong as well. Only Pennsylvania stood out as having a below-average growth this quarter.
Average core consumer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office and CDs over $250,000, increased in an annualized rate of 8% from the second quarter, reflecting higher levels of trust and savings deposits, partially offset by lower levels of time deposits.
Turning to noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $491 million in the third quarter, up from $448 million in the prior quarter. Excluding securities gains from both periods, noninterest revenues grew 3% from the linked quarter. Mortgage banking revenues were $104 million in the recent quarter, $14 million higher than in the linked quarter. Total residential banking revenues, including origination in servicing activities, were $67 million compared with $65 million in the prior quarter. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $836 million in the quarter, down about 3% compared to the second quarter, but with a higher gain on sale margin.
Our commercial mortgage banking operation had another strong quarter. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were $37 million compared with $24 million in the second quarter, reflecting strong origination activity. Trust income was $119 million in the recent quarter compared to $120 million in the previous quarter.
Recall that in the second quarter's results, included were $3 million of seasonal tax preparation fees that did not recur in the third quarter. New business generation remains particularly strong on the institutional side of our business.
Service charges on deposit accounts were $108 million, improved from $104 million in the second quarter, reflecting seasonal strength as well as the benefit from new customers.
Turning to expenses. Operating expenses for the third quarter, which exclude merger-related expenses and the amortization of intangible assets, were $743 million compared with $726 million in the prior quarter.
The FDIC assessment increased by $6 million to $28 million as the assessment surcharge on banks over $10 billion in size came into effect.  Other cost of operations increased by $10 million on an operating basis compared to the second quarter. That increase reflects higher amortizing expenses to capitalize on the competitive changes occurring within our markets as well as higher professional services, which include legal.
The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization and any merger-related expenses from the new [indiscernible] and securities gains from the denominator, was 55.9% in the recent quarter compared to 55.1% in the previous quarter.  The comparable figure was 57.1% in last year's third quarter.
Next, let's turn to credit. Our credit quality remains stable with continued low levels of nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs. Nonaccrual loans declined by $11 million to $837 million at September 30, and the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans was 93 basis points, improved from 96 basis points at the end of the second quarter. 
Net charge-offs for the third quarter were $41 million compared to $24 million in the second quarter. Reflected in the recent quarters charge-offs was $12 million associated with the commercial loan to a commercial maintenance services provider.  Recall that the second quarter's results included a sizable $7 million recovery on a previously charged-off commercial loan.  Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 19 basis points for the third quarter, in line with what we've seen on average over the past 2 years.
The provision for credit losses was $47 million in the recent quarter, exceeding net charge-offs by $6 million, reflecting overall loan growth as well as the ongoing shift to a higher proportion of commercial loans to total loans as the Hudson City mortgage portfolio pays them. 
The allowance for credit losses was $976 million at the end of September. The ratio of this allowance to total loans was 1.09%, little change from the 1.10% at the end of the second quarter.
Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest, excluding acquired loans that had been marked to a fair value discounted acquisition, were $317 million at the end of the recent quarter. And of those loans, $282 million or 89% are guaranteed by government-related entities.
Turning to capital. M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio under the current transitional Basel III capital rules was an estimated 10.76% compared to 11.01% at the end of the second quarter. This reflects earnings retention, less $350 million of share repurchases during the quarter, $110 million in dividends paid during the quarter as well as the impact of net asset growth.
Turning to the outlook. The trends in the third quarter were largely consistent with what we've seen over the course of 2016. At this point, our outlook for the remainder of the year remains little changed. We expect runoff of the mortgage loan portfolio to continue, but that will be more than offset by growth in commercial and other consumer loans. We expect the normal seasonal rebound in auto floor plan balances. 
The pipeline of customer activity in other parts of the C&I portfolio remains strong. We expect continued pressure in the core net interest margin in the area of 2 to 3 basis points. But as we saw this quarter, changes in the level of trust deposits, the overall cost of interest-bearing deposits and other items can result in some volatility in the printed margin.  In any case, we expect growth in net interest income to continue to be challenged, while we transition our New Jersey operations to a commercial banking profile amidst the ongoing difficult interest rate environment.  
On expenses, our outlook for spending in the second half of 2016 is that it will approximate spending in the first half.  Our outlook for credit is little changed over the short term. We're still not seeing any significant pressures on credit, either in nonaccrual loans or in charge-offs.
And we remain on track with our capital plan with the pace of repurchases a little more weighted toward the second half of 2016 and a little less in the first half of 2017.  As is our normal practice, we'll share our thoughts on the outlook for 2017 in the July earnings conference call. 
Of course, as you are aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.
At this point, we'll open up the call to questions, before which, Maria will briefly review the instructions."

I know there's a lot going on in the margin. If we think about the basics in the 2 to 3 basis points, that's what we've been talking about all year. And that is the combination of the run off in the mortgage portfolio, how quickly w",273,"Yes. So good question. I know there's a lot going on in the margin. If we think about the basics in the 2 to 3 basis points, that's what we've been talking about all year. And that is the combination of the run off in the mortgage portfolio, how quickly we price the CD book as well as just as older loans that are at a higher margin payoff and the newer ones that are at a slightly lower margin become a bigger part of the portfolio, you're seeing that compression. If you look at the 2 basis points that happened because of the trust demand deposits, it's really literally that extra $1 billion that was being kept at the Fed. So those billion dollars carry a very low margin. We're not receiving much on it, but we're not pay much on them. Those are just a different form of payment for our global capital markets business. And then the other piece was obviously the mortgage portfolio being a bigger chunk of our balances and the pricing convention there being 30 over 360. That when you have a quarter like we did, the interest paid by the customer doesn't change, but the basis over, which you calculate the effective rate or the margin drops. So, I guess, we kind of look at that is what I would call noise. How much cash at the Fed and trust demand deposits will be in the next quarter. I guess it's our anticipation that they will go down, but that's something that is subject to move quarter-to-quarter based on the activity we have in that business."

So I guess if you look at our expenses and how they've gone over the course of the year and you look at where some of the investments have happened, if you look at our salaries and benefits line and where we've been over the course of the year, and,",426,"Sure. So I guess if you look at our expenses and how they've gone over the course of the year and you look at where some of the investments have happened, if you look at our salaries and benefits line and where we've been over the course of the year, and, of course, over the last year, we've added some people. We've invested in some businesses and growing global capital markets business. We've hired a couple of teams over the course of the year, and we're investing, as you noted, in New Jersey. We think that we'll continue to make investments as appropriate, but probably the pace will slow down a little bit. That we wouldn't maintain the pace that we were this year versus 2015 when you think about salary and benefits. When you look at some of the other cost of operations, I mean, occupancy, obviously, will go with people, but should be pretty much contained. One of the places where we did spend more money this year was advertising and promotion. It was probably a little bit elevated compared to what would be a normal run rate for us because we were making a splash in New Jersey as we went in there as well as we're taking advantage as we talked about some of the changes in the marketplaces that we operate in that have been happening. So, I guess, absent other changes happening, our expectation would be that, that would come back down. Probably not all the way to were it was in prior years because we are now a bigger organization with New Jersey, but below the place where we are today. And when we look at the other professional services expenses that are out there, our pace of IT investment I think won't get higher from where we are right now. That we're looking at the additions we've made to the technology team as well as to outside help. We think the run rate we're at is a good place, and we might actually slow it down a little bit so that we're able to manage the change that we're introducing into the bank so that we can do things well. So, I guess, I don't see those dropping dramatically, but I don't see them going up from here. And then, obviously, the other wild card is illegal, which is part of the professional services, and we will continue our work there as we get ready to go to trial, which has been extended until October of next year."

So you noted something that we've been paying attention to and had a lot of discussion on around here over the last little while. There's a bunch of components within that $12 billion. We certainly don't need $12 billion to run the bank, that's for sure. When we look at what we need for HQLA and for the LCR, that number is maybe between $3 billion and $5 billion. And I think the question of whether it's $3 billion or whether it's $5 billion is really a function of what we think we can invest in the securities world. And for us, when we look at investing it in a 2-year [ph] treasuries, it's at 70 basis points or just keeping it. At the Fed, it's 50. Right now, we're kind of more inclined to leave it in the Fed. Now other components of that $12 billion include primarily 2 things: one is trust demand deposits. And when you look at those, either we or the customer that we are holding those on, on their behalf, we can either choose to put them in the Fed or you can put them in the money funds, which is what would've happened historically. I think as rates start to come back there, trust demand deposits will sit as much or more in the money funds as it will all sit in the Fed. And either we'll do that on behalf of the customer or the customer will choose to do it themselves and then we won't get those dollars as payment. We'll get paid in fees in our global capital markets business. And then the other part of what's in the Fed is some escrow balances that come with relationship we have with Bayview and the servicing that we do, and those are monthly PNI payments. So there's a floor that we see every month and that will look to put to work, but there are some part of that, those balances that grow throughout the month until the payments are made and then they drop back down. And we think the most prudent thing to do with those certainly right now is to just keep those at the Fed.  So really, when you -- when we look at those balances, we're thinking about those 3 categories. And we're looking to try and optimize what we have to make sure that we're not putting funds at risk, but we're getting as good as good as return as we can on those dollars."

There's a couple of factors that are involved in the Hudson City deposits, and I'll do my best to give you some guidance on how to think about it. So in the fourth quarter, there's, I think, $2 billion to $2.5 billion that will mature and they're across a number of different term buckets. And what we've seen so far as we've started the repricing is that approximately 50% of the CDs are renewing and they're renewing typically at a lower rate. Some -- and that could of come in 2 forms. It could be at a lower rate within the existing term or -- but we're also seeing is people shifting to shorter term just because the interest rate environment wherein I think the book is generally short for us. I think it is for folks in the industry because people are uncertain. So some of the dollars will reprice into CDs, light term or shorter term.

And then, obviously, we're trying to grow in New Jersey, which is a place where we did see some outsized growth. Although I remind you that the percentage looks good, but it's of the small base. But overall, when we look at our pipeline, the pipeline is strong. It's slightly above what we had seen in prior quarters.

You can get stuff that happens at quarter end for various reasons. I would tend to look at the average that, that normalizes out. Things that might show up 1 month and I get participated out. So I think that's a better measure to use and the one that we will probably pay more attention to. I guess the only thing to remind everyone up is the fourth quarter that always tends to be a little bit of a spike. As our customers reach year-end and they're trying to get things done in a certain tax year, that's often a driver of activity to get deals done or loans closed. And we've historically seen a little bit of a spike at the end of the fourth quarter, so I would just pay attention to that but it's usually late in the quarter. So from an average perspective, again, it might -- it won't necessarily drive income in the quarter, but it will give you a nice pop at the end of the period. So a long-winded way of saying I tend to focus on the averages."

We're not seeing a ton of CapEx for growth and a bunch of the replacement cycle is gone. So, I guess, I would describe it and think about it as steady.

So, I guess, as we look at what's been going on with net interest income, I think -- we think we're approaching the bottom and it will start to turn. How quickly that turns will be obviously a function of once we get the rate increase in December or not. But even absent that, we expect it to start to turn in the next couple of quarters. Part of the issue is, and I think this is pretty straightforward for everyone, is as the mortgages run off, the reason they're prepaying is because they tend to be right around 4% and those are fixed yields. Where as the commercial loans that we're replacing them with and the short term with LIBOR where they are being LIBOR based are at yields that are kind of 350 to 360. So that's part of what's driving that core compression. But as the mortgage balances become a little bit less of a factor in the balance sheet that's why we see that bottoming out coming in the quarters and expect to happen in 2017 and see things go the other way."

Now that said, though impact of a rate  the impact of a rate hike, sorry, on net interest margin I think will be pretty similar to what we saw last time. If it's 25 points, it won't be the whole thing that will show up in the margin. Obviously, deposit pricing, deposit price reactivity will impact that. We're not sure that it will be that much this time as well, but I think a good guide line will be to look at what would happen this time.

And it's our intention to manage that number so that we've got ourselves covered, but without giving away interest income that we could otherwise get if we were able to invest that in securities that paid better than holding cash with the Fed. When it comes to the escrow balances, there are minimums that we need to have to make sure that we don't ever have ourselves in a position where we can't make those payments on behalf of the people that we're covering from a servicing perspective. They're, obviously, the cost to holding those and we're cognizant of what that cost this, but that's also part of the pricing that we have the people that we're doing that business. Trust demand will be the same thing. I guess, I think it's the trust demand balances I look at as primarily a function of the interest rate environment that we're in right now. That if we were in different part of the cycle where rates were -- we'll see what happens if there's a 25-basis-point hike. But certainly, another 50 and I think the level trust demand deposits that we see us carrying will start to get real small real fast and will be down into the range of the 5-ish billion that we're holding for HQLA.

That would be primarily credit card and home equity lines of credit. So what we're finding within the CD customer base, at least is it tends to skew a little bit older and, therefore, our ability to penetrate that with home equity loans and cards isn't the same as it would be from dealing with a slightly younger crowd. But, obviously, we've got those mortgages that we look at as well. And if we have some of that has a mortgage, those would be good candidates for certainly home equity lines of credit. So we're cognizant of that and we're working on it. But is that going to drive double-digit growth? I don't think so. I think what you're seeing in our home equity growth is not dissimilar to what you're seeing in the industry. And really, with 30-year rates and 15-year rates, as long as they are, the average consumer is much more interested in doing a first than using a second. We always start to see second balances and demand start to increase as rates increase when people can't utilize the first lien market as their primary option. When you talk about auto loans, for us and I think the industry, that tends to generally work through the dealerships, we've been through -- we've been operating in New Jersey even prior to having Hudson City. And we have reps there that are working with dealers, dealerships and dealer groups to try and be in their set of options. But it's a -- I don't think you would look at New Jersey, I certainly wouldn't and say that's a big opportunity that will drive our indirect auto business growth beyond the rate that we've been seeing over the last few quarters."

I appreciate there's been a whole lot of moving parts over the last 12 months, but should we -- I mean, should we assume that the 25 basis points that we might get in December would add, all else being equal, 15 to 20 basis points to the margin by the fourth quarter of 2017? Or are there other moving parts that could diminish that?"

So I think the 15 to 20, you start to see that work its way through the loan book, but shouldn't think about the whole part of the impact on the liability repricing as well. And I think when you net the 2 together and you look at what happened last time, you probably net more in the 6 to 10 range. And that you see the pop early on in that it comes down. Hopefully, it doesn't come down, the reason for the range, hopefully, it doesn't come down as much as it had this time as the LIBOR rate moves up, which you're giving up from the mortgages going into commercial loans isn't as big a gap as it was it is today, given where rates are.  And so that will effect it. And then, obviously, the other thing that will be part of the margin that's important to think about is in total how we fund the balance sheet, right? So we have some bank notes that are coming due next year that we'll issue. And depending on where the print is there, that will also impact the margin. So I guess, originally, as I was thinking about the question in my response, I was thinking more on simply the asset side. But I think 6 to 10 in total margin is probably a better space to be, which, again, I always look at what happened this past year, recognizing there was some noise in there, but that's probably a good guide."

When the accounting for acquired certificates of deposit, the math is that if it's a 12-month CD and there's 2 months left, you basically market as a 2-month instrument and you think about the interest rate as that. So as those CDs that were in partial pay down, if you will, they were with less than their maturity, the rate that we would see would be the marked rate. And then as they renew, you would go to the actual rate, and that's partly why you're seeing that increase in those time deposit accounts over the course of the quarters this year. We've talked before that the bulk of the book is less than a year, so we should be pretty close to the end of that accounting happening and start to see more pronounced the effect of the repricing that's happening. But also remind you that the repricing happens every month, right. So in the first month, you see 1/12 of it, right? And then the second month, you see 2/12 of it? So it takes awhile for that stuff to work its way through, and it's also a fashion of how being the balances are -- that are maturing in each of those twelves. And we started to work in the middle of August. So really, we've got 1/12 in that book so far in  September, and that's why the numbers that you're quoting are accurate and why they're not that impressive. But you've got to start sometime in making those changes, and we're started down that path. And we think it's an important next step in the conversion we have of this thrift into a commercial bank."

As most of you have no doubt seen in this morning's press release, M&T's results for the third quarter reflect the initiatives we have under way to position the bank for future success. The merger with Hudson City Bancorp was completed almost a year ago, and the ongoing process of converting a thrift to a commercial bank continues. 
During the quarter, we continue to build out the New Jersey consumer bank, both by growing new households as well as taking steps to reprice the acquired deposit base. 
For the New Jersey Commercial Bank, loan balances for the year-to-date have grown at an annualized rate of over 20%, led by loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises. We're pleased to see that our community's focus to approach to banking is starting to take root in the New Jersey marketplace. 
Customer migration arising from the multiple mergers and acquisitions that have occurred within our footprint also continues. We've been advertising and offering incentives to bring in new customers impacted by some of those changes in our markets. Customer growth in the third quarter was the highest we've seen in the past 8 quarters. 
We've also continued our program of investments in operational infrastructure and technology. As we previously signaled, the enhanced mtb.com website went live during the quarter. Other highlights for the quarter include an upgrade to our ATM network, to handle EMV-chip-equipped cards and adding a feature to our payment services capability that enables our customers to send and receive same-day ACH transactions. 
The upgrade to our consumer mobile app is in final testing and we expect it to go live later this quarter. And finally, we took some actions to get ahead of the pending implementation of the so-called Volcker Rule contained within the Dodd-Frank Act by divesting some securities disallowed by the rule. I'll share some more details on each of these actions and how they impacted us in a few minutes.
However, before we proceed, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the recent passing of Richard King, our board member -- I'm sorry, a member of M&T's Board of Directors. 
Mr. King joined M&T's board in 2000, following our acquisition of Pennsylvania-based Keystone Financial. We valued his extensive experience in business and his deep ties to the communities in Pennsylvania. We'll miss his counsel and his friendship. 
Now let's turn to the numbers. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $2.10 for the third quarter of 2016, improved from $1.98 in the second quarter of 2016 and $1.93 in last year's third quarter. 
Net income for the quarter was $350 million, up 4% from $336 million in the linked quarter and up 25% from $280 million in the year-ago quarter. 
Included in GAAP results were after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $6 million or $0.03 per common share in the recent quarter compared with $7 million and $0.04 per common share in the second quarter. There were no merger-related expenses in the third quarter results, however, results for the second quarter included merger-related expenses amounting to $8 million after tax effect or $0.05 per common share.
Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provide supplemental reporting on its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of the amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions.
M&T's net operating income for the third quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related expenses from the relevant periods, was $356 million compared with $351 million in the linked quarter and $283 million in last year's third quarter.
Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $2.13 in the recent quarter, improved from $2.07 in this year's second quarter and $1.95 in the year-ago quarter.
On a GAAP basis, M&T's third quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.12% and an annualized rate of return on average common equity of 8.68%. This compares to 1.09% and 8.38%, respectively in the previous quarter.
Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.81% and 12.77% in the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.18% and 12.68% in the second quarter of 2016.
In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.
Included in both GAAP and net operating results were $28 million of net pretax securities gains. This equates to $17 million after-tax effect or $0.11 per common share. The gains pertain to a variety of TruPS CDOs that M&T obtained during our acquisition of other banks over the past number of years, primarily through the merger with Provident Bankshares in 2009. 
Our marked to fair value through acquisition accounting and under Section 6.19 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly known as the Volcker Rule, divestiture of most of these securities would otherwise have been required prior to July 21, 2017. 
Turning to the balanced sheet and income statement. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $865 million in the third quarter of 2016, down $5 million from the linked quarter. The net interest margin declined to 3.05%, down 8 basis points from 3.13% in the linked quarter. 
During the quarter, we had another increase in average trust deposits, which we placed at the Fed. Average interest-bearing deposits with banks were $9.7 billion during the past quarter compared to $8.7 billion in the second quarter. Those deposits are modestly additive to net interest income, but we estimate a diluted net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points during the quarter. 
Also, with the acquisition of the Hudson City mortgage loans, we have a higher proportion of assets with a 30 over 360-day pricing basis on our balance sheet than we had previously. That has the impact of diminishing the reported margin in a 92-day quarter, such as the one that just ended -- sorry, such as the one that just ended. We estimate the impact on the margin was about 2 basis points. 
Several other items included in net interest income, including prepayment fees and interest on nonaccrual loans, which individually aren't large, in the aggregate reduced the margin by approximately 1 basis point. What we would consider to be core margin pressure accounted for about 3 basis points of the decline.
As we discussed earlier in the third quarter, we began to take action to reprice the Hudson City deposit base to be more in line with the market and we began those efforts in mid-August. This benefits the margin immediately but will take another few quarters for the full impact to be realized as time deposits reach their state of maturity. Average loans increased by about 3% on an annualized basis or $577 million compared to the linked quarter.
Looking at the loans by category. On an average basis compared with the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans were roughly flat with the usual seasonal decline in auto floor plan loans offset by about 4% annualized growth and other C&I loans. 
Commercial real estate loans increased by about $1.1 billion or 15% annualized. Residential mortgage loans declined at a 13% annualized rate and consumer loans grew at an annualized 8%, with growth in indirect loans, including indirect auto loans being offset by a decline in home equity lines of credit.
Regionally, we've seen the highest growth rate in commercial loans in New Jersey coming off what is admittedly a low base. Growth in the adjacent New York City, Tarrytown, Philadelphia markets, continues to be strong as well. Only Pennsylvania stood out as having a below-average growth this quarter.
Average core consumer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office and CDs over $250,000, increased in an annualized rate of 8% from the second quarter, reflecting higher levels of trust and savings deposits, partially offset by lower levels of time deposits.
Turning to noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $491 million in the third quarter, up from $448 million in the prior quarter. Excluding securities gains from both periods, noninterest revenues grew 3% from the linked quarter. Mortgage banking revenues were $104 million in the recent quarter, $14 million higher than in the linked quarter. Total residential banking revenues, including origination in servicing activities, were $67 million compared with $65 million in the prior quarter. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $836 million in the quarter, down about 3% compared to the second quarter, but with a higher gain on sale margin.
Our commercial mortgage banking operation had another strong quarter. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were $37 million compared with $24 million in the second quarter, reflecting strong origination activity. Trust income was $119 million in the recent quarter compared to $120 million in the previous quarter.
Recall that in the second quarter's results, included were $3 million of seasonal tax preparation fees that did not recur in the third quarter. New business generation remains particularly strong on the institutional side of our business.
Service charges on deposit accounts were $108 million, improved from $104 million in the second quarter, reflecting seasonal strength as well as the benefit from new customers.
Turning to expenses. Operating expenses for the third quarter, which exclude merger-related expenses and the amortization of intangible assets, were $743 million compared with $726 million in the prior quarter.
The FDIC assessment increased by $6 million to $28 million as the assessment surcharge on banks over $10 billion in size came into effect. Other cost of operations increased by $10 million on an operating basis compared to the second quarter. That increase reflects higher amortizing expenses to capitalize on the competitive changes occurring within our markets as well as higher professional services, which include legal.
The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization and any merger-related expenses from the new Bryn Mawr [ph] and securities gains from the denominator, was 55.9% in the recent quarter compared to 55.1% in the previous quarter. The comparable figure was 57.1% in last year's third quarter.
Next, let's turn to credit. Our credit quality remains stable with continued low levels of nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs. Nonaccrual loans declined by $11 million to $837 million at September 30, and the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans was 93 basis points, improved from 96 basis points at the end of the second quarter. 
Net charge-offs for the third quarter were $41 million compared to $24 million in the second quarter. Reflected in the recent quarters charge-offs was $12 million associated with the commercial loan to a commercial maintenance services provider. Recall that the second quarter's results included a sizable $7 million recovery on a previously charged-off commercial loan. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 19 basis points for the third quarter, in line with what we've seen on average over the past 2 years.
The provision for credit losses was $47 million in the recent quarter, exceeding net charge-offs by $6 million, reflecting overall loan growth as well as the ongoing shift to a higher proportion of commercial loans to total loans as the Hudson City mortgage portfolio pays them. 
The allowance for credit losses was $976 million at the end of September. The ratio of this allowance to total loans was 1.09%, little change from the 1.10% at the end of the second quarter.
Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest, excluding acquired loans that had been marked to a fair value discounted acquisition, were $317 million at the end of the recent quarter. And of those loans, $282 million or 89% are guaranteed by government-related entities.
Turning to capital. M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio under the current transitional Basel III capital rules was an estimated 10.76% compared to 11.01% at the end of the second quarter. This reflects earnings retention, less $350 million of share repurchases during the quarter, $110 million in dividends paid during the quarter as well as the impact of net asset growth.
Turning to the outlook. The trends in the third quarter were largely consistent with what we've seen over the course of 2016. At this point, our outlook for the remainder of the year remains little changed. We expect runoff of the mortgage loan portfolio to continue, but that will be more than offset by growth in commercial and other consumer loans. We expect the normal seasonal rebound in auto floor plan balances. 
The pipeline of customer activity in other parts of the C&I portfolio remains strong. We expect continued pressure in the core net interest margin in the area of 2 to 3 basis points. But as we saw this quarter, changes in the level of trust deposits, the overall cost of interest-bearing deposits and other items can result in some volatility in the printed margin. In any case, we expect growth in net interest income to continue to be challenged, while we transition our New Jersey operations to a commercial banking profile amidst the ongoing difficult interest rate environment. 
On expenses, our outlook for spending in the second half of 2016 is that it will approximate spending in the first half. Our outlook for credit is little changed over the short term. We're still not seeing any significant pressures on credit, either in nonaccrual loans or in charge-offs.
And we remain on track with our capital plan with the pace of repurchases a little more weighted toward the second half of 2016 and a little less in the first half of 2017. As is our normal practice, we'll share our thoughts on the outlook for 2017 in the July earnings conference call. 
Of course, as you are aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.

If we think about the basics in the 2 to 3 basis points, that's what we've been talking about all year. And that is the combination of the runoff in the mortgage portfolio, how quickly we reprice the CD book as well as just as older loans that are at a higher margin payoff and the newer ones that are at a slightly lower margin become a bigger part of the portfolio, you're seeing that compression. If you look at the 2 basis points that happened because of the trust demand deposits, it's really literally that extra $1 billion that was being kept at the Fed. So those billion dollars carry a very low margin. We're not receiving much on it, but we're not pay much on them. Those are just a different form of payment for our global capital markets business. And then the other piece was obviously the mortgage portfolio being a bigger chunk of our balances and the pricing convention there being 30 over 360. That when you have a quarter like we did, the interest paid by the customer doesn't change, but the basis over which you calculate the effective rate or the margin drops. So I guess, we kind of look at that as what I would call noise. How much cash at the Fed and trust demand deposits will be in the next quarter. I guess it's our anticipation that they will go down, but that's something that is subject to move quarter-to-quarter based on the activity we have in that business."

So I guess if you look at our expenses and how they've gone over the course of the year and you look at where some of the investments have happened, if you look at our salaries and benefits line and where we've been over the course of the year and the course of the last year, we've added some people. We've invested in some businesses in growing global capital markets business. We've hired a couple of teams over the course of the year, and we're investing, as you noted, in New Jersey. We think that we'll continue to make investments as appropriate, but probably the pace will slow down a little bit. That we wouldn't maintain the pace that we were this year versus 2015 when you think about salary and benefits. When you look at some of the other cost of operations, I mean, occupancy, obviously, will go with people, but that should be pretty much contained. One of the places where we did spend more money this year was advertising and promotion. It was probably a little bit elevated compared to what would be a normal run rate for us because we were making a splash in New Jersey as we went in there as well as we were taking advantage as we talked about some of the changes in the marketplaces that we operate in that have been happening. So, I guess, absent other changes happening, our expectation would be that, that would come back down. Probably not all the way to where it was in prior years because we are now a bigger organization with New Jersey, but below the place where we are today. And when we look at the other professional services expenses that are out there, our pace of IT investment I think won't get higher from where we are right now, that we're looking at the additions we've made to the technology team as well as to outside help, that we think the run rate we're at is a good place, and we might actually slow it down a little bit so that we're able to manage the change that we're introducing into the bank so that we can do things well. So, I guess, I don't see those dropping dramatically, but I don't see them going up from here. And then, obviously, the other wild card is illegal, which is part of the professional services, and we will continue our work there as we get ready to go to trial, which has been extended until October of next year."

So you noted something that we've been paying attention to and had a lot of discussion on around here over the last little while. There's a bunch of components within that $12 billion. We certainly don't need $12 billion to run the bank, that's for sure. When we look at what we need for HQLA and for the LCR, that number is maybe between $3 billion and $5 billion. And I think the question of whether it's $3 billion or whether it's $5 billion is really a function of what we think we can invest in the securities world. And for us, when we look at investing it in 2-year treasuries at 70 basis points or just keeping it. At the Fed, it's 50. Right now, we're kind of more inclined to leave it in the Fed. Now other components of that $12 billion include primarily 2 things: one is trust demand deposits. And when you look at those, either we or the customer that we are holding those on, on their behalf, we can either choose to put them in the Fed or you can put them in the money funds, which is what would've happened historically. I think as rates start to come back there, trust demand deposits will sit as much or more in the money funds as it will all sit in the Fed. And either we'll do that on behalf of the customer or the customer will choose to do it themselves and then we won't get those dollars as payment. We'll get paid in fees in our global capital markets business. And then the other part of what's in the Fed is some escrow balances that come with a relationship we have with Bayview and the servicing that we do, and those are monthly P&I payments. So there's a floor that we see every month and that will look to put to work, but there are some part of that, those balances that grow throughout the month until the payments are made and then they drop back down. And we think the most prudent thing to do with those certainly right now is to just keep those at the Fed. So really, when you -- when we look at those balances, we're thinking about those 3 categories. And we're looking to try and optimize what we have to make sure that we're not putting funds at risk, but we're getting as good a return as we can on those dollars."

There's a couple of factors that are involved in the Hudson City deposits, and I'll do my best to give you some guidance on how to think about it. So in the fourth quarter, there's, I think, $2 billion to $2.5 billion that will mature and they're across a number of different term buckets. And what we've seen so far as we've started the repricing is that approximately 50% of the CDs are renewing and they're renewing typically at a lower rate. Some -- and that could have come in 2 forms. It could be at a lower rate within the existing term or -- but we're also seeing is people shifting to shorter term just because of the interest rate environment wherein I think the book is generally short for us. I think it is for folks in the industry because people are uncertain. So some of the dollars will reprice into CDs, light term or shorter term. Some of those CDs will actually change categories and will go into money market accounts or even now accounts, again, while people wait out the interest rate environment and then some of those aren't rising. In total, we're retaining about 60% of the balances across all categories and about half are staying within time deposits of various maturities."

So I think that's a better measure to use and the one that we will probably pay more attention to. I guess the only thing to remind everyone of is the fourth quarter, there always tends to be a little bit of a spike. As our customers reach year-end and they're trying to get things done in a certain tax year, that's often a driver of activity to get deals done or loans closed. And we've historically seen a little bit of a spike at the end of the fourth quarter, so I would just pay attention to that, but it's usually late in the quarter. So from an average perspective, again, it might -- it won't necessarily drive income in the quarter, but it will give you a nice pop at the end of the period.

As I mentioned before, our pipeline is very strong. It's in line with what we've seen in prior quarters. I think there is a little bit of a pause, and I expect there will be a pause this quarter as we go through the election cycle and people digest what that means and with the change in administration. And the more global trend that we've seen this year and have for the last couple of years is companies of all sizes are sitting more on cash, and they're holding that cash and they're investing, but they're still reticent to invest beyond maintaining where they are. We're not seeing a ton of CapEx for growth and a bunch of the replacement cycle is gone. So, I guess, I would describe it and think about it as steady. And the growth that we had in the quarter, I think is fairly consistent in the ex floor plan space, consistent with kind of where we've been in the prior quarters. And we don't see a huge reason for that to change in the fourth quarter, either up or down."

How quickly that turns will be obviously a function of whether we get the rate increase in December or not. But even absent that, we expect it to start to turn in the next couple of quarters. Part of the issue is, and I think this is pretty straightforward for everyone, is as the mortgages run off, the reason they're prepaying is because they tend to be right around 4% and those are fixed yields. Whereas the commercial loans that we're replacing them with and the short term with LIBOR where they are being LIBOR based are at yields that are kind of 3.50% to 3.60%. So that's part of what's driving that core compression. But as the mortgage balances become a little bit less of a factor in the balance sheet that's why we see that bottoming out coming in the coming quarters and expect to happen in 2017 and see things go the other way."

Now that said, though impact of a rate -- the impact of a rate hike, sorry, on net interest margin I think will be pretty similar to what we saw last time. If it's 25 points, it won't be the whole thing that will show up in the margin. Obviously, deposit pricing, deposit price reactivity will impact that.

And it's our intention to manage that number so that we've got ourselves covered, but without giving away interest income that we could otherwise get if we were able to invest that in securities that paid better than holding cash with the Fed.

They're, obviously, the cost to holding those and we're cognizant of what that cost is, but that's also part of the pricing that we have with the people that we're doing that business. Trust demand will be the same thing. I guess, I think it's a -- the trust demand balances I look at as primarily a function of the interest rate environment that we're in right now. That if we were in different part of the cycle where rates were -- we'll see what happens if there's a 25-basis-point hike.

That would be primarily credit card and home equity lines of credit. What we're finding within the CD customer base, at least, is that it tends to skew a little bit older and, therefore, our ability to penetrate that with home equity loans and cards isn't the same as it would be through dealing with a slightly younger crowd. But, obviously, we've got those mortgages that we look at as well. And if we have someone that has a mortgage, those would be good candidates for certainly home equity lines of credit. So we're cognizant of that and we're working on it. But is that going to drive double-digit growth? I don't think so. I think what you're seeing in our home equity growth is not dissimilar to what you're seeing in the industry. And really, with 30-year rates and 15-year rates, as low as they are, the average consumer is much more interested in doing a first than using a second. We only start to see second balances and demand start to increase as rates increase when people can't utilize the first lien market as their primary option. When you talk about auto loans, for us and I think the industry, that tends to generally work through the dealerships, we've been through -- we've been operating in New Jersey even prior to having Hudson City. And we have reps there that are working with dealers, dealerships and dealer groups to try and be in their set of options. But it's -- I don't think you would look at New Jersey, I certainly wouldn't, and say that's a big opportunity that will drive our indirect auto business growth beyond the rate that we've been seeing over the last few quarters."

So I think the 15 to 20, you start to see that work its way through the loan book, but should have been thinking about the whole part of the impact on the liability repricing as well. And I think when you net the 2 together and you look at what happened last time, you probably net more in the 6 to 10 range. And that you see the pop early on and then it comes down. Hopefully, it doesn't come down, when the reason for the range. Hopefully, it doesn't come down quite as much as it had this time because the -- as the LIBOR rate moves up, which you're giving up from the mortgages going into commercial loans isn't as big a gap as what it is today, given where rates are. And so that will affect it. And then, obviously, the other thing that will be part of the margin that's important to think about is in total how we fund the balance sheet, right? So we have some bank notes that are coming due next year that we'll issue. And depending on where the print is there, that will also impact the margin. So I guess, originally, as I was thinking about the question in my response, I was thinking more on simply the asset side. But I think 6 to 10 in total margin is probably a better space to be, which, again, I always look at what happened this past year, recognizing there was some noise in there, but that's probably a good guide."

When the accounting for acquired certificates of deposit, the math is that if it's a 12-month CD and there's 2 months left, you basically market as a 2-month instrument and you think about the interest rate as that. So as those CDs that were in partial pay down, if you will, they were with less than their full maturity, the rate that we would see would be the marked rate. And then as they renew, you would go to the actual rate, and that's partly why you're seeing that increase in those time deposit accounts over the course of the quarters this year. We've talked before that the bulk of the book is less than a year, so we should be pretty close to the end of that accounting happening and start to see more pronounced the effect of the repricing that's happening. But also remind you that the repricing happens every month, right? So in the first month, you see 1/12 of it, right? And then the second month, you see 2/12 of it? So it takes awhile for that stuff to work its way through, and it's also a function of how big the balances are that are maturing in each of those 12s. And we started to work in the middle of August. So really, we've got 1/12 in the book so far in September, and that's why the numbers that you're quoting are accurate and why they're not that impressive.

As most of you have no doubt seen in this morning's press release, M&T's results for the third quarter reflect the initiatives we have under way to position the bank for future success. The merger with Hudson City Bancorp was completed almost a year ago, and the ongoing process of converting a thrift to a commercial bank continues. 
During the quarter, we continued to build out the New Jersey consumer bank, both by growing new households as well as taking steps to reprice the acquired deposit base. 
For the New Jersey Commercial Bank, loan balances for the year-to-date have grown at an annualized rate of over 20%, led by loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises. We're pleased to see that our community-focused approach to banking is starting to take root in the New Jersey marketplace. 
Customer migration, arising from the multiple mergers and acquisitions that have occurred within our footprint, also continues. We've been advertising and offering incentives to bring in new customers impacted by some of those changes in our markets. Customer growth in the third quarter was the highest we've seen in the past 8 quarters. 
We've also continued our program of investments in operational infrastructure and technology. As we previously signaled, the enhanced mtb.com website went live during the quarter. Other highlights for the quarter include an upgrade to our ATM network, to handle EMV-chip-equipped cards, and adding a feature to our payment services capability that enables our customers to send and receive same-day ACH transactions. 
The upgrade to our consumer mobile app is in final testing and we expect it to go live later this quarter. And finally, we took some actions to get ahead of the pending implementation of the so-called Volcker Rule contained within the Dodd-Frank Act by divesting some securities disallowed by the rule. I'll share some more details on each of these actions and how they impacted us in a few minutes.
However, before we proceed, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the recent passing of Richard King, our board member -- I'm sorry, a member of M&T's Board of Directors. 
Mr. King joined M&T's board in 2000, following our acquisition of Pennsylvania-based Keystone Financial. We valued his extensive experience in business and his deep ties to the communities in Pennsylvania. We'll miss his counsel and his friendship. 
Now let's turn to the numbers. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $2.10 for the third quarter of 2016, improved from $1.98 in the second quarter of 2016 and $1.93 in last year's third quarter. 
Net income for the quarter was $350 million, up 4% from $336 million in the linked quarter and up 25% from $280 million in the year-ago quarter. 
Included in GAAP results were after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $6 million or $0.03 per common share in the recent quarter compared with $7 million and $0.04 per common share in the second quarter. There were no merger-related expenses in the third quarter results, however, results for the second quarter included merger-related expenses amounting to $8 million after tax effect or $0.05 per common share.
Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting on its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of the amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions.
M&T's net operating income for the third quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related expenses from the relevant periods, was $356 million compared with $351 million in the linked quarter and $283 million in last year's third quarter.
Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $2.13 in the recent quarter, improved from $2.07 in this year's second quarter and $1.95 in the year-ago quarter.
On a GAAP basis, M&T's third quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.12% and an annualized rate of return on average common equity of 8.68%. This compares to 1.09% and 8.38%, respectively, in the previous quarter.
Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.18% and 12.77% in the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.18% and 12.68% in the second quarter of 2016.
In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.
Included in both GAAP and net operating results were $28 million of net pretax securities gains. This equates to $17 million after-tax effect or $0.11 per common share. The gains pertain to a variety of TruPS CDOs that M&T obtained during our acquisition of other banks over the past number of years, primarily through the merger with Provident Bankshares in 2009. 
All were marked to fair value through acquisition accounting, and under Section 6.19 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly known as the Volcker Rule, divestiture of most of these securities would otherwise have been required prior to July 21, 2017. 
Turning to the balanced sheet and income statement. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $865 million in the third quarter of 2016, down $5 million from the linked quarter. The net interest margin declined to 3.05%, down 8 basis points from 3.13% in the linked quarter. 
During the quarter, we had another increase in average trust deposits, which we placed at the Fed. Average interest-bearing deposits with banks were $9.7 billion during the past quarter compared to $8.7 billion in the second quarter. Those deposits are modestly additive to net interest income, but we estimate they diluted net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points during the quarter. 
Also, with the acquisition of the Hudson City mortgage loans, we have a higher proportion of assets with a 30 over 360-day pricing basis on our balance sheet than we had previously. That has the impact of diminishing the reported margin in a 92-day quarter, such as the one that just ended -- sorry, such as the one that just ended. We estimate the impact on the margin was about 2 basis points. 
Several other items included in net interest income, including prepayment fees and interest on nonaccrual loans, which individually aren't large, in the aggregate reduced the margin by approximately 1 basis point. What we would consider to be core margin pressure accounted for about 3 basis points of the decline.
As we discussed earlier in the third quarter, we began to take action to reprice the Hudson City deposit base to be more in line with the market and we began those efforts in mid-August. This benefits the margin immediately but will take another few quarters for the full impact to be realized as time deposits reach their state of maturity. Average loans increased by about 3% on an annualized basis or $577 million compared to the linked quarter.
Looking at the loans by category. On an average basis compared with the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans were roughly flat, with the usual seasonal decline in auto floor plan loans offset by about a 4% annualized growth and other C&I loans. 
Commercial real estate loans increased by about $1.1 billion or 15% annualized. Residential mortgage loans declined at a 13% annualized rate, and consumer loans grew at an annualized 8%, with growth in indirect loans, including indirect auto loans being offset by a decline in home equity lines of credit.
Regionally, we've seen the highest growth rate in commercial loans in New Jersey coming off what is admittedly a low base. Growth in the adjacent New York City, Tarrytown, Philadelphia markets, continues to be strong as well. Only Pennsylvania stood out as having a below-average growth this quarter.
Average core consumer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office and CDs over $250,000, increased in an annualized rate of 8% from the second quarter, reflecting higher levels of trust and savings deposits, partially offset by lower levels of time deposits.
Turning to noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $491 million in the third quarter, up from $448 million in the prior quarter. Excluding securities gains from both periods, noninterest revenues grew 3% from the linked quarter. Mortgage banking revenues were $104 million in the recent quarter, $14 million higher than in the linked quarter. Total residential banking revenues, including origination and servicing activities, were $67 million compared with $65 million in the prior quarter. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $836 million in the quarter, down about 3% compared to the second quarter, but with a higher gain on sale margin.
Our commercial mortgage banking operation had another strong quarter. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were $37 million compared with $24 million in the second quarter, reflecting strong origination activity. Trust income was $119 million in the recent quarter compared to $120 million in the previous quarter.
Recall that in the second quarter's results, included were $3 million of seasonal tax preparation fees that did not recur in the third quarter. New business generation remains particularly strong on the institutional side of our business.
Service charges on deposit accounts were $108 million, improved from $104 million in the second quarter, reflecting seasonal strength as well as the benefit from new customers.
Turning to expenses. Operating expenses for the third quarter, which exclude merger-related expenses and the amortization of intangible assets, were $743 million compared with $726 million in the prior quarter.
The FDIC assessment increased by $6 million to $28 million as the assessment surcharge on banks over $10 billion in size came into effect. Other costs of operations increased by $10 million on an operating basis compared to the second quarter. That increase reflects higher amortizing expenses to capitalize on the competitive changes occurring within our markets as well as higher professional services, which include legal.
The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization and any merger-related expenses from the numerator and securities gains from the denominator, was 55.9% in the recent quarter compared to 55.1% in the previous quarter. The comparable figure was 57.1% in last year's third quarter.
Next, let's turn to credit. Our credit quality remains stable, with continued low levels of nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs. Nonaccrual loans declined by $11 million to $837 million at September 30, and the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans was 93 basis points, improved from 96 basis points at the end of the second quarter. 
Net charge-offs for the third quarter were $41 million compared to $24 million in the second quarter. Reflected in the recent quarter's charge-offs was $12 million associated with a commercial loan to a commercial maintenance services provider. Recall that the second quarter's results included a sizable $7 million recovery on a previously charged-off commercial loan. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 19 basis points for the third quarter, in line with what we've seen on average over the past 2 years.
The provision for credit losses was $47 million in the recent quarter, exceeding net charge-offs by $6 million, reflecting overall loan growth as well as the ongoing shift to a higher proportion of commercial loans to total loans as the Hudson City mortgage portfolio pays down. 
The allowance for credit losses was $976 million at the end of September. The ratio of this allowance to total loans was 1.09%, little change from the 1.10% at the end of the second quarter.
Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest, excluding acquired loans that had been marked to a fair value discounted acquisition, were $317 million at the end of the recent quarter. And of those loans, $282 million or 89% are guaranteed by government-related entities.
Turning to capital. M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio under the current transitional Basel III capital rules was an estimated 10.76% compared to 11.01% at the end of the second quarter. This reflects earnings retention, less $350 million of share repurchases during the quarter, $110 million in dividends paid during the quarter as well as the impact of net asset growth.
Turning to the outlook. The trends in the third quarter were largely consistent with what we've seen over the course of 2016. At this point, our outlook for the remainder of the year remains little changed. We expect runoff of the mortgage loan portfolio to continue, but be more than offset by growth in commercial and other consumer loans. We expect the normal seasonal rebound in auto floor plan balances. 
The pipeline of customer activity in other parts of the C&I portfolio remains strong. We expect continued pressure in the core net interest margin in the area of 2 to 3 basis points. But as we saw this quarter, changes in the level of trust deposits, the overall cost of interest-bearing deposits and other items can result in some volatility in the printed margin. In any case, we expect growth in net interest income to continue to be challenged, while we transition our New Jersey operations to a commercial banking profile amidst the ongoing difficult interest rate environment. 
On expenses, our outlook for spending in the second half of 2016 is that it will approximate spending in the first half. Our outlook for credit is little changed over the short term. We're still not seeing any significant pressures on credit, either in nonaccrual loans or in charge-offs.
And we remain on track with our capital plan, with the pace of repurchases a little more weighted toward the second half of 2016 and a little less in the first half of 2017. As is our normal practice, we'll share our thoughts on the outlook for 2017 in the July earnings conference call. 
Of course, as you are aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.
At this point, we'll open up the call to questions, before which, Maria will briefly review the instructions."

If we think about the basics in the 2 to 3 basis points, that's what we've been talking about all year. And that is the combination of the runoff in the mortgage portfolio, how quickly we price the CD book as well as just as older loans that are at a higher margin payoff and the newer ones that are at a slightly lower margin become a bigger part of the portfolio, you're seeing that compression. If you look at the 2 basis points that happened because of the trust demand deposits, it's really literally that extra $1 billion that was being kept at the Fed. So those billion dollars carry a very low margin. We're not receiving much on it, but we're not pay much on them. Those are just a different form of payment for our global capital markets business. And then the other piece was obviously the mortgage portfolio being a bigger chunk of our balances and the pricing convention there being 30 over 360. That when you have a quarter like we did, the interest paid by the customer doesn't change, but the basis over which you calculate the effective rate or the margin drops. So I guess we kind of look at that as what I would call noise. How much cash at the Fed and trust demand deposits will be in the next quarter. I guess it's our anticipation that they will go down, but that's something that is subject to move quarter-to-quarter based on the activity we have in that business."

I think in the release, you did talk about the normal seasoning of the non- sort of purchased impaired loans at Hudson City. Is that deteriorates just normal seasoning of the Hudson portfolio?

So I guess if you look at our expenses and how they've gone over the course of the year and you look at where some of the investments have happened, if you look at our salaries and benefits line and where we've been over the course of the year and the course of the last year, we've added some people. We've invested in some businesses in growing global capital markets business. We've hired a couple of teams over the course of the year, and we're investing, as you noted, in New Jersey. We think that we'll continue to make investments, as appropriate, but probably the pace will slow down a little bit. That we wouldn't maintain the pace that we were this year versus 2015, when you think about salary and benefits. When you look at some of the other costs of operations, I mean, occupancy, obviously, will go with people, but that should be pretty much contained. One of the places where we did spend more money this year was advertising and promotion. It was probably a little bit elevated compared to what would be a normal run rate for us because we were making a splash in New Jersey as we went in there as well as we were taking advantage, as we talked about, some of the changes in the marketplaces that we operate in that have been happening. So, I guess, absent other changes happening, our expectation would be that, that would come back down. Probably not all the way to where it was in prior years, because we are now a bigger organization with New Jersey, but below the place where we are today. And when we look at the other professional services expenses that are out there, our pace of IT investment I think won't get higher from where we are right now. We're looking at the additions we've made to the technology team as well as to outside help, that we think the run rate we're at is a good place, and we might actually slow it down a little bit, so that we're able to manage the change that we're introducing into the bank so that we can do things well. So, I guess, I don't see those dropping dramatically, but I don't see them going up from here. And then, obviously, the other wild card is legal, which is part of the professional services, and we will continue our work there as we get ready to go to trial, which has been extended until October of next year."

And I think the question of whether it's $3 billion or whether it's $5 billion is really a function of what we think we can invest it in the securities world. And for us, when we look at investing it in 2-year treasuries at 70 basis points or just keeping it at the Fed at 50, right now, we're kind of more inclined to leave it in the Fed. Now other components of that $12 billion include primarily 2 things. One is trust demand deposits. And when you look at those, either we or the customer that we are holding those on, on their behalf, we can either choose to put them in the Fed or you can put them in the money funds, which is what would've happened historically. I think as rates start to come back there, trust demand deposits will sit as much or more in the money funds as it will sit in the Fed. And either we'll do that on behalf of the customer or the customer will choose to do it themselves and then we won't get those dollars as payment. We'll get paid in fees in our global capital markets business. And then the other part of what's at the Fed is some escrow balances that come with the relationship we have with Bayview and the servicing that we do, and those are monthly P&I payments. So there's a floor that we see every month and that we'll look to put to work, but there are some part of that, those balances that grow throughout the month until the payments are made and then they drop back down. And we think the most prudent thing to do with those certainly right now is to just keep those at the Fed. So really, when you -- when we look at those balances, we're thinking about those 3 categories. And we're looking to try and optimize what we have to make sure that we're not putting funds at risk, but we're getting as good a return as we can on those dollars."

There's a couple of factors that are involved in the Hudson City deposits, and I'll do my best to give you some guidance on how to think about it. So in the fourth quarter, there's, I think, $2 billion to $2.5 billion that will mature and they're across a number of different term buckets. And what we've seen so far as we've started the repricing is that approximately 50% of the CDs are renewing and they're renewing typically at a lower rate. Some -- and that could come in 2 forms. It could be at a lower rate within the existing term or -- but we're also seeing is people shifting to shorter term just because of the interest rate environment we're in, I think the book is generally short for us. I think it is for folks in the industry because people are uncertain. So some of the dollars will reprice into CDs, like term or shorter term. Some of those CDs will actually change categories and will go into money market accounts or even NOW accounts, again, while people wait out the interest rate environment and then some of those are in trading [ph]. In total, we're retaining about 60% of the balances across all categories and about half are staying within time deposits of various maturities."

You can get stuff that happens at quarter end for various reasons. I would tend to look at the average. That normalizes out. Things that might show up 1 month, it might get participated out. So I think that's a better measure to use and the one that we would probably pay more attention to. I guess the only thing to remind everyone of is the fourth quarter, there always tends to be a little bit of a spike as our customers reach year-end and they're trying to get things done in a certain tax year, that's often a driver of activity to get deals done or loans closed. And we've historically seen a little bit of a spike at the end of the fourth quarter, so I would just pay attention to that, but it's usually late in the quarter. So from an average perspective, again, it might -- it won't necessarily drive income in the quarter, but it will give you a nice pop at the end of the period.

We're not seeing a ton of CapEx for growth and a bunch of the replacement cycle is gone. So, I guess, I would describe it and think about it as steady.

How quickly that turns will be obviously a function of whether we get a rate increase in December or not. But even absent that, we expect it to start to turn in the next couple of quarters. Part of the issue is, and I think this is pretty straightforward for everyone, is as the mortgages run off, the reason they're prepaying is because they tend to be right around 4% and those are fixed yields. Whereas the commercial loans that we're replacing them with in the short term with LIBOR, where they are being LIBOR based, are at yields that are kind of 3.50% to 3.60%. So that's part of what's driving that core compression. But as the mortgage balances become a little bit less of a factor in the balance sheet, that's why we see that bottoming out coming in the coming quarters and expect to happen in 2017 and see things go the other way."

Now that said, though impact of a rate -- the impact of a rate hike, sorry, on net interest margin I think will be pretty similar to what we saw last time. If it's 25 points, it won't be the whole thing that will show up in the margin. Obviously, deposit pricing, deposit price reactivity will impact that.

Not all customers are renewing in the same term, and the -- so the rates vary, obviously, depending on which term they're in. In general, those are lower than what they were before, but the customer can get a different rate, depending on the breadth of their relationship. So it's a little bit all over the board. There's not one rate per se that we're seeing those CDs go into."

We know it's broader than just the local market that the Internet banks are part of it, but for certain customer segments, that's not an option they choose to use. So we look at our pricing all the time and make sure that we feel good about where our pricing stands, vis-√†-vis, the competition as well as doing the right thing for our customers and doing the right thing for our balance sheet.

And it's our intention to manage that number so that we've got ourselves covered, but without giving away interest income that we could otherwise get if we were able to invest that in securities that paid better than holding cash at the Fed. When it comes to the escrow balances, there are minimums that we need to have to make sure that we don't ever have ourselves in a position where we can't make those payments on behalf of the people that we're covering from a servicing perspective. There, obviously, is a the cost to holding those, and we're cognizant of what that cost is, but that's also part of the pricing that we have with the people that we're doing that business. Trust demand would the same thing. I guess, I think it's a -- the trust demand balances I look at as primarily a function of the interest rate environment that we're in right now. That if we were in different part of the cycle, where rates were -- we'll see what happens if there's a 25-basis-point hike. But certainly another 50, and I think the level of trust demand deposits that we see us carrying will start to get real small real fast and we'd be down into the range of the 5-ish billion that we're holding for HQLA. And even that, we might start to haircut a little bit."

That would be primarily credit card and home equity lines of credit. What we're finding within the CD customer base, at least, is that it tends to skew a little bit older and, therefore, our ability to penetrate that with home equity loans and cards isn't the same as it would be if we're dealing with a slightly younger crowd. But, obviously, we've got those mortgages that we look at as well. And if we have someone that has a mortgage, those would be good candidates for, certainly, home equity lines of credit. So we're cognizant of that and we're working on it. But is that going to drive double-digit growth? I don't think so. I think what you're seeing in our home equity growth is not dissimilar to what you're seeing in the industry. And really, with 30-year rates and 15-year rates as low as they are, the average consumer is much more interested in doing a first than using a second. We'll only start to see second balances and demand start to increase as rates increase when people can't utilize the first lien market as their primary option. When you talk about auto loans, for us and I think the industry, that tends to generally work through the dealerships. We've been through -- we've been operating in New Jersey even prior to having Hudson City, and we have reps there that are working with dealers, dealerships and dealer groups to try and be in their set of options. But it's -- I don't think you would look at New Jersey, I certainly wouldn't, and say that's a big opportunity that will drive our indirect auto business growth beyond the rate that we've been seeing over the last few quarters."

I appreciate there's been a whole lot of moving parts over the last 12 months, but should we -- I mean, should we assume that the 25 basis points that we might get in December would add, all else being equal, 15 to 20 basis points to the margin by the fourth quarter of 2017?

So I think the 15 to 20, you start to see that work its way through the loan book, but should have been thinking about the whole part of the impact on the liability repricing as well. And I think when you net the 2 together and you look at what happened last time, you probably net more in the 6 to 10 range. And that you see the pop early on and then it comes down. Hopefully, it doesn't come down, when the reason for the range. Hopefully, it doesn't come down quite as much as it has this time because the -- as the LIBOR rate moves up, which you're giving up from the mortgages going into commercial loans isn't as big a gap as what it is today, given where rates are. And so that will affect it. And then, obviously, the other thing that will be part of the margin that's important to think about is in total how we fund the balance sheet, right? So we have some bank notes that are coming due next year that we'll issue. And depending on where the print is there, that will also impact the margin. So I guess, originally, as I was thinking about the question in my response, I was thinking more on simply the asset side. But I think 6 to 10 in total margin is probably a better space to be, which, again, I always look at what happened this past year, recognizing there was some noise in there, but that's probably a good guide."

So I think you hit the nail on the head that when the accounting for acquired certificates of deposit, the math is that if it's a 12-month CD and there's 2 months left, you basically market as a 2-month instrument and you think about the interest rate as that. So as those CDs that were in partial pay down, if you will, they were with less than their full maturity, the rate that we would see would be the marked rate. And then as they renew, you would go to the actual rate, and that's partly why you're seeing that increase in those time deposit accounts over the course of the quarters this year. We've talked before that the bulk of the book is less than a year, so we should be pretty close to the end of that accounting happening and start to see, more pronounced, the effect of the repricing that's happening. But also remind you that the repricing happens every month, right? So in the first month, you see 1/12 of it, right? And then the second month, you see 2/12 of it? So it takes awhile for that stuff to work its way through, and it's also a function of how big the balances are that are maturing in each of those 12s. And we started to work in the middle of August. So really, we've got 1/12 in the book so far in September, and that's why the numbers that you're quoting are accurate and why they're not that impressive. But you've got to start sometime in making those changes, and we're started down that path. And we think it's an important next step in the conversion we have of this thrift into a commercial bank."

As most of you have no doubt seen in this morning's press release, M&T's results for the third quarter reflect the initiatives we have under way to position the bank for future success. The merger with Hudson City Bancorp was completed almost a year ago, and the ongoing process of converting a thrift to a commercial bank continues. 
During the quarter, we continued to build out the New Jersey consumer bank, both by growing new households as well as taking steps to reprice the acquired deposit base. 
For the New Jersey Commercial Bank, loan balances for the year-to-date have grown at an annualized rate of over 20%, led by loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises. We're pleased to see that our community-focused approach to banking is starting to take root in the New Jersey marketplace. 
Customer migration, arising from the multiple mergers and acquisitions that have occurred within our footprint, also continues. We've been advertising and offering incentives to bring in new customers impacted by some of those changes in our markets. Customer growth in the third quarter was the highest we've seen in the past 8 quarters. 
We've also continued our program of investments in operational infrastructure and technology. As we previously signaled, the enhanced mtb.com website went live during the quarter. Other highlights for the quarter include an upgrade to our ATM network, to handle EMV-chip-equipped cards, and adding a feature to our payment services capability that enables our customers to send and receive same-day ACH transactions. 
The upgrade to our consumer mobile app is in final testing and we expect it to go live later this quarter. And finally, we took some actions to get ahead of the pending implementation of the so-called Volcker Rule contained within the Dodd-Frank Act by divesting some securities disallowed by the rule. I'll share some more details on each of these actions and how they impacted us in a few minutes.
However, before we proceed, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the recent passing of Richard King, our board member -- I'm sorry, a member of M&T's Board of Directors. 
Mr. King joined M&T's board in 2000, following our acquisition of Pennsylvania-based Keystone Financial. We valued his extensive experience in business and his deep ties to the communities in Pennsylvania. We'll miss his counsel and his friendship. 
Now let's turn to the numbers. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $2.10 for the third quarter of 2016, improved from $1.98 in the second quarter of 2016 and $1.93 in last year's third quarter. 
Net income for the quarter was $350 million, up 4% from $336 million in the linked quarter and up 25% from $280 million in the year-ago quarter. 
Included in GAAP results were after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $6 million or $0.03 per common share in the recent quarter compared with $7 million and $0.04 per common share in the second quarter. There were no merger-related expenses in the third quarter results, however, results for the second quarter included merger-related expenses amounting to $8 million after tax effect or $0.05 per common share.
Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting on its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of the amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions.
M&T's net operating income for the third quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related expenses from the relevant periods, was $356 million compared with $351 million in the linked quarter and $283 million in last year's third quarter.
Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $2.13 in the recent quarter, improved from $2.07 in this year's second quarter and $1.95 in the year-ago quarter.
On a GAAP basis, M&T's third quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.12% and an annualized rate of return on average common equity of 8.68%. This compares to 1.09% and 8.38%, respectively, in the previous quarter.
Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.18% and 12.77% in the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.18% and 12.68% in the second quarter of 2016.
In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.
Included in both GAAP and net operating results were $28 million of net pretax securities gains. This equates to $17 million after-tax effect or $0.11 per common share. The gains pertain to a variety of TruPS CDOs that M&T obtained during our acquisition of other banks over the past number of years, primarily through the merger with Provident Bankshares in 2009. 
All were marked to fair value through acquisition accounting, and under Section 6.19 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly known as the Volcker Rule, divestiture of most of these securities would otherwise have been required prior to July 21, 2017. 
Turning to the balanced sheet and income statement. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $865 million in the third quarter of 2016, down $5 million from the linked quarter. The net interest margin declined to 3.05%, down 8 basis points from 3.13% in the linked quarter. 
During the quarter, we had another increase in average trust deposits, which we placed at the Fed. Average interest-bearing deposits with banks were $9.7 billion during the past quarter compared to $8.7 billion in the second quarter. Those deposits are modestly additive to net interest income, but we estimate they diluted net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points during the quarter. 
Also, with the acquisition of the Hudson City mortgage loans, we have a higher proportion of assets with a 30 over 360-day pricing basis on our balance sheet than we had previously. That has the impact of diminishing the reported margin in a 92-day quarter, such as the one that just ended -- sorry, such as the one that just ended. We estimate the impact on the margin was about 2 basis points. 
Several other items included in net interest income, including prepayment fees and interest on nonaccrual loans, which individually aren't large, in the aggregate reduced the margin by approximately 1 basis point. What we would consider to be core margin pressure accounted for about 3 basis points of the decline.
As we discussed earlier in the third quarter, we began to take action to reprice the Hudson City deposit base to be more in line with the market and we began those efforts in mid-August. This benefits the margin immediately but will take another few quarters for the full impact to be realized as time deposits reach their state of maturity. Average loans increased by about 3% on an annualized basis or $577 million compared to the linked quarter.
Looking at the loans by category. On an average basis compared with the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans were roughly flat, with the usual seasonal decline in auto floor plan loans offset by about a 4% annualized growth and other C&I loans. 
Commercial real estate loans increased by about $1.1 billion or 15% annualized. Residential mortgage loans declined at a 13% annualized rate, and consumer loans grew at an annualized 8%, with growth in indirect loans, including indirect auto loans being offset by a decline in home equity lines of credit.
Regionally, we've seen the highest growth rate in commercial loans in New Jersey coming off what is admittedly a low base. Growth in the adjacent New York City, Tarrytown, Philadelphia markets, continues to be strong as well. Only Pennsylvania stood out as having a below-average growth this quarter.
Average core consumer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office and CDs over $250,000, increased in an annualized rate of 8% from the second quarter, reflecting higher levels of trust and savings deposits, partially offset by lower levels of time deposits.
Turning to noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $491 million in the third quarter, up from $448 million in the prior quarter. Excluding securities gains from both periods, noninterest revenues grew 3% from the linked quarter. Mortgage banking revenues were $104 million in the recent quarter, $14 million higher than in the linked quarter. Total residential banking revenues, including origination and servicing activities, were $67 million compared with $65 million in the prior quarter. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $836 million in the quarter, down about 3% compared to the second quarter, but with a higher gain on sale margin.
Our commercial mortgage banking operation had another strong quarter. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were $37 million compared with $24 million in the second quarter, reflecting strong origination activity. Trust income was $119 million in the recent quarter compared to $120 million in the previous quarter.
Recall that in the second quarter's results, included were $3 million of seasonal tax preparation fees that did not recur in the third quarter. New business generation remains particularly strong on the institutional side of our business.
Service charges on deposit accounts were $108 million, improved from $104 million in the second quarter, reflecting seasonal strength as well as the benefit from new customers.
Turning to expenses. Operating expenses for the third quarter, which exclude merger-related expenses and the amortization of intangible assets, were $743 million compared with $726 million in the prior quarter.
The FDIC assessment increased by $6 million to $28 million as the assessment surcharge on banks over $10 billion in size came into effect. Other costs of operations increased by $10 million on an operating basis compared to the second quarter. That increase reflects higher amortizing expenses to capitalize on the competitive changes occurring within our markets as well as higher professional services, which include legal.
The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization and any merger-related expenses from the numerator and securities gains from the denominator, was 55.9% in the recent quarter compared to 55.1% in the previous quarter. The comparable figure was 57.1% in last year's third quarter.
Next, let's turn to credit. Our credit quality remains stable, with continued low levels of nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs. Nonaccrual loans declined by $11 million to $837 million at September 30, and the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans was 93 basis points, improved from 96 basis points at the end of the second quarter. 
Net charge-offs for the third quarter were $41 million compared to $24 million in the second quarter. Reflected in the recent quarter's charge-offs was $12 million associated with a commercial loan to a commercial maintenance services provider. Recall that the second quarter's results included a sizable $7 million recovery on a previously charged-off commercial loan. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 19 basis points for the third quarter, in line with what we've seen on average over the past 2 years.
The provision for credit losses was $47 million in the recent quarter, exceeding net charge-offs by $6 million, reflecting overall loan growth as well as the ongoing shift to a higher proportion of commercial loans to total loans as the Hudson City mortgage portfolio pays down. 
The allowance for credit losses was $976 million at the end of September. The ratio of this allowance to total loans was 1.09%, little change from the 1.10% at the end of the second quarter.
Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest, excluding acquired loans that had been marked to a fair value discounted acquisition, were $317 million at the end of the recent quarter. And of those loans, $282 million or 89% are guaranteed by government-related entities.
Turning to capital. M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio under the current transitional Basel III capital rules was an estimated 10.76% compared to 11.01% at the end of the second quarter. This reflects earnings retention, less $350 million of share repurchases during the quarter, $110 million in dividends paid during the quarter as well as the impact of net asset growth.
Turning to the outlook. The trends in the third quarter were largely consistent with what we've seen over the course of 2016. At this point, our outlook for the remainder of the year remains little changed. We expect runoff of the mortgage loan portfolio to continue, but be more than offset by growth in commercial and other consumer loans. We expect the normal seasonal rebound in auto floor plan balances. 
The pipeline of customer activity in other parts of the C&I portfolio remains strong. We expect continued pressure in the core net interest margin in the area of 2 to 3 basis points. But as we saw this quarter, changes in the level of trust deposits, the overall cost of interest-bearing deposits and other items can result in some volatility in the printed margin. In any case, we expect growth in net interest income to continue to be challenged, while we transition our New Jersey operations to a commercial banking profile amidst the ongoing difficult interest rate environment. 
On expenses, our outlook for spending in the second half of 2016 is that it will approximate spending in the first half. Our outlook for credit is little changed over the short term. We're still not seeing any significant pressures on credit, either in nonaccrual loans or in charge-offs.
And we remain on track with our capital plan, with the pace of repurchases a little more weighted toward the second half of 2016 and a little less in the first half of 2017. As is our normal practice, we'll share our thoughts on the outlook for 2017 in the July earnings conference call. 
Of course, as you are aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.
At this point, we'll open up the call to questions, before which, Maria will briefly review the instructions."

If we think about the basics in the 2 to 3 basis points, that's what we've been talking about all year. And that is the combination of the runoff in the mortgage portfolio, how quickly we price the CD book as well as just as older loans that are at a higher margin payoff and the newer ones that are at a slightly lower margin become a bigger part of the portfolio, you're seeing that compression. If you look at the 2 basis points that happened because of the trust demand deposits, it's really literally that extra $1 billion that was being kept at the Fed. So those billion dollars carry a very low margin. We're not receiving much on it, but we're not pay much on them. Those are just a different form of payment for our global capital markets business. And then the other piece was obviously the mortgage portfolio being a bigger chunk of our balances and the pricing convention there being 30 over 360. That when you have a quarter like we did, the interest paid by the customer doesn't change, but the basis over which you calculate the effective rate or the margin drops. So I guess we kind of look at that as what I would call noise. How much cash at the Fed and trust demand deposits will be in the next quarter. I guess it's our anticipation that they will go down, but that's something that is subject to move quarter-to-quarter based on the activity we have in that business."

So I guess if you look at our expenses and how they've gone over the course of the year and you look at where some of the investments have happened, if you look at our salaries and benefits line and where we've been over the course of the year and the course of the last year, we've added some people. We've invested in some businesses in growing global capital markets business. We've hired a couple of teams over the course of the year, and we're investing, as you noted, in New Jersey. We think that we'll continue to make investments, as appropriate, but probably the pace will slow down a little bit. That we wouldn't maintain the pace that we were this year versus 2015, when you think about salary and benefits. When you look at some of the other costs of operations, I mean, occupancy, obviously, will go with people, but that should be pretty much contained. One of the places where we did spend more money this year was advertising and promotion. It was probably a little bit elevated compared to what would be a normal run rate for us because we were making a splash in New Jersey as we went in there as well as we were taking advantage, as we talked about, some of the changes in the marketplaces that we operate in that have been happening. So, I guess, absent other changes happening, our expectation would be that, that would come back down. Probably not all the way to where it was in prior years, because we are now a bigger organization with New Jersey, but below the place where we are today. And when we look at the other professional services expenses that are out there, our pace of IT investment I think won't get higher from where we are right now. We're looking at the additions we've made to the technology team as well as to outside help, that we think the run rate we're at is a good place, and we might actually slow it down a little bit, so that we're able to manage the change that we're introducing into the bank so that we can do things well. So, I guess, I don't see those dropping dramatically, but I don't see them going up from here. And then, obviously, the other wild card is legal, which is part of the professional services, and we will continue our work there as we get ready to go to trial, which has been extended until October of next year."

So you noted something that we've been paying attention to and had a lot of discussion on around here over the last little while. There's a bunch of components within that $12 billion. We certainly don't need $12 billion to run the bank, that's for sure. When we look at what we need for HQLA and for the LCR, that number is maybe between $3 billion and $5 billion. And I think the question of whether it's $3 billion or whether it's $5 billion is really a function of what we think we can invest it in the securities world. And for us, when we look at investing it in 2-year treasuries at 70 basis points or just keeping it at the Fed at 50, right now, we're kind of more inclined to leave it in the Fed. Now other components of that $12 billion include primarily 2 things. One is trust demand deposits. And when you look at those, either we or the customer that we are holding those on, on their behalf, we can either choose to put them in the Fed or you can put them in the money funds, which is what would've happened historically. I think as rates start to come back there, trust demand deposits will sit as much or more in the money funds as it will sit in the Fed. And either we'll do that on behalf of the customer or the customer will choose to do it themselves and then we won't get those dollars as payment. We'll get paid in fees in our global capital markets business. And then the other part of what's at the Fed is some escrow balances that come with the relationship we have with Bayview and the servicing that we do, and those are monthly P&I payments. So there's a floor that we see every month and that we'll look to put to work, but there are some part of that, those balances that grow throughout the month until the payments are made and then they drop back down. And we think the most prudent thing to do with those certainly right now is to just keep those at the Fed. So really, when you -- when we look at those balances, we're thinking about those 3 categories. And we're looking to try and optimize what we have to make sure that we're not putting funds at risk, but we're getting as good a return as we can on those dollars."

There's a couple of factors that are involved in the Hudson City deposits, and I'll do my best to give you some guidance on how to think about it. So in the fourth quarter, there's, I think, $2 billion to $2.5 billion that will mature and they're across a number of different term buckets. And what we've seen so far as we've started the repricing is that approximately 50% of the CDs are renewing and they're renewing typically at a lower rate. Some -- and that could come in 2 forms. It could be at a lower rate within the existing term or -- but we're also seeing is people shifting to shorter term just because of the interest rate environment we're in, I think the book is generally short for us. I think it is for folks in the industry because people are uncertain. So some of the dollars will reprice into CDs, like term or shorter term. Some of those CDs will actually change categories and will go into money market accounts or even NOW accounts, again, while people wait out the interest rate environment and then some of those are in trading [ph].

You can get stuff that happens at quarter end for various reasons. I would tend to look at the average. That normalizes out. Things that might show up 1 month, it might get participated out. So I think that's a better measure to use and the one that we would probably pay more attention to. I guess the only thing to remind everyone of is the fourth quarter, there always tends to be a little bit of a spike as our customers reach year-end and they're trying to get things done in a certain tax year, that's often a driver of activity to get deals done or loans closed. And we've historically seen a little bit of a spike at the end of the fourth quarter, so I would just pay attention to that, but it's usually late in the quarter. So from an average perspective, again, it might -- it won't necessarily drive income in the quarter, but it will give you a nice pop at the end of the period. So a long-winded way of saying I tend to focus on the averages."

And the more global trend that we've seen this year and have for the last couple of years is companies of all sizes are sitting more on cash, and they're holding that cash and they're investing, but they're still reticent to invest beyond maintaining where they are. We're not seeing a ton of CapEx for growth and a bunch of the replacement cycle is gone. So, I guess, I would describe it and think about it as steady. And the growth that we had in the quarter, I think is fairly consistent in the ex floor plan space, consistent with kind of where we've been in the prior quarters.

How quickly that turns will be obviously a function of whether we get a rate increase in December or not. But even absent that, we expect it to start to turn in the next couple of quarters. Part of the issue is, and I think this is pretty straightforward for everyone, is as the mortgages run off, the reason they're prepaying is because they tend to be right around 4% and those are fixed yields. Whereas the commercial loans that we're replacing them with in the short term with LIBOR, where they are being LIBOR based, are at yields that are kind of 3.50% to 3.60%. So that's part of what's driving that core compression. But as the mortgage balances become a little bit less of a factor in the balance sheet, that's why we see that bottoming out coming in the coming quarters and expect to happen in 2017 and see things go the other way."

So I think the best comparison for you will be first quarter '16 to first quarter '17. Now that said, though impact of a rate -- the impact of a rate hike, sorry, on net interest margin I think will be pretty similar to what we saw last time. If it's 25 points, it won't be the whole thing that will show up in the margin. Obviously, deposit pricing, deposit price reactivity will impact that. But we're not sure that it will be that much this time as well. But I think a good guideline would be to look at what we -- what happened last time.

And it's our intention to manage that number so that we've got ourselves covered, but without giving away interest income that we could otherwise get if we were able to invest that in securities that paid better than holding cash at the Fed.

There, obviously, is a the cost to holding those, and we're cognizant of what that cost is, but that's also part of the pricing that we have with the people that we're doing that business. Trust demand would be the same thing. I guess, I think it's a -- the trust demand balances I look at as primarily a function of the interest rate environment that we're in right now. That if we were in different part of the cycle, where rates were -- we'll see what happens if there's a 25-basis-point hike.

That would be primarily credit card and home equity lines of credit. What we're finding within the CD customer base, at least, is that it tends to skew a little bit older and, therefore, our ability to penetrate that with home equity loans and cards isn't the same as it would be if we're dealing with a slightly younger crowd. But, obviously, we've got those mortgages that we look at as well. And if we have someone that has a mortgage, those would be good candidates for, certainly, home equity lines of credit. So we're cognizant of that and we're working on it. But is that going to drive double-digit growth? I don't think so. I think what you're seeing in our home equity growth is not dissimilar to what you're seeing in the industry. And really, with 30-year rates and 15-year rates as low as they are, the average consumer is much more interested in doing a first than using a second. We'll only start to see second balances and demand start to increase as rates increase when people can't utilize the first lien market as their primary option. When you talk about auto loans, for us and I think the industry, that tends to generally work through the dealerships. We've been through -- we've been operating in New Jersey even prior to having Hudson City, and we have reps there that are working with dealers, dealerships and dealer groups to try and be in their set of options. But it's -- I don't think you would look at New Jersey, I certainly wouldn't, and say that's a big opportunity that will drive our indirect auto business growth beyond the rate that we've been seeing over the last few quarters."

Hopefully, it doesn't come down, when the reason for the range. Hopefully, it doesn't come down quite as much as it has this time because the -- as the LIBOR rate moves up, which you're giving up from the mortgages going into commercial loans isn't as big a gap as what it is today, given where rates are. And so that will affect it. And then, obviously, the other thing that will be part of the margin that's important to think about is in total how we fund the balance sheet, right? So we have some bank notes that are coming due next year that we'll issue. And depending on where the print is there, that will also impact the margin. So I guess, originally, as I was thinking about the question in my response, I was thinking more on simply the asset side. But I think 6 to 10 in total margin is probably a better space to be, which, again, I always look at what happened this past year, recognizing there was some noise in there, but that's probably a good guide."

So I think you hit the nail on the head that when the accounting for acquired certificates of deposit, the math is that if it's a 12-month CD and there's 2 months left, you basically market as a 2-month instrument and you think about the interest rate as that. So as those CDs that were in partial pay down, if you will, they were with less than their full maturity, the rate that we would see would be the marked rate. And then as they renew, you would go to the actual rate, and that's partly why you're seeing that increase in those time deposit accounts over the course of the quarters this year. We've talked before that the bulk of the book is less than a year, so we should be pretty close to the end of that accounting happening and start to see, more pronounced, the effect of the repricing that's happening. But also remind you that the repricing happens every month, right? So in the first month, you see 1/12 of it, right? And then the second month, you see 2/12 of it? So it takes awhile for that stuff to work its way through, and it's also a function of how big the balances are that are maturing in each of those 12s. And we started to work in the middle of August. So really, we've got 1/12 in the book so far in September, and that's why the numbers that you're quoting are accurate and why they're not that impressive. But you've got to start sometime in making those changes, and we're started down that path. And we think it's an important next step in the conversion we have of this thrift into a commercial bank."

As most of you have no doubt seen in this morning's press release, M&T's results for the third quarter reflect the initiatives we have under way to position the bank for future success. The merger with Hudson City Bancorp was completed almost a year ago, and the ongoing process of converting a thrift to a commercial bank continues. 
During the quarter, we continued to build out the New Jersey consumer bank, both by growing new households as well as taking steps to reprice the acquired deposit base. 
For the New Jersey Commercial Bank, loan balances for the year-to-date have grown at an annualized rate of over 20%, led by loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises. We're pleased to see that our community-focused approach to banking is starting to take root in the New Jersey marketplace. 
Customer migration arising from the multiple mergers and acquisitions that have occurred within our footprint also continues. We've been advertising and offering incentives to bring in new customers impacted by some of those changes in our markets. Customer growth in the third quarter was the highest we've seen in the past 8 quarters. 
We've also continued our program of investments in operational infrastructure and technology. As we previously signaled, the enhanced mtb.com website went live during the quarter. Other highlights for the quarter include an upgrade to our ATM network, to handle EMV-chip-equipped card, and adding a feature to our payment services capability that enables our customers to send and receive same-day ACH transactions. 
The upgrade to our consumer mobile app is in final testing and we expect it to go live later this quarter. And finally, we took some actions to get ahead of the pending implementation of the so-called Volcker Rule contained within the Dodd-Frank Act by divesting some securities disallowed by the rule. I'll share some more details on each of these actions and how they impacted us in a few minutes.
However, before we proceed, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the recent passing of Richard King, our board member -- I'm sorry, a member of M&T's Board of Directors. 
Mr. King joined M&T's board in 2000, following our acquisition of Pennsylvania-based Keystone Financial. We valued his extensive experience in business and his deep ties to the communities in Pennsylvania. We'll miss his counsel and his friendship. 
Now let's turn to the numbers. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $2.10 for the third quarter of 2016, improved from $1.98 in the second quarter of 2016 and $1.93 in last year's third quarter. 
Net income for the quarter was $350 million, up 4% from $336 million in the linked quarter and up 25% from $280 million in the year-ago quarter. 
Included in GAAP results were after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $6 million or $0.03 per common share in the recent quarter compared with $7 million and $0.04 per common share in the second quarter. There were no merger-related expenses in the third quarter results, however, results for the second quarter included merger-related expenses amounting to $8 million after tax effect or $0.05 per common share.
Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting on its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of the amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions.
M&T's net operating income for the third quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related expenses from the relevant periods, was $356 million compared with $351 million in the linked quarter and $283 million in last year's third quarter.
Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $2.13 in the recent quarter, improved from $2.07 in this year's second quarter and $1.95 in the year-ago quarter.
On a GAAP basis, M&T's third quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.12% and an annualized rate of return on average common equity of 8.68%. This compares to 1.09% and 8.38%, respectively, in the previous quarter.
Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.18% and 12.77% in the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.18% and 12.68% in the second quarter of 2016.
In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.
Included in both GAAP and net operating results were $28 million of net pretax securities gains. This equates to $17 million after-tax effect or $0.11 per common share. The gains pertain to a variety of TruPS CDOs that M&T obtained during our acquisition of other banks over the past number of years, primarily through the merger with Provident Bankshares in 2009. 
All were marked to fair value through acquisition accounting, and under Section 6.19 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly known as the Volcker Rule, divestiture of most of these securities would otherwise have been required prior to July 21, 2017. 
Turning to the balanced sheet and income statement. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $865 million in the third quarter of 2016, down $5 million from the linked quarter. The net interest margin declined to 3.05%, down 8 basis points from 3.13% in the linked quarter. 
During the quarter, we had another increase in average trust deposits, which we placed at the Fed. Average interest-bearing deposits with banks were $9.7 billion during the past quarter compared to $8.7 billion in the second quarter. Those deposits are modestly additive to net interest income, but we estimate they diluted net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points during the quarter. 
Also, with the acquisition of the Hudson City mortgage loans, we have a higher proportion of assets with a 30 over 360-day pricing basis on our balance sheet than we had previously. That has the impact of diminishing the reported margin in a 92-day quarter, such as the one that just ended -- sorry, such as the one that just ended. We estimate the impact on the margin was about 2 basis points. 
Several other items included in net interest income, including prepayment fees and interest on nonaccrual loans, which individually aren't large, in the aggregate reduced the margin by approximately 1 basis point. What we would consider to be core margin pressure accounted for about 3 basis points of the decline.
As we discussed earlier in the third quarter, we began to take action to reprice the Hudson City deposit base to be more in line with the market and we began those efforts in mid-August. This benefits the margin immediately but will take another few quarters for the full impact to be realized as time deposits reach their state of maturity. Average loans increased by about 3% on an annualized basis or $577 million compared to the linked quarter.
Looking at the loans by category. On an average basis compared with the linked quarter, commercial and industrial loans were roughly flat with the usual seasonal decline in auto floor plan loans offset by about a 4% annualized growth and other C&I loans. 
Commercial real estate loans increased by about $1.1 billion or 15% annualized. Residential mortgage loans declined at a 13% annualized rate, and consumer loans grew at an annualized 8%, with growth in indirect loans, including indirect auto loans being offset by a decline in home equity lines of credit.
Regionally, we've seen the highest growth rate in commercial loans in New Jersey coming off what is admittedly a low base. Growth in the adjacent New York City, Tarrytown, Philadelphia markets, continues to be strong as well. Only Pennsylvania stood out as having a below-average growth this quarter.
Average core consumer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office and CDs over $250,000, increased in an annualized rate of 8% from the second quarter, reflecting higher levels of trust and savings deposits, partially offset by lower levels of time deposits.
Turning to noninterest income. Noninterest income totaled $491 million in the third quarter, up from $448 million in the prior quarter. Excluding securities gains from both periods, noninterest revenues grew 3% from the linked quarter. Mortgage banking revenues were $104 million in the recent quarter, $14 million higher than in the linked quarter. Total residential banking revenues, including origination and servicing activities, were $67 million compared with $65 million in the prior quarter. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $836 million in the quarter, down about 3% compared to the second quarter, but with a higher gain on sale margin.
Our commercial mortgage banking operation had another strong quarter. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were $37 million compared with $24 million in the second quarter, reflecting strong origination activity. Trust income was $119 million in the recent quarter compared to $120 million in the previous quarter.
Recall that in the second quarter's results, included were $3 million of seasonal tax preparation fees that did not recur in the third quarter. New business generation remains particularly strong on the institutional side of our business.
Service charges on deposit accounts were $108 million, improved from $104 million in the second quarter, reflecting seasonal strength as well as the benefit from new customers.
Turning to expenses. Operating expenses for the third quarter, which exclude merger-related expenses and the amortization of intangible assets, were $743 million compared with $726 million in the prior quarter.
The FDIC assessment increased by $6 million to $28 million as the assessment surcharge on banks over $10 billion in size came into effect. Other costs of operations increased by $10 million on an operating basis compared to the second quarter. That increase reflects higher amortizing expenses to capitalize on the competitive changes occurring within our markets as well as higher professional services, which include legal.
The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization and any merger-related expenses from the numerator and securities gains from the denominator, was 55.9% in the recent quarter compared to 55.1% in the previous quarter. The comparable figure was 57.1% in last year's third quarter.
Next, let's turn to credit. Our credit quality remains stable, with continued low levels of nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs. Nonaccrual loans declined by $11 million to $837 million at September 30, and the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans was 93 basis points, improved from 96 basis points at the end of the second quarter. 
Net charge-offs for the third quarter were $41 million compared to $24 million in the second quarter. Reflected in the recent quarter's charge-offs was $12 million associated with a commercial loan to a commercial maintenance services provider. Recall that the second quarter's results included a sizable $7 million recovery on a previously charged-off commercial loan. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 19 basis points for the third quarter, in line with what we've seen on average over the past 2 years.
The provision for credit losses was $47 million in the recent quarter, exceeding net charge-offs by $6 million, reflecting overall loan growth as well as the ongoing shift to a higher proportion of commercial loans to total loans as the Hudson City mortgage portfolio pays down. 
The allowance for credit losses was $976 million at the end of September. The ratio of this allowance to total loans was 1.09%, little change from the 1.10% at the end of the second quarter.
Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest, excluding acquired loans that had been marked to a fair value discounted acquisition, were $317 million at the end of the recent quarter. And of those loans, $282 million or 89% are guaranteed by government-related entities.
Turning to capital. M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio under the current transitional Basel III capital rules was an estimated 10.76% compared to 11.01% at the end of the second quarter. This reflects earnings retention, less $350 million of share repurchases during the quarter, $110 million in dividends paid during the quarter as well as the impact of net asset growth.
Turning to the outlook. The trends in the third quarter were largely consistent with what we've seen over the course of 2016. At this point, our outlook for the remainder of the year remains little changed. We expect runoff of the mortgage loan portfolio to continue, but be more than offset by growth in commercial and other consumer loans. We expect the normal seasonal rebound in auto floor plan balances. 
The pipeline of customer activity in other parts of the C&I portfolio remains strong. We expect continued pressure in the core net interest margin in the area of 2 to 3 basis points. But as we saw this quarter, changes in the level of trust deposits, the overall cost of interest-bearing deposits and other items can result in some volatility in the printed margin. In any case, we expect growth in net interest income to continue to be challenged, while we transition our New Jersey operations to a commercial banking profile amidst the ongoing difficult interest rate environment. 
On expenses, our outlook for spending in the second half of 2016 is that it will approximate spending in the first half. Our outlook for credit is little changed over the short term. We're still not seeing any significant pressures on credit, either in nonaccrual loans or in charge-offs.
And we remain on track with our capital plan with the pace of repurchases a little more weighted toward the second half of 2016 and a little less in the first half of 2017. As is our normal practice, we'll share our thoughts on the outlook for 2017 in the July earnings conference call. 
Of course, as you are aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.
At this point, we'll open up the call to questions, before which, Maria will briefly review the instructions."

If we think about the basics in the 2 to 3 basis points, that's what we've been talking about all year. And that is the combination of the runoff in the mortgage portfolio, how quickly we price the CD book as well as just as older loans that are at a higher margin payoff and the newer ones that are at a slightly lower margin become a bigger part of the portfolio, you're seeing that compression. If you look at the 2 basis points that happened because of the trust demand deposits, it's really literally that extra $1 billion that was being kept at the Fed. So those billion dollars carry a very low margin. We're not receiving much on it, but we're not pay much on them. Those are just a different form of payment for our global capital markets business. And then the other piece was obviously the mortgage portfolio being a bigger chunk of our balances and the pricing convention there being 30 over 360. That when you have a quarter like we did, the interest paid by the customer doesn't change, but the basis over which you calculate the effective rate or the margin drops. So I guess we kind of look at that as what I would call noise. How much cash at the Fed and trust demand deposits will be in the next quarter. I guess it's our anticipation that they will go down, but that's something that is subject to move quarter-to-quarter based on the activity we have in that business."

So I guess if you look at our expenses and how they've gone over the course of the year and you look at where some of the investments have happened, if you look at our salaries and benefits line and where we've been over the course of the year and the course of the last year, we've added some people. We've invested in some businesses in growing global capital markets business. We've hired a couple of teams over the course of the year, and we're investing, as you noted, in New Jersey. We think that we'll continue to make investments as appropriate, but probably the pace will slow down a little bit. That we wouldn't maintain the pace that we were this year versus 2015 when you think about salary and benefits. When you look at some of the other costs of operations, I mean, occupancy, obviously, will go with people, but that should be pretty much contained. One of the places where we did spend more money this year was advertising and promotion. It was probably a little bit elevated compared to what would be a normal run rate for us because we were making a splash in New Jersey as we went in there as well as we were taking advantage as we talked about some of the changes in the marketplaces that we operate in that have been happening. So, I guess, absent other changes happening, our expectation would be that, that would come back down. Probably not all the way to where it was in prior years because we are now a bigger organization with New Jersey, but below the place where we are today. And when we look at the other professional services expenses that are out there, our pace of IT investment I think won't get higher from where we are right now. We're looking at the additions we've made to the technology team as well as to outside help, that we think the run rate we're at is a good place, and we might actually slow it down a little bit, so that we're able to manage the change that we're introducing into the bank so that we can do things well.

So you noted something that we've been paying attention to and had a lot of discussion on around here over the last little while. There's a bunch of components within that $12 billion. We certainly don't need $12 billion to run the bank, that's for sure. When we look at what we need for HQLA and for the LCR, that number is maybe between $3 billion and $5 billion. And I think the question of whether it's $3 billion or whether it's $5 billion is really a function of what we think we can invest it in the securities world. And for us, when we look at investing it in 2-year treasuries at 70 basis points or just keeping it at the Fed at 50, right now, we're kind of more inclined to leave it in the Fed. Now other components of that $12 billion include primarily 2 things. One is trust demand deposits. And when you look at those, either we or the customer that we are holding those on, on their behalf, we can either choose to put them in the Fed or you can put them in the money funds, which is what would've happened historically. I think as rates start to come back there, trust demand deposits will sit as much or more in the money funds as it will sit in the Fed. And either we'll do that on behalf of the customer or the customer will choose to do it themselves and then we won't get those dollars as payment. We'll get paid in fees in our global capital markets business. And then the other part of what's at the Fed is some escrow balances that come with the relationship we have with Bayview and the servicing that we do, and those are monthly P&I payments. So there's a floor that we see every month and that we'll look to put to work, but there are some part of that, those balances that grow throughout the month until the payments are made and then they drop back down. And we think the most prudent thing to do with those certainly right now is to just keep those at the Fed. So really, when you -- when we look at those balances, we're thinking about those 3 categories. And we're looking to try and optimize what we have to make sure that we're not putting funds at risk, but we're getting as good a return as we can on those dollars."

There's a couple of factors that are involved in the Hudson City deposits, and I'll do my best to give you some guidance on how to think about it. So in the fourth quarter, there's, I think, $2 billion to $2.5 billion that will mature and they're across a number of different term buckets. And what we've seen so far as we've started the repricing is that approximately 50% of the CDs are renewing and they're renewing typically at a lower rate. Some -- and that could come in 2 forms. It could be at a lower rate within the existing term or -- but we're also seeing is people shifting to shorter term just because of the interest rate environment we're in, I think the book is generally short for us. I think it is for folks in the industry because people are uncertain. So some of the dollars will reprice into CDs, like term or shorter term. Some of those CDs will actually change categories and will go into money market accounts or even NOW accounts, again, while people wait out the interest rate environment and then some of those are in trading [ph].

You can get stuff that happens at quarter end for various reasons. I would tend to look at the average. That normalizes out. Things that might show up 1 month, it might get participated out. So I think that's a better measure to use and the one that we would probably pay more attention to. I guess the only thing to remind everyone of is the fourth quarter, there always tends to be a little bit of a spike as our customers reach year-end and they're trying to get things done in a certain tax year, that's often a driver of activity to get deals done or loans closed. And we've historically seen a little bit of a spike at the end of the fourth quarter, so I would just pay attention to that, but it's usually late in the quarter. So from an average perspective, again, it might -- it won't necessarily drive income in the quarter, but it will give you a nice pop at the end of the period.

How quickly that turns will be obviously a function of whether we get a rate increase in December or not. But even absent that, we expect it to start to turn in the next couple of quarters. Part of the issue is, and I think this is pretty straightforward for everyone, is as the mortgages run off, the reason they're prepaying is because they tend to be right around 4% and those are fixed yields. Whereas the commercial loans that we're replacing them with in the short term with LIBOR, where they are being LIBOR based, are at yields that are kind of 3.50% to 3.60%. So that's part of what's driving that core compression. But as the mortgage balances become a little bit less of a factor in the balance sheet, that's why we see that bottoming out coming in the coming quarters and expect to happen in 2017 and see things go the other way."

Now that said, though impact of a rate -- the impact of a rate hike, sorry, on net interest margin I think will be pretty similar to what we saw last time. If it's 25 points, it won't be the whole thing that will show up in the margin. Obviously, deposit pricing, deposit price reactivity will impact that. But we're not sure that it will be that much this time as well. But I think a good guideline would be to look at what we -- what happened last time.

I think when we're dealing with customers who are single-service CD customers, oftentimes there's a better option for them. We're a relationship bank and our best pricing is for our best customers, and those have more fulsome relationship with us.

We know it's broader than just the local market that the Internet banks are part of it, but for certain customer segments, that's not an option they choose to use. So we look at our pricing all the time and make sure that we feel good about where our pricing stands, vis-√†-vis, the competition as well as doing the right thing for our customers and doing the right thing for our balance sheet.

And it's our intention to manage that number so that we've got ourselves covered, but without giving away interest income that we could otherwise get if we were able to invest that in securities that paid better than holding cash at the Fed. When it comes to the escrow balances, there are minimums that we need to have to make sure that we don't ever have ourselves in a position where we can't make those payments on behalf of the people that we're covering from a servicing perspective. There, obviously, is a the cost to holding those, and we're cognizant of what that cost is, but that's also part of the pricing that we have with the people that we're doing that business. Trust demand would be the same thing. I guess, I think it's a -- the trust demand balances I look at as primarily a function of the interest rate environment that we're in right now. That if we were in different part of the cycle, where rates were -- we'll see what happens if there's a 25-basis-point hike. But certainly another 50, and I think the level of trust demand deposits that we see us carrying will start to get real small real fast and we'd be down into the range of the 5-ish billion that we're holding for HQLA. And even that, we might start to haircut a little bit."

That would be primarily credit card and home equity lines of credit. What we're finding within the CD customer base, at least, is that it tends to skew a little bit older and, therefore, our ability to penetrate that with home equity loans and cards isn't the same as it would be if we're dealing with a slightly younger crowd. But, obviously, we've got those mortgages that we look at as well. And if we have someone that has a mortgage, those would be good candidates for, certainly, home equity lines of credit. So we're cognizant of that and we're working on it. But is that going to drive double-digit growth? I don't think so. I think what you're seeing in our home equity growth is not dissimilar to what you're seeing in the industry. And really, with 30-year rates and 15-year rates as low as they are, the average consumer is much more interested in doing a first than using a second. We'll only start to see second balances and demand start to increase as rates increase when people can't utilize the first lien market as their primary option. When you talk about auto loans, for us and I think the industry, that tends to generally work through the dealerships. We've been through -- we've been operating in New Jersey even prior to having Hudson City, and we have reps there that are working with dealers, dealerships and dealer groups to try and be in their set of options. But it's -- I don't think you would look at New Jersey, I certainly wouldn't, and say that's a big opportunity that will drive our indirect auto business growth beyond the rate that we've been seeing over the last few quarters."

I appreciate there's been a whole lot of moving parts over the last 12 months, but should we -- I mean, should we assume that the 25 basis points that we might get in December would add, all else being equal, 15 to 20 basis points to the margin by the fourth quarter of 2017?

So I think the 15 to 20, you start to see that work its way through the loan book, but should have been thinking about the whole part of the impact on the liability repricing as well. And I think when you net the 2 together and you look at what happened last time, you probably net more in the 6 to 10 range. And that you see the pop early on and then it comes down. Hopefully, it doesn't come down, when the reason for the range. Hopefully, it doesn't come down quite as much as it has this time because the -- as the LIBOR rate moves up, which you're giving up from the mortgages going into commercial loans isn't as big a gap as what it is today, given where rates are. And so that will affect it. And then, obviously, the other thing that will be part of the margin that's important to think about is in total how we fund the balance sheet, right? So we have some bank notes that are coming due next year that we'll issue. And depending on where the print is there, that will also impact the margin. So I guess, originally, as I was thinking about the question in my response, I was thinking more on simply the asset side. But I think 6 to 10 in total margin is probably a better space to be, which, again, I always look at what happened this past year, recognizing there was some noise in there, but that's probably a good guide."

So I think you hit the nail on the head that when the accounting for acquired certificates of deposit, the math is that if it's a 12-month CD and there's 2 months left, you basically market as a 2-month instrument and you think about the interest rate as that. So as those CDs that were in partial pay down, if you will, they were with less than their full maturity, the rate that we would see would be the marked rate. And then as they renew, you would go to the actual rate, and that's partly why you're seeing that increase in those time deposit accounts over the course of the quarters this year. We've talked before that the bulk of the book is less than a year, so we should be pretty close to the end of that accounting happening and start to see, more pronounced, the effect of the repricing that's happening. But also remind you that the repricing happens every month, right? So in the first month, you see 1/12 of it, right? And then the second month, you see 2/12 of it? So it takes awhile for that stuff to work its way through, and it's also a function of how big the balances are that are maturing in each of those 12s. And we started to work in the middle of August. So really, we've got 1/12 in the book so far in September, and that's why the numbers that you're quoting are accurate and why they're not that impressive. But you've got to start sometime in making those changes, and we're started down that path. And we think it's an important next step in the conversion we have of this thrift into a commercial bank."
