Welcome to our fiscal 2016 third quarter earnings call. Revenue in the December quarter was approximately $620 million consistent with our preannouncement issued January 7. Gross margin and operating margin fell i",1100,"Thanks, Doug. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our fiscal 2016 third quarter earnings call. 
Revenue in the December quarter was approximately $620 million consistent with our preannouncement issued January 7. Gross margin and operating margin fell in at 47.9% and 25.3%, respectively. Operating expenses were down sequentially, reflecting less variable compensation expense and seasonally lower spending. Orval generated approximately $156.5 million in free cash flow and repurchased $250 million of stock to enhance shareholder value. 
In Infrastructure and Defense, revenue increased sequentially, with improved performance in wireless infrastructure. We expect this business to recover further in the near term, reinforcing our top line growth opportunities in calendar are 2016. 
Our IDP team continues to sharpen its focus on the highest growth segments into diversified business portfolio. This focus drives alignment with the growth markets of the Internet of Things, connected home, connected car, and the high growth segments within aerospace and defense. By leveraging Qorvo's comprehensive product and technology portfolio, we are providing customers highly differentiated solutions, especially exciting in the growth rate of gain solutions and in many of IDP's key market segments, driving a compound annual growth rate of approximately 25% for the next few years. 
We expect growth rates in 2016 to be well above IDP's underlying markets and significantly above the legacy growth rates of our premerger multimarket organizations. 
In mobile, the increase in global demand for broadband data and always-on connectivity continues to trigger a dramatic increase in the requirements for mobile networks and connected devices. For smartphone manufacturers and network operators, it's become increasingly difficult to capitalize on this demand while also solving your challenges related to frequency crowding, as carriers' signals are aggregated, distinct bands and protocols are operated in narrowly adjacent frequency bands and popular new consumer applications increase the congestion on our networks. 
For all these reasons, it's increasingly clear that the most effective solutions available to network operators and device manufacturers are better-performing, more highly integrated RF solutions. In fact, if you were to examine the product designs in development for those networks and devices, you'd identify increasing requirement for world-class filters, switchers, tuners and amplifiers, all tightly packaged and system-level implementations. This is tilting the competitive playing field in Qorvo's favor. Said another way, the RF suppliers with today's best performing, most tightly integrated solutions are at the forefront of the most challenging and most lucrative customer designs. This year, next year and extending well into 2018. 
As customers increasingly require more tightly integrated, high-performance system-level solutions, this is favoring Qorvo's comprehensive portfolio of premium products. In fact, this is why we became Qorvo. 
Now, one year into the creation of Qorvo, the roughly 7,000 members of the Qorvo team have much to be proud of. Looking at our first full year, compared to calendar 2014, revenue grew 12%. Gross margin expanded more than 400 basis points and operating income increased more than 40%. In fact, the non-GAAP earnings we reported over the last 4 quarters equates to a little over $4.60 per share based on our Q3 share count of approximately 144 million shares. 
On the design front, Orval is growing our dollar content in the most highly anticipated marquee smartphones launching this year at our 3 largest mobile customers. 
It's worth pointing out that in December, we released the industry's first 6-inch [indiscernible] wafers in our Florida fab, qualified 6-inch SAW wafers in our Greensboro fab and demonstrated our first 8-inch BAW wafers in our Texas fab. 
We can't overstate how important these achievements are. We see our 6-inch SAW capacity contributing to growth and profitability in the current year. And we see our 8-inch BAW capacity doing the same in 2017. 
We commenced shipments of our recently launched BAW-based quadplexers for FDD bands 1 and 3, an industry first, and we demonstrated BAW-based hexaplexer prototypes. We've also been selected to support a number of key cellular platforms with our next-generation auto tracking agreement. We commenced production shipments in support of a large global smartphone OEM and it's landed a number of large tailwinds later this year. We've also recently expanded our shipments of the antenna control solutions into the China smartphone market. Previously, Qorvo's antenna tuners and tuners have been highly concentrated within a small number of high-volume marquee devices. So we're thrilled with the increasing our addressable market in China as these customers add our functionality to support their standing presence in the worldwide market. 
In IDP, December was an exceptionally strong design win quarter. Here are some of the highlights: We captured multiple key design wins for macro and small cell based station applications, we believe network capacity constraints will accelerate the adoption of small cell base station and massive MIMO active antenna. 
Massive MIMO active antenna systems are driving a 10x increase in RF content and next-generation base stations. We continue to work on capturing new design wins as the market shifts from 4G LTE to LTEA, LTE Pro and eventually, 5G. 
At this year's Consumer Electronics Show, we supplied a suite of critical megalith components for a 5G massive MIMO demonstration performed by a leading base station OEM. The demo featured Qorvo space shifters, power amplifiers and switches. 
We also expanded our presence in the connected home with key design wins and gateways and access points highlighted by our design wins and flagship products at both NetGear and Lync Sys. 
We continue to believe that the rapidly increasing number of connected devices represented by the Internet of Things will be IDP's largest growth engine. In defense, we are a market leader in GaN and we continue to experience strong growth with our GaN-based products. 
For example, we secured a multi-year win on a next-generation electronic warfare system using our patented station solid-state RF technology with GaN [indiscernible] with hundreds of system installation anticipated over the life of the contract. On a synergy front, we continue to be on target to achieve our goals, the largest of which includes the increase in sourcing of margin assembly, and increased in sourcing of SAW filters. So for Qorvo, across all our businesses, we believe industry fundamentals remain strong. 
We are leveraging our comprehensive product portfolio of world-class RF solutions, rapidly introducing new products and technologies, expanding into new serviceable markets and enjoying very favorable design win activity. We are growing our dollar content and our 3 largest mobile customers in the most highly anticipated marquee smartphones being released this year. And we anticipate strong growth in IDP. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve for a more detailed look at our financials."
33821,321594253,927364,"Qorvo, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Qorvo, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob.

In the December quarter, Qorvo's revenue decreased 12% sequentially to $620 million. The Mobile Products revenue declined 15% to $489 million due to lower customer demand for existing business we'd already won. In IDP, revenue grew slightly to $130 million. Qorvo had two 10% customers, the larger at approximately 42% of revenue, representing the aggregated demand of multiple subcontractors for the second customer. 
Our second 10% customer during the quarter was Huawei. Gross margin was 47.9%, down sequentially from 49.7%. The sequential decline reflects the lower yields in inventory adjustments. 
Operating expenses were approximately $140 million for the December quarter, down $17 million sequentially. The decline was driven by reduced accruals and bonus expense and seasonally lower spending. 
Operating income was $156.9 million or just over 25% of revenue. Net income for the December quarter was $148 million or $1.03 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total cash and investments are over $1 billion and cash flow from operations totaled $218 million. CapEx was $62 million, primarily to address growth in demand for our premium filters. Finally, the company repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares at a total cost of $250 million and has $750 million remaining in its share repurchase program. 
We're proud of Qorvo's first full year performance and excited about the opportunities in the coming year. We're introducing an expanded set of new products, combining switches and filters and leveraging our broad set of competencies, including BAW filter and gallium nitrite process technologies. All of this is creating exciting new growth opportunities for Qorvo. 
With the first full year of Qorvo now in the books, I'm pleased to report the company exceeded its targets or achievement of an exit run rate of $75 million in synergies and is on track for the previously committed $150 million of run rate reduction by the end of calendar 2016. The largest remaining task is migration of all mobile segment parts in the company's China-based assembly and test facilities. 
Now let's turn to our business outlook. Qorvo currently believes demand environment and its end market supports the following non-GAAP expectations for the quarter ending April 2: quarterly revenue of approximately $600 million; gross margin of about 50%; net interest expense of about $15 million; tax rate at approximately 3%; and diluted earnings per share of $0.90 to $0.95 based on approximately 142 million shares. Our March revenue expectations are slightly below our preannouncement, reflecting an overall conservative posture in a cautious environment as well as the timing of new product ramps. 
We think Calendar 2016 will be a strong year for Qorvo. During which we'll continue to make progress on our target operating model while building a robust and defensible technology mode. Actual quarterly results may differ from these expectations and as such -- and such differences may be material. We currently expect to report March quarter results on May 4. 
Now on a personal note, I'm turning 60 at the end of this year and I've always had, as a personal goal, to retire by that point. But at December also, fortuitously, marks the end of our second year as Qorvo, and I'm proud to say we're on track to achieve the goals we've set for our first 2-year period. It's been a pleasure being part of Qorvo and in helping to shape its course. The company's on a fantastic trajectory, and I'm really looking forward to helping with the transition to a new CFO and participating in the company's success over the balance of the year before moving on to more personal pursuits. 
With that, I'm going to hand the call back to Bob."

James and his team have done a great job of realigning their product portfolio to drive above-industry growth there. So I think you're going to see a very nice rebound in growth beginning, actually, in the beginning of our fiscal '17. As you commented on the [indiscernible] business in the mobile phones business, clearly, we've got a cautious view in the next couple of quarters as we look out in our guidance that we gave for this quarter, along with the beginning of the next fiscal year. With that said, depending on the timing of new program ramps, and our confidence in the wings that we already have in our largest 3 customers, I do believe the second half of FY '17 will be very strong and should be above industry growth rates."

Your model every quarter for 101 different reasons of mix and whatever those are in the quarter. And in the quarter we just completed, we had a couple of yield issues and also, December tends to be a higher quarter for excess and obsolete as our customers in mobile separate the winners from the losers and sometimes, we get to write off a lot of inventory from the losers. And so that, I think, was a oneoff kind of 200 basis point hit of the margins in the December quarter and so it's really coming back to the -- to where we're running naturally, it's around 50%. As you know, our long-term goal is to move margins up to 55%, and we are hard work at both adopting and implementing parts of our manufacturing cost-reduction road map, including some significant changes in filter, wafer sizes and significant activities there. And finally, our completion of our synergies moving to former TriQuint model portfolios test activity into China. So I think there's some good stuff on the longer-term horizon. Next quarter, I think we can kind of come back to our current run rate, which is right around 50%."

And so when they look to these emerging markets, instead of taking your traditional approach of doing that will strip down low cost phone there generally, starting with their full mode phone and adding the bands for those regions to them.

Revenue in the December quarter was approximately $620 million, consistent with our preannouncement issued January 7. Gross margin and operating margin held in at 47.9% and 25.3%, respectively. Operating expenses were down sequentially, reflecting less variable compensation expense and seasonally lower spending. Qorvo generated approximately $156.5 million in free cash flow and repurchased $250 million of stock to enhance shareholder value.
In infrastructure and defense, revenue increased sequentially, with improved performance in Wireless Infrastructure. We expect this business to recover further in the near term, reinforcing our top line growth opportunities in calendar 2016.
Our IDP team continues to sharpen its focus on the highest growth segments in its diversified business portfolio. This focus drives alignment with the growth markets of the Internet of Things, connected home, connected car and the high-growth segments within aerospace and defense. By leveraging Qorvo's comprehensive product and technology portfolio, we are providing customers highly differentiated solutions, especially exciting in the growth rate of GaN solutions and in many of IDP's key market segments, driving a compound annual growth rate of approximately 25% for the next few years.
We expect growth rates in 2016 to be well above IDP's underlying markets and significantly above the legacy growth rates of our premerger multi-market organizations.
In mobile, the increase in global demand for broadband data and always-on connectivity continues to trigger a dramatic increase in the requirements for mobile networks and connected devices. For smartphone manufacturers and network operators, it's become increasingly difficult to capitalize on this demand while also solving new challenges related to frequency crowding, as carriers' signals are aggregated, distinct bands and protocols are operated in narrowly adjacent frequency bands and popular new consumer applications increase the congestion on our networks.
For all these reasons, it's increasingly clear that the most effective solutions available to network operators and device manufacturers are better-performing, more highly integrated RF solutions. In fact, if you were to examine the product designs in development for tomorrow's networks and devices, you'd identify increasing requirement for world-class filters, switches, tuners and amplifiers, all tightly packaged in system-level implementations. This is tilting the competitive playing field in Qorvo's favor. Said another way, the RF suppliers with today's best-performing, most tightly integrated solutions are at the forefront of the most challenging and most lucrative customer designs this year, next year and extending well into 2018.
As customers increasingly require more tightly integrated, high-performance system-level solutions, this is favoring Qorvo's comprehensive portfolio of premium products. In fact, this is why we became Qorvo.
Now 1 year into the creation of Qorvo, the roughly 7,000 members of the Qorvo team have much to be proud of. Looking at our first full year, compared to calendar 2014, revenue grew 12%, gross margin expanded more than 400 basis points and operating income increased more than 40%. In fact, the non-GAAP earnings we reported over the last 4 quarters equates to a little over $4.60 per share based on our Q3 share count of approximately 144 million shares.
On the design front, Qorvo is growing our dollar content in the most highly anticipated marquee smartphones launching this year at our 3 largest mobile customers.
It's worth pointing out that in December, we released the industry's first 6-inch temp comp SAW wafers in our Florida fab, qualified 6-inch SAW wafers in our Greensboro fab and demonstrated our first 8-inch BAW wafers in our Texas fab.
We can't overstate how important these achievements are. We see our 6-inch SAW capacity contributing to growth and profitability in the current year, and we see our 8-inch BAW capacity doing the same in 2017.
We commenced shipments of our recently launched BAW-based quadplexers for FDD bands 1 and 3, an industry first, and we demonstrated BAW-based hexaplexer prototypes. We've also been selected to support a number of key cellular platforms with our next-generation envelope tracking PMO. We have commenced production shipments in support of a large global smartphone OEM and has landed a number of large scale wins layering on later this year. We've also recently expanded our shipments of the antenna control solutions into the China smartphone market. Previously, Qorvo's antenna tuners and impedance tuners had been highly concentrated within a small number of high-volume marquee devices. So we're thrilled to be increasing our addressable market in China as these customers add RF functionality to support their expanding presence in the worldwide market.
In IDP, December was an exceptionally strong design win quarter. Here are some of the highlights. We captured multiple key design wins for macro and small cell base station applications. We believe network capacity constraints will accelerate the adoption of small cell base stations and massive MIMO active antennas.
Massive MIMO active antenna systems are driving a 10x increase in RF content in next-generation base stations. We continue to work on capturing new design wins as the market shifts from 4G LTE to LTE-A, LTE Pro and, eventually, 5G.
At this year's Consumer Electronics Show, we supplied a suite of critical microwave components for a 5G massive MIMO demonstration performed by a leading base station OEM. The demo featured Qorvo phase shifters, power amplifiers and switches.
We also expanded our presence in the connected home with key design wins in gateways and access points, highlighted by our design wins and flagship products at both NETGEAR and Linksys.
We continue to believe that the rapidly increasing number of connected devices represented by the Internet of Things will be IDP's largest growth engine. In defense, we are a market leader in GaN, and we continue to experience strong growth with our GaN-based products.
For example, we secured a multi-year win on a next-generation electronic warfare system using our patented Spatium solid-state RF power technology with GaN MMICs with hundreds of system installations anticipated over the life of the contract. On a synergy front, we continue to be on target to achieve our goals, the largest of which include the increase in sourcing of module assembly and increase in sourcing of SAW filters. So for Qorvo, across all our businesses, we believe industry fundamentals remain strong.
We are leveraging our comprehensive product portfolio of world-class RF solutions, rapidly introducing new products and technologies, expanding into new serviceable markets and enjoying very favorable design win activity. We are growing our dollar content in our 3 largest mobile customers, in the most highly anticipated marquee smartphones being released this year. And we anticipate strong growth in IDP.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve for a more detailed look at our financials."

In the December quarter, Qorvo's revenue decreased 12% sequentially to $620 million. Mobile Products revenue declined 15% to $489 million due to lower customer demand for existing business we'd already won. In IDP, revenue grew slightly to $1",605,"Thanks, Bob. In the December quarter, Qorvo's revenue decreased 12% sequentially to $620 million. Mobile Products revenue declined 15% to $489 million due to lower customer demand for existing business we'd already won. In IDP, revenue grew slightly to $130 million. Qorvo had two 10% customers, the larger at approximately 42% of revenue, representing the aggregated demand of multiple subcontractors for this end customer.
Our second 10% customer during the quarter was Huawei. Gross margin was 47.9%, down sequentially from 49.7%. The sequential decline reflects lower yields in inventory adjustments.
Operating expenses were approximately $140 million for the December quarter, down $17 million sequentially. The decline was driven by reduced accruals for bonus expense and seasonally lower spending.
Operating income was $156.9 million or just over 25% of revenue. Net income for the December quarter was $148 million or $1.03 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total cash and investments are over $1 billion, and cash flow from operations totaled $218 million. CapEx was $62 million, primarily to address growth in demand for our premium filters. Finally, the company repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares at a total cost of $250 million and has $750 million remaining in its share repurchase program.
We're proud of Qorvo's first full year performance and excited about the opportunities in the coming year. We're introducing an expanded set of new products, combining switches and filters, and leveraging our broad set of competencies, including BAW filter and gallium nitrite process technologies. All of this is creating exciting new growth opportunities for Qorvo.
With the first full year of Qorvo now in the books, I'm pleased to report the company exceeded its targets for achievement of an exit run rate of $75 million in synergies and is on track for the previously committed $150 million of run rate reduction by the end of calendar 2016. The largest remaining task is migration of all mobile segment parts to the company's China-based assembly and test facilities.
Now let's turn to our business outlook. Qorvo currently believes demand environment in its end markets supports the following non-GAAP expectations for the quarter ending April 2: quarterly revenue of approximately $600 million; gross margin of about 50%; net interest expense of about $15 million; tax rate at approximately 3%; and diluted earnings per share of $0.90 to $0.95 based on approximately 142 million shares. Our March revenue expectations are slightly below our preannouncement, reflecting an overall conservative posture given the cautious environment as well as the timing of new product ramps.
We think calendar 2016 will be a strong year for Qorvo, during which we'll continue to make progress on our target operating model while building a robust and defensible technology moat. Actual quarterly results may differ from these expectations and as such -- and such differences may be material. We currently expect to report March quarter results on May 4.
Now on a personal note, I'm turning 60 at the end of this year, and I've always had it as a personal goal to retire by that point. By December also, fortuitously, marks the end of our second year as Qorvo, and I'm proud to say we're on track to achieve the goals we've set for our first 2-year period. It's been a pleasure being part of Qorvo and helping to shape its course. The company's on a fantastic trajectory, and I'm really looking forward to helping with the transition to a new CFO and participating in the company's success over the balance of the year before moving on to more personal pursuits.
With that, I'm going to hand the call back to Bob."

So I think you're going to see a very nice rebound in growth beginning, actually, in the beginning of our fiscal '17. As you commented on the -- in Eric's business, in the mobile phone business, clearly, we've got a cautious view in the next couple of quarters as we look out in our guidance that we gave for this quarter, along with the beginning of the next fiscal year.

As I said in my opening comments, plus we put it in our press release, we feel very good about the design wins that we have in our top 3 customers, marquee phones that are launching this year. Some of those phones begin ramping later in this quarter, and we'll see some others as you typically see launches throughout the year. And clearly, they are in the second half. So I feel we have very good visibility into that. Again, I think timing of any marquee phone can vary. And when phones ramp at the end of the quarters, they can influence which quarter they fall in, depending on also what sub cons you're shipping into. But Harsh, we feel very good about the wins and feel very good about the second half of fiscal 2017 for our mobile products."

So we actually look at this and go this is probably going to open up some opportunities for us. We made our investments in our filters. Clearly, us and our 2 largest competitors buy from TDK.

So if I understood your question, it was about the non-China emerging markets, and that is an interesting question, I think, it's something that percolates throughout the year. We think roughly 50 million units of 4G smartphones could be consumed in that kind of emerging market outside of China. The majority of those will be provided by our current customers, of course, in a lot of the China brands. And one of the things that's interesting is China is moving towards 5-mode or full mode against that -- those customers are getting better and better at including really complex RF in there. And so when they look to these new emerging markets, instead of taking a traditional approach or doing kind of a real strip down low-cost phone, they're generally starting with their full mode phones and adding the bands for those regions to them. And that's one of the things that's driving the antenna tuner demand we've talked about in China. Between that and the fact that they're also adopting very high-quality, global look-and-feel, if you will, handsets, middle cases for example. All the same things that drove antenna tuning into the highest tier, really, that's where our China-based customers are taking their products for all of these 4G markets."

Welcome to our fiscal 2016 third quarter earnings call.Revenue in the December quarter was approximately $620 million, consistent with our preannouncement issued January 7. Gross margin and operating margin held i",1100,"Thanks, Doug. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our fiscal 2016 third quarter earnings call.
Revenue in the December quarter was approximately $620 million, consistent with our preannouncement issued January 7. Gross margin and operating margin held in at 47.9% and 25.3%, respectively. Operating expenses were down sequentially, reflecting less variable compensation expense and seasonally lower spending. Qorvo generated approximately $156.5 million in free cash flow and repurchased $250 million of stock to enhance shareholder value.
In infrastructure and defense, revenue increased sequentially with improved performance in Wireless Infrastructure. We expect this business to recover further in the near term, reinforcing our top line growth opportunities in calendar 2016.
Our IDP team continues to sharpen its focus on the highest growth segments in its diversified business portfolio. This focus drives alignment with the growth markets of the Internet of Things, connected home, connected car, and the high-growth segments within aerospace and defense. By leveraging Qorvo's comprehensive product and technology portfolio, we are providing customers highly differentiated solutions, especially exciting in the growth rate of GaN solutions and in many of IDP's key market segments, driving a compound annual growth rate of approximately 25% for the next few years.
We expect growth rates in 2016 to be well above IDP's underlying markets and significantly above the legacy growth rates of our premerger multimarket organizations.
In mobile, the increase in global demand for broadband data and always-on connectivity continues to trigger a dramatic increase in the requirements for mobile networks and connected devices. For smartphone manufacturers and network operators, it's become increasingly difficult to capitalize on this demand while also solving new challenges related to frequency crowding. As carrier signals are aggregated, distinct bands and protocols are operated in narrowly adjacent frequency bands and popular new consumer applications increase the congestion on our networks.
For all these reasons, it's increasingly clear that the most effective solutions available to network operators and device manufacturers are better-performing, more highly integrated RF solutions. In fact, if you were to examine the product designs in development for tomorrow's networks and devices, you'd identify an increasing requirement for world-class filters, switches, tuners and amplifiers, all tightly packaged in system-level implementations. This is tilting the competitive playing field in Qorvo's favor. Said another way, the RF suppliers with today's best-performing, most tightly integrated solutions are at the forefront of the most challenging and most lucrative customer designs this year, next year and extending well into 2018.
As customers increasingly require more tightly integrated, high-performance system-level solutions, this is favoring Qorvo's comprehensive portfolio of premium products. In fact, this is why we became Qorvo.
Now 1 year into the creation of Qorvo, the roughly 7,000 members of the Qorvo team have much to be proud of. Looking at our first full year, compared to calendar 2014, revenue grew 12%. Gross margin expanded more than 400 basis points. And operating income increased more than 40%. In fact, the non-GAAP earnings we reported over the last 4 quarters equates to a little over $4.60 per share based on our Q3 share count of approximately 144 million shares.
On the design front, Qorvo is growing our dollar content in the most highly anticipated marquee smartphones launching this year at our 3 largest mobile customers.
It's worth pointing out that, in December, we released the industry's first 6-inch temp comp SAW wafers in our Florida fab, qualified 6-inch SAW wafers in our Greensboro fab and demonstrated our first 8-inch BAW wafers in our Texas fab.
We can't overstate how important these achievements are. We see our 6-inch SAW capacity contributing to growth and profitability in the current year, and we see our 8-inch BAW capacity doing the same in 2017.
We've commenced shipments of our recently launched BAW-based quadplexers for FDD bands 1 and 3, an industry first, and we demonstrated BAW-based hexaplexer prototypes. We've also been selected to support a number of key cellular platforms with our next-generation envelope tracking PMIC. We've commenced production shipments in support of a large global smartphone OEM and have landed a number of large-scale wins layering on later this year. We've also recently expanded our shipments of the antenna control solutions into the China smartphone market. Previously, Qorvo's antenna tuners and impedance tuners had been highly concentrated within a small number of high-volume marquee devices. So we're thrilled to be increasing our addressable market in China as these customers add RF functionality to support their expanding presence in the worldwide market.
In IDP, December was an exceptionally strong design win quarter. Here's some of the highlights. We captured multiple key design wins for macro and small cell base station applications. We believe network capacity constraints will accelerate the adoption of small cell base stations and massive MIMO active antennas.
Massive MIMO active antenna systems are driving a 10x increase in RF content in next-generation base stations. We continue to work on capturing new design wins as the market shifts from 4G LTE to LTE-A, LTE Pro and, eventually, 5G.
At this year's Consumer Electronics Show, we supplied a suite of critical microwave components for a 5G massive MIMO demonstration performed by a leading base station OEM. The demo featured Qorvo phase shifters, power amplifiers and switches.
We also expanded our presence in the connected home with key design wins in gateways and access points, highlighted by our design wins in flagship products at both NETGEAR and Linksys.
We continue to believe that the rapidly increasing number of connected devices represented by the Internet of Things will be IDP's largest growth engine. In defense, we're a market leader in GaN, and we continue to experience strong growth with our GaN-based products.
For example, we secured a multiyear win on a next-generation electronic warfare system using our patented Spatium solid-state RF power technology with GaN MMICs with hundreds of system installations anticipated over the life of the contract. On the synergy front, we continue to be on target to achieve our goals, the largest of which include the increased insourcing of module assembly and increased insourcing of SAW filters. So for Qorvo, across all our businesses, we believe industry fundamentals remain strong.
We are leveraging our comprehensive product portfolio of world-class RF solutions, rapidly introducing new products and technologies, expanding into new serviceable markets and enjoying very favorable design win activity. We are growing our dollar content in our 3 largest mobile customers in the most highly anticipated marquee smartphones being released this year. And we anticipate strong growth in IDP.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve for a more detailed look at our financials."
33821,321594253,927702,"Qorvo, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2016",2016-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Qorvo, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob. In the December quarter, Qorvo's revenue decreased 12% sequentially to $620 million. Mobile Products revenue declined 15% to $489 million due to lower customer demand for existing business we'd already won. In IDP, revenue grew slightly to $1",603,"Thanks, Bob. In the December quarter, Qorvo's revenue decreased 12% sequentially to $620 million. Mobile Products revenue declined 15% to $489 million due to lower customer demand for existing business we'd already won. In IDP, revenue grew slightly to $130 million. Qorvo had two 10% customers, the larger at approximately 42% of revenue, representing the aggregated demand of multiple subcontractors for this end customer.
Our second 10% customer during the quarter was Huawei. Gross margin was 47.9%, down sequentially from 49.7%. The sequential decline reflects lower yields in inventory adjustments.
Operating expenses were approximately $140 million for the December quarter, down $17 million sequentially. The decline was driven by reduced accruals for bonus expense and seasonally lower spending.
Operating income was $156.9 million or just over 25% of revenue. Net income for the December quarter was $148 million or $1.03 per diluted share. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total cash and investments were over $1 billion, and cash flow from operations totaled $218 million. CapEx was $62 million, primarily to address growth in demand for our premium filters. Finally, the company repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares at a total cost of $250 million and has $750 million remaining in its share repurchase program.
We're proud of Qorvo's first full year performance and excited about the opportunities in the coming year. We're introducing an expanded set of new products, combining switches and filters and leveraging our broad set of competencies, including BAW filter and gallium nitride process technologies. All of this is creating exciting new growth opportunities for Qorvo.
With the first full year of Qorvo now in the books, I'm pleased to report the company exceeded its targets for achievement of an exit run rate of $75 million in synergies and is on track for the previously committed $150 million run rate reduction by the end of calendar 2016. The largest remaining task is migration of all mobile segment parts to the company's China-based assembly and test facilities.
Now let's turn to our business outlook. Qorvo currently believes demand environment in its end markets supports the following non-GAAP expectations for the quarter ending April 2: quarterly revenue of approximately $600 million; gross margin of about 50%; net interest expense of about $15 million; tax rate at approximately 3%; and diluted earnings per share of $0.90 to $0.95 based on approximately 142 million shares. Our March revenue expectations are slightly below our preannouncement, reflecting an overall conservative posture given the cautious environment as well as the timing of new product ramps.
We think calendar 2016 will be a strong year for Qorvo, during which we'll continue to make progress on our target operating model while building a robust and defensible technology moat. Actual quarterly results may differ from these expectations and as such -- and such differences may be material. We currently expect to report March quarter results on May 4.
Now on a personal note, I'm turning 60 at the end of this year, and I've always had it as a personal goal to retire by that point. But December also, fortuitously, marks the end of our second year as Qorvo, and I'm proud to say we're on track to achieve the goals we've set for our first 2-year period. It's been a pleasure being part of Qorvo and helping to shape its course. Company's on a fantastic trajectory, and I'm really looking forward to helping with the transition to a new CFO and participating in the company's success over the balance of the year before moving on to more personal pursuits.
With that, I'm going to hand the call back to Bob."

So moving off of that, we are very confident in the IDP business growing significantly faster than its underlying markets. James and his team have done a great job of realigning their product portfolio to drive above-industry growth there. So I think you're going to see a very nice rebound in growth beginning, actually, in the beginning of our fiscal '17. As you commented on the -- in Eric's business, in the mobile phone business, clearly, we've got a cautious view in the next couple quarters as we look out in our guidance that we gave for this quarter along with the beginning of the next fiscal year. With that said, depending on the timing of new program ramps and our confidence in the wins that we already have with our largest 3 customers, I do believe the second half of FY '17 will be very strong and should be above industry growth rates."

The majority of those will be provided by our current customers, of course, in a lot of the China brands. And one of the things that's interesting as -- is China is moving towards 5-mode or full mode handsets. Those customers are getting better and better at including really complex RF in there. And so when they look to these new emerging markets, instead of taking a traditional approach or doing kind of a real stripped down low-cost phone, they're generally starting with their full mode phones and adding the bands for those regions to them. And that's one of the things that's driving the antenna tuner demand we've talked about in China. Between that and the fact that they're also adopting very high-quality, global look-and-feel, if you will, handsets that have metal cases, for example.

Welcome to our fiscal 2016 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Revenue for March quarter totaled $607.1 million, exceeding our quarterly guidance, reflecting increased demand for our highly integrated solutions and return",1332,"Thanks, Doug. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our fiscal 2016 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Revenue for March quarter totaled $607.1 million, exceeding our quarterly guidance, reflecting increased demand for our highly integrated solutions and returned to growth in IDP broad target markets. Gross margin was 50%, up 210 basis points sequentially, reflecting crisp execution by the Qorvo team. Operating margin was 26.4% with operating expenses of approximately $143 million, reflecting reduced variable compensation expense.
On February 17, we announced an accelerated share repurchase program. And during the March quarter, we were able to repurchase 10 million shares of common stock. We expect to repurchase an estimated 500,000 shares in the June quarter as part of ASR and we have $250 million that remained authorized for future repurchases. 
In mobile products, revenue was $465 million, on the strength of content gains and Smartphone program grants. During the quarter, we launched an increasing number of highly integrated, high-performance solutions that leverage the breadth of our industry-leading portfolio of products and technology. We enjoyed strong demand for our highly integrated solutions, led by products incorporating our premium filters. We expect these highly integrated solutions will continue to drive our growth. Qorvo's expanding family of RF Fusion standards -- solution stands out as an example.
These tightly integrated complex solutions leverage our BAW and TC-SAW filters switches and high performance low noise amplifiers to deliver performance that's unmatched by competitive solution. In the China market, the deployment of carry aggregation and the migration to 4 more devices is increasing the demand for our RF Flex solutions. Our BAW-based cloud structures and a broad variety of our antenna control solutions. 
Looking into calendar 2017, our customers in China are asking us to integrate our premium filters into RF Flex, to reduce complexity and enhance Smartphone performance, as carrier aggregation proliferates and bands and modes are added. Again, this strongly favors our broad product portfolio and integration capability.
In IDP, revenue grew 9% sequentially to approximately $142 million, reflecting a return to growth in IDP's broad target market. We indicated last quarter that IDP had repositioned its diverse portfolio of businesses to accelerate growth. And we've begun to see the benefit of that sharp end focus. In automotive, IDP secured a significant design win with a Tier 1 automotive supplier, meaningfully expanding our opportunity in automotive infotainment system at several European car manufacturers.
Elsewhere in connectivity, IDP leveraged the superior performance of our integrated solutions in efficiency, thermal dissipation, range and a number of other key metrics to secure the lead position on QSR10G Wi-Fi solution. This solution enables the industry first 10G solution wave free solutions through 8x8 MIMO configuration for 5 gigahertz networks and 4x4 MIMO configuration for 2.4 Gigahertz networks. In Wireless Infrastructure, revenue grew by more than 25% sequentially and we returned to more historic levels in our base station business.
And in GaN, we enjoyed increasing demand for Qorvo's high frequency, high power solutions across both infrastructure deployment and advanced defense applications. Across all our market, it's increasingly clear that Qorvo's industry-leading portfolio of RF products and technology represents a significant competitive advantage. Qorvo is offering our customers a combination of performance and integration that's not been available previously, putting us in a favorable position to gain content and outpace our market. Equally important is our unique ability to match the optimum technology or a combination of technologies to each customer's application without bias for its any one technology or architecture.
Only Qorvo delivers a comprehensive product portfolio of filters, switches, amplifiers, and tuners with the scale, integration capabilities and system-level expertise to supply an expanding variety of highly integrated solutions. This is leading to deeper relationships with our customers, channel partners and carriers, as they see greater economic value and maximizing spectral efficiency. To monetize their respective investments, they're seeking increasingly precise, highly integrated solutions, optimized to solve specific challenges related to delivery of broadband data. Qorvo is unique in its ability to address that need. 
In both mobile and IDP, Qorvo is leveraging our comprehensive product and technology portfolio to participate in the development of 5G standards to expand the growth opportunity. We're engaged in 5G field trials with infrastructure customers and we are assisting in development of key aspects of 5G next-generation wireless communications standards as a member of 3 GPPA.
In 2016, 3 GPP is set to make significant progress in defining 5G use cases. 5G will enable speeds comparable to fixed broadband with ultralow latency and the capacity for massive scale networks, creating exciting opportunities in new markets like wireless, residential, broadband, autonomous driving, robotic, virtual reality, audible sensor networks, and other applications leveraging employment of a global Internet of Things ecosystem. In IDP, we're introducing highly differentiated products that enable customers in high-growth markets to introduce products at record speed and with higher levels of functionality. As an example, in automotive, our highly integrated solutions maximize data throughput, while solving the complex challenges related to spectrum congestion. The compound annual growth rate in automotive connectivity is forecasted to be 45% through the year 2020. And Qorvo's broad portfolio of RF solutions position us favorably for success.
Across all our markets, it's our goal to deliver breakthrough RF solutions and accelerate the delivery of broadband data and create value for our customers and our customer's customers. We intend to leverage our broad scale, industry-leading product and technology portfolio, and strong organizational discipline to achieve operational excellence, capture value, and deliver superior financial results. We prioritized usage of cash by investing in our business to drive growth, returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases, and exploring opportunities for M&A to supplement growth in IDP. Since our earnings conference call last quarter, we repurchased more than 10 million shares of common stock. We made an acquisition to expand into the Internet of Things.
We commenced production of 6-inch temp comp SAW in Florida and 6-inch saw SIW supports Marquee smartphone this calendar. And we are in final days of qualifying our 8-inch BAW process in Texas. Our broad based hexaplexer prototypes are demonstrating excellent performance and we began to sample a height integrated RF Fusion that incorporates our hexaplexers. We see strong growth and increasing customer pull for these types of solutions in the coming years. We recently acquired Cleanroom space, near Richardson campus to support for BAW fitters. Whether they will be in implementations, quadplexers, hexaplexers, diversity modules or other highly integrated RF solution. The facility is already fully operational and it's our goal to incrementally convert the facility to BAW in the back half of next calendar year to support customer broadband. As the industry's leading supplier of SAW, temp comp SAW and BAW devices, we're adding capacity to keep pace with increase in customer win for our high, mid an low-band products. In fact, Qorvo will soon be in production with low-band pads, mid-band pads and high-band pads, all in premium tier Marquee LTE smartphones.
Before handing of the call to Steve, I want to say a quick word about our acquisition of GreenPeak Technologies, which just recently closed. GreenPeak is a recognized leader in ultra-low power, short-range RF solutions with an expanding business and customers all over the globe, a great number of through our already purchasing high power solutions for Qorvo. GreenPeak will become a part of IDP and will be run by Cees Links, their founder and CEO. Cees Links is a recognized industry leader through its instrumental in development and adoption of Wi-Fi technology. We expect GreenPeak's ultra- low-power RF solutions and SLC is connected home and Internet of Things will nicely complement IDP's industry-leading portfolio of high-power solutions.
We have not included any revenue from GreenPeak Technologies in our June guidance. In September quarter, we will have a full quarter of GreenPeak revenue and will begin to include it in our guidance then. 
And with that, I will hand the call over to Steve for a more detailed look at our financials."

Qorvo's revenue for the March quarter was $607 million, much better than typical seasonality relative to the December quarter. Mobile products revenue declined 5% to $465 million, while IDP showed continued strength as revenue grew 9% to $142",512,"Thanks, Bob. Qorvo's revenue for the March quarter was $607 million, much better than typical seasonality relative to the December quarter. Mobile products revenue declined 5% to $465 million, while IDP showed continued strength as revenue grew 9% to $142 million. Content gains in the Samsung Galaxy were the largest driver of healthy sequential performance in mobile. Qorvo had 3 10% customers, the largest at approximately 33% of revenue, representing the aggregated demand of multiple subcontractors for this end customer. Our other 10% customers during the quarter were Samsung and Huawei.
Gross margin is 50%, up sequentially from 47.9%, reflecting the absence of couple of yield issues experienced in the prior quarter. Operating expenses remain relatively low at $143 million, driven by reduced variable compensation expense.
Operating income was $161 million or just over 26% of revenue. Net income for the March quarter was $143 million or $1.04 per diluted share, based on 137.5 million shares outstanding. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total cash and investments were $613 million and cash flow from operations totaled $160.5 million. Capital expenditures were $84.4 million, primarily to address growth in demand for our premium filters. The company repurchased approximately 10 million shares during the March quarter under our $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. As the actual purchase occurred about halfway through the quarter, the impact on the March quarter sharecount was about 5 million shares. We expect to repurchase an estimated 500,000 shares this quarter, as the ASR program is completed. ASR is part of our previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program approved in November of 2015.
After giving effect of the ASR, approximately $250 million remained authorized under this program for future repurchases. We made good progress last year on significant long-term opportunities to improve our growth and profitability. We acquired highly respected IoT firm, improving our and growth prospects. We continue to improve both the fundamental performance capabilities of our SMR BAW process and the capacity to produce to growing customer demand. Our acquisition of a former plant is just few miles from our existing operation in Richardson will provide low-cost, cleanroom capacity for the next leg for BAW growth. We saw strong progress on large cost-reduction initiatives, 8-inch BAW wafers, 6-inch TC-SAW first and the in-sourcing of mobile assembling desk into our Chinese plants. It's an exciting time in RF and at Qorvo.
Now, let's turn to our business outlook. Qorvo currently believes the demand environment in its end markets supports the following non-GAAP expectations for the quarter ending July 2, 2016: Quarterly revenue of about $650 million; gross margin of about 50%; net interest expense of approximately $15 million; tax rate at approximately 10%; and diluted earnings per share of approximately $1.05, based on approximately 133 million shares outstanding.
Our June revenue expectations indicated healthy 7% sequential growth, reflecting our strong book of business. Actual quarterly results may differ from these expectations. And as such, differences may be material. We currently expect to report June quarter results on August 2, 2016. 
With that, I'd like to welcome your questions."

I was wondering you can give us any sense obviously you're ramping Gen 3 of RF FLEX but your premium filters. Can you give us some sense, is it fairly well balanced between RF Flex and filters? Or is one of those businesses much larger than the other? And then sort of follow-on question to that is, last year you guys saw massive June quarter in China and ended up inventory stimulation effect at September, December. As you look forward right now, do you think that strength in China sort of continues in the back of the year? Or is it hard to have visibility that far right out now?"

With the portfolio that's going in June in China, particularly is very, very diverse. In addition to all the RF Flex and quadplexers and discrete filters and so forth that we're growing with the most of the China suppliers. When we look at Huawei, that's a completely different sort of dynamic. We also see them growing strongly in June. But based on the RF Fusion portfolio, some of the more premium solutions and power management and so forth. So really I think its fair to say our entire product portfolio is involved in one way or others with various tiers and manufacturer out in China. And you have to below Huawei, the other suppliers like Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi, we have good long-term relationships with these guys and they're looking to expand beyond domestic consumption and export more, which is driving a need for more premium filters and more bands in their phones. And so that just plays right into where we're investing. And regarding your second point, yes, very good point, last year we also had very strong start of June. I think that has caused us to be pretty cautious. We're being as careful as we can to make sure looking at the total demand and watching for customers that might be double ordering or chasing the same slots and so forth. So we're watching it very carefully. I think another big part of last year was the MediaTek's Pahse II generation, where we were frankly, behind by 1 or 2 quarters. And it was hard to catch up once we got there. So this transition this time of Phase III and looking into phase 5 and Faye 6 at this time, we look very, very well aligned with the MediaTek as well as the end customers."

I think they're underestimating what it's going to take, I think the amount of IP, the capacity is going to take we are moving to 8-inch. The performance keeps improving, generation over generation. Quite honestly, I'm not sure where they're getting the technology or where they're even having a factory to produce it. We currently do know suppliers out there that are limited in their ability to use BAW filters, coupled with SAW filters you want to transmit or receive. So we're certainly familiar with those things, but we just don't see it. And as far as high performance figures, whether they are BAW or temp comp SAW, continue to expand the growth. They are bigger than Qorvo in temp comp SAW. We are expanding capacity for programs that we already 1. We migrated to 6-inch, we talked in the February call about how we were qualified to first 6-inch process. We're first in the industry to do that. This quarter, in opening comments, I talked about how we're ramping temp comp SAW in Florida. And again, that's for programs we've already won. But we feel pretty good about the capacity we're putting in place in BAW as well as in SAW. So when I talked about SAW filters in Greensboro, that's really in sourced it is that we're buying outside.

So I think overall, we're still in fairly early innings. I think we talked about this at Analyst Day, compounding effect of those with the reduced number of SKUs in the handsets manufacturers pipeline that drives the complexity dramatically.

Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Fiscal 2016 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Revenue for the March quarter totaled $607.1 million, exceeding our quarterly guidance, reflecting increased demand for our highly integrated solutions and a return to growth in IDP broad target markets. Gross margin was 50%, up 210 basis points sequentially, reflecting crisp execution by the Qorvo team. Operating margin was 26.4%, with operating expenses of approximately $143 million, reflecting reduced variable compensation expense.
On February 17, we announced an accelerated share repurchase program, and during the March quarter, we were able to repurchase 10 million shares of common stock. We expect to repurchase an estimated 500,000 shares in the June quarter as part of the ASR, and we have $250 million that remain authorized for future repurchases. 
In Mobile Products, revenue was $465 million on the strength of content gains and smartphone program ramps. During the quarter, we launched an increasing number of highly integrated, high-performance solutions that leverage the breadth of our industry-leading portfolio of products and technology. We enjoyed strong demand for our highly integrated solutions, led by products incorporating our premium filters. We expect these highly integrated solutions will continue to drive our growth. 
Qorvo's expanding family of RF Fusion standards -- solution stands out as an example. These tightly integrated compact solutions leveraged our BAW and temp comp SAW filters, our low-loss, high-[indiscernible] SOI switches and our high-performance low-noise amplifiers to deliver performance that's unmatched by competitive solution. In the China market, the deployment of carry aggregation and the migration to 4-mode devices is increasing the demand for our RF Flex solutions, our BAW-based quadplexers and a broad variety of our antenna control solutions. 
Looking into calendar 2017, our customers in China are asking us to integrate our premium filters into RF Flex to reduce complexity and enhance smartphone performance as carrier aggregation proliferates and bands and modes are added. Again, this strongly favors our broad product portfolio and integration capability.
In IDP, revenue grew 9% sequentially to approximately $142 million, reflecting a return to growth in IDP's broad target market. We indicated last quarter that IDP had repositioned its diverse portfolio of businesses to accelerate growth, and we've begun to see the benefit of that sharpened focus. In automotive, IDP secured a significant design win with a Tier 1 automotive supplier, meaningfully expanding our opportunity in automotive infotainment systems at several European car manufacturers.
Elsewhere in connectivity, IDP leveraged the superior performance of our integrated solutions in efficiency, thermal dissipation, range and a number of other key metrics to secure the lead position on Quantenna's QSR10G Wi-Fi solution. This solution enables the industry's first 10G Wave 3 solution through a True 8x8 MIMO configuration for 5 gigahertz networks and a 4x4 MIMO configuration for 2.4 gigahertz networks. 
In Wireless Infrastructure, revenue grew by more than 25% sequentially, and we returned to more historic levels in our base station business.
And in GaN, we enjoyed increasing demand for Qorvo's high-frequency, high-power solutions across both infrastructure deployments and advanced defense applications. 
Across all our market, it's increasingly clear that Qorvo's industry-leading portfolio of RF products and technology represents a significant competitive advantage. Qorvo is offering our customers a combination of performance and integration that's not been available previously, putting us in a favorable position to gain content and outpace our market. Equally important is our unique ability to match the optimum technology or combination of technologies to each customer's application without bias towards any one technology or architecture.
Only Qorvo delivers a comprehensive product portfolio of filters, switches, amplifiers, LNAs and tuners with the scale, integration capabilities and system-level expertise to supply an expanding variety of highly integrated solutions. This is leading to deeper relationships with our customers, channel partners and carriers as they see greater economic value in maximizing spectral efficiency. To monetize their respective investments, they're seeking increasingly precise, highly integrated solutions optimized to solve specific challenges related to the delivery of broadband data. Qorvo is unique in its ability to address that need. 
In both Mobile and IDP, Qorvo is leveraging our comprehensive product and technology portfolio to participate in the development of 5G standards to expand our growth opportunity. We are engaged in 5G field trials with infrastructure customers, and we are assisting in the development of key aspects of 5G next-generation wireless communication standards as a member of 3GPP.
In 2016, 3GPP is set to make significant progress in defining 5G use cases. 5G will enable speeds comparable to fixed broadband with ultralow latency and the capacity for massive scale networks, creating exciting opportunities in new markets like wireless residential broadband, autonomous driving, robotics, virtual reality, urban sensor networks and other applications leveraging deployment of the global Internet of Things ecosystem. 
In IDP, we're introducing highly differentiated products that enable customers in high-growth markets to introduce products at record speed and with higher levels of functionality. As an example, in automotive, our highly integrated solutions maximize data throughput while solving the complex challenges related to spectrum congestion. The compound annual growth rate in automotive connectivity is forecasted to be 45% through the year 2020. And Qorvo's broad portfolio of RF solutions position us favorably for success.
Across all our markets, it's our goal to deliver breakthrough RF solutions that accelerate the delivery of broadband data and create value for our customers and our customers' customers. We intend to leverage our broad scale, industry-leading product and technology portfolio and strong organizational discipline to achieve operational excellence, capture value and deliver superior financial results. 
We prioritize our uses of cash by investing in our business to drive growth, returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and exploring opportunities for M&A to supplement growth in IDP. Since our earnings conference call last quarter, we repurchased more than 10 million shares of common stock. We made an acquisition to expand into the Internet of Things. We commenced production of 6-inch temp comp SAW in Florida and 6-inch SAW in Greensboro to support a marquee smartphone this calendar year. And we're in the final days of qualifying our 8-inch BAW process in Texas. Our BAW-based hexaplexer prototypes are demonstrating excellent performance, and we began to sample a highly integrated RF Fusion that incorporates our hexaplexers. We see strong growth and increasing customer pull for these types of solutions in the coming years. 
We recently acquired Clean Room space near our Richardson campus to support customer demand for BAW filters, whether they be in discrete implementations, quadplexers, pentaplexers, hexaplexers, diversity receive modules or other highly integrated RF solution. The facility is already fully operational, and it's our goal to incrementally convert the facility to BAW in the back half of next calendar year to support customer BAW demand. As the industry's leading supplier of SAW, temp comp SAW and BAW devices, we are adding capacity to keep pace with the increase in customer demand for our high-, mid- and low-band products. In fact, Qorvo will soon be in production with low-band PADs, mid-band PADs and high-band PADs, all in premium-tier marquee LTE smartphones.
Before handing off the call to Steve, I want to say a quick word about our acquisition of GreenPeak Technologies, which just recently closed. GreenPeak is a recognized leader in ultra-low power, short-range RF solutions with an expanding business and customers all over the globe, a great number of whom are already purchasing high-power solutions from Qorvo. GreenPeak will become a part of IDP and will be run by Cees Links, their founder and CEO. Cees Links is a recognized industry leader, who was instrumental in the development and adoption of Wi-Fi technology. We expect GreenPeak's ultra-low-power RF solutions and SoCs for the connected home and Internet of Things to nicely complement IDP's industry-leading portfolio of high-power solutions.
We have not included any revenue from GreenPeak Technologies in our June guidance. In the September quarter, we'll have a full quarter of GreenPeak revenue, and we'll begin to include it in our guidance then. 
And with that, I'll hand the call over to Steve for a more detailed look at our financials."

Qorvo's revenue for the March quarter was $607 million, much better than typical seasonality relative to the December quarter. Mobile Products revenue declined 5% to $465 million, while IDP showed continued strength as revenue grew 9% to $142 million. Content gains in the Samsung Galaxy were the largest driver of the healthy sequential performance in Mobile. Qorvo had 3 10% customers, the largest at approximately 33% of revenue, representing the aggregated demand of multiple subcontractors for this end customer. Our other 10% customers during the quarter were Samsung and Huawei.
Gross margin was 50%, up sequentially from 47.9%, reflecting the absence of a couple of yield issues experienced in the prior quarter. Operating expenses remained relatively low at $143 million, driven by reduced variable compensation expense.
Operating income was $161 million or just over 26% of revenue. Net income for the March quarter was $143 million or $1.04 per diluted share based on 137.5 million shares outstanding. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total cash and investments were $613 million, and cash flow from operations totaled $160.5 million. Capital expenditures were $84.4 million, primarily to address growth in demand for our premium filters. The company repurchased approximately 10 million shares during the March quarter under our $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. As the actual purchase occurred about halfway through the quarter, the impact on the March quarter share count was about 5 million shares. We expect to repurchase an estimated 500,000 shares this quarter as the ASR program is completed. ASR is part of our previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program approved in November of 2015.
After giving effect to the ASR, approximately $250 million remain authorized under this program for future repurchases. We made good progress last quarter on significant long-term opportunities to improve our growth and profitability. We acquired a highly respected IoT firm, improving our SAM and growth prospects. We continue to improve both the fundamental performance capabilities of our SMR BAW process and the capacity to produce to growing customer demand. Our acquisition of a former Maxim plant just a few miles from our existing operation in Richardson will provide low-cost, Clean Room capacity for the next leg of BAW growth. We saw strong progress on large cost-reduction initiatives, 8-inch BAW wafers, 6-inch TC-SAW wafers and the in-sourcing of mobile assembly and test into our Chinese plants. It's an exciting time in RF and at Qorvo.
Now let's turn to our business outlook. Qorvo currently believes the demand environment in its end markets supports the following non-GAAP expectations for the quarter ending July 2, 2016: quarterly revenue of about $650 million, gross margin of about 50%, net interest expense of approximately $15 million, a tax rate at approximately 10%, and diluted earnings per share of approximately $1.05 based on approximately 133 million shares outstanding. Our June revenue expectations indicate healthy 7% sequential growth, reflecting our strong book of business. Actual quarterly results may differ from these expectations, and as such, differences may be material. We currently expect to report June quarter results on August 2, 2016. 
With that, I'd like to welcome your questions."

It's -- the -- for the portfolio, it's growing in June in China and, in particular, is very, very diverse; in addition to all the RF Flex and quadplexers and discrete filters and so forth that we're growing with the -- most of the China suppliers. When we look at Huawei, that's a completely different sort of dynamic. We also see them growing strongly in June. But based more on the RF Fusion portfolio, some of them more premium solutions and power management and so forth. So really, I think its fair to say our entire product portfolio is involved in one way or the other with various tiers and manufacturers throughout China. And you have to remember, of course, even the below Huawei, the other suppliers, the other leading suppliers like OPPO, vivo and Xiaomi, we have very good long-term relationships with these guys. And they're looking to expand beyond just domestic consumption and export more, which is driving a need for more premium filters and more bands in their phones. And so that just plays right into where we're investing. And then regarding your second point, yes, a very good point. Last year, we also had a very strong start to June. I think that has caused us to be pretty cautious. We are being just as -- just careful as we can to make sure we're looking at the total demand and watching for customers that might be double ordering or chasing the same slots and so forth. So we're watching that really carefully. I think another big part of last year was the MediaTek Phase 2 generation, where we were, frankly, behind by 1 or 2 quarters. And it was hard to catch up once we got there. And that's -- so this transition this time with Phase 3 and then looking into Phase 5 and Phase 6 at this time, we look very, very well aligned with MediaTek as well as the end customers."

I think they're underestimating what it's going to take, I think the amount of IP, the capacity it's going to take. We're moving to 8 inch. And the performance keeps improving generation over generation. Quite honestly, I'm not sure where they're getting the technology or where they're even have a factory to produce it. We currently do know of suppliers out there that are limited in their ability to use BAW filters, coupled with a SAW filter, and you pick it or you want the BAW on transmit or receive. So we're certainly familiar with those things but just don't see it. And as far as temp-comp SAW goes, high performance filters, whether they're BAW or temp-comp SAW, continue to expand and grow. They are bigger than Qorvo in temp-comp SAW. We are expanding capacity for programs that we've already won. Like I said, we migrated to 6 inch. We talked in the February call about how we qualified to 6-inch process. So we're first in the industry to do that. This quarter, in my opening comments, I talked about how we're ramping temp-comp SAW in Florida. And again, that's for programs we've already won.

It's a compounding effect of those with the reduced number of SKUs in the handset manufacturers' pipeline that drives the complexity up dramatically.

We'll be consolidating our gas production and do a single foundry over the next 1.5 years. In-sourcing assembly and test for a part of our mobile business, the part that used to be belonging to TriQuint. And each of these have a significant impact, which is largely going to be felt in FY '18. These will occur throughout the year, but the financial impact will be mostly in FY '18. And then we'd also simply have scale benefits of the kind of growth I referenced to earlier. We have a fair amount of fixed cost, and we will see scale benefits as we continue to grow with the market. And we'll -- we expect it'll be a 10% to 15% rate.

Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Fiscal 2016 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Revenue for the March quarter totaled $607.1 million, exceeding our quarterly guidance, reflecting increased demand for our highly integrated solutions and a return to growth in IDP broad target markets. Gross margin was 50%, up 210 basis points sequentially, reflecting crisp execution by the Qorvo team. Operating margin was 26.4%, with operating expenses of approximately $143 million, reflecting reduced variable compensation expense.
On February 17, we announced an accelerated share repurchase program; and during the March quarter, we were able to repurchase 10 million shares of common stock. We expect to repurchase an estimated 500,000 shares in the June quarter as part of the ASR, and we have $250 million that remain authorized for future repurchases. 
In Mobile Products, revenue was $465 million on the strength of content gains and smartphone program ramps. During the quarter, we launched an increasing number of highly integrated, high-performance solutions that leverage the breadth of our industry-leading portfolio of products and technology. We enjoyed strong demand for our highly integrated solutions, led by products incorporating our premium filters. We expect these highly integrated solutions will continue to drive our growth.

These tightly integrated compact solutions leveraged our BAW and temp comp SAW filters, our low-loss, high-profile SOI switches and our high-performance low-noise amplifiers to deliver performance that's unmatched by competitive solution. In the China market, the deployment of carry aggregation and the migration to 4-mode devices is increasing the demand for our RF Flex solutions, our BAW-based quadplexers and a broad variety of our antenna control solutions. 
Looking into calendar 2017, our customers in China are asking us to integrate our premium filters into RF Flex to reduce complexity and enhance smartphone performance, as carrier aggregation proliferates and bands and modes are added. Again, this strongly favors our broad product portfolio and integration capability.
In IDP, revenue grew 9% sequentially to approximately $142 million, reflecting a return to growth in IDP's broad target market. We indicated last quarter that IDP had repositioned its diverse portfolio of businesses to accelerate growth, and we've begun to see the benefit of that sharpened focus. In automotive, IDP secured a significant design win with a Tier 1 automotive supplier, meaningfully expanding our opportunity in automotive infotainment systems at several European car manufacturers.
Elsewhere in connectivity, IDP leveraged the superior performance of our integrated solutions in efficiency, thermal dissipation, range and a number of other key metrics to secure the lead position on Quantenna's QSR10G WiFi solution. This solution enables the industry's first 10G Wave 3 solution through a True 8x8 MIMO configuration for 5 gigahertz networks and a 4x4 MIMO configuration for 2.4 gigahertz networks. 
In Wireless Infrastructure, revenue grew by more than 25% sequentially, and we returned to more historic levels in our base station business.
And in GaN, we enjoyed increasing demand for Qorvo's high-frequency, high-power solutions across both infrastructure deployments and advanced defense applications. 
Across all our market, it's increasingly clear that Qorvo's industry-leading portfolio of RF products and technology represents a significant competitive advantage. Qorvo is offering our customers a combination of performance and integration that's not been available previously, putting us in a favorable position to gain content and outpace our market. Equally important is our unique ability to match the optimum technology or combination of technologies to each customer's application without bias towards any one technology or architecture.
Only Qorvo delivers a comprehensive product portfolio of filters, switches, amplifiers, LNAs and tuners with the scale, integration capabilities and system-level expertise to supply an expanding variety of highly integrated solutions. This is leading to deeper relationships with our customers, channel partners and carriers, as they see greater economic value in maximizing spectral efficiency. To monetize their respective investments, they're seeking increasingly precise, highly integrated solutions optimized to solve specific challenges related to the delivery of broadband data. Qorvo is unique in its ability to address that need. 
In both Mobile and IDP, Qorvo is leveraging our comprehensive product and technology portfolio to participate in the development of 5G standards to expand our growth opportunity. We are engaged in 5G field trials with infrastructure customers, and we are assisting in the development of key aspects of 5G next-generation wireless communication standards as a member of 3GPP.
In 2016, 3GPP is set to make significant progress in defining 5G use cases. 5G will enable speeds comparable to fixed broadband with ultralow latency and the capacity for massive scale networks, creating exciting opportunities in new markets like wireless residential broadband, autonomous driving, robotics, virtual reality, urban sensor networks and other applications leveraging deployment of a global Internet of Things ecosystem. 
In IDP, we're introducing highly differentiated products that enable customers in high-growth markets to introduce products at record speed and with higher levels of functionality. As an example, in automotive, our highly integrated solutions maximize data throughput, while solving the complex challenges related to spectrum congestion. The compound annual growth rate in automotive connectivity is forecasted to be 45% through the year 2020. And Qorvo's broad portfolio of RF solutions position us favorably for success.
Across all our markets, it's our goal to deliver breakthrough RF solutions that accelerate the delivery of broadband data and create value for our customers and our customers' customers. We intend to leverage our broad scale, industry-leading product and technology portfolio and strong organizational discipline to achieve operational excellence, capture value and deliver superior financial results. 
We prioritize our uses of cash by investing in our business to drive growth, returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and exploring opportunities for M&A to supplement growth in IDP. Since our earnings conference call last quarter, we repurchased more than 10 million shares of common stock. We made an acquisition to expand into the Internet of Things. We commenced production of 6-inch temp comp SAW in Florida and 6-inch SAW in Greensboro to support a marquee smartphone this calendar year. And we're in the final days of qualifying our 8-inch BAW process in Texas. Our BAW-based hexaplexer prototypes are demonstrating excellent performance, and we began to sample a highly integrated RF Fusion that incorporates our hexaplexers. We see strong growth and increasing customer pull for these types of solutions in the coming years. 
We recently acquired Clean Room space near our Richardson campus to support customer demand for BAW filters, whether they be in discrete implementations, quadplexers, pentaplexers, hexaplexers, diversity receive modules or other highly integrated RF solution. The facility is already fully operational, and it's our goal to incrementally convert the facility to BAW in the back half of next calendar year to support customer BAW demand. As the industry's leading supplier of SAW, temp comp SAW and BAW devices, we are adding capacity to keep pace with the increase in customer demand for our high-, mid- and low-band products. In fact, Qorvo will soon be in production with low-band PADs, mid-band PADs and high-band PADs, all in premium-tier marquee LTE smartphones.
Before handing off the call to Steve, I want to say a quick word about our acquisition of GreenPeak Technologies, which just recently closed. GreenPeak is a recognized leader in ultra-low power, short-range RF solutions with an expanding business and customers all over the globe, a great number of who are already purchasing high-power solutions from Qorvo. GreenPeak will become a part of IDP and will be run by Cees Links, their founder and CEO. Cees Links is a recognized industry leader, who was instrumental in the development and adoption of WiFi technology. We expect GreenPeak's ultra-low-power RF solutions and SoCs for the connected home and Internet of Things to nicely complement IDP's industry-leading portfolio of high-power solutions.
We have not included any revenue from GreenPeak Technologies in our June guidance. In the September quarter, we'll have a full quarter of GreenPeak revenue, and we'll begin to include it in our guidance then. 
And with that, I'll hand the call over to Steve for a more detailed look at our financials."

Mobile Products revenue declined 5% to $465 million, while IDP showed continued strength, as revenue grew 9% to $14",521,"Thanks, Bob. Qorvo's revenue for the March quarter was $607 million, much better than typical seasonality relative to the December quarter. Mobile Products revenue declined 5% to $465 million, while IDP showed continued strength, as revenue grew 9% to $142 million. Content gains in the Samsung Galaxy were the largest driver of the healthy sequential performance in Mobile. Qorvo had 3 10% customers, the largest at approximately 33% of revenue, representing the aggregated demand of multiple subcontractors for this end customer. Our other 10% customers during the quarter were Samsung and Huawei.
Gross margin was 50%, up sequentially from 47.9%, reflecting the absence of a couple of yield issues experienced in the prior quarter. Operating expenses remained relatively low at $143 million, driven by reduced variable compensation expense.
Operating income was $161 million or just over 26% of revenue. Net income for the March quarter was $143 million or $1.04 per diluted share based on 137.5 million shares outstanding. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total cash and investments were $613 million, and cash flow from operations totaled $160.5 million. Capital expenditures were $84.4 million, primarily to address growth in demand for our premium filters. The company repurchased approximately 10 million shares during the March quarter under our $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. As the actual purchase occurred about halfway through the quarter, the impact on the March quarter share count was about 5 million shares. We expect to repurchase an estimated 500,000 shares this quarter as the ASR program is completed. ASR is part of our previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program approved in November of 2015.
After giving effect to the ASR, approximately $250 million remain authorized under this program for future repurchases. We made good progress last quarter on significant long-term opportunities to improve our growth and profitability. We acquired a highly respected IoT firm, improving our SAM and growth prospects. We continue to improve both the fundamental performance capabilities of our SMR BAW process and the capacity to produce to growing customer demand. Our acquisition of a former Maxim plant just a few miles from our existing operation in Richardson will provide low-cost Clean Room capacity for the next leg of BAW growth. We saw strong progress on large cost-reduction initiatives, 8-inch BAW wafers, 6-inch TC-SAW wafers and the in-sourcing of mobile assembly and test into our Chinese plants. It's an exciting time in RF and at Qorvo.
Now let's turn to our business outlook. Qorvo currently believes the demand environment in its end markets supports the following non-GAAP expectations for the quarter ending July 2, 2016: quarterly revenue of about $650 million, gross margin of about 50%, net interest expense of approximately $15 million, a tax rate at approximately 10% and diluted earnings per share of approximately $1.05 based on approximately 133 million shares outstanding. Our June revenue expectations indicate healthy 7% sequential growth, reflecting our strong book of business. Actual quarterly results may differ from these expectations, and as such, differences may be material. We currently expect to report June quarter results on August 2, 2016. 
With that, I'd like to welcome your questions."

One is we continue to believe our market is growing at a 10% to 15% rate, and we believe we'll grow consistent with that. Second, I think we have with that growth rate a good opportunity to see fiscal year '17 earnings per share getting pretty close to $5 a share. If all goes well, we might hit that $5.

It's -- the -- for the portfolio, it's growing in June, in China particular, is very, very diverse; in addition to all the RF Flex and quadplexers and discrete filters and so forth that we're growing with the -- most of the China suppliers. When we look at Huawei, that's a completely different sort of dynamic. We also see them growing strongly in June but based more on the RF Fusion portfolio, some of them more premium solutions and power management and so forth. So really, I think its fair to say our entire product portfolio is involved in one way or the other with various tiers and manufacturers throughout China. You have to remember, of course, even below Huawei, the other suppliers, the other leading suppliers like OPPO, vivo and Xiaomi, we have very good long-term relationships with these guys. And they're looking to expand beyond just domestic consumption and export more, which is driving the need for more premium filters and more bands in their phones. And so that just plays right into where we're investing. And then regarding your second point, yes, a very good point. Last year, we also had a very strong start to June. I think that has caused us to be pretty cautious. We are being just as careful as we can to make sure we're looking at the total demand and watching for customers that might be double ordering or chasing the same slots and so forth. So we're watching that really carefully. I think another big part of last year was the MediaTek Phase 2 generation, where we were, frankly, behind by 1 or 2 quarters. And it was hard to catch up once we got there. And that's -- so this transition this time with Phase 3 and then looking into Phase 5 and Phase 6, at this time we look very, very well aligned with MediaTek as well as the end customers."

I think they're underestimating what it's going to take, I think the amount of IP, the capacity it's going to take. We're moving to 8 inch. The performance keeps improving generation over generation. Quite honestly, I'm not sure where they're getting the technology or where they even have a factory to produce it. We currently do know of suppliers out there that are limited in their ability to use BAW filters, coupled with a SAW filter, and you pick either you want the BAW in transmit or receive. So we're certainly familiar with those things, but just don't see it. And as far as temp-comp SAW goes, high performance filters, whether they're BAW or temp-comp SAW, continue to expand and grow. They are bigger than Qorvo in temp-comp SAW. We are expanding capacity for programs that we've already won. Like I said, we migrated to 6 inch. We talked in the February call about how we qualified the 6-inch process, and we're first in the industry to do that. This quarter, in my opening comments, I talked about how we're ramping temp-comp SAW in Florida. And again, that's for programs we've already won.

Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Fiscal 2016 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Revenue for the March quarter totaled $607.1 million, exceeding our quarterly guidance, reflecting increased demand for our highly integrated solutions and a return to growth in IDP broad target markets. Gross margin was 50%, up 210 basis points sequentially, reflecting crisp execution by the Qorvo team. Operating margin was 26.4%, with operating expenses of approximately $143 million, reflecting reduced variable compensation expense.
On February 17, we announced an accelerated share repurchase program; and during the March quarter, we were able to repurchase 10 million shares of common stock. We expect to repurchase an estimated 500,000 shares in the June quarter as part of the ASR, and we have $250 million that remain authorized for future repurchases. 
In Mobile Products, revenue was $465 million on the strength of content gains and smartphone program ramps. During the quarter, we launched an increasing number of highly integrated, high-performance solutions that leverage the breadth of our industry-leading portfolio of products and technology. We enjoyed strong demand for our highly integrated solutions, led by products incorporating our premium filters. We expect these highly integrated solutions will continue to drive our growth. 
Qorvo's expanding family of RF Fusion standards -- solution stands out as an example. These tightly integrated compact solutions leveraged our BAW and temp comp SAW filters, our low-loss, high-profile SOI switches and our high-performance low-noise amplifiers to deliver performance that's unmatched by competitive solution. In the China market, the deployment of carry aggregation and the migration to 4-mode devices is increasing the demand for our RF Flex solutions, our BAW-based quadplexers and a broad variety of our antenna control solutions. 
Looking into calendar 2017, our customers in China are asking us to integrate our premium filters into RF Flex to reduce complexity and enhance smartphone performance, as carrier aggregation proliferates and bands and modes are added. Again, this strongly favors our broad product portfolio and integration capability.
In IDP, revenue grew 9% sequentially to approximately $142 million, reflecting a return to growth in IDP's broad target market. We indicated last quarter that IDP had repositioned its diverse portfolio of businesses to accelerate growth, and we've begun to see the benefit of that sharpened focus. In automotive, IDP secured a significant design win with a Tier 1 automotive supplier, meaningfully expanding our opportunity in automotive infotainment systems at several European car manufacturers.
Elsewhere in connectivity, IDP leveraged the superior performance of our integrated solutions in efficiency, thermal dissipation, range and a number of other key metrics to secure the lead position on Quantenna's QSR10G WiFi solution. This solution enables the industry's first 10G Wave 3 solution through a True 8x8 MIMO configuration for 5 gigahertz networks and a 4x4 MIMO configuration for 2.4 gigahertz networks. 
In Wireless Infrastructure, revenue grew by more than 25% sequentially, and we returned to more historic levels in our base station business.
And in GaN, we enjoyed increasing demand for Qorvo's high-frequency, high-power solutions across both infrastructure deployments and advanced defense applications. 
Across all our market, it's increasingly clear that Qorvo's industry-leading portfolio of RF products and technology represents a significant competitive advantage. Qorvo is offering our customers a combination of performance and integration that's not been available previously, putting us in a favorable position to gain content and outpace our market. Equally important is our unique ability to match the optimum technology or combination of technologies to each customer's application without bias towards any one technology or architecture.
Only Qorvo delivers a comprehensive product portfolio of filters, switches, amplifiers, LNAs and tuners with the scale, integration capabilities and system-level expertise to supply an expanding variety of highly integrated solutions. This is leading to deeper relationships with our customers, channel partners and carriers, as they see greater economic value in maximizing spectral efficiency. To monetize their respective investments, they're seeking increasingly precise, highly integrated solutions optimized to solve specific challenges related to the delivery of broadband data. Qorvo is unique in its ability to address that need. 
In both Mobile and IDP, Qorvo is leveraging our comprehensive product and technology portfolio to participate in the development of 5G standards to expand our growth opportunity. We are engaged in 5G field trials with infrastructure customers, and we are assisting in the development of key aspects of 5G next-generation wireless communication standards as a member of 3GPP.
In 2016, 3GPP is set to make significant progress in defining 5G use cases. 5G will enable speeds comparable to fixed broadband with ultralow latency and the capacity for massive scale networks, creating exciting opportunities in new markets like wireless residential broadband, autonomous driving, robotics, virtual reality, urban sensor networks and other applications leveraging deployment of a global Internet of Things ecosystem. 
In IDP, we're introducing highly differentiated products that enable customers in high-growth markets to introduce products at record speed and with higher levels of functionality. As an example, in automotive, our highly integrated solutions maximize data throughput, while solving the complex challenges related to spectrum congestion. The compound annual growth rate in automotive connectivity is forecasted to be 45% through the year 2020. And Qorvo's broad portfolio of RF solutions position us favorably for success.
Across all our markets, it's our goal to deliver breakthrough RF solutions that accelerate the delivery of broadband data and create value for our customers and our customers' customers. We intend to leverage our broad scale, industry-leading product and technology portfolio and strong organizational discipline to achieve operational excellence, capture value and deliver superior financial results. 
We prioritize our uses of cash by investing in our business to drive growth, returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and exploring opportunities for M&A to supplement growth in IDP. Since our earnings conference call last quarter, we repurchased more than 10 million shares of common stock. We made an acquisition to expand into the Internet of Things. We commenced production of 6-inch temp comp SAW in Florida and 6-inch SAW in Greensboro to support a marquee smartphone this calendar year. And we're in the final days of qualifying our 8-inch BAW process in Texas. Our BAW-based hexaplexer prototypes are demonstrating excellent performance, and we began to sample a highly integrated RF Fusion that incorporates our hexaplexers. We see strong growth and increasing customer pull for these types of solutions in the coming years. 
We recently acquired Clean Room space near our Richardson campus to support customer demand for BAW filters, whether they be in discrete implementations, quadplexers, pentaplexers, hexaplexers, diversity receive modules or other highly integrated RF solution. The facility is already fully operational, and it's our goal to incrementally convert the facility to BAW in the back half of next calendar year to support customer BAW demand. As the industry's leading supplier of SAW, temp comp SAW and BAW devices, we are adding capacity to keep pace with the increase in customer demand for our high-, mid- and low-band products. In fact, Qorvo will soon be in production with low-band PADs, mid-band PADs and high-band PADs, all in premium-tier marquee LTE smartphones.
Before handing off the call to Steve, I want to say a quick word about our acquisition of GreenPeak Technologies, which just recently closed. GreenPeak is a recognized leader in ultra-low power, short-range RF solutions with an expanding business and customers all over the globe, a great number of who are already purchasing high-power solutions from Qorvo. GreenPeak will become a part of IDP and will be run by Cees Links, their founder and CEO. Cees Links is a recognized industry leader, who was instrumental in the development and adoption of WiFi technology. We expect GreenPeak's ultra-low-power RF solutions and SoCs for the connected home and Internet of Things to nicely complement IDP's industry-leading portfolio of high-power solutions.
We have not included any revenue from GreenPeak Technologies in our June guidance. In the September quarter, we'll have a full quarter of GreenPeak revenue, and we'll begin to include it in our guidance then. 
And with that, I'll hand the call over to Steve for a more detailed look at our financials."

Qorvo's revenue for the March quarter was $607 million, much better than typical seasonality relative to the December quarter. Mobile Products revenue declined 5% to $465 million, while IDP showed continued strength, as revenue grew 9% to $142 million. Content gains in the Samsung Galaxy were the largest driver of the healthy sequential performance in Mobile. Qorvo had 3 10% customers, the largest at approximately 33% of revenue, representing the aggregated demand of multiple subcontractors for this end customer. Our other 10% customers during the quarter were Samsung and Huawei.
Gross margin was 50%, up sequentially from 47.9%, reflecting the absence of a couple of yield issues experienced in the prior quarter. Operating expenses remained relatively low at $143 million, driven by reduced variable compensation expense.
Operating income was $161 million or just over 26% of revenue. Net income for the March quarter was $143 million or $1.04 per diluted share based on 137.5 million shares outstanding. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total cash and investments were $613 million, and cash flow from operations totaled $160.5 million. Capital expenditures were $84.4 million, primarily to address growth in demand for our premium filters. The company repurchased approximately 10 million shares during the March quarter under our $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. As the actual purchase occurred about halfway through the quarter, the impact on the March quarter share count was about 5 million shares. We expect to repurchase an estimated 500,000 shares this quarter as the ASR program is completed. ASR is part of our previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program approved in November of 2015.
After giving effect to the ASR, approximately $250 million remain authorized under this program for future repurchases. We made good progress last quarter on significant long-term opportunities to improve our growth and profitability. We acquired a highly respected IoT firm, improving our SAM and growth prospects. We continue to improve both the fundamental performance capabilities of our SMR BAW process and the capacity to produce to growing customer demand. Our acquisition of a former Maxim plant just a few miles from our existing operation in Richardson will provide low-cost Clean Room capacity for the next leg of BAW growth. We saw strong progress on large cost-reduction initiatives, 8-inch BAW wafers, 6-inch TC-SAW wafers and the in-sourcing of mobile assembly and test into our Chinese plants. It's an exciting time in RF and at Qorvo.
Now let's turn to our business outlook. Qorvo currently believes the demand environment in its end markets supports the following non-GAAP expectations for the quarter ending July 2, 2016: quarterly revenue of about $650 million, gross margin of about 50%, net interest expense of approximately $15 million, a tax rate at approximately 10% and diluted earnings per share of approximately $1.05 based on approximately 133 million shares outstanding. Our June revenue expectations indicate healthy 7% sequential growth, reflecting our strong book of business. Actual quarterly results may differ from these expectations, and as such, differences may be material. We currently expect to report June quarter results on August 2, 2016. 
With that, I'd like to welcome your questions."

I think it would be good -- as we look at the June guidance, we are expecting both businesses to grow in June, but I will tell you the majority of the growth is going to be coming from the Mobile business. So I'll let Eric talk a little bit about the growth."

One is we continue to believe our market is growing at a 10% to 15% rate, and we believe we'll grow consistent with that.

It's -- the -- for the portfolio, it's growing in June, in China particular, is very, very diverse; in addition to all the RF Flex and quadplexers and discrete filters and so forth that we're growing with the -- most of the China suppliers. When we look at Huawei, that's a completely different sort of dynamic. We also see them growing strongly in June but based more on the RF Fusion portfolio, some of them more premium solutions and power management and so forth. So really, I think it's fair to say our entire product portfolio is involved in one way or the other with various tiers and manufacturers throughout China. You have to remember, of course, even below Huawei, the other suppliers, the other leading suppliers like OPPO, vivo and Xiaomi, we have very good long-term relationships with these guys. And they're looking to expand beyond just domestic consumption and export more, which is driving the need for more premium filters and more bands in their phones. And so that just plays right into where we're investing. And then regarding your second point, yes, a very good point. Last year, we also had a very strong start to June. I think that has caused us to be pretty cautious. We are being just as careful as we can to make sure we're looking at the total demand and watching for customers that might be double ordering or chasing the same slots and so forth. So we're watching that really carefully. I think another big part of last year was the MediaTek Phase 2 generation, where we were, frankly, behind by 1 or 2 quarters. And it was hard to catch up once we got there. And that's -- so this transition this time with Phase 3 and then looking into Phase 5 and Phase 6, at this time we look very, very well aligned with MediaTek as well as the end customers."

I think they're underestimating what it's going to take, I think the amount of IP, the capacity it's going to take. We're moving to 8 inch. The performance keeps improving generation over generation. Quite honestly, I'm not sure where they're getting the technology or where they even have a factory to produce it. We currently do know of suppliers out there that are limited in their ability to use BAW filters, coupled with a SAW filter, and you pick either you want the BAW in transmit or receive. So we're certainly familiar with those things, but just don't see it. And as far as temp-comp SAW goes, high performance filters, whether they're BAW or temp-comp SAW, continue to expand and grow. They are bigger than Qorvo in temp-comp SAW. We are expanding capacity for programs that we've already won. Like I said, we migrated to 6 inch. We talked in the February call about how we qualified the 6-inch process, and we're first in the industry to do that.

And eventually, I'm confident they'll all have it over the next 3 to 5 years. In China alone as well, we think somewhere like 1/4 to 1/3 of even the Chinese 4G phones will have carrier aggregation in the downlink this year. So I think overall, we're still in fairly early innings. Remember, I think we talked about this at Analyst Day. It's a compounding effect of those with reduced number of SKUs in the handset manufacturers' pipeline that drives the complexity up dramatically. And so that overall trend as well, we definitely see our #2 or #3 customer, in particular, driving towards more of a global SKU like our largest customer does. And that also is still in the early innings of development."

We'll be consolidating our gas production and do a single foundry over the next 1.5 years; in-sourcing assembly and test for a part of our mobile business, the part that used to be -- belonged to TriQuint. And each of these have a significant impact, which is largely going to be felt in FY '18. These will occur throughout the year, but the financial impact will be mostly in FY '18.

Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Qorvo's Fiscal 2017 First Quarter Earnings Call. Revenue for the June quarter increased 4% year-over-year and 15% sequentially to approximately $698 million. Revenue was above our quarterly guidance p",1556,"Thanks, Doug. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Qorvo's Fiscal 2017 First Quarter Earnings Call. 
Revenue for the June quarter increased 4% year-over-year and 15% sequentially to approximately $698 million. Revenue was above our quarterly guidance provided May 4, reflecting strength in Mobile in China, a large customer smartphone ramp and growth in IDP's broad markets. During the quarter, we saw customer demand coming stronger than expected, well within lead times and we worked hard to keep up with the demand. Our customers caught on us and the Qorvo team delivered. 
Gross margin was 48.2%, reflecting low band pad business, exceeding expectations with higher than expected cost. Also, less of an impact within the mix, early yields on high-volume quadplexers for China were below plan. In both examples, these were high-volume products. 
Operating margin was 24% and operating expenses were approximately $169 million. The sequential increase in OpEx reflected higher R&D expense, increased variable compensation expense and the addition of GreenPeak Technologies. 
The company's higher R&D expense reflects increased investment in the designers of high-performance filters, SAW and BAW process engineers and associated material costs for prototypes. During the June quarter, we completed our $500 million ASR, retiring an additional 400,000 shares. 
Qorvo's June financial performance and September guidance provide context for 2 major initiatives underway: One, leveraging our BAW filter assets; and two, establishing filter independents. We expect these initiatives to support margin expansion early next year as new customer programs ramp. 
Qorvo today is number 1 or number 2 in the majority of our growth markets and we are investing to extend our leadership. We're building a technology moat to maintain leadership where we're number 1. And where we're number 2, we're investing to advance from a challenger to the leader. 
How will we do this? First, we will leverage our BAW filters. The vast majority of our customers from newcomers to market leaders are requesting more, highly integrated solutions with even greater capabilities, including: Receive diversity modules with integrated LNAs; RF Flex modules with quadplexers; RF Fusion modules with hexaplexers; Wi-Fi fence with BAW filters; and multichip modules to support massive MIMO. 
An increasing number of these solutions contain BAW filters. And BAW filters rank first among our growth drivers. BAW filters will also deliver the highest incremental margin for Qorvo. And BAW filters are the primary driver of our long term operating model. 
To keep pace with customer demand, we're staffing up our engineering teams to complete the outfit of our Richardson fab, from 6-inch to 8-inch. We're also bringing up an 8-inch line in a recently acquired fab in Farmers Ranch, Texas. 
Today, our BAW filter utilization is below optimal but we expect that to reverse as new programs ramp next year. Demand for our first quadplexers have been robust and we continue to enjoy large customer interest in our BAW-based hexaplexer prototypes. More importantly, we have delivered hexaplexer solutions utilizing our recently released next generation BAW process and customer feedback indicates we are very competitive. 
For the premium tier, we are integrating BAW-based hexaplexers into RF Fusion. And in the performance tier, we are integrating BAW-based quadplexers. 
Second, we will achieve filter independents. We believe Qorvo's growth will rely increasingly on filters and filter-based products and we're adding high-performance filter designers and SAW and BAW process engineers to in-source all filters to improve our cost, accelerate time-to-market and deliver higher value solutions. 
Today, our largest revenue product, which is growing significantly this quarter, contains third-party SAW filters. By comparison, our RF Flex modules will integrate high-performance and lower costs internally sourced BAW filters for the first time. This will significantly enhance our product margins while creating a new competitive barrier-to-entry. 
To ensure we achieve filter independents, we are increasing from 6- to 8-inch BAW in Richardson and we're increasing from 4- to 6-inch [indiscernible] SAW in Florida. In Greensboro, we are converting our 6-inch gas capacity to 10 [indiscernible] SAW and adding a new power metal process for SAW which is another Qorvo first. Of note, Qorvo's power metal processor SAW is the final process needed in our toolbox, if you will, clearing the path for us to achieve filter independence. 
We are also moving our gas capacity from North Carolina to our organ fab and transitioning our North Carolina GaN products to Texas. In China, we're bringing up our second packaged assembly and test facility, even as these efforts add to COGS and R&D today. We expect them contributing to revenue and margin expansion related to large customer opportunities slated for 2017 and '18. 
Looking at our June quarterly performance by segment, Mobile Product revenue was approximately flat year-over-year and increased 18% sequentially to $547 million. Qorvo helped launch a number of premium and performance tier smartphones and we benefited in China from a strong market and the migration from 3 mode to 4 mode smartphones for domestic and export markets. 
We saw strong demand for our recently launched quadplexers and for our second-generation RF Flex modules which launched last year. In Wi-Fi, for handsets, we enjoyed 13% growth sequentially as we ramped our highly integrated RF Fusion for mobile Wi-Fi. 
Outside of handsets, Mobile Products grew 30% versus last quarter. Across all of Mobile Products, customer order activity strengthened throughout the June quarter with many orders placed well within lead times. Through the month of July, order activity in Mobile remained very strong. It's clear to us that the demand for broadband data continues to increase with the effect amplified for RF suppliers as content per device expands. We believe the expanding market requirements for carrier aggregation in 5G, among others, will favor our unique competitive strengths and we expect this to support strong, longer-term dynamics and improving visibility in our growth drivers. 
Only Qorvo delivers a comprehensive portfolio of filters, switches, amplifiers, PMICs, LNAs and tuners with the scale, integration capabilities and system-level expertise that supply an expanding variety of highly integrated solutions. 
In IDP, revenue grew 24% year-over-year and 6% sequentially to $151 million. We're very pleased with the performance of IDP, particularly the revenue and margin performance. 
The addition of a great franchise in GreenPeak Technologies and the achievement of another strong design win quarter. GreenPeak is growing at a rapid clip and we expect this acquisition to be accretive by the end of the year. IDP continues to reposition our product portfolio to support high-growth markets. And today, they're a highly diversified business in a $3.8 billion serviceable market. IDP currently forecasts the markets they serve will grow at a compound annual rate of 17% which nearly doubles their market by 2020 to $7 billion. 
In our infrastructure unit, we continue to see a stabilization in the China base station market and strong customer activity, especially in GaN. We enjoyed robust demand for our 3.5 gigahertz GaN [indiscernible] during the quarter and we supplied duplexers, LNAs and PAs for small cell solutions at multiple base station OEM customers. 
On the design front, our GaN PAs were selected by a major infrastructure provider for a massive MIMO active antenna system. 2 global wireless infrastructure manufacturer selected our 28 gigahertz 5G base station GaN PAs and a major infrastructure provider selected our 2.6 gigahertz PA, LNA and switch for pre-5G MIMO deployment. 
In connectivity, we saw strong momentum in CPE Wi-Fi, particularly 5 gigahertz. And we layered in GreenPeak Technologies during the quarter. GreenPeak is a recognized industry leader in ultra-low-power, short-range RF communication and they expand our customer offering very nicely to include highly integrated RF systems on a chip for the connected home and Internet of things. The markets we are targeting are growing faster than 40%. 
In transport, we began the production ramp of our -- of a quadlinear 400 GB -- 400G optimal driver for a Tier 1 telecom equipment provider. We also reached record revenue levels for our CATV hybrid products driven by the industry leaders. Both support the build out of infrastructure to keep pace with the ever increasing demand for data. 
In defense, our business was up 30% year-over-year. Most of this growth has been driven by domestic active electronically scanned array radar programs and the proliferation of gallium nitride, especially for international markets. In the defense market alone, we anticipate greater than $300 million of potential opportunities for Qorvo's GaN products. 
So from a high level, whether you're looking at IDP or Mobile Products, Qorvo is delivering breakthrough RF solutions that accelerate the delivery of broadband data and create value for our customers and our customers' customers. In IDP, we're introducing breakthrough products using highly differentiated internally developed technologies that enable our customers to introduce products at record speed and with higher levels of functionality. 
In Mobile, we're leveraging the industry's most complete product and technology portfolio with our broad scale, integration capabilities and system-level expertise to offer high-performance RF solutions with unprecedented levels of integration. 
In summary, Qorvo saw customer activity accelerate as the June quarter progress and the entire Qorvo team ran hard to satisfy that demand. In the September quarter, we continue to see strong demand and support of this year's most popular devices and we're rapidly expanding our capabilities to develop new, highly integrated solutions for large customer opportunities launching in 2017 and 2018. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark."

Qorvo's non-GAAP revenue increased 15% sequentially for the June quarter to $698 million. Mobile Products revenue increased 18% sequentially to $547 million and Infrastructure and Defense Products increased 6% sequentially to $151 million. Qorvo had 3 10% customers, the largest at approximately 29% of revenue, representing the aggregated demand of multiple subcontractors for this end customer. Our other 10% customers during the quarter were Huawei and Samsung. 
Gross margin was 48.2%, impacted by low band pad business exceeding expectations with higher than expected costs. Upon transition to a more integrated modules with Qorvo produced filters and completion of our fab conversions, we expect gross margin to expand. 
Operating expenses increased to $169 million on higher R&D expenses to support ongoing development programs in premium filters, higher variable compensation expense and the addition of our GreenPeak acquisition. In the September quarter, we expect to achieve our OpEx goal of approximately 20% of sales and we expect to sustain that performance through the December quarter. 
Operating income for the June quarter was $168 million or 24% of revenue. Net income was $143 million and earnings per share was $1.08. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments was $447 million. Cash flow from operations was $59 million, reflecting the working capital build associated with higher first quarter sales and our September quarter outlook. Capital expenditures increased to $130 million primarily to address growing premium filter demand. 
During the June quarter, we completed our $500 million ASR, retiring an additional 400,000 shares. $250 million remains available under the $1 billion program authorized last November. We continue to make progress on opportunities to improve our growth and profitability. In the quarter, we acquired GreenPeak, a producer of low-power RF devices, expanded our capabilities to serve IoT markets. Our BAW products are closing in on state-of-the-art performance and we're on a measured pace to add capacity needed to meet expected customer demand for premium filters. 
As Bob mentioned, a large number of productivity projects are underway, including conversion to 8-inch BAW [indiscernible] in our Texas fab and 6-inch SAW in our Florida fab. Conversion of our North Carolina fab to TC-SAW and SAW, consolidation of our gas capacity in Oregon, migration of GaN from North Carolina to Texas; an additional mobile products assembly and test capacity in China. 
We expect these new product capabilities, capacity additions and productivity initiatives to help us sustain above market growth and drive margin expansion. Now let's turn to our business outlook. 
Qorvo currently believes customer demand supports the following non-GAAP expectations for the September quarter. Quarterly revenue between $820 million and $850 million; gross margin of approximately 47%; diluted EPS between $1.35 and $1.45; a tax rate of approximately 10%. 
Our September quarter guidance reflects strong broad-based demand. We expect gross margins to remain near the second quarter levels through the year on low band product mix and while our fab conversions are underway. We expect OpEx to trend down through the back half of the year. We project CapEx to remain elevated as we align capacity additions with stronger customer demand for premium filters and our integrated modules. 
With that, we'll open up the call to your questions."

Revenue was above our quarterly guidance",1552,"Thanks, Doug. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Qorvo's Fiscal 2017 First Quarter Earnings Call.
Revenue for the June quarter increased 4% year-over-year and 15% sequentially to approximately $698 million. Revenue was above our quarterly guidance provided May 4, reflecting strength in Mobile in China, a large customer smartphone ramp and growth in IDP's broad markets. During the quarter, we saw customer demand come in stronger than expected, well within lead times, and we worked hard to keep up with the demand. Our customers called on us, and the Qorvo team delivered.
Gross margin was 48.2%, reflecting low-band PAD business exceeding expectations with higher-than-expected cost. Also, less of an impact, but in the mix, early yields on high-volume quadplexers for China were below plan. In both examples, these were high-volume products.
Operating margin was 24%, and operating expenses were approximately $169 million. The sequential increase in OpEx reflected higher R&D expense, increased variable compensation expense and the addition of GreenPeak Technologies.
The company's higher R&D expense reflects increased investment in the designers of high-performance filters, SAW and BAW process engineers and associated material cost for prototypes. During the June quarter, we completed our $500 million ASR, retiring an additional 400,000 shares.
Qorvo's June financial performance and September guidance provide context for 2 major initiatives underway: one, leveraging our BAW filter assets; and two, establishing filter independents. We expect these initiatives to support margin expansion early next year as new customer programs ramp.
Qorvo today is #1 or #2 in the majority of our growth markets, and we are investing to extend our leadership. We are building a technology moat to maintain leadership where we're #1. And where we're #2, we're investing to advance from a challenger to the leader.
How will we do this? First, we will leverage our BAW filters. The vast majority of our customers from newcomers to market leaders are requesting more highly integrated solutions with even greater capabilities, including receive diversity modules with integrated LNAs; RF Flex modules with quadplexers; RF Fusion modules with hexaplexers; Wi-Fi FEMs with BAW filters; and multichip modules to support massive MIMO. 
An increasing number of these solutions contain BAW filters. And BAW filters rank first among our growth drivers. BAW filters will also deliver the highest incremental margin for Qorvo. And BAW filters are a primary driver of our long-term operating model.
To keep pace with customer demand, we're staffing up our engineering teams to complete the upfit of our Richardson fab from 6-inch to 8-inch. We're also bringing up an 8-inch line in our recently acquired fab in Farmers Branch, Texas.
Today, our BAW filter utilization is below optimal, but we expect that to reverse as new programs ramp next year. Demand for our first quadplexers has been robust, and we continue to enjoy large customer interest in our BAW-based hexaplexer prototypes. More importantly, we have delivered hexaplexer solutions utilizing our recently released next-generation BAW process, and customer feedback indicates we are very competitive.
For the premium tier, we are integrating BAW-based hexaplexers into RF Fusion. And in the performance tier, we are integrating BAW-based quadplexers.
Second, we will achieve filter independents. We believe Qorvo's growth will rely increasingly on filters and filter-based products, and we're adding high-performance filter designers and SAW and BAW process engineers to in-source all filters to improve our cost, accelerate time to market and deliver higher-value solutions.
Today, our largest revenue product, which is growing significantly this quarter, contains third-party SAW filters. By comparison, our RF Flex modules next year will integrate high-performance and lower cost internally sourced Qorvo filters for the first time. This will significantly enhance our product margins while creating a new competitive barrier to entry.
To ensure we achieve filter independents, we are increasing from 6- to 8-inch BAW in Richardson and we're increasing from 4- to 6-inch SAW -- temp comp SAW in Florida. In Greensboro, we're converting our 6-inch gas capacity to temp comp SAW and adding a new power metal process for SAW, which is another Qorvo first. Of note, Qorvo's power metal processor SAW is the final process needed in our toolbox, if you will, clearing the path for us to achieve filter independence.
We're also moving our gas capacity from North Carolina to our Oregon fab and transitioning our North Carolina GaN products to Texas. In China, we're bringing up our second package, assembly and test facility. Even as these efforts add to COGS and R&D today, we expect them contributing to revenue and margin expansion related to large customer opportunities slated for 2017 and '18.
Looking at our June quarterly performance by segment. Mobile Product revenue was approximately flat year-over-year and increased 18% sequentially to $547 million. Qorvo helped launch a number of premium and performance-tier smartphones, and we benefited in China from a strong market and the migration from 3-mode to 4-mode smartphones for domestic and export markets.
We saw strong demand for our recently launched quadplexers and for our second-generation RF Flex modules, which launched last year. In Wi-Fi, for handsets, we enjoyed 13% growth sequentially as we ramped our highly integrated RF Fusion for mobile Wi-Fi.
Outside of handsets, Mobile Products grew 30% versus last quarter. Across all of Mobile Products, customer order activity strengthened throughout the June quarter with many orders placed well within lead times. Through the month of July, order activity in Mobile remained very strong. It's clear to us the demand for broadband data continues to increase with the effect amplified for RF suppliers as content per device expands. We believe the expanding market requirements for carrier aggregation and 5G, among others, will favor our unique competitive strengths. And we expect this to support strong, longer-term dynamics and improving visibility in our growth drivers.
Only Qorvo delivers a comprehensive portfolio of filters, switches, amplifiers, PMICs, LNAs and tuners with the scale, integration capabilities and system-level expertise to supply an expanding variety of highly integrated solutions.
In IDP, revenue grew 24% year-over-year and 6% sequentially to $151 million. We're very pleased with the performance of IDP, particularly the revenue and margin performance, the addition of a great franchise in GreenPeak Technologies and the achievement of another strong design win quarter. GreenPeak is growing at a rapid clip, and we expect this acquisition to be accretive by the end of the year. IDP continues to reposition our product portfolio to support high-growth markets. And today, they're a highly diversified business in a $3.8 billion serviceable market. IDP currently forecasts the markets they serve will grow at a compound annual rate of 17%, which nearly doubles their market by 2020 to $7 billion.
In our infrastructure unit, we continue to see a stabilization in the China base station market and strong customer activity, especially in GaN. We enjoyed robust demand for our 3.5 gigahertz GaN PAs during the quarter, and we supplied duplexers, LNAs and PAs for small cell solutions at multiple base station OEM customers.
On the design front, our GaN PAs were selected by a major infrastructure provider for a massive MIMO active antenna system. Two global wireless infrastructure manufacturers selected our 28 gigahertz 5G base station GaN PAs, and a major infrastructure provider selected our 2.6 gigahertz PA, LNA and switch for pre-5G MIMO deployment.
In connectivity, we saw strong momentum in CPE Wi-Fi, particularly 5 gigahertz. And we layered in GreenPeak Technologies during the quarter. GreenPeak is a recognized industry leader in ultra-low-power, short-range RF communication. And they expand our customer offering very nicely to include highly integrated RF systems on a chip for the connected home and Internet of Things. The markets we are targeting are growing faster than 40%.
In transport, we began the production ramp of our -- of a quadlinear 400 gig -- 400G optical driver for a Tier 1 telecom equipment provider. We also reached record revenue levels for our CATV hybrid products driven by the industry leaders. Both support the build-out of infrastructure to keep pace with the ever-increasing demand for data.
In defense, our business was up 30% year-over-year. Most of this growth has been driven by domestic, active, electronically scanned array -- radar programs and the proliferation of gallium nitride, especially for international markets. In the defense market alone, we anticipate greater than $300 million of potential opportunities for Qorvo's GaN products.
So from a high level, whether you're looking at IDP or Mobile Products, Qorvo is delivering breakthrough RF solutions that accelerate the delivery of broadband data and create value for our customers and our customers' customers. In IDP, we're introducing breakthrough products using highly differentiated internally developed technologies that enable our customers to introduce products at record speed and with higher levels of functionality.
In Mobile, we're leveraging the industry's most complete product and technology portfolio with our broad scale, integration capabilities and system-level expertise to offer high-performance RF solutions with unprecedented levels of integration.
In summary, Qorvo saw customer order activity accelerate as the June quarter progressed, and the entire Qorvo team ran hard to satisfy that demand. In the September quarter, we continue to see strong demand and support of this year's most popular devices, and we're rapidly expanding our capabilities to develop new, highly integrated solutions for large customer opportunities launching in 2017 and 2018.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark."

Qorvo's non-GAAP revenue increased 15% sequentially for the June quarter to $698 million. Mobile Products revenue increased 18% sequentially to $547 million, and Infrastructure and Defense Products increased 6% sequentially to $151 million. Qorvo had 3 10% customers, the largest at approximately 29% of revenue, representing the aggregated demand of multiple subcontractors for this end customer. Our other 10% customers during the quarter were Huawei and Samsung.
Gross margin was 48.2%, impacted by low-band PAD business exceeding expectations with higher-than-expected cost. Upon transition to a more integrated modules with Qorvo-produced filters and completion of our fab conversions, we expect gross margin to expand.
Operating expenses increased to $169 million on higher R&D expenses to support ongoing development programs in premium filters, higher variable compensation expense and the addition of our GreenPeak acquisition. In the September quarter, we expect to achieve our OpEx goal of approximately 20% of sales, and we expect to sustain that performance through the December quarter.
Operating income for the June quarter was $168 million or 24% of revenue. Net income was $143 million and earnings per share was $1.08.
Turning to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments was $447 million. Cash flow from operations was $59 million, reflecting the working capital build associated with higher first quarter sales and our September quarter outlook. Capital expenditures increased to $130 million primarily to address growing premium filter demand.
During the June quarter, we completed our $500 million ASR, retiring an additional 400,000 shares. $250 million remains available under the $1 billion program authorized last November. We continue to make progress on opportunities to improve our growth and profitability. In the quarter, we acquired GreenPeak, a producer of low-power RF devices, expanded our capabilities to serve IoT markets. Our BAW products are closing in on state-of-the-art performance, and we're on a measured pace to add capacity needed to meet expected customer demand for premium filters.
As Bob mentioned, a large number of productivity projects are underway, including conversion to 8-inch BAW wafers in our Texas fab and 6-inch SAW in our Florida fab, conversion of our North Carolina fab to TC-SAW and SAW, consolidation of our gas capacity in Oregon, migration of GaN from North Carolina to Texas and additional mobile products assembly and test capacity in China. We expect these new product capabilities, capacity additions and productivity initiatives to help us sustain above-market growth and drive margin expansion.
Now let's turn to our business outlook. Qorvo currently believes customer demand supports the following non-GAAP expectations for the September quarter: quarterly revenue between $820 million and $850 million; gross margin of approximately 47%; diluted EPS between $1.35 and $1.45; a tax rate of approximately 10%.
Our September quarter guidance reflects strong broad-based demand. We expect gross margins to remain near the second quarter level through the year on low-band product mix and while our fab conversions are underway. We expect OpEx to trend down through the back half of the year. We project CapEx to remain elevated as we align capacity additions with stronger customer demand for premium filters and our integrated modules.
With that, we'll open up the call to your questions."

So it's got a lot of content that is not internally in our fab. So we don't see the benefit of it from a contribution margin. So that does play into it. When we have our Analyst Day, we'll outline and quantify a lot of those activities to help you model next year where we can get to on the gross margin."

And again, we'll qualify the line in '17 and be ready for production in '18. As far as what's going on in the packaging, assembly and test facility, again, that's one of the largest pre-merger synergies that we talked about is because a lot of the legacy work is outside assembly houses. And in fact, given the volume we're running right now, we have a lot of work on the outside, and that's why they're bringing up -- and we had our grand opening in [indiscernible] just a few weeks ago. And as we in-source that, that is a significant cost saving for us. As far as, yes, in Greensboro, we're starting in 6-inch with standard SAW and temp comp SAW. And it's a significant margin improvement over what we're paying outside. I'll say it that way. But it will take time to get those into the market and designed into current products. So again, much more of a 2017 story than a 2016 story. And as far as the diameters -- and you can do the math on what the savings is from 6 to 8. And we'll give you a lot more color on the timing of that at the Analyst Day. But again, most of these things really take hold in 2017. I know you had a question for Eric as well."

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Qorvo's Fiscal 2017 First Quarter Earnings Call.Revenue for the June quarter increased 4% year-over-year and 15% sequentially to approximately $698 million. Revenue was above our quarterly guidance",1553,"Thanks, Doug. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Qorvo's Fiscal 2017 First Quarter Earnings Call.
Revenue for the June quarter increased 4% year-over-year and 15% sequentially to approximately $698 million. Revenue was above our quarterly guidance provided May 4, reflecting strength in Mobile in China, a large customer smartphone ramp and growth in IDP's broad markets. During the quarter, we saw customer demand come in stronger than expected, well within lead times, and we worked hard to keep up with the demand. Our customers called on us, and the Qorvo Team delivered.
Gross margin was 48.2%, reflecting low-band PAD business exceeding expectations with higher-than-expected costs. Also, less of an impact, but in the mix, early yields on high-volume quadplexers for China were below plan. In both examples, these were high-volume products.
Operating margin was 24%, and operating expenses were approximately $169 million. The sequential increase in OpEx reflected higher R&D expense, increased variable compensation expense and the addition of GreenPeak Technologies.
The company's higher R&D expense reflects increased investment in the designers of high-performance filters, SAW and BAW process engineers and associated material costs for prototypes. During the June quarter, we completed our $500 million ASR, retiring an additional 400,000 shares.
Qorvo's June financial performance and September guidance provide context for 2 major initiatives underway: one, leveraging our BAW filter assets; and two, establishing filter independence. We expect these initiatives to support margin expansion early next year as new customer programs ramp.
Qorvo today is #1 or #2 in the majority of our growth markets, and we are investing to extend our leadership. We are building a technology moat to maintain leadership where we're #1. And where we're #2, we're investing to advance from a challenger to the leader.
How will we do this? First, we will leverage our BAW filters. The vast majority of our customers from newcomers to market leaders are requesting more highly integrated solutions with even greater capabilities, including receive diversity modules with integrated LNAs; RF Flex modules with quadplexers; RF Fusion modules with hexaplexers; Wi-Fi FEMs with BAW filters; and multichip modules to support massive MIMO. 
An increasing number of these solutions contain BAW filters. And BAW filters rank first among our growth drivers. BAW filters will also deliver the highest incremental margin for Qorvo. And BAW filters are a primary driver of our long-term operating model.
To keep pace with customer demand, we're staffing up our engineering teams to complete the upfit of our Richardson fab from 6-inch to 8-inch. We're also bringing up an 8-inch line in our recently acquired fab in Farmers Branch, Texas.
Today, our BAW filter utilization is below optimal, but we expect that to reverse as new programs ramp next year. Demand for our first quadplexers has been robust, and we continue to enjoy large customer interest in our BAW-based hexaplexer prototypes. More importantly, we have delivered hexaplexer solutions utilizing our recently released next-generation BAW process, and customer feedback indicates we are very competitive.
For the premium tier, we are integrating BAW-based hexaplexers into RF Fusion. And in the performance tier, we are integrating BAW-based quadplexers.
Second, we will achieve filter independence. We believe Qorvo's growth will rely increasingly on filters and filter-based products, and we're adding high-performance filter designers and SAW and BAW process engineers to in-source all filters to improve our cost, accelerate time to market and deliver higher-value solutions.
Today, our largest revenue product, which is growing significantly this quarter, contains third-party SAW filters. By comparison, our RF Flex modules next year will integrate high-performance and lower cost internally sourced Qorvo filters for the first time. This will significantly enhance our product margins while creating a new competitive barrier to entry.
To ensure we achieve filter independence, we are increasing from 6- to 8-inch BAW in Richardson and we're increasing from 4- to 6-inch SAW -- temp comp SAW in Florida. In Greensboro, we're converting our 6-inch gas capacity to temp comp SAW and adding a new power metal process for SAW, which is another Qorvo first. Of note, Qorvo's power metal process for SAW is the final process needed in our toolbox, if you will, clearing the path for us to achieve filter independence.
We're also moving our gas capacity from North Carolina to our Oregon fab and transitioning our North Carolina GaN products to Texas. In China, we're bringing up our second package, assembly and test facility. Even as these efforts add to COGS and R&D today, we expect them contributing to revenue and margin expansion related to large customer opportunities slated for 2017 and '18.
Looking at our June quarterly performance by segment. Mobile Product revenue was approximately flat year-over-year and increased 18% sequentially to $547 million. Qorvo helped launch a number of premium and performance-tier smartphones, and we benefited in China from a strong market and the migration from 3-mode to 4-mode smartphones for domestic and export markets.
We saw strong demand for our recently launched quadplexers and for our second-generation RF Flex modules, which launched last year. In Wi-Fi, for handsets, we enjoyed 13% growth sequentially as we ramped our highly integrated RF Fusion for mobile Wi-Fi.
Outside of handsets, Mobile Products grew 30% versus last quarter. Across all of Mobile Products, customer order activity strengthened throughout the June quarter with many orders placed well within lead times. Through the month of July, order activity in Mobile remained very strong. It's clear to us the demand for broadband data continues to increase with the effect amplified for RF suppliers as content per device expands. We believe the expanding market requirements for carrier aggregation and 5G, among others, will favor our unique competitive strengths. And we expect this to support strong, longer-term dynamics and improving visibility into our growth drivers.
Only Qorvo delivers a comprehensive portfolio of filters, switches, amplifiers, PMICs, LNAs and tuners with the scale, integration capabilities and system-level expertise to supply an expanding variety of highly integrated solutions.
In IDP, revenue grew 24% year-over-year and 6% sequentially to $151 million. We're very pleased with the performance of IDP, particularly the revenue and margin performance, the addition of a great franchise in GreenPeak Technologies and the achievement of another strong design win quarter. GreenPeak is growing at a rapid clip, and we expect this acquisition to be accretive by the end of the year. IDP continues to reposition our product portfolio to support high-growth markets. And today, they're a highly diversified business in a $3.8 billion serviceable market. IDP currently forecasts the markets they serve will grow at a compound annual rate of 17%, which nearly doubles their market by 2020 to $7 billion.
In our infrastructure unit, we continue to see a stabilization in the China base station market and strong customer activity, especially in GaN. We enjoyed robust demand for our 3.5 gigahertz GaN PAs during the quarter, and we supplied duplexers, LNAs and PAs for small cell solutions at multiple base station OEM customers.
On the design front, our GaN PAs were selected by a major infrastructure provider for a massive MIMO active antenna system. Two global wireless infrastructure manufacturers selected our 28 gigahertz 5G base station GaN PAs, and a major infrastructure provider selected our 2.6 gigahertz PA, LNA and switch for pre-5G MIMO deployment.
In connectivity, we saw strong momentum in CPE Wi-Fi, particularly 5 gigahertz. And we layered in GreenPeak Technologies during the quarter. GreenPeak is a recognized industry leader in ultra-low-power, short-range RF communications. And they expand our customer offering very nicely to include highly integrated RF systems on a chip for the connected home and Internet of Things. The markets we are targeting are growing faster than 40%.
In transport, we began the production ramp of our -- of a quadlinear 400 gig -- 400G optical driver for a Tier 1 telecom equipment provider. We also reached record revenue levels for our CATV hybrid products driven by the industry leaders. Both support the build-out of infrastructure to keep pace with the ever-increasing demand for data.
In defense, our business was up 30% year-over-year. Most of this growth has been driven by domestic, active, electronically scanned array -- radar programs and the proliferation of gallium nitride, especially for international markets. In the defense market alone, we anticipate greater than $300 million of potential opportunities for Qorvo's GaN products.
So from a high level, whether you're looking at IDP or Mobile Products, Qorvo is delivering breakthrough RF solutions that accelerate the delivery of broadband data and create value for our customers and our customers' customers. In IDP, we're introducing breakthrough products using highly differentiated internally developed technologies that enable our customers to introduce products at record speed and with higher levels of functionality.
In Mobile, we're leveraging the industry's most complete product and technology portfolio with our broad scale, integration capabilities and system-level expertise to offer high-performance RF solutions with unprecedented levels of integration.
In summary, Qorvo saw customer order activity accelerate as the June quarter progressed, and the entire Qorvo Team ran hard to satisfy that demand. In the September quarter, we continue to see strong demand and support of this year's most popular devices, and we're rapidly expanding our capabilities to develop new, highly integrated solutions for large customer opportunities launching in 2017 and 2018.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark."
33821,376364455,1022518,"Qorvo, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Qorvo, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Qorvo's non-GAAP revenue increased 15% sequentially for the June quarter to $698 million. Mobile Products revenue increased 18% sequentially to $547 million, and Infrastructure and Defense Products increased 6% sequentially to $151 million. Q",528,"Thanks, Bob. Qorvo's non-GAAP revenue increased 15% sequentially for the June quarter to $698 million. Mobile Products revenue increased 18% sequentially to $547 million, and Infrastructure and Defense Products increased 6% sequentially to $151 million. Qorvo had 3 10% customers, the largest at approximately 29% of revenue, representing the aggregated demand of multiple subcontractors for this end customer. Our other 10% customers during the quarter were Huawei and Samsung.
Gross margin was 48.2%, impacted by low-band PAD business exceeding expectations with higher-than-expected costs. Upon transition to a more integrated modules with Qorvo-produced filters and completion of our fab conversions, we expect gross margin to expand.
Operating expenses increased to $169 million on higher R&D expenses to support ongoing development programs in premium filters, higher variable compensation expense and the addition of our GreenPeak acquisition. In the September quarter, we expect to achieve our OpEx goal of approximately 20% of sales, and we expect to sustain that performance through the December quarter.
Operating income for the June quarter was $168 million or 24% of revenue. Net income was $143 million and earnings per share was $1.08.
Turning to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments was $447 million. Cash flow from operations was $59 million, reflecting the working capital build associated with higher first quarter sales and our September quarter outlook. Capital expenditures increased to $130 million primarily to address growing premium filter demand.
During the June quarter, we completed our $500 million ASR, retiring an additional 400,000 shares. $250 million remains available under the $1 billion program authorized last November. We continue to make progress on opportunities to improve our growth and profitability. In the quarter, we acquired GreenPeak, a producer of low-power RF devices, expanded our capabilities to serve IoT markets. Our BAW products are closing in on state-of-the-art performance, and we're on a measured pace to add capacity needed to meet expected customer demand for premium filters.
As Bob mentioned, a large number of productivity projects are underway, including conversion to 8-inch BAW wafers in our Texas fab and 6-inch SAW in our Florida fab, conversion of our North Carolina fab to TC-SAW and SAW, consolidation of our gas capacity in Oregon, migration of GaN from North Carolina to Texas and additional mobile products assembly and test capacity in China. We expect these new product capabilities, capacity additions and productivity initiatives to help us sustain above-market growth and drive margin expansion.
Now let's turn to our business outlook. Qorvo currently believes customer demand supports the following non-GAAP expectations for the September quarter: quarterly revenue between $820 million and $850 million; gross margin of approximately 47%; diluted EPS between $1.35 and $1.45; a tax rate of approximately 10%.
Our September quarter guidance reflects strong broad-based demand. We expect gross margins to remain near the second quarter level through the year on low-band product mix and while our fab conversions are underway. We expect OpEx to trend down through the back half of the year. We project CapEx to remain elevated as we align capacity additions with stronger customer demand for premium filters and our integrated modules.
With that, we'll open up the call to your questions."

As far as what's going on in the packaging, assembly and test facility, again, that's one of the largest pre-merger synergies that we talked about is because a lot of the legacy work is at outside assembly houses. And in fact, given the volume we're running right now, we have a lot of work on the outside, and that's why they're bringing up -- and we had our grand opening in Dezhou just a few weeks ago. And as we in-source that, that is a significant cost savings for us. As far as, yes, in Greensboro, we're starting in 6-inch with standard SAW and temp-comp SAW. And it's a significant margin improvement over what we're paying outside. I'll say it that way. But it will take time to get those into the market and designed into current products. So again, much more of a 2017 story than a 2016 story. And as far as the diameters -- and you can do the math on what the savings is from 6 to 8.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Qorvo's Fiscal 2017 First Quarter Earnings Call.Revenue for the June quarter increased 4% year-over-year and 15% sequentially to approximately $698 million. Revenue was above our quarterly guidance",1553,"Thanks, Doug. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Qorvo's Fiscal 2017 First Quarter Earnings Call.
Revenue for the June quarter increased 4% year-over-year and 15% sequentially to approximately $698 million. Revenue was above our quarterly guidance provided May 4, reflecting strength in Mobile in China, a large customer smartphone ramp and growth in IDP's broad markets. During the quarter, we saw customer demand come in stronger than expected, well within lead times, and we worked hard to keep up with the demand. Our customers called on us, and the Qorvo Team delivered.
Gross margin was 48.2%, reflecting low-band PAD business exceeding expectations with higher-than-expected costs. Also, less of an impact, but in the mix, early yields on high-volume quadplexers for China were below plan. In both examples, these were high-volume products.
Operating margin was 24%, and operating expenses were approximately $169 million. The sequential increase in OpEx reflected higher R&D expense, increased variable compensation expense and the addition of GreenPeak Technologies.
The company's higher R&D expense reflects increased investment in the designers of high-performance filters, SAW and BAW process engineers and associated material costs for prototypes. During the June quarter, we completed our $500 million ASR, retiring an additional 400,000 shares.
Qorvo's June financial performance and September guidance provide context for 2 major initiatives underway: one, leveraging our BAW filter assets; and two, establishing filter independence. We expect these initiatives to support margin expansion early next year as new customer programs ramp.
Qorvo today is #1 or #2 in the majority of our growth markets, and we are investing to extend our leadership. We are building a technology moat to maintain leadership where we're #1. And where we're #2, we're investing to advance from a challenger to the leader.
How will we do this? First, we will leverage our BAW filters. The vast majority of our customers from newcomers to market leaders are requesting more highly integrated solutions with even greater capabilities, including receive diversity modules with integrated LNAs; RF Flex modules with quadplexers; RF Fusion modules with hexaplexers; Wi-Fi FEMs with BAW filters; and multichip modules to support massive MIMO. 
An increasing number of these solutions contain BAW filters. And BAW filters rank first among our growth drivers. BAW filters will also deliver the highest incremental margin for Qorvo. And BAW filters are a primary driver of our long-term operating model.
To keep pace with customer demand, we're staffing up our engineering teams to complete the upfit of our Richardson fab from 6-inch to 8-inch. We're also bringing up an 8-inch line in our recently acquired fab in Farmers Branch, Texas.
Today, our BAW filter utilization is below optimal, but we expect that to reverse as new programs ramp next year. Demand for our first quadplexers has been robust, and we continue to enjoy large customer interest in our BAW-based hexaplexer prototypes. More importantly, we have delivered hexaplexer solutions utilizing our recently released next-generation BAW process, and customer feedback indicates we are very competitive.
For the premium tier, we are integrating BAW-based hexaplexers into RF Fusion. And in the performance tier, we are integrating BAW-based quadplexers.
Second, we will achieve filter independence. We believe Qorvo's growth will rely increasingly on filters and filter-based products, and we're adding high-performance filter designers and SAW and BAW process engineers to in-source all filters to improve our cost, accelerate time to market and deliver higher-value solutions.
Today, our largest revenue product, which is growing significantly this quarter, contains third-party SAW filters. By comparison, our RF Flex modules next year will integrate high-performance and lower cost internally sourced Qorvo filters for the first time. This will significantly enhance our product margins while creating a new competitive barrier to entry.
To ensure we achieve filter independence, we are increasing from 6- to 8-inch BAW in Richardson and we're increasing from 4- to 6-inch SAW -- temp comp SAW in Florida. In Greensboro, we're converting our 6-inch gas capacity to temp comp SAW and adding a new power metal process for SAW, which is another Qorvo first. Of note, Qorvo's power metal process for SAW is the final process needed in our toolbox, if you will, clearing the path for us to achieve filter independence.
We're also moving our gas capacity from North Carolina to our Oregon fab and transitioning our North Carolina GaN products to Texas. In China, we're bringing up our second package, assembly and test facility. Even as these efforts add to COGS and R&D today, we expect them contributing to revenue and margin expansion related to large customer opportunities slated for 2017 and '18.
Looking at our June quarterly performance by segment. Mobile Product revenue was approximately flat year-over-year and increased 18% sequentially to $547 million. Qorvo helped launch a number of premium and performance-tier smartphones, and we benefited in China from a strong market and the migration from 3-mode to 4-mode smartphones for domestic and export markets.
We saw strong demand for our recently launched quadplexers and for our second-generation RF Flex modules, which launched last year. In Wi-Fi, for handsets, we enjoyed 13% growth sequentially as we ramped our highly integrated RF Fusion for mobile Wi-Fi.
Outside of handsets, Mobile Products grew 30% versus last quarter. Across all of Mobile Products, customer order activity strengthened throughout the June quarter with many orders placed well within lead times. Through the month of July, order activity in Mobile remained very strong. It's clear to us the demand for broadband data continues to increase with the effect amplified for RF suppliers as content per device expands. We believe the expanding market requirements for carrier aggregation and 5G, among others, will favor our unique competitive strengths. And we expect this to support strong, longer-term dynamics and improving visibility into our growth drivers.
Only Qorvo delivers a comprehensive portfolio of filters, switches, amplifiers, PMICs, LNAs and tuners with the scale, integration capabilities and system-level expertise to supply an expanding variety of highly integrated solutions.
In IDP, revenue grew 24% year-over-year and 6% sequentially to $151 million. We're very pleased with the performance of IDP, particularly the revenue and margin performance, the addition of a great franchise in GreenPeak Technologies and the achievement of another strong design win quarter. GreenPeak is growing at a rapid clip, and we expect this acquisition to be accretive by the end of the year. IDP continues to reposition our product portfolio to support high-growth markets. And today, they're a highly diversified business in a $3.8 billion serviceable market. IDP currently forecasts the markets they serve will grow at a compound annual rate of 17%, which nearly doubles their market by 2020 to $7 billion.
In our infrastructure unit, we continue to see a stabilization in the China base station market and strong customer activity, especially in GaN. We enjoyed robust demand for our 3.5 gigahertz GaN PAs during the quarter, and we supplied duplexers, LNAs and PAs for small cell solutions at multiple base station OEM customers.
On the design front, our GaN PAs were selected by a major infrastructure provider for a massive MIMO active antenna system. Two global wireless infrastructure manufacturers selected our 28 gigahertz 5G base station GaN PAs, and a major infrastructure provider selected our 2.6 gigahertz PA, LNA and switch for pre-5G MIMO deployment.
In connectivity, we saw strong momentum in CPE Wi-Fi, particularly 5 gigahertz. And we layered in GreenPeak Technologies during the quarter. GreenPeak is a recognized industry leader in ultra-low-power, short-range RF communications. And they expand our customer offering very nicely to include highly integrated RF systems on a chip for the connected home and Internet of Things. The markets we are targeting are growing faster than 40%.
In transport, we began the production ramp of our -- of a quadlinear 400 gig -- 400G optical driver for a Tier 1 telecom equipment provider. We also reached record revenue levels for our CATV hybrid products driven by the industry leaders. Both support the build-out of infrastructure to keep pace with the ever-increasing demand for data.
In defense, our business was up 30% year-over-year. Most of this growth has been driven by domestic, active, electronically scanned array -- radar programs and the proliferation of gallium nitride, especially for international markets. In the defense market alone, we anticipate greater than $300 million of potential opportunities for Qorvo's GaN products.
So from a high level, whether you're looking at IDP or Mobile Products, Qorvo is delivering breakthrough RF solutions that accelerate the delivery of broadband data and create value for our customers and our customers' customers. In IDP, we're introducing breakthrough products using highly differentiated internally developed technologies that enable our customers to introduce products at record speed and with higher levels of functionality.
In Mobile, we're leveraging the industry's most complete product and technology portfolio with our broad scale, integration capabilities and system-level expertise to offer high-performance RF solutions with unprecedented levels of integration.
In summary, Qorvo saw customer order activity accelerate as the June quarter progressed, and the entire Qorvo Team ran hard to satisfy that demand. In the September quarter, we continue to see strong demand and support of this year's most popular devices, and we're rapidly expanding our capabilities to develop new, highly integrated solutions for large customer opportunities launching in 2017 and 2018.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark."
33821,376364455,1022723,"Qorvo, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Qorvo, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Qorvo's non-GAAP revenue increased 15% sequentially for the June quarter to $698 million. Mobile Products revenue increased 18% sequentially to $547 million, and Infrastructure and Defense Products increased 6% sequentially to $151 million. Q",528,"Thanks, Bob. Qorvo's non-GAAP revenue increased 15% sequentially for the June quarter to $698 million. Mobile Products revenue increased 18% sequentially to $547 million, and Infrastructure and Defense Products increased 6% sequentially to $151 million. Qorvo had 3 10% customers, the largest at approximately 29% of revenue, representing the aggregated demand of multiple subcontractors for this end customer. Our other 10% customers during the quarter were Huawei and Samsung.
Gross margin was 48.2%, impacted by low-band PAD business exceeding expectations with higher-than-expected costs. Upon transition to a more integrated modules with Qorvo-produced filters and completion of our fab conversions, we expect gross margin to expand.
Operating expenses increased to $169 million on higher R&D expenses to support ongoing development programs in premium filters, higher variable compensation expense and the addition of our GreenPeak acquisition. In the September quarter, we expect to achieve our OpEx goal of approximately 20% of sales, and we expect to sustain that performance through the December quarter.
Operating income for the June quarter was $168 million or 24% of revenue. Net income was $143 million and earnings per share was $1.08.
Turning to the balance sheet. Total cash and short-term investments was $447 million. Cash flow from operations was $59 million, reflecting the working capital build associated with higher first quarter sales and our September quarter outlook. Capital expenditures increased to $130 million primarily to address growing premium filter demand.
During the June quarter, we completed our $500 million ASR, retiring an additional 400,000 shares. $250 million remains available under the $1 billion program authorized last November. We continue to make progress on opportunities to improve our growth and profitability. In the quarter, we acquired GreenPeak, a producer of low-power RF devices, expanded our capabilities to serve IoT markets. Our BAW products are closing in on state-of-the-art performance, and we're on a measured pace to add capacity needed to meet expected customer demand for premium filters.
As Bob mentioned, a large number of productivity projects are underway, including conversion to 8-inch BAW wafers in our Texas fab and 6-inch SAW in our Florida fab, conversion of our North Carolina fab to TC-SAW and SAW, consolidation of our gas capacity in Oregon, migration of GaN from North Carolina to Texas and additional mobile products assembly and test capacity in China. We expect these new product capabilities, capacity additions and productivity initiatives to help us sustain above-market growth and drive margin expansion.
Now let's turn to our business outlook. Qorvo currently believes customer demand supports the following non-GAAP expectations for the September quarter: quarterly revenue between $820 million and $850 million; gross margin of approximately 47%; diluted EPS between $1.35 and $1.45; a tax rate of approximately 10%.
Our September quarter guidance reflects strong broad-based demand. We expect gross margins to remain near the second quarter level through the year on low-band product mix and while our fab conversions are underway. We expect OpEx to trend down through the back half of the year. We project CapEx to remain elevated as we align capacity additions with stronger customer demand for premium filters and our integrated modules.
With that, we'll open up the call to your questions."

As far as what's going on in the packaging, assembly and test facility, again, that's one of the largest pre-merger synergies that we talked about is because a lot of the legacy work is at outside assembly houses. And in fact, given the volume we're running right now, we have a lot of work on the outside, and that's why they're bringing up -- and we had our grand opening in Dezhou just a few weeks ago. And as we in-source that, that is a significant cost savings for us. As far as, yes, in Greensboro, we're starting in 6-inch with standard SAW and temp-comp SAW. And it's a significant margin improvement over what we're paying outside. I'll say it that way. But it will take time to get those into the market and designed into current products.

Very few people can manufacture them. It's not commoditized, and there's not a pricing issue going on here at all. Because they're incredibly hard to manufacture, we're having some yields ramping a new one and especially with, again, our new wafer line in it. So why we're in the low-band PAD business -- it's actually a premium product category, and we see a lot of customers now asking us and giving us the opportunity to do the entire RF front end.

Given your legacy and how long you've been in this technology, what's changed, Eric, that made this more difficult part -- just the filter itself, forget the module."

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Qorvo's Fiscal 2017 Second Quarter Earnings Call. 
Revenue for Qorvo's fiscal second quarter increased 24% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to approximately $864 million. Revenue was above our quarterly guidance provided August 2, reflecting broad based demand. Gross margin for the quarter was approximately 43%. Within the quarter, we experienced lower-than-expected manufacturing yields due to a steep product ramp to a large customer. To protect our long-term customer relationships, we did everything we could to assure supply of high-quality material to the customer while working through the internal yield issues. And this significantly impacted our gross margin. 
Operating expenses were $172.9 million, in line with our goal of 20% of sales. On the bottom line, earnings were $1.29 per share, an increase of 19% versus our prior quarter.
Mark will walk you though additional details in a moment and provide a bridge to our margin expectations. In the meantime, I will update you on some other major initiatives currently underway. 
During the September quarter, we brought up and released our TC-SAW process in Greensboro ahead of schedule, giving us the ability to support additional customer demand this quarter. We are increasing the mix of 6-inch TC-SAW in Florida, while moving all GaAs capacity to Oregon, transitioning all GaN products to Richardson. We also ramping our new assembly and test facility in [indiscernible], China. In Richardson, the organization has done an outstanding job, releasing our most advanced next generation BAW process which delivers a significant improvement over our prior generation in key performance metrics. We've also brought up and are now designing products on our new 8-inch BAW line in Richardson. We are enjoying broad-based demand for our BAW filter solutions and we expect the ramp of new customer programs to improve our utilization rates in calendar 2017. Notably, we continued to enjoy strong demand for our BAW based multiplexer solutions and we have delivered module prototypes containing our BAW-based hexaplexers. 
Looking at quarterly performance by segment. Mobile Products grew approximately 22% year-over-year and 29% sequentially to a record $706 million, Mobile Products supported the launch of highly popular, premium tier smartphones. And in the performance tier smartphones, we enjoyed strong demand for RF Flex Solutions. And Wi-Fi for handsets, Qorvo's RF Fusion for mobile Wi-Fi delivered customers a unique, highly integrated solution, combining our high-performance BAW filters with our Wi-Fi front-end modules. In China, mobile products is benefiting as smartphone manufacturers migrate from 3-mode to full mode devices. By the end of this year, we expect more than half of all 4G smartphones manufactured for the China market will be full mode. Our largest customers in China are looking for ways to introduce fewer models with higher levels of RF content to provide broader coverage of additional geographies as they move towards more of an export market. 
Huawei stands out as an excellent example. They're adding more RF content to their smartphones as they build their global brand. Huawei was one of two 10% customers for Qorvo in our fiscal second quarter and they are our largest customer in China. 
Finally, the expanding market requirements for carrier aggregation and the upcoming deployment of 5G favor our unique combination of competitive strengths. Only Qorvo delivers a comprehensive portfolio of filters, switches, amplifiers, envelope trackers, LNAs and tuners with the scale, integration capabilities and system-level expertise to supply a complete portfolio of highly integrated solutions. 
Looking at IDP. Revenue grew 22% year-over-year and 5% sequentially to $158 million as our focus on higher growth segments continued to bear fruit. We are very pleased with the performance of IDP. In particular, the revenue growth, the initiatives to target faster growing market segments and the rate and pace of new product introductions, IDP has enjoyed a series of very strong quarters and is closing in on its margin model of 60% gross margin and 30% operating margin. IDP is a recognized global leader with a product and technology leadership strategy that leverages internally developed best-in-class technologies to provide our customers with differentiated performance solutions. IDP is highly diversified and competes in a $3.8 billion serviceable market that's forecast by industry analysts to grow at a compound annual rate of 17%, nearly doubling to $7 billion by 2020. In September, IDP released 49 new products, including power amplifiers for small cell, dual and quad linear drivers for [indiscernible] applications, LNAs and filters for automotive and integrated front end modules for Wi-Fi. The continued aggressive pace of product releases is creating a broad-based pipeline of differentiated solutions with long production tales across our portfolio of markets. 
IDP's strong performance last quarter was across all major market segments, highlighted by growth in Wireless Infrastructure, Wi-Fi, Defense and Aerospace, as well as the IoT. 
We've seen a continued recovery in the base station market and we enjoyed broad-based market share across all OEMs. This helps buffer IDP from the ups and downs experienced by any one customer. Our view on the overall base station market is cautiously optimistic. We are continuing our focus on the market's higher growth segments, with an emphasis on the transition of base station power amplifiers to GaN technology and the implementation of massive MIMO. 
In connectivity, IDP enjoyed growth in both Wi-Fi and low power wireless. With the acquisition of GreenPeak, Qorvo is a recognized leader at ultralow power, short-range RF communications. We are expanding our low product portfolio to include highly integrated RF systems on a chip for the connected home and the Internet of Things. And our target markets are growing faster than 40%. 
In Wi-Fi, our growth was supported by continued wins in both the retail and set-top box market segments. 
In transport, growth was driven by strength in our cable TV products to support the rollout of DOCSIS 3.1, our traditional long-haul optical driver business and ramping data center interconnect products. Qorvo's transport business is at the forefront of the buildout of infrastructure to keep pace with the ever increasing demand for data and we continue to see an expanding set of opportunities. 
In defense, our growth was driven by international and domestic GaN on silicon carbide sales, and a major aces program ramping. Design wins for our GaN on silicon carbide devices have been exceptionally strong and the market segments that are growing at over 25% per year. 
In summary, the Qorvo Team did an excellent job, delivering 22% year-over-year growth and achieving our goal of operating expenses at 20% of sales. At the same time, we made progress advancing core technologies and developing highly integrated Qorvo solutions for large customer opportunities in 2017 and 2018. It's clear we have work to do on our gross margin and we're taking steps to address it. We continue to drive to our operating model, including above revenue growth and operating income above 30%. 
Now before turning the call over to Mark, let's view our achievements and our comments today through the prism of Qorvo's long-term strategy. 
Qorvo's growth strategy is based on three core principles. First, leverage our differentiated technologies and product leadership to achieve operational excellence, capture value and deliver superior financial results. Second, drive the integration of our two predecessor companies to achieve, as Qorvo, what neither could achieve alone. Third, prioritize the use of cash on investments that grow our business, return capital to our stockholders through share repurchases and supplement growth in IDP through M&A. 
Our long-term view of the RF industry envisions more modes, more bands, more complexity and more RF, all driven by the ever increasing demand for data and the limited frequency spectrum available to support that demand. 
In Mobile Products, only Qorvo can deliver a complete suite of multimode, multiband solutions combining premium BAW and [indiscernible] SAW filters, SAW filters, broadband power amplifiers, high pro count switches, high-performance LNAs, envelope trackers and antenna control solutions. And Qorvo is the only industry participant positioning itself to supply internally developed, internally manufactured and internally assembled system-level solutions serving all major cellular frequencies. 
We see growing demand for low, mid and high frequency RF solutions sales in the performance tier as new cellular bands limit board space and pressure our customers product development cycles. In the premium tier, we anticipate demand for multiple customers for highly compact, single placement solutions combining coverage of mid and high frequencies. To be clear, this will require more TC-SAW and BAW, a distinct advantage for Qorvo. 
In IDP, our investments in internally developed best-in-class technologies, our sharpened focus on higher margin, higher growth markets and our introduction of hundreds of new products annually are combining to support excellent growth opportunities. These opportunities are underpinned by large secular trends extending into the foreseeable future. They include: high-speed connectivity, the Internet of things, the connected car, data centers and the proliferation of phased array technologies. In Wireless Infrastructure, cable TV and defense applications, we expect our GaN technology to be increasingly disruptive. 
So from a high level, Qorvo has assembled the technology, products, people and resources to deliver best-in-class, highly integrated systems level solutions. We are investing in highly differentiated internally sourced technologies, best-in-class products, adding manufacturing capacity to keep pace with customer demand and we are leveraging our unique combination of competitive strengths to drive above market growth. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark."

Qorvo's second quarter non-GAAP revenue increased 24% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to $864 million. Mobile Products revenue increased 29% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to $706 million on continued RF",1136,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Qorvo's second quarter non-GAAP revenue increased 24% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to $864 million. Mobile Products revenue increased 29% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to $706 million on continued RF content growth, the ramp of the key customer product and strong Asia customer demand. 
Infrastructure and Defense Products revenue increased 5% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to $158 million, on higher Wireless Infrastructure, Wi-Fi, Defense and Aerospace and IoT. 
We believe Qorvo is well-positioned to continue to outpace the market growth due to our strong technology position, comprehensive product portfolio and broad supply capabilities. 
Gross margin was near 43% and most negatively impacted by manufacturing yield issues on our highest volume part in the quarter. Manufacturing yield issues on this part, a low-band PAD module, were related to SAW filters from a single fab. The impact was contained within Qorvo and yields have stabilized in the fab which will help support even stronger customer demand for that module in the third quarter. 
During the third quarter, we do expect margins to improve on more stable production. However, higher mix of the low-band PAD will partially offset the improvement. Operating expenses were at our target 20% of sales or $173 million. During the quarter, we had higher expenses to support ongoing development programs, higher sales commissions and the full quarter effects of our GreenPeak acquisition. 
Operating income for the quarter was approximately $197 million, with margins negatively impacted by the gross margin effects discussed. Non-GAAP net income was $170 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.29. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash increased to $469 million. Cash flow from operations was $250 million on income growth and efficient working capital management, particularly inventories. Capital expenditures of $120 million are largely addressing growing premium filter demand through SAW investments in North Carolina and BAW investments in Texas. We yielded $130 million of free cash flow in the quarter. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 91 million of shares. And today, we announced the approval of a new $500 million share repurchase program. We intend to commence buying under this program when our window opens as part of an ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders. 
Now let's turn to our business outlook. Qorvo currently believes customer demand supports the following non-GAAP expectations for the December quarter: quarterly revenue between $800 million and $840 million; sequential gross margin expansion of 100 to 200 basis points; diluted EPS between $1.15 and $1.35; tax rate of approximately 8%. 
Our December quarter guidance reflects continued strong demand with projected year-over-year sales growth over 30%. We currently expect gross margins to improve from the second quarter and through the second half of the fiscal year '17 as our mix of low-band PAD peaks in the third quarter and our operation stabilize. We expect OpEx to remain in their 20% of sales in the third quarter and trend down $1 for the rest of the fiscal year on lower commissions and an increase in productivity initiatives. CapEx will remain elevated through the rest of the fiscal year as we invest in premium filter capacity to support forecasted customer demand. 
As I close out my first quarter at Qorvo, I'd like to share my initial observations on the company and provide a longer-term outlook on the business. I believe Qorvo is exceptionally well positioned to address rapidly growing RF demand and the design and production challenges posed by growing RF module complexity. Qorvo has the key technologies, best-in-class design resources, advanced production capabilities and high-quality employees to succeed. While the company has all the pieces to deliver extraordinary shareholder value, we have to improve our execution to reach this potential. The integration has gone well in many ways, validated our vision for the combined company and yielded a common culture and synergies. But there is more that can be done on both the integration and general productivity. For example, this past quarter was the first full quarter in which most of the company was on a common ERP system. Going forward, we expect that improved visibility, increased financial discipline and rigor and a broad-based commitment to operational excellence will help drive additional synergies and improve our financial performance. 
I'm enthusiastic about Qorvo's future and pleased to be able to contribute to efforts to improve the operating discipline and efficiency of the company. Within 6 quarters, we expect to be at our target operating performance. We currently expect double-digit sales growth to continue through fiscal 2018 and forecast over 30% operating margins by the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. The Mobile Products segment is projected to benefit from continued content growth and demand for more complex modules using our premium filters. Our Infrastructure and Defense Products segment has been repositioned to serve higher growth markets, including Wi-Fi, automotive, IoT and Wireless Infrastructure. 
Looking forward through fiscal year '18, we expect IDP's growth to be in line with Mobile Products. For the rest of this fiscal year, we expect our margins will improve as operations stabilize and low-band PAD mix declines. We expect to exit fiscal year '17 above 46% margins and we believe that additional yield improvements, factory loading, sourcing and other productivity initiatives will help drive margin expansion in fiscal year 2018. Factory yield improvements from process maturity and larger wafer production in SAW and BAW are expected to add approximately 100 basis points to gross margin in fiscal year '18. Higher volumes are projected to add over 150 basis points of margin based on higher utilization of our BAW, SAW and GaAs lines as well as ramping our new [indiscernible] assembly and test facility. Next year, considering projected volumes and the impacts of consolidation efforts and measured capacity additions, we expect our global operations to be running near capacity. Finally, we project that ongoing supply chain consolidation and procurement initiatives, along with additional efforts to wring out merger savings, should drive another 150 basis points of gross margin expansion. 
Together, by the end of fiscal year '18, we expect these efforts and a more favorable mix of higher margin products should result in greater than 50% gross margins. In fiscal year '18, our OpEx is expected to grow at no more than half the rate of sales, which will drive OpEx to under 20% of sales. The operating model Bob mentioned is intact. It's a focus and imperative for our business team. And a goal we expect to achieve. We plan to exit fiscal year '18 at over 50% gross margins, OpEx below 20% of sales and operating margins over 30%. Achieving this performance will generate substantial free cash flow which we plan to use for acquisitions and returning capital to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

So we had very good visibility so that the walk I did initially, walks to 200 basis points sequential improvement, combination of better yield in the third quarter, fewer associated inventory write-offs and then we lose some ground related to the higher volume associated with the lower margin part, so just a mix issue. So that's a 200 basis point sequential improvement. We gave a range of 100 to 200 to deal with the fact that, listen, we're doing record volumes and we want to make sure that we meet our commitments and we have good line of sight to what the midpoint would be, 150 basis points. As far as the longer-term view, we've done a great deal of work to walk back up to margins that we used to be and how are we going to get there. And as we pointed out in several calls, including today, we have a large number of initiatives underway which begin to bear fruit. Well, they've benefited us recently, but they continue to bear fruit through '18 as our facilities are more mature, as they're fully loaded and our product mix turns over to higher value parts. So we feel confident in the business model and our gross margin objective in the fourth quarter of 2018."

We did have yet another fantastic quarter growth with our China-based customer set. Of course, while it was a 10% customer for the company, but beyond Huawei's, well with Oppo and Vivo and many others in China, we did benefit from the trend of higher dollar content in the RFs. We are expecting exiting the year at over half the phones consumed in China will now be full mode phones. We are also seeing many of our customers looking to export and reducing their SKU count, which of course, those 2 things together, drive up our content further as we look into next year. So for the December quarter specifically, to your question, we're remaining cautious on China and being careful for any inventory pockets that might be out there. We see some customer-specific issues but our products are used across all of our set so we expect to work through that in December and then back to growth next year."

So we did identify the fact that our yield was lower-than-expected. To go a little deeper than that, specific to the die level yield within the SAW and TC-SAW manufacturing process, I should be clear, it's not related to a design issue. In fact, this is related to the filter resonators themselves. It's really contained within the die simulation process and wafer level packaging. The fact is we had a very steep ramp, the volume was heavily loaded towards the back of the quarter. Our die level screens that we have in place in the factory did not catch the issue and so we found it once we had assembled the modules completely and we're well under production. Our top priority of course was protecting our customers lines. We made sure that they had good material. It resulted in great many modules that needed to be scrapped to finish that good level. However, by now we have produced, as you can imagine, tens of millions of the part. We understand the problem very well. We now have new die level screens which are targeting the issue and working effectively. So I think it's behind us. To your point, we can't make changes in the actual manufacturing process now that we're in production. We do have some ability to make incremental improvements from here which we're going to do. But products that we release from this point forward will have improved manufacturing process and not be a subject to this yield at all."

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Qorvo's Fiscal 2017 Second Quarter Earnings Call.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Qorvo's Fiscal 2017 Second Quarter Earnings Call. 
Revenue for Qorvo's fiscal second quarter increased 24% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to approximately $864 million. Revenue was above our quarterly guidance provided August 2, reflecting broad based demand. Gross margin for the quarter was approximately 43%. Within the quarter, we experienced lower-than-expected manufacturing yields during a steep product ramp to a large customer. To protect our long-term customer relationships, we did everything we could to assure supply of high-quality material to the customer while working through the internal yield issues. And this significantly impacted our gross margin. 
Operating expenses were $172.9 million, in line with our goal of 20% of sales. On the bottom line, earnings were $1.29 per share, an increase of 19% versus our prior quarter.
Mark will walk you through additional details in a moment and provide a bridge to our margin expectations. In the meantime, I'll update you on some other major initiatives currently underway. 
During the September quarter, we brought up and released our TC-SAW process in Greensboro ahead of schedule, giving us the ability to support additional customer demand this quarter. We are increasing the mix of 6-inch TC-SAW in Florida, while moving all GaAs capacity to Oregon, transitioning all GaN products to Richardson. We're also ramping our new assembly and test facility in Dezhou, China. In Richardson, the organization has done an outstanding job, releasing our most advanced, next generation BAW process which delivers a significant improvement over our prior generation in key performance metrics. We've also brought up and are now designing products on our new 8-inch BAW line in Richardson. We are enjoying broad-based demand for our BAW filter solutions and we expect the ramp of new customer programs to improve our utilization rates in calendar 2017. Notably, we continue to enjoy strong demand for our BAW based multiplexer solutions and we have delivered module prototypes containing our BAW-based hexaplexers. 
Looking at quarterly performance by segment. Mobile Products grew approximately 22% year-over-year and 29% sequentially to a record $706 million, Mobile Products supported the launch of highly popular, premium tier smartphones, and in the performance tier smartphones, we enjoyed strong demand for our RF Flex Solutions. And Wi-Fi for handsets, Qorvo's RF Fusion for mobile Wi-Fi delivered customers a unique, highly integrated solution, combining our high-performance BAW filters with our Wi-Fi front-end modules. In China, Mobile Products is benefiting as smartphone manufacturers migrate from 3-mode to full mode devices. By the end of this year, we expect more than half of all 4G smartphones manufactured for the China market will be full mode. Our largest customers in China are looking for ways to introduce fewer models with higher levels of RF content to provide broader coverage of additional geographies as they move towards more of an export market. 
Huawei stands out as an excellent example. They are adding more RF content to their smartphones as they build their global brand. Huawei was one of two 10% customers for Qorvo in our fiscal second quarter and they are our largest customer in China. 
Finally, the expanding market requirements for carrier aggregation and the upcoming deployment of 5G favor our unique combination of competitive strengths. Only Qorvo delivers a comprehensive portfolio of filters, switches, amplifiers, envelope trackers, LNAs and tuners with the scale, integration capabilities and system-level expertise to supply a complete portfolio of highly integrated solutions. 
Looking at IDP. Revenue grew 22% year-over-year and 5% sequentially to $158 million as our focus on higher growth segments continue to bear fruit. We're very pleased with the performance of IDP. In particular, the revenue growth, the initiatives to target faster growing market segments and the rate and pace of new product introductions, IDP has enjoyed a series of very strong quarters and is closing in on its margin model of 60% gross margin and 30% operating margin. IDP is a recognized global leader with a product and technology leadership strategy that leverages internally developed best-in-class technologies to provide our customers with differentiated performance solutions. IDP is highly diversified and competes in a $3.8 billion serviceable market that's forecast by industry analysts to grow at a compound annual rate of 17%, nearly doubling to $7 billion by 2020. In September, IDP released 49 new products, including power amplifiers for small cell, dual and quad linear drivers for optical applications, LNAs and filters for automotive and integrated front end modules for Wi-Fi. The continued aggressive pace of product releases is creating a broad-based pipeline of differentiated solutions with long production tales across our portfolio of markets. 
IDP's strong performance last quarter was across all major market segments, highlighted by growth in Wireless Infrastructure, Wi-Fi, Defense and Aerospace, as well as the IoT. 
We've seen a continued recovery in the base station market and we enjoy broad-based market share across all OEMs. This helps buffer IDP from the ups and downs experienced by any one customer. Our view on the overall base station market is cautiously optimistic. We are continuing our focus on the market's higher growth segments, with an emphasis on the transition of base station power amplifiers to GaN technology and the implementation of massive MIMO. 
In connectivity, IDP enjoyed growth in both Wi-Fi and low power wireless. With the acquisition of GreenPeak, Qorvo is a recognized leader at ultralow power, short-range RF communications. We are expanding our low power product portfolio to include highly integrated RF systems on a chip for the connected home and the Internet of Things. And our target markets are growing faster than 40%. 
In Wi-Fi, our growth was supported by continued wins in both the retail and set-top box market segments. 
In transport, growth was driven by strength in our cable TV products to support the rollout of DOCSIS 3.1, our traditional long-haul optical driver business and ramping data center interconnect products. Qorvo's transport business is at the forefront of the buildout of infrastructure to keep pace with the ever increasing demand for data, and we continue to see an expanding set of opportunities. 
In defense, our growth was driven by international and domestic GaN on silicon carbide sales, and a major Asus program ramping. Design wins for our GaN on silicon carbide devices have been exceptionally strong in the market segments that are growing at over 25% per year. 
In summary, the Qorvo Team did an excellent job, delivering 22% year-over-year growth and achieving our goal of operating expenses at 20% of sales. At the same time, we made progress advancing core technologies and developing highly integrated Qorvo solutions for large customer opportunities in 2017 and 2018. It's clear we have work to do on our gross margin and we're taking steps to address it. We continue to drive to our operating model, including above revenue growth and operating income above 30%. 
Now before turning the call over to Mark, let's view our achievements and our comments today through the prism of Qorvo's long-term strategy. 
Qorvo's growth strategy is based on three core principles: First, leverage our differentiated technologies and product leadership to achieve operational excellence, capture value and deliver superior financial results. Second, drive the integration of our two predecessor companies to achieve, as Qorvo, what neither could achieve alone. Third, prioritize the use of cash on investments that grow our business, return capital to our stockholders through share repurchases and supplement growth in IDP through M&A. 
Our long-term view of the RF industry envisions more modes, more bands, more complexity and more RF, all driven by the ever increasing demand for data and the limited frequency spectrum available to support that demand. 
In Mobile Products, only Qorvo can deliver a complete suite of multimode, multiband solutions, combining premium BAW and temp-comp SAW filters, SAW filters, broadband power amplifiers, high pro count switches, high-performance LNAs, envelope trackers and antenna control solutions. And Qorvo is the only industry participant positioning itself to supply internally developed, internally manufactured and internally assembled system-level solutions serving all major cellular frequencies. 
We see growing demand for low, mid and high frequency RF solution sales in the performance tier, as new cellular bands limit board space and pressure our customers' product development cycles. In the premium tier, we anticipate demand for multiple customers for highly compact, single placement solutions combining coverage of mid and high frequencies. To be clear, this will require more TC-SAW and BAW, a distinct advantage for Qorvo. 
In IDP, our investments in internally developed best-in-class technologies, our sharpened focus on higher margin, higher growth markets and our introduction of hundreds of new products annually are combining to support excellent growth opportunities. These opportunities are underpinned by large secular trends extending into the foreseeable future. They include: high-speed connectivity, the Internet of things, the connected car, data centers and the proliferation of phased array technology. In Wireless Infrastructure, cable TV and defense applications, we expect our GaN technology to be increasingly disruptive. 
So from a high level, Qorvo has assembled the technology, products, people and resources to deliver best-in-class, highly integrated systems level solutions. We are investing in highly differentiated, internally sourced technologies, best-in-class products, adding manufacturing capacity to keep pace with customer demand and we are leveraging our unique combination of competitive strengths to drive above market growth. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark."

Qorvo's second quarter non-GAAP revenue increased 24% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to $864 million. Mobile Products revenue increased 29% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to $706 million on continued RF",1137,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Qorvo's second quarter non-GAAP revenue increased 24% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to $864 million. Mobile Products revenue increased 29% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to $706 million on continued RF content growth, the ramp of the key customer product and strong Asia customer demand. 
Infrastructure and Defense Products revenue increased 5% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to $158 million, on higher Wireless Infrastructure, Wi-Fi, Defense and Aerospace and IoT. 
We believe Qorvo is well-positioned to continue to outpace the market growth due to our strong technology position, comprehensive product portfolio and broad supply capabilities. 
Gross margin was near 43% and most negatively impacted by manufacturing yield issues on our highest volume part in the quarter. Manufacturing yield issues on this part, a low-band PAD module, were related to SAW filters from a single fab. The impact was contained within Qorvo and yields have stabilized in the fab which will help support even stronger customer demand for that module in the third quarter. 
During the third quarter, we do expect margins to improve on more stable production. However, higher mix of the low-band PAD will partially offset the improvement. Operating expenses were at our target 20% of sales or $173 million. During the quarter, we had higher expenses to support ongoing development programs, higher sales commissions and the full quarter effects of our GreenPeak acquisition. 
Operating income for the quarter was approximately $197 million, with margins negatively impacted by the gross margin effects discussed. Non-GAAP net income was $170 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.29. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash increased to $469 million. Cash flow from operations was $250 million on income growth and efficient working capital management, particularly inventories. Capital expenditures of $120 million are largely addressing growing premium filter demand through SAW investments in North Carolina and BAW investments in Texas. We yielded $130 million of free cash flow in the quarter. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 91 million of shares. And today, we announced the approval of a new $500 million share repurchase program. We intend to commence buying under this program when our window opens as part of an ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders. 
Now let's turn to our business outlook. Qorvo currently believes customer demand supports the following non-GAAP expectations for the December quarter: quarterly revenue between $800 million and $840 million; sequential gross margin expansion of 100 to 200 basis points; diluted EPS between $1.15 and $1.35; tax rate of approximately 8%. 
Our December quarter guidance reflects continued strong demand with projected year-over-year sales growth over 30%. We currently expect gross margins to improve from the second quarter and through the second half of the fiscal year '17 as our mix of low-band PAD peaks in the third quarter and our operations stabilize. We expect OpEx to remain near 20% of sales in the third quarter and trend down $1 should the rest of the fiscal year on lower commissions and an increase in productivity initiatives. CapEx will remain elevated through the rest of the fiscal year as we invest in premium filter capacity to support forecasted customer demand. 
As I close out my first quarter at Qorvo, I'd like to share my initial observations on the company and provide a longer-term outlook on the business. I believe Qorvo is exceptionally well positioned to address rapidly growing RF demand and the design and production challenges posed by growing RF module complexity. Qorvo has the key technologies, best-in-class design resources, advanced production capabilities and high-quality employees to succeed. While the company has all the pieces to deliver extraordinary shareholder value, we have to improve our execution to reach this potential. The integration has gone well in many ways, validated our vision for the combined company and yielded a common culture and synergies. But there is more that can be done on both the integration and general productivity. For example, this past quarter was the first full quarter in which most of the company was on a common ERP system. Going forward, we expect that improved visibility, increased financial discipline and rigor and a broad-based commitment to operational excellence will help drive additional synergies and improve our financial performance. 
I'm enthusiastic about Qorvo's future and pleased to be able to contribute to efforts to improve the operating discipline and efficiency of the company. Within 6 quarters, we expect to be at our target operating performance. We currently expect double-digit sales growth to continue through fiscal 2018 and forecast over 30% operating margins by the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. The Mobile Products segment is projected to benefit from continued content growth and demand for more complex modules using our premium filters. Our Infrastructure and Defense Products segment has been repositioned to serve higher growth markets, including Wi-Fi, automotive, IoT and Wireless Infrastructure. 
Looking forward through fiscal year '18, we expect IDP's growth to be in line with Mobile Products. For the rest of this fiscal year, we expect our margins will improve as operations stabilize and low-band PAD mix declines. We expect to exit fiscal year '17 above 46% gross margins and we believe that additional yield improvements, factory loading, sourcing and other productivity initiatives will help drive margin expansion in fiscal year 2018. Factory yield improvements from process maturity and larger wafer production in SAW and BAW are expected to add approximately 100 basis points to gross margin in fiscal year '18. Higher volumes are projected to add over 150 basis points of margin based on a higher utilization of our BAW, SAW and GaAs lines as well as ramping our new Dezhou assembly and test facility. Next year, considering projected volumes and the impacts of consolidation efforts and measured capacity additions, we expect our global operations to be running near capacity. Finally, we project that ongoing supply chain consolidation and procurement initiatives, along with additional efforts to wring out merger savings, should drive another 150 basis points of gross margin expansion. 
Together, by the end of fiscal year '18, we expect these efforts and a more favorable mix of higher margin products should result in greater than 50% gross margins. In fiscal year '18, our OpEx is expected to grow at no more than half the rate of sales, which will drive OpEx to under 20% of sales. The operating model Bob mentioned is intact. It's a focus and imperative for our business team. And a goal we expect to achieve. We plan to exit fiscal year '18 at over 50% gross margins, OpEx below 20% of sales and operating margins over 30%. Achieving this performance would generate substantial free cash flow which we plan to use for acquisitions and returning capital to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

To go a little deeper than that, it's specific to the die level yield within the SAW and TC-SAW manufacturing process. I should be clear, it's not related to a design issue. In fact, it's slightly related to the filter resonators themselves. It's really contained within the die simulation process and wafer level packaging. The fact is, we had a very steep ramp, the volume was heavily loaded towards the back of the quarter. Our die level screens that we have in place in the factory did not catch the issue and so we found it, once we had assembled the modules completely and we're well under production. Our top priority of course was protecting our customers' lines. We made sure that they had good material. It resulted in a great many modules that needed to be scrapped to finish good level. However, by now we have produced, as you can imagine, tens of millions of the part. We understand the problem very well. We now have new die level screens which are targeting the issue and working effectively. So I think it's behind us. To your point, we can't make changes in the actual manufacturing process now that we're in production. We do have some ability to make incremental improvements from here, which we're going to do. But products that we release from this point forward will have improved manufacturing process and not be a subject to this yield at all."

I thought mostly because you had to -- you outsourced SAW filters and some of the high-volume runners. This quarter, you're talking about having some yield issues on the SAW process that you've talked about. So I'm just trying to get a sense, are you still buying a lot of SAW filters externally, and just not getting good margin on the pass through? Or have you been able to in-source that production and as you try to ramp the in-source production, you ran into this yield issue, then so we've had sort of a changing impact on that gross margin?"

Last quarter, we talked an awful lot about filter independence.

The part that we're talking about, yes, it does use outsourced filters, but it also had some of our internal filters in there. And that's the yield issue that Eric talked through. And I think we've commented last call, but I'll make it clear again, this is a product that we're not able to change the process, nor the product design for its multiyear life. So we're going to have this for a while. What we do believe is, that the low-band PAD market is a good market for us. We will have the right cost structure and we'll remain competitive."

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Qorvo's Fiscal 2017 Second Quarter Earnings Call. Revenue for Qorvo's fiscal second quarter increased 24% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to approximately $864 million. Revenue was above our qua",1555,"Thanks, Doug. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Qorvo's Fiscal 2017 Second Quarter Earnings Call. 
Revenue for Qorvo's fiscal second quarter increased 24% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to approximately $864 million. Revenue was above our quarterly guidance provided August 2, reflecting broad based demand. Gross margin for the quarter was approximately 43%. Within the quarter, we experienced lower-than-expected manufacturing yields during a steep product ramp to a large customer. To protect our long-term customer relationships, we did everything we could to assure supply of high-quality material to the customer while working through the internal yield issues. And this significantly impacted our gross margin. 
Operating expenses were $172.9 million, in line with our goal of 20% of sales. On the bottom line, earnings were $1.29 per share, an increase of 19% versus our prior quarter.
Mark will walk you through additional details in a moment and provide a bridge to our margin expectations. In the meantime, I'll update you on some other major initiatives currently underway. 
During the September quarter, we brought up and released our TC-SAW process in Greensboro ahead of schedule, giving us the ability to support additional customer demand this quarter. We are increasing the mix of 6-inch TC-SAW in Florida, while moving all GaAs capacity to Oregon, transitioning all GaN products to Richardson. We're also ramping our new assembly and test facility in Dezhou, China. In Richardson, the organization has done an outstanding job, releasing our most advanced, next generation BAW process which delivers a significant improvement over our prior generation in key performance metrics. We've also brought up and are now designing products on our new 8-inch BAW line in Richardson. We are enjoying broad-based demand for our BAW filter solutions and we expect the ramp of new customer programs to improve our utilization rates in calendar 2017. Notably, we continue to enjoy strong demand for our BAW based multiplexer solutions and we have delivered module prototypes containing our BAW-based hexaplexers. 
Looking at quarterly performance by segment. Mobile Products grew approximately 22% year-over-year and 29% sequentially to a record $706 million, Mobile Products supported the launch of highly popular, premium tier smartphones, and in the performance tier smartphones, we enjoyed strong demand for our RF Flex Solutions. And Wi-Fi for handsets, Qorvo's RF Fusion for mobile Wi-Fi delivered customers a unique, highly integrated solution, combining our high-performance BAW filters with our Wi-Fi front-end modules. In China, Mobile Products is benefiting as smartphone manufacturers migrate from 3-mode to full mode devices. By the end of this year, we expect more than half of all 4G smartphones manufactured for the China market will be full mode. Our largest customers in China are looking for ways to introduce fewer models with higher levels of RF content to provide broader coverage of additional geographies as they move towards more of an export market. 
Huawei stands out as an excellent example. They are adding more RF content to their smartphones as they build their global brand. Huawei was one of two 10% customers for Qorvo in our fiscal second quarter and they are our largest customer in China. 
Finally, the expanding market requirements for carrier aggregation and the upcoming deployment of 5G favor our unique combination of competitive strengths. Only Qorvo delivers a comprehensive portfolio of filters, switches, amplifiers, envelope trackers, LNAs and tuners with the scale, integration capabilities and system-level expertise to supply a complete portfolio of highly integrated solutions. 
Looking at IDP. Revenue grew 22% year-over-year and 5% sequentially to $158 million as our focus on higher growth segments continue to bear fruit. We're very pleased with the performance of IDP. In particular, the revenue growth, the initiatives to target faster growing market segments and the rate and pace of new product introductions, IDP has enjoyed a series of very strong quarters and is closing in on its margin model of 60% gross margin and 30% operating margin. IDP is a recognized global leader with a product and technology leadership strategy that leverages internally developed best-in-class technologies to provide our customers with differentiated performance solutions. IDP is highly diversified and competes in a $3.8 billion serviceable market that's forecast by industry analysts to grow at a compound annual rate of 17%, nearly doubling to $7 billion by 2020. In September, IDP released 49 new products, including power amplifiers for small cell, dual and quad linear drivers for optical applications, LNAs and filters for automotive and integrated front end modules for Wi-Fi. The continued aggressive pace of product releases is creating a broad-based pipeline of differentiated solutions with long production tales across our portfolio of markets. 
IDP's strong performance last quarter was across all major market segments, highlighted by growth in Wireless Infrastructure, Wi-Fi, Defense and Aerospace, as well as the IoT. 
We've seen a continued recovery in the base station market and we enjoy broad-based market share across all OEMs. This helps buffer IDP from the ups and downs experienced by any one customer. Our view on the overall base station market is cautiously optimistic. We are continuing our focus on the market's higher growth segments, with an emphasis on the transition of base station power amplifiers to GaN technology and the implementation of massive MIMO. 
In connectivity, IDP enjoyed growth in both Wi-Fi and low power wireless. With the acquisition of GreenPeak, Qorvo is a recognized leader at ultralow power, short-range RF communications. We are expanding our low power product portfolio to include highly integrated RF systems on a chip for the connected home and the Internet of Things. And our target markets are growing faster than 40%. 
In Wi-Fi, our growth was supported by continued wins in both the retail and set-top box market segments. 
In transport, growth was driven by strength in our cable TV products to support the rollout of DOCSIS 3.1, our traditional long-haul optical driver business and ramping data center interconnect products. Qorvo's transport business is at the forefront of the buildout of infrastructure to keep pace with the ever increasing demand for data, and we continue to see an expanding set of opportunities. 
In defense, our growth was driven by international and domestic GaN on silicon carbide sales, and a major Asus program ramping. Design wins for our GaN on silicon carbide devices have been exceptionally strong in the market segments that are growing at over 25% per year. 
In summary, the Qorvo Team did an excellent job, delivering 22% year-over-year growth and achieving our goal of operating expenses at 20% of sales. At the same time, we made progress advancing core technologies and developing highly integrated Qorvo solutions for large customer opportunities in 2017 and 2018. It's clear we have work to do on our gross margin and we're taking steps to address it. We continue to drive to our operating model, including above revenue growth and operating income above 30%. 
Now before turning the call over to Mark, let's view our achievements and our comments today through the prism of Qorvo's long-term strategy. 
Qorvo's growth strategy is based on three core principles: First, leverage our differentiated technologies and product leadership to achieve operational excellence, capture value and deliver superior financial results. Second, drive the integration of our two predecessor companies to achieve, as Qorvo, what neither could achieve alone. Third, prioritize the use of cash on investments that grow our business, return capital to our stockholders through share repurchases and supplement growth in IDP through M&A. 
Our long-term view of the RF industry envisions more modes, more bands, more complexity and more RF, all driven by the ever increasing demand for data and the limited frequency spectrum available to support that demand. 
In Mobile Products, only Qorvo can deliver a complete suite of multimode, multiband solutions, combining premium BAW and temp-comp SAW filters, SAW filters, broadband power amplifiers, high pro count switches, high-performance LNAs, envelope trackers and antenna control solutions. And Qorvo is the only industry participant positioning itself to supply internally developed, internally manufactured and internally assembled system-level solutions serving all major cellular frequencies. 
We see growing demand for low, mid and high frequency RF solution sales in the performance tier, as new cellular bands limit board space and pressure our customers' product development cycles. In the premium tier, we anticipate demand for multiple customers for highly compact, single placement solutions combining coverage of mid and high frequencies. To be clear, this will require more TC-SAW and BAW, a distinct advantage for Qorvo. 
In IDP, our investments in internally developed best-in-class technologies, our sharpened focus on higher margin, higher growth markets and our introduction of hundreds of new products annually are combining to support excellent growth opportunities. These opportunities are underpinned by large secular trends extending into the foreseeable future. They include: high-speed connectivity, the Internet of things, the connected car, data centers and the proliferation of phased array technology. In Wireless Infrastructure, cable TV and defense applications, we expect our GaN technology to be increasingly disruptive. 
So from a high level, Qorvo has assembled the technology, products, people and resources to deliver best-in-class, highly integrated systems level solutions. We are investing in highly differentiated, internally sourced technologies, best-in-class products, adding manufacturing capacity to keep pace with customer demand and we are leveraging our unique combination of competitive strengths to drive above market growth. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark."

Qorvo's second quarter non-GAAP revenue increased 24% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to $864 million. Mobile Products revenue increased 29% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to $706 million on continued RF",1137,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Qorvo's second quarter non-GAAP revenue increased 24% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to $864 million. Mobile Products revenue increased 29% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to $706 million on continued RF content growth, the ramp of the key customer product and strong Asia customer demand. 
Infrastructure and Defense Products revenue increased 5% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to $158 million, on higher Wireless Infrastructure, Wi-Fi, Defense and Aerospace and IoT. 
We believe Qorvo is well-positioned to continue to outpace the market growth due to our strong technology position, comprehensive product portfolio and broad supply capabilities. 
Gross margin was near 43% and most negatively impacted by manufacturing yield issues on our highest volume part in the quarter. Manufacturing yield issues on this part, a low-band PAD module, were related to SAW filters from a single fab. The impact was contained within Qorvo and yields have stabilized in the fab which will help support even stronger customer demand for that module in the third quarter. 
During the third quarter, we do expect margins to improve on more stable production. However, higher mix of the low-band PAD will partially offset the improvement. Operating expenses were at our target 20% of sales or $173 million. During the quarter, we had higher expenses to support ongoing development programs, higher sales commissions and the full quarter effects of our GreenPeak acquisition. 
Operating income for the quarter was approximately $197 million, with margins negatively impacted by the gross margin effects discussed. Non-GAAP net income was $170 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.29. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash increased to $469 million. Cash flow from operations was $250 million on income growth and efficient working capital management, particularly inventories. Capital expenditures of $120 million are largely addressing growing premium filter demand through SAW investments in North Carolina and BAW investments in Texas. We yielded $130 million of free cash flow in the quarter. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 91 million of shares. And today, we announced the approval of a new $500 million share repurchase program. We intend to commence buying under this program when our window opens as part of an ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders. 
Now let's turn to our business outlook. Qorvo currently believes customer demand supports the following non-GAAP expectations for the December quarter: quarterly revenue between $800 million and $840 million; sequential gross margin expansion of 100 to 200 basis points; diluted EPS between $1.15 and $1.35; tax rate of approximately 8%. 
Our December quarter guidance reflects continued strong demand with projected year-over-year sales growth over 30%. We currently expect gross margins to improve from the second quarter and through the second half of the fiscal year '17 as our mix of low-band PAD peaks in the third quarter and our operations stabilize. We expect OpEx to remain near 20% of sales in the third quarter and trend down $1 through the rest of the fiscal year on lower commissions and an increase in productivity initiatives. CapEx will remain elevated through the rest of the fiscal year as we invest in premium filter capacity to support forecasted customer demand. 
As I close out my first quarter at Qorvo, I'd like to share my initial observations on the company and provide a longer-term outlook on the business. I believe Qorvo is exceptionally well positioned to address rapidly growing RF demand and the design and production challenges posed by growing RF module complexity. Qorvo has the key technologies, best-in-class design resources, advanced production capabilities and high-quality employees to succeed. While the company has all the pieces to deliver extraordinary shareholder value, we have to improve our execution to reach this potential. The integration has gone well in many ways, validated our vision for the combined company and yielded a common culture and synergies. But there is more that can be done on both the integration and general productivity. For example, this past quarter was the first full quarter in which most of the company was on a common ERP system. Going forward, we expect that improved visibility, increased financial discipline and rigor and a broad-based commitment to operational excellence will help drive additional synergies and improve our financial performance. 
I'm enthusiastic about Qorvo's future and pleased to be able to contribute to efforts to improve the operating discipline and efficiency of the company. Within 6 quarters, we expect to be at our target operating performance. We currently expect double-digit sales growth to continue through fiscal 2018 and forecast over 30% operating margins by the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. The Mobile Products segment is projected to benefit from continued content growth and demand for more complex modules using our premium filters. Our Infrastructure and Defense Products segment has been repositioned to serve higher growth markets, including Wi-Fi, automotive, IoT and Wireless Infrastructure. 
Looking forward through fiscal year '18, we expect IDP's growth to be in line with Mobile Products. For the rest of this fiscal year, we expect our margins will improve as operations stabilize and low-band PAD mix declines. We expect to exit fiscal year '17 above 46% gross margins and we believe that additional yield improvements, factory loading, sourcing and other productivity initiatives will help drive margin expansion in fiscal year 2018. Factory yield improvements from process maturity and larger wafer production in SAW and BAW are expected to add approximately 100 basis points to gross margin in fiscal year '18. Higher volumes are projected to add over 150 basis points of margin based on a higher utilization of our BAW, SAW and GaAs lines as well as ramping our new Dezhou assembly and test facility. Next year, considering projected volumes and the impacts of consolidation efforts and measured capacity additions, we expect our global operations to be running near capacity. Finally, we project that ongoing supply chain consolidation and procurement initiatives, along with additional efforts to wring out merger savings, should drive another 150 basis points of gross margin expansion. 
Together, by the end of fiscal year '18, we expect these efforts and a more favorable mix of higher margin products should result in greater than 50% gross margins. In fiscal year '18, our OpEx is expected to grow at no more than half the rate of sales, which will drive OpEx to under 20% of sales. The operating model Bob mentioned is intact. It's a focus and imperative for our business team. And a goal we expect to achieve. We plan to exit fiscal year '18 at over 50% gross margins, OpEx below 20% of sales and operating margins over 30%. Achieving this performance would generate substantial free cash flow which we plan to use for acquisitions and returning capital to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

To go a little deeper than that, it's specific to the die level yield within the SAW and TC-SAW manufacturing process. I should be clear, it's not related to a design issue. In fact, it's slightly related to the filter resonators themselves. It's really contained within the die simulation process and wafer level packaging. The fact is we had a very steep ramp, the volume was heavily loaded towards the back of the quarter. Our die level screens that we have in place in the factory did not catch the issue and so we found it, once we had assembled the modules completely and we're well under production. Our top priority of course was protecting our customers' lines. We made sure that they had good material. It resulted in a great many modules that needed to be scrapped to fi nish good level. However, by now we have produced, as you can imagine, tens of millions of the part. We understand the problem very well. We now have new die level screens which are targeting the issue and working effectively. So I think it's behind us. To your point, we can't make changes in the actual manufacturing process now that we're in production. We do have some ability to make incremental improvements from here, which we're going to do.

So as an example, GaN has been a great growth story for us. Our capabilities have allowed us to capture key markets, things like DOCSIS 3.1 for cable TV and base stations where they're moving to broader bandwidths and higher frequencies. Also another area for us is IoT, particularly the connected home. Our system on a chip capability brings some real advantages to our customers. We offer benefits in multiprotocol, power consumption and range. And in the next few years, for this, this will be a $1.5 billion market for us."

Number one, high-growth. Number two, good margin profile. Number three, a nice market to help diversify our business in the fast-growing market of the IoT. So we are willing to have M&A activities on smaller companies that are tuck-ins that we believe we can grow and scale, given our own ability to grow and scale. Obviously, another area that we look at are technologies that we might want to tuck-in in either the mobile business or IDP that we can then leverage, so. But getting far abreast in the RF field currently is not in our interest. We think we're in great markets that are growing. The semiconductor industry in general is slowing.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Qorvo's Fiscal 2017 Second Quarter Earnings Call. 
Revenue for Qorvo's fiscal second quarter increased 24% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to approximately $864 million. Revenue was above our quarterly guidance provided August 2, reflecting broad based demand. Gross margin for the quarter was approximately 43%. Within the quarter, we experienced lower-than-expected manufacturing yields during a steep product ramp to a large customer. To protect our long-term customer relationships, we did everything we could to assure supply of high-quality material to the customer while working through the internal yield issues. And this significantly impacted our gross margin. 
Operating expenses were $172.9 million, in line with our goal of 20% of sales. On the bottom line, earnings were $1.29 per share, an increase of 19% versus our prior quarter.
Mark will walk you through additional details in a moment and provide a bridge to our margin expectations. In the meantime, I'll update you on some other major initiatives currently underway. 
During the September quarter, we brought up and released our TC-SAW process in Greensboro ahead of schedule, giving us the ability to support additional customer demand this quarter. We are increasing the mix of 6-inch TC-SAW in Florida, while moving all GaAs capacity to Oregon, transitioning all GaN products to Richardson. We're also ramping our new assembly and test facility in Dezhou, China. In Richardson, the organization has done an outstanding job, releasing our most advanced, next generation BAW process which delivers a significant improvement over our prior generation in key performance metrics. We've also brought up and are now designing products on our new 8-inch BAW line in Richardson. We are enjoying broad-based demand for our BAW filter solutions and we expect the ramp of new customer programs to improve our utilization rates in calendar 2017. Notably, we continue to enjoy strong demand for our BAW based multiplexer solutions and we have delivered module prototypes containing our BAW-based hexaplexers. 
Looking at quarterly performance by segment. Mobile Products grew approximately 22% year-over-year and 29% sequentially to a record $706 million, Mobile Products supported the launch of highly popular, premium tier smartphones, and in the performance tier smartphones, we enjoyed strong demand for our RF Flex Solutions. And Wi-Fi for handsets, Qorvo's RF Fusion for mobile Wi-Fi delivered customers a unique, highly integrated solution, combining our high-performance BAW filters with our Wi-Fi front-end modules. In China, Mobile Products is benefiting as smartphone manufacturers migrate from 3-mode to full mode devices. By the end of this year, we expect more than half of all 4G smartphones manufactured for the China market will be full mode. Our largest customers in China are looking for ways to introduce fewer models with higher levels of RF content to provide broader coverage of additional geographies as they move towards more of an export market. 
Huawei stands out as an excellent example. They are adding more RF content to their smartphones as they build their global brand. Huawei was one of two 10% customers for Qorvo in our fiscal second quarter and they are our largest customer in China. 
Finally, the expanding market requirements for carrier aggregation and the upcoming deployment of 5G favor our unique combination of competitive strengths. Only Qorvo delivers a comprehensive portfolio of filters, switches, amplifiers, envelope trackers, LNAs and tuners with the scale, integration capabilities and system-level expertise to supply a complete portfolio of highly integrated solutions. 
Looking at IDP. Revenue grew 22% year-over-year and 5% sequentially to $158 million as our focus on higher growth segments continue to bear fruit. We're very pleased with the performance of IDP. In particular, the revenue growth, the initiatives to target faster growing market segments and the rate and pace of new product introductions, IDP has enjoyed a series of very strong quarters and is closing in on its margin model of 60% gross margin and 30% operating margin. IDP is a recognized global leader with a product and technology leadership strategy that leverages internally developed best-in-class technologies to provide our customers with differentiated performance solutions. IDP is highly diversified and competes in a $3.8 billion serviceable market that's forecast by industry analysts to grow at a compound annual rate of 17%, nearly doubling to $7 billion by 2020. In September, IDP released 49 new products, including power amplifiers for small cell, dual and quad linear drivers for optical applications, LNAs and filters for automotive and integrated front end modules for Wi-Fi. The continued aggressive pace of product releases is creating a broad-based pipeline of differentiated solutions with long production tales across our portfolio of markets. 
IDP's strong performance last quarter was across all major market segments, highlighted by growth in Wireless Infrastructure, Wi-Fi, Defense and Aerospace as well as the IoT. 
We've seen a continued recovery in the base station market and we enjoy broad-based market share across all OEMs. This helps buffer IDP from the ups and downs experienced by any one customer. Our view on the overall base station market is cautiously optimistic. We are continuing our focus on the market's higher growth segments, with an emphasis on the transition of base station power amplifiers to GaN technology and the implementation of massive MIMO. 
In connectivity, IDP enjoyed growth in both Wi-Fi and low power wireless. With the acquisition of GreenPeak, Qorvo is a recognized leader at ultralow power, short-range RF communications. We are expanding our low power product portfolio to include highly integrated RF systems on a chip for the connected home and the Internet of Things. And our target markets are growing faster than 40%. 
In Wi-Fi, our growth was supported by continued wins in both the retail and set-top box market segments. 
In transport, growth was driven by strength in our cable TV products to support the rollout of DOCSIS 3.1, our traditional long-haul optical driver business and ramping data center interconnect products. Qorvo's transport business is at the forefront of the buildout of infrastructure to keep pace with the ever increasing demand for data, and we continue to see an expanding set of opportunities. 
In defense, our growth was driven by international and domestic GaN on silicon carbide sales, and a major Asus program ramping. Design wins for our GaN on silicon carbide devices have been exceptionally strong in the market segments that are growing at over 25% per year. 
In summary, the Qorvo Team did an excellent job, delivering 22% year-over-year growth and achieving our goal of operating expenses at 20% of sales. At the same time, we made progress advancing core technologies and developing highly integrated Qorvo solutions for large customer opportunities in 2017 and 2018. It's clear we have work to do on our gross margin and we're taking steps to address it. We continue to drive to our operating model, including above revenue growth and operating income above 30%. 
Now before turning the call over to Mark, let's view our achievements and our comments today through the prism of Qorvo's long-term strategy. 
Qorvo's growth strategy is based on three core principles: First, leverage our differentiated technologies and product leadership to achieve operational excellence, capture value and deliver superior financial results. Second, drive the integration of our two predecessor companies to achieve, as Qorvo, what neither could achieve alone. Third, prioritize the use of cash on investments that grow our business, return capital to our stockholders through share repurchases and supplement growth in IDP through M&A. 
Our long-term view of the RF industry envisions more modes, more bands, more complexity and more RF, all driven by the ever increasing demand for data and the limited frequency spectrum available to support that demand. 
In Mobile Products, only Qorvo can deliver a complete suite of multimode, multiband solutions, combining premium BAW and temp-comp SAW filters, SAW filters, broadband power amplifiers, high pro count switches, high-performance LNAs, envelope trackers and antenna control solutions. And Qorvo is the only industry participant positioning itself to supply internally developed, internally manufactured and internally assembled system-level solutions serving all major cellular frequencies. 
We see growing demand for low, mid and high frequency RF solution sales in the performance tier, as new cellular bands limit board space and pressure our customers' product development cycles. In the premium tier, we anticipate demand for multiple customers for highly compact, single placement solutions combining coverage of mid and high frequencies. To be clear, this will require more TC-SAW and BAW, a distinct advantage for Qorvo. 
In IDP, our investments in internally developed best-in-class technologies, our sharpened focus on higher margin, higher growth markets and our introduction of hundreds of new products annually are combining to support excellent growth opportunities. These opportunities are underpinned by large secular trends extending into the foreseeable future. They include: high-speed connectivity, the Internet of things, the connected car, data centers and the proliferation of phased array technology. In Wireless Infrastructure, cable TV and defense applications, we expect our GaN technology to be increasingly disruptive. 
So from a high level, Qorvo has assembled the technology, products, people and resources to deliver best-in-class, highly integrated systems level solutions. We are investing in highly differentiated, internally sourced technologies, best-in-class products, adding manufacturing capacity to keep pace with customer demand and we are leveraging our unique combination of competitive strengths to drive above market growth. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark."

Infrastructure and Defense Products revenue increased 5% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to $158 million, on higher Wireless Infrastructure, Wi-Fi, Defense and Aerospace and IoT. 
We believe Qorvo is well-positioned to continue to outpace the market growth due to our strong technology position, comprehensive product portfolio and broad supply capabilities. 
Gross margin was near 43% and most negatively impacted by manufacturing yield issues on our highest volume part in the quarter. Manufacturing yield issues on this part, a low-band PAD module, were related to SAW filters from a single fab. The impact was contained within Qorvo and yields have stabilized in the fab which will help support even stronger customer demand for that module in the third quarter. 
During the third quarter, we do expect margins to improve on more stable production. However, higher mix of the low-band PAD will partially offset the improvement. Operating expenses were at our target 20% of sales or $173 million. During the quarter, we had higher expenses to support ongoing development programs, higher sales commissions and the full quarter effects of our GreenPeak acquisition. 
Operating income for the quarter was approximately $197 million, with margins negatively impacted by the gross margin effects discussed. Non-GAAP net income was $170 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.29. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash increased to $469 million. Cash flow from operations was $250 million on income growth and efficient working capital management, particularly inventories. Capital expenditures of $120 million are largely addressing growing premium filter demand through SAW investments in North Carolina and BAW investments in Texas. We yielded $130 million of free cash flow in the quarter. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 91 million of shares. And today, we announced the approval of a new $500 million share repurchase program. We intend to commence buying under this program when our window opens as part of an ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders. 
Now let's turn to our business outlook. Qorvo currently believes customer demand supports the following non-GAAP expectations for the December quarter: quarterly revenue between $800 million and $840 million; sequential gross margin expansion of 100 to 200 basis points; diluted EPS between $1.15 and $1.35; tax rate of approximately 8%. 
Our December quarter guidance reflects continued strong demand with projected year-over-year sales growth over 30%. We currently expect gross margins to improve from the second quarter and through the second half of the fiscal year '17 as our mix of low-band PAD peaks in the third quarter and our operations stabilize. We expect OpEx to remain near 20% of sales in the third quarter and trend down $1 through the rest of the fiscal year on lower commissions and an increase in productivity initiatives. CapEx will remain elevated through the rest of the fiscal year as we invest in premium filter capacity to support forecasted customer demand. 
As I close out my first quarter at Qorvo, I'd like to share my initial observations on the company and provide a longer-term outlook on the business. I believe Qorvo is exceptionally well positioned to address rapidly growing RF demand and the design and production challenges posed by growing RF module complexity. Qorvo has the key technologies, best-in-class design resources, advanced production capabilities and high-quality employees to succeed. While the company has all the pieces to deliver extraordinary shareholder value, we have to improve our execution to reach this potential. The integration has gone well in many ways, validated our vision for the combined company and yielded a common culture and synergies. But there is more that can be done on both the integration and general productivity. For example, this past quarter was the first full quarter in which most of the company was on a common ERP system. Going forward, we expect that improved visibility, increased financial discipline and rigor and a broad-based commitment to operational excellence will help drive additional synergies and improve our financial performance. 
I'm enthusiastic about Qorvo's future and pleased to be able to contribute to efforts to improve the operating discipline and efficiency of the company. Within 6 quarters, we expect to be at our target operating performance. We currently expect double-digit sales growth to continue through fiscal 2018 and forecast over 30% operating margins by the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. The Mobile Products segment is projected to benefit from continued content growth and demand for more complex modules using our premium filters. Our Infrastructure and Defense Products segment has been repositioned to serve higher growth markets, including Wi-Fi, automotive, IoT and Wireless Infrastructure. 
Looking forward through fiscal year '18, we expect IDP's growth to be in line with Mobile Products. For the rest of this fiscal year, we expect our margins will improve as operations stabilize and low-band PAD mix declines. We expect to exit fiscal year '17 above 46% gross margins and we believe that additional yield improvements, factory loading, sourcing and other productivity initiatives will help drive margin expansion in fiscal year 2018. Factory yield improvements from process maturity and larger wafer production in SAW and BAW are expected to add approximately 100 basis points to gross margin in fiscal year '18. Higher volumes are projected to add over 150 basis points of margin based on a higher utilization of our BAW, SAW and GaAs lines as well as ramping our new Dezhou assembly and test facility. Next year, considering projected volumes and the impacts of consolidation efforts and measured capacity additions, we expect our global operations to be running near capacity. Finally, we project that ongoing supply chain consolidation and procurement initiatives, along with additional efforts to wring out merger savings, should drive another 150 basis points of gross margin expansion. 
Together, by the end of fiscal year '18, we expect these efforts and a more favorable mix of higher margin products should result in greater than 50% gross margins. In fiscal year '18, our OpEx is expected to grow at no more than half the rate of sales, which will drive OpEx to under 20% of sales. The operating model Bob mentioned is intact. It's a focus and imperative for our business team. And a goal we expect to achieve. We plan to exit fiscal year '18 at over 50% gross margins, OpEx below 20% of sales and operating margins over 30%. Achieving this performance would generate substantial free cash flow which we plan to use for acquisitions and returning capital to our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

To go a little deeper than that, it's specific to the die level yield within the SAW and TC-SAW manufacturing process. I should be clear, it's not related to a design issue. In fact, it's slightly related to the filter resonators themselves. It's really contained within the die simulation process and wafer level packaging. The fact is we had a very steep ramp, the volume was heavily loaded towards the back of the quarter. Our die level screens that we have in place in the factory did not catch the issue and so we found it, once we had assembled the modules completely and we're well under production. Our top priority of course was protecting our customers' lines. We made sure that they had good material. It resulted in a great many modules that needed to be scrapped to finish good level. However, by now we have produced, as you can imagine, tens of millions of the part. We understand the problem very well. We now have new die level screens which are targeting the issue and working effectively. So I think it's behind us. To your point, we can't make changes in the actual manufacturing process now that we're in production. We do have some ability to make incremental improvements from here, which we're going to do.
