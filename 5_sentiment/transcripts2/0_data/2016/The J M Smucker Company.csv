Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. It was a great pressure to see many of you last week at CAGNY. We appreciate the opportunity to provide an update on a number of key initiatives that are going on across our businesse",1187,"Thank you, Aaron. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. It was a great pressure to see many of you last week at CAGNY. We appreciate the opportunity to provide an update on a number of key initiatives that are going on across our businesses. 
One of our takeaways from CAGNY was how aligned the CPG companies were on the trends that we're all seeing in the changing consumer perceptions and shopping habits. The real key to success is how each company responds to these changes and perceptions. We're trying to capitalize early on trends and not the fads, with bigger, longer lasting bests. 
We also believe that our company and especially our brands are well in line with the consumers' desires, and we are in a better position than most to capture more of the growth from these trends. 
Today, our comments will primarily focus on the third quarter financial results that we announced earlier this morning and our updated outlook for the rest of the year. 
I'll begin with an overview of consolidated results. First, net sales increased 37% to nearly $2 billion, driven by the addition of the Big Heart Pet Brands. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, sales declined -- the sales decline of 1% was reflected in volume decline in Consumer Foods and the price declined in Coffee. 
Second, non-GAAP operating income grew $108 million or 44% for the third quarter. 
The addition of the Big Heart business, strong Coffee segment profit growth and onetime gain on the divestiture of the U.S. Canned Milk business were all key drivers. 
Third, reflecting increased interest expense and a higher share count, non-GAAP earnings per share increased 14% to $1.76. 
Excluding amortization, adjusted earnings per share were $2.05, an increase of 21% from the comparable measure in the prior year. Both of these EPS metrics include a $0.14 per share gain on the divestiture of the Milk business. 
Lastly, we generated record free cash flow nearly $500 million in the quarter, bringing the full year total to $962 million. 
Turning to our U.S. Retail segments. I'll start with Coffee, which had another strong quarter as our growth initiatives, along with favorable manufacturing overhead and commodity cost benefited results. 
Looking at the key drivers, Folgers roast and ground coffee volume based on tonnage was up slightly compared to the prior year, while unit shipments increased even more, reflecting the transition to a reduced canister size for the Folgers offerings. 
With our price reduction related to small canisters and an additional list price decrease implemented in July to pass through lower green coffee cost, consumers are seeing lower price points on shelf and our market share continues to grow. 
During the latest 12-week period, our brands gained 3 points dollar share within the mainstream Coffee segment. 
For our overall K-Cup portfolio, the Dunkin' Donuts brand continues to drive growth with a 12-week ACB of over 90% and a 6% dollar share of the K-Cup category.  Consumer trial and repeat rates also remained strong. 
We're pleased with the momentum for this business, which has helped offset declines for Folgers K-Cups. 
As with other mainstream brands, Folgers K-Cups continue to be impacted by the proliferation of offerings in the K-Cup space and the resulting competitive pricing. Our team is focused on improving this trend, including price improvements. 
The performance of Dunkin' Donuts bagged coffee was soft in the quarter, reflecting aggressive pricing -- competitive pricing. However, the recent target pricing investments, which are supported by favorable green coffee costs, our price gaps have improved and we're well-positioned as we move ahead. 
Lastly, Café Bustelo brand established a new record for the quarterly sales under our ownership with double-digit gains for both roast and ground and K-Cup offerings in the quarter. 
Promotional activities such as our Café Bustelo pop-up cafés have successfully broadened the brand awareness and the brand continues to gain traction especially with millennials. 
Turning to Consumer Foods. Overall results were mixed. Specifically, the Smucker's brand performed well in the quarter. Smucker's Uncrustables frozen sandwiches achieved a 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit volume growth. 
In addition, net sales for Smucker's Fruit Spreads were in line with last year's third quarter and the brand continues to gain volume in dollar share within the breads category. 
Within Natural Foods, our branded business also had a strong third quarter, led by double-digit sales gains for our R.W. Knudsen family and Santa Cruz Organic brands. 
Volume for the Jif brand was down from the prior year, primarily attributable to a reduction in inventory levels at several key customers. We believe this is mostly the result of timing as ScanData trends remained positive for our peanut butter business. 
Lastly, in the baking aisle, the overall category remains down, which we believe is partially attributable to continued growth in retailers and store bakeries. Our results have been further impacted by aggressive competitive pricing as was expected.  Our focus remains on providing value-added innovation in these categories and competing responsibly. 
Results for our Pet Food business also fell short of expectations in the quarter. Mainstream pet food sales continue to reflect heightened competitive activity and drive ARPU, which has impacted the performance of our Kibbles 'n Bits brand. 
As we discussed last week, we are looking at all levers, including pricing, and are committed to improving the competitive position of our Dry Dog Food business. 
Cat food sales were also down in the quarter, however, similar to peanut butter, we view this as a timing issue with certain key customers as market share trends remained positive. 
Offsetting much of these declines were the continued strong performance of our premium pet food and pet snacks brands, which both achieved high single digit sales growth in the quarter. 
We have been pleased with the rollout of the Natural Balance brand into PetSmart. 
Also, innovation for Milk-Bone and Meow Mix brand has continued to be a key contributor to the pet snack results. 
Overall, while mainstream dog food has been challenged, we are pleased by solid results in Pet Specialty and Pet Snacks, which are the growing segments of the business. 
With respect to both pet foods and the broader organization, we continue to make good progress on our integration activities and synergy targets. Our March 1 integration is now just a week away, and through the hard work and dedication of many individuals throughout our company, we are well prepared for this exciting milestone. 
Lastly, as Mark will discuss in a moment, we continue to expect our full year earnings per share before factoring in the gain of the sale of the milk business to be in line with the guidance provided at the end of the second quarter. 
In addition, we remain confident about our brands and the initiatives we have in place to support future growth across our key platforms of Coffee, Consumer Foods and Pet Foods. 
Finally, I'd like to close by thanking all our employees. This continues to be an exciting and dynamic time, and we appreciate their ongoing efforts. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark."
303591,321462334,937987,"The J. M. Smucker Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2016",2016-02-23,"Earnings Calls","The J. M.

I will start by providing additional color on our third quarter results and then conclude by updating our outlook for the year. Net sales increased by $534 million in the quarter, reflecting the addition o",1744,"Thank you, Richard, and good morning, everyone. I will start by providing additional color on our third quarter results and then conclude by updating our outlook for the year. 
Net sales increased by $534 million in the quarter, reflecting the addition of Big Heart. Including pet, sales were down as lower net pricing primarily for Coffee detracted 2 percentage points from net sales. 
Foreign exchange was also unfavorable in the quarter, reducing net sales by about 1 percentage point. 
Conversely, volume and mix combined to add 1 point of growth as strong contributions from Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups were mostly offset by declines in several key categories. 
GAAP earnings per share were $1.55 this quarter, 2% below the prior year. Included in GAAP earnings were $45 million of special project costs related to merger integration activities compared to $6 million of such cost in the prior year. 
Also included were $7 million of unallocated derivative gains compared to $30 million last year. 
Excluding these items, non-GAAP EPS was $1.76 or an increase of 14%, which included a $0.14 per share gain on the divestiture of our U.S. Canned Milk business. 
Excluding amortization expense of $52 million, adjusted EPS was $2.05, up 21% for the quarter. Non-GAAP gross profit grew 49%, reflecting the addition of Pet Food and favorable volume/mix for the Coffee segment. And commodity cost were also favorable in the third quarter, most notably for green coffee and were only partially offset by lower net pricing. 
Combined, this resulted in a 310 basis point increase in gross margin to 38.5%, well ahead of our previous expectations for the quarter. 
SD&A increased at a greater rate than sales primarily attributable to incremental marketing spend across all 3 U.S. Retail segments. 
For the third quarter, synergy recognition totaled approximately $12 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $20 million, mostly benefiting G&A expenses. 
As we indicated last week, we are now on track to achieve $35 million in synergies for the full year. 
Amortization expense increased $27 million in the third quarter as a result of the Pet Food acquisition. Factoring all of these in, including a $25 million gain on the sale of the Milk business, non-GAAP operating income increased $108 million or 44%, while operating margin increased 80 basis points to 18%. 
The gain in operating income was partially offset below the line by higher interest expense and an increase in the number of shares outstanding related to the Big Heart acquisition. 
Let me now provide a brief overview of the results for our segments starting with Coffee. Net sales grew 1% as favorable volume mix of 5% was mostly offset by lower net pricing. 
For the Folgers brand, net sales declined 9%, mostly attributable to a 6% reduction in net price realization. 
Unfavorable mix, driven by declines in Folgers K-Cups, also was a factor. 
Sales for the Dunkin' Donuts brand increased 55% for the quarter, driven by Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups. 
And lastly, Café Bustelo sales were up 16% as the momentum for this brand continues. 
Segment profit increased 17% for the quarter, higher volume/mix and lower manufacturing overhead more than offset a double-digit increase in marketing and significantly higher selling expense due to the Dunkin' Donuts royalties. 
And in addition, we continue to recognize lower green coffee cost in the quarter, which is only partially offset by the lower net pricing. 
As we move ahead, we anticipate fourth quarter segment profit growth to be comparable to the year-to-date rate, reflecting the momentum in the business, additional contributions for Dunkin K-Cups and favorable coffee costs. 
Factored into this outlook is ongoing marketing spend related to new products, along with plans to continue supporting key price points as well as other targeted pricing investments to address competitive activity related to Dunkin' Donuts bagged coffee and Folgers K-Cups. 
Overall, we are very pleased with this level of profit recovery following the decline in the prior year. 
Turning to Consumer Foods. Net sales were down 5% as lower volume, the impact of the canned milk divestiture and lower net price realization all contributed. 
Looking at our key brands. Volume for Jif Peanut Butter was down 7% compared to a strong prior year quarter where volume was up 7%. 
As Richard indicated, we believe that current year decline is mostly the result of timing as consumer takeaway was up slightly in the quarter based on volume trends reported in IRI placed 4- and 12-week scan periods. 
Volume for Smucker's Uncrustables was up an impressive 33% for quarter while Smucker fruit spreads were down 2%. However, in the peanut butter, we're encouraged the consumer takeaway trends were much better as scan volume was up nearly 4% in the latest 4- and 12-week periods for Smucker's Fruit Spreads. 
And lastly in the bake aisle, volume for the Crisco and Pillsbury brand declined 3% and 9%, respectively. 
Segment profit increased 6% compared to the prior year, including the $25 million gain on the milk divestiture, a 42% increase in marketing expense, the unfavorable impact of volume and plan increases in manufacturing overhead cost offset much of this gain. 
The higher overhead costs were primarily attributable to the new peanut butter facility in Memphis as well as temporarily under absorbed overhead costs related to our working capital initiatives. 
On a full year basis, we continue to expect Consumer Foods segment profits to be down as the gain from the milk sale will be more than offset by higher overhead, the unfavorable impact of lower pricing net of cost and higher marketing expenses. 
Net sales for our U.S. Retail Pet Foods segments were $571 million in the third quarter. Sales for pet snacks and premium pet brands of growth increased high single digits, driven by distribution gains and new item launches. 
Conversely, mainstream pet food sales declined at low double digits resulting in a modest overall decline for the segment. 
Pet Food segment profit was $97 million for the quarter. As anticipated, we realized a sequential increase in segment profit margin from 15.6% in the second quarter to 17% this quarter, and we continue to expect another sequential step up in the fourth quarter. 
Despite the softer than anticipated top line and a slight reduction in profitability expectations for 2016, we remain on track to deliver on our targeted growing full year pet food gross margin by 100 basis points compared to the prior year. 
Lastly, net sales for International and Foodservice declined 4% in the quarter as the addition of pet food in Canada was more than offset by a $17 million impact of FX. 
Combined segment profit for our International and Foodservice businesses was up 4% over the prior year, primarily in our Canadian business. 
Favorable mix, along with lower selling expenses, contributed to the profit gains. 
The impact of foreign exchange partially offset these items. We continue to expect FX to remain a significant headwind in the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2017. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $542 million for the quarter compared to $428 million in the prior year. The increase primarily reflect a lower working capital needs as the impact of higher noncash depreciation and amortization in the current year was offset by the benefit of terminating an interest rate swap in the prior year. 
Factoring in capital expenditures of $43 million, free cash flow was $499 million for the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $962 million. 
We're increasing our full year outlook for free cash flow from $925 million to $975 million. The increase primarily reflects the strong cash flow performance through the first 9 months of the year, which includes nearly $100 million of our working capital improvement target, up from our previous estimate of $60 million. 
Partially offsetting this as we now project CapEx of $240 million for the year, an increase from our most recent guidance of $220 million as we pull forward spending on certain projects into 2016. 
As a result, CapEx in the fourth quarter is projected to approximately $80 million. 
This step up in CapEx, along with planned inventory build and incremental tax payment are the primary cost of free cash flow increasing only modestly for the fourth quarter. 
In addition to this strong free cash flow, we used after-tax proceeds from the divestiture of the milk business of approximately $165 million to further paid down debt during the third quarter. As a result, we ended the quarter with total debt of just under $5.3 billion and leverage currently stand at approximately 3.5x. 
Let me conclude with an update on our full year sales and earnings outlook for 2016. We now expect net sales of approximately $7.8 billion with the reduction from our previous guidance of $7.9 million, primarily attributable to Consumer Foods and Pet Food segments. 
For Consumer Foods, this reflects the softer-than-anticipated third quarter results, which we expect to continue into the fourth quarter, particularly for our oil and baking businesses. For Pets, this reflects the continuing challenges in our dry dog food. 
With stronger-than-expected Coffee segment profits and increase in synergies, we expect to offset the net sale shortfall at bottom line. 
As a result, we continue to expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be consistent with our previous guidance range of $5.70 to $5.80. 
Adding the $0.14 gain on sale of Milk business to this range, our updated guidance is now $5.84 to $5.94 for the year. 
Excluding amortization expense of approximately $1.15 per share, this would result in adjusted earnings per share between $6.99 and $7.09. 
As discussed last week, we expect to recognize a noncash deferred tax benefit related to the integration of Big Heart into the Smucker company during the fourth quarter. While not factored into our revised guidance range, we're estimating this benefit to be approximately $50 million. 
In summary, we continue to be pleased with the earnings performance of the company and, in particular, the ongoing strong results for coffee. Our overall results reflect the success of our key growth initiatives for the current year, including the launch of Dunkin K-Cups, achieving lower price points for Folgers roast and ground coffee, introduction of Natural Balance and PetSmart. 
At the same time, while delivering on our cost-savings and our working capital initiatives. 
And as we move ahead, we're encouraged by the plans in place to deliver continued growth. 
With that, we'll now open the call up to your questions. Operator, can you please queue up the first question?"

We did see heightening competitive activity in the marketplace in the quarter in the form of price side and wage changes in bonus ags. We have corn and soybean milk continue to be trading at relative lows and what we have seen is some of that favorability commodities was reinvested in the marketplace and I think what on a year-to-date basis, we would -- our margins, our gross margins in the mainstream pet food business are actually up. So not all of the commodity favorability has been passed through from our perspective, and we're using part of our goal and the way we set our plans for this of fiscal would have been prior to the acquisition of Big Heart by JMS. So we executed those plans. You will see it become a bit more aggressive now as we come into the latter part of the year and the early part of next year to respond to some of the bonus pay activity. Now the relative price and size. But I think overall, it was a little bit more -- it was more down than we would expect it to be, but the margin structure of the business is still pretty good and there's a fundamentally there's a consumer food there's is going to continue to look at value in the marketplace but there other consumers who are looking for other benefits, and we will go meet those other benefits in a different way, it won't be a price lever. So I think Barry's point was, we see other segments emerging, we're very pleased with our premium dog food business in this pet -- specialty channel and in the independent channel, but we're not happy with where we are in mass."

Does require just being more promotional, or is there one piece of the business that you need to attack if you will kind of firm up the non-Dunkin' K-Cup Coffee business?"

The Coffee business does have a couple of big segments and if you bore into that Nielsen data, you'll see that our mainstream roast and ground business, although threw a lot of changes this year remember there's an 11% smaller canister, the promotional size, and we took a 6% price decline. So your roll those two things and then you actually see volume up. So mainstream volume will be up when you take 11% out of the canister. We think it's a nice rebound to that business, and we're hitting price points that excite and I talked about this both the retailer and the consumer, right? You need to the price point to get to retailer excited about merchandising. So that piece of business is much healthier than it's been in a while. So then you take our Dunkin' K-Cup business, and it's fair to say that, that business has just come out of the gate on fire. We should continue to see good momentum there. So the Dunkin' K-Cup business is very strong and although small, Bustelo is starting to move our share a little bit, right? It's starting to get big enough that that business is material. Now the Dunkin' bag business has been a struggle early on the year. I would say that we've seen price compression in premium that we've never seen before. And part of that was driven by a green and part of that is driven by the strategy of the competitive side. And so the good news is the pricing we have in the market we've seen today turned that around somewhat turned that around be expected business as green helps us to get even better. And frankly the legacy K-Cup business or the Folgers K-Cup business is performing, I would argue, held up K-Cup category. If you take 2 premium brand out, you take out some of the other major premium brand in the K-Cup business, it's not a healthy category. And so the opportunity for us is to continue the momentum on the Dunkin' business and to fix our K-Cup business. And we are committed, I think it's an important statement to grow in our whole K-Cup portfolio over time. Dunkin' is giving us a little bit of tailwind there, a lot of tailwind right there, but the challenge process to get our legacy K-Cup business back on track."

What's interesting is and where we have seen good growth is on the on-trend items, like gluten-free and the more simple ingredients, those businesses seem to be doing very well, albeit not enough to offset the decline in sort of the mainstream business. So cake frosting, unfortunately, frosting has been down as well. Brownies are actually doing well for some reason, but it's really need more on-trend authentic simple ingredients items that we're seeing some good growth. That would also be true in our Fruit Spreads business as well or even though we had a down quarter in peanut butter, our Jif Natural, our National Product is actually up significantly as well. So from a peanut butter perspective, I think we're less concerns because the consumer takeaway has not followed our decline in shipments.

And I think that in a normal year, I would call that conservative. But there are tougher comparisons in fiscal '17. And I appreciate the comments to grow Natural Balance and Duncans K-Cups and Uncrustables. But I think we've all been in that situation where you have -- what had been a great launch in the first year ends up being a tougher comp in the second year.

So we would expect basically to call each one of those levers and no one is going to drive the growth, but if you combine them all together, we can each get a little bit out of each one, which is our plan, we're going to see reasonable growth. Now we're in categories that we think are -- resonate well with the consumer today. And so we think that we're going to have some reasonable baseline growth in addition, with new product growth.

It's much more difficult to move those types of businesses. So in the dry dog food business, in the mass channel is a business that is much more ESLP and plan with big one customers. So we are looking at all levers, so we're looking at pricing, we're looking at product packaging, we're looking at other opportunities to innovate in the business, not just in the Kibbles 'n Bits brands but across our entire mass dog food business. So we're looking at all the levers. I think what in the short-term, the ""easiest""  lever to pull is always pricing promotion. It's not generally the smartest one to pull because when you talk about poor trade spending, poor IRI, the trade spend is deployed on a short-term basis generally doesn't have great ROI because you don't get the kind of merchandising, your lift force that you would expect. So I think we've looked at all of those things as I mentioned from a profitability standpoint when we had our Investor Day, the areas of focus for growth for the pet business were around pet snacks, dog snacks and cat snacks, around the premium business and particularly, Natural Balance and the expansion of Natural Balance and then also focus in our cat business, our Meow Mix business, which is our largest brand in the pet portfolio and innovation that we have coming on that brand next year. So the role of the dry dog food business and mass has not been one of growth that has been one of profit maintenance, and that's the role we've taken our margins are up for the year. Our gross margins are up, that's the role of portfolio. As Barry said, we've looked at what we're doing. I don't want to get into specifics. I don't  think I want to be forecasting or projecting into the marketplace longer to do, but we are looking at all levers, and you will see some changes in terms of how we're going to market across the portfolio. But as I said, we're disappointed with those kind of results. But overall, when I look strategically across the 3 growth levers that we talked about when we had our Investor Day back in October, we're hitting on those 3 levers and this was not going to be a huge area of focus for growth for us. Unfortunately, right now, it's down significantly, and we'll take steps that we need to fix it."

And then maybe if you could just touch a little bit on these advertising mix so digital versus traditional media, et cetera. That will be helpful."

We're supporting Milk-Bone, the Milk-Bone brand, we're supporting Meow Mix Irresistible Cat Snacks, and we're also supporting the Natural Balance brand as we expanded our distribution footprint. I think those 3 initiatives are really against trial and awareness and building, so the ROI on them initially is a tough to measure because you're trying to get to trial and repeat. So I'm not sure that the economic effectiveness of it measuring it in the first quarter, at the end of 6 months that it's the same true on Dunkin' K-Cups and Jif Peanut Butter bars and the number of other things where we're going to advertise new items. It's part of launching a new item with the quality way you try to stock your marketing so that you'll get merchandising as well as an attractive price point plus consumer awareness. So a lot of the marketing that you're seeing from us is a geared towards that, across the portfolio. And then the other area where I think it's more difficult for the industry in general to measure is an investment in digital. And we're trying to make sure that we invest in first party data and first party relationships with consumers. We want to reach them wherever they are and want to make sure that we are on their path to purchase. So whether it's free shop or in-store as they're making decisions, we are focused on building a digital network and a digital ecosystem that reaches them there. So there's some infrastructure building there as well. Overall, I think we continue to look at the ROI and I think will fine-tune them as we go along. But I think is the right thing to do with the brands that we have to support them the way we're supporting them."

As Dave said, there's a lot of advertising being spent, particularly we had on, what we would call initiatives. So if you think about the 2 buckets of advertising, it's equity support and initiative. And so while a lot of it you're seeing on pet is more on new products initiatives versus Smucker's we're on there with a new ad that is strictly focused on equity. And so again -- but in either case, they're relatively difficult to manage or measure, I should say, and so just trying to get the ROI on those isn't the quarterly exercise, it's more like a 12-month exercise. But we do feel that obviously supporting our brand is very important, and we're going to continue to do that, but I think that's it."

In terms of the dollar investment and guys, jump in here. We would continue to invest as we were. I think we said earlier on our call, our marketing spend while it's up significantly, it quite came returning to more historical levels. So we don't see that at least year-over-year as another significant incremental jump in marketing as we would a pretty good run rate. So I don't think you got to be too concerned about that being a big headwind going into it. And then, again, we're kind of moving to our planning process for '17, but the expectations is for all things you've heard today where we're trying to build the business, we would expect to see some benefits out of that and trying to hit sort of our normal growth rate for those business units."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. It was a great pleasure to see many of you last week at CAGNY.

It was a great pleasure to see many of you last week at CAGNY. We appreciate the opportunity to provide an update on a number of key initiatives that are going on across our businesses. 
One of our takeaways from CAGNY was how aligned the CPG companies were on the trends that we're all seeing in the changing consumer perceptions and shopping habits. The real key to success is how each company responds to these changes and perceptions. We are trying to capitalize early on trends and not the fads, with bigger, longer-lasting bets. 
We also believe that our company, and especially our brands, are well in line with the consumers' desires and we are in a better position than most to capture more of the growth from these trends. 
Today, our comments will primarily focus on the third quarter financial results that we announced earlier this morning and our updated outlook for the rest of the year.  I'll begin with an overview of consolidated results. 
First, net sales increased 37% to nearly $2 billion, driven by the addition of the Big Heart Pet Brands. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, sales declined reflect -- the sales decline of 1% was reflected in volume decline in Consumer Foods and the price decline in Coffee.  
Second, non-GAAP operating income grew $108 million or 44% for the third quarter.  The addition of the Big Heart business, strong Coffee segment profit growth and onetime gain on the divestiture of the U.S. canned milk business were all key drivers. 
Third, reflecting increased interest expense and a higher share count, non-GAAP earnings per share increased 14% to $1.76.  Excluding amortization, adjusted earnings per share were $2.05, an increase of 21% from the comparable measure in the prior year. Both of these EPS metrics include a $0.14 per share gain on the divestiture of the milk business. 
Lastly, we generated record free cash flow of nearly $500 million in the quarter, bringing the full year total to $962 million. 
Turning to our U.S. Retail segments. I'll start with Coffee, which had another strong quarter as our growth initiatives, along with favorable manufacturing overhead and commodity cost benefited results. 
Looking at the key drivers, Folgers roast and ground coffee volume based on tonnage was up slightly compared to the prior year, while unit shipments increased even more, reflecting the transition to a reduced canister size for the key -- for key Folgers offerings.  With our price reduction related to small canisters and an additional list price decrease implemented in July to pass through lower green coffee cost, consumers are seeing lower price points on shelf and our market share continues to grow.  During the latest 12-week period, our brands gained 3 points of dollar share within the mainstream Coffee segment. 
For our overall K-Cup portfolio, the Dunkin' Donuts brand continues to drive growth with a 12-week ACB of over 90% and a 6% dollar share of the K-Cup category.  Consumer trial and repeat rates also remained strong.  We are pleased with the momentum for this business, which has helped offset declines for Folgers K-Cups.  
As with other mainstream brands, Folgers K-Cups continue to be impacted by the proliferation of offerings in the K-Cup space and the resulting competitive pricing. Our team is focused on improving this trend, including price improvements. 
The performance of Dunkin' Donuts bagged coffee was soft in the quarter, reflecting aggressive pricing -- competitive pricing. However, the recent target pricing investments, which are supported by favorable green coffee cost, our price gaps have improved and we are well-positioned as we move ahead. 
Lastly, Café Bustelo brand established a new record for the quarterly sales under our ownership with double-digit gains for both roast and ground and K-Cup offerings in the quarter.  Promotional activities such as our Café Bustelo pop-up cafés have successfully broadened the brand awareness, and the brand continues to gain traction especially with millennials. 
Turning to Consumer Foods. Overall results were mixed. Specifically, the Smucker's brand performed well in the quarter. Smucker's Uncrustables frozen sandwiches achieved a 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit volume growth.  In addition, net sales for Smucker's Fruit Spreads were in line with last year's third quarter and the brand continues to gain volume and dollar share within the Fruit Spreads category. 
Within Natural Foods, our branded business also had a strong third quarter, led by double-digit sales gains for our R.W. Knudsen family and Santa Cruz Organic brands. 
Volume for the Jif brand was down from the prior year, primarily attributable to a reduction in inventory levels at several key customers. We believe this is mostly the result of timing as ScanData trends remained positive for our peanut butter business. 
Lastly, in the baking aisle, the overall category remains down, which we believe is partially attributable to continued growth in retailers and store bakeries. Our results have been further impacted by aggressive competitive pricing, as was expected.  Our focus remains on providing value-added innovation in these categories and competing responsibly. 
Results for our Pet Food business also fell short of expectations in the quarter. Mainstream Pet Food sales continued to reflect heightened competitive activity in dry dog food, which has impacted the performance of our Kibbles 'n Bits brand.  As we discussed last week, we are looking at all levers, including pricing, and are committed to improving the competitive position of our dry dog food business. 
Cat food sales were also down in the quarter, however, similar to peanut butter, we view this as a timing issue with certain key customers as market share trends remain positive.  Offsetting much of these declines were the continued strong performance of our premium pet food and pet snack -- our pet snack brands, which both achieved high-single digit sales growth in the quarter.  We have been pleased with the rollout of the Natural Balance brand into PetSmart.  Also, innovation for Milk-Bone and Meow Mix brand has continued to be a key contributor to the pet snack results. 
Overall, while mainstream dog food has been challenged, we are pleased by solid results in pet specialty and pet snacks, which are the growing segments of the business. 
With respect to both Pet Foods and the broader organization, we continue to make good progress on our integration activities and synergy targets. Our March 1 integration is now just a week away, and through the hard work and dedication of many individuals throughout our company, we are well-prepared for this exciting milestone. 
Lastly, as Mark will discuss in a moment, we continue to expect our full-year earnings per share before factoring in the gain of the sale of the milk business, to be in line with the guidance provided at the end of the second quarter.  In addition, we remain confident about our brands and the initiatives we have in place to support future growth across our key platforms of Coffee, Consumer Foods and Pet Foods. 
Finally, I'd like to close by thanking all of our employees. This continues to be an exciting and dynamic time, and we appreciate their ongoing efforts. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark."
303591,321462334,938363,"The J. M. Smucker Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2016",2016-02-23,"Earnings Calls","The J. M. Smucker Company","Executives","Thank you, Richard, and good morning, everyone. I will start by providing additional color on our third quarter results and then conclude by updating our outlook for the year. Net sales increased by $534 million in the quarter, reflecting the addition o",1739,"Thank you, Richard, and good morning, everyone. I will start by providing additional color on our third quarter results and then conclude by updating our outlook for the year. 
Net sales increased by $534 million in the quarter, reflecting the addition of Big Heart. Including pet, sales were down as lower net pricing, primarily for Coffee, detracted 2 percentage points from net sales.  Foreign exchange was also unfavorable in the quarter, reducing net sales by about 1 percentage point.  Conversely, volume and mix combined to add 1 point of growth as strong contributions from Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups were mostly offset by declines in several key categories. 
GAAP earnings per share were $1.55 this quarter, 2% below the prior year. Included in GAAP earnings were $45 million of special project costs related to merger integration activities compared to $6 million of such cost in the prior year.  Also included were $7 million of unallocated derivative gains compared to $13 million last year.  Excluding these items, non-GAAP EPS was $1.76, or an increase of 14%, which included a $0.14 per share gain on the divestiture of our U.S. canned milk business.  Excluding amortization expense of $52 million, adjusted EPS was $2.05, up 21% for the quarter. 
Non-GAAP gross profit grew 49%, reflecting the addition of Pet Food and favorable volume/mix for the Coffee segment. And commodity costs were also favorable in the third quarter, most notably for green coffee, and were only partially offset by lower net pricing.  Combined, this resulted in a 310 basis point increase in gross margin to 38.5%, well ahead of our previous expectations for the quarter. 
SD&A increased at a greater rate than sales, primarily attributable to incremental marketing spend across all 3 U.S. Retail segments. 
For the third quarter, synergy recognition totaled approximately $12 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $20 million, mostly benefiting G&A expenses.  As we indicated last week, we're now on track to achieve $35 million in synergies for the full year. 
Amortization expense increased $27 million in the third quarter as a result of the Pet Food acquisition. Factoring all of this in and including a $25 million gain on the sale of the milk business, non-GAAP operating income increased $108 million or 44%, while operating margin increased 80 basis points to 18%.  The gain in operating income was partially offset below the line by higher interest expense and an increase in the number of shares outstanding related to the Big Heart acquisition. 
Let me now provide a brief overview of the results for our segments, starting with Coffee. 
Net sales grew 1% as favorable volume/mix of 5% was mostly offset by lower net pricing. 
For the Folgers brand, net sales declined 9%, mostly attributable to a 6% reduction in net price realization.  Unfavorable mix, driven by declines in Folgers K-Cups, also was a factor. 
Sales for the Dunkin' Donuts brand increased 55% for the quarter, driven by Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups. 
And lastly, Café Bustelo sales were up 16% as the momentum for this brand continues. 
Segment profit increased 17% for the quarter. Higher volume/mix and lower manufacturing overhead more than offset a double-digit increase in marketing and significantly higher selling expense due to the Dunkin' Donuts royalties.  And in addition, we continue to recognize lower green coffee cost in the quarter, which was only partially offset by the lower net pricing. 
As we move ahead, we anticipate fourth quarter segment profit growth to be comparable to the year-to-date rate, reflecting the momentum in the business, additional contributions from Dunkin K-Cups and favorable coffee costs. 
Factored into this outlook is ongoing marketing spend related to new products, along with plans to continue supporting key price points as well as other targeted pricing investments to address competitive activity related to Dunkin' Donuts bagged coffee and Folgers K-Cups. 
Overall, we are very pleased with this level of profit recovery following the decline in the prior year. 
Turning to Consumer Foods. Net sales were down 5% as lower volume, the impact of the canned milk divestiture and lower net price realization all contributed. 
Looking at our key brands. Volume for Jif Peanut Butter was down 7% compared to a strong prior year quarter where volume was up 7%.  As Richard indicated, we believe the current year decline is mostly the result of timing as consumer takeaway was up slightly in the quarter based on volume trends reported in IRI's latest 4- and 12-week scan periods. 
Volume for Smucker's Uncrustables was up an impressive 33% for quarter, while Smucker's Fruit Spreads were down 2%. However, similar to peanut butter, we're encouraged that consumer takeaway trends were much better as scan volume was up nearly 4% in the latest 4- and 12-week periods for Smucker's Fruit Spreads. 
And lastly, in the bake aisle, volume for the Crisco and Pillsbury brand declined 3% and 9%, respectively. 
Segment profit increased 6% compared to the prior year, including the $25 million gain on the milk divestiture, a 42% increase in marketing expense, the unfavorable impact of volume and planned increases in manufacturing overhead costs offset much of this gain.  The higher overhead costs were primarily attributable to the new peanut butter facility in Memphis, as well as temporarily under-absorbed overhead costs related to our working capital initiatives. 
On a full-year basis, we continue to expect Consumer Foods segment profits to be down as the gain from the milk sale will be more than offset by higher overhead, the unfavorable impact of lower pricing net of cost and higher marketing expenses. 
Net sales for our U.S. Retail Pet Foods segments were $571 million in the third quarter. Sales for pet snacks and premium pet brands both increased high-single digits, driven by distribution gains and new item launches.  Conversely, mainstream Pet Food sales declined at low-double digits, resulting in a modest overall decline for the segment. 
Pet Food segment profit was $97 million for the quarter. As anticipated, we realized a sequential increase in segment profit margin from 15.6% in the second quarter to 17% this quarter, and we continue to expect another sequential step up in the fourth quarter. 
Despite the softer-than-anticipated top line and a slight reduction in profitability expectations for 2016, we remain on track to deliver on our target of growing full-year Pet Food gross margin by 100 basis points compared to the prior year. 
Lastly, net sales for International and Foodservice declined 4% in the quarter as the addition of Pet Food in Canada was more than offset by a $17 million impact of FX.  Combined segment profit for our International and Foodservice businesses was up 4% over the prior year, primarily in our Canadian business.  Favorable mix, along with lower selling expenses, contributed to the profit gains. 
The impact of foreign exchange partially offset these items. We continue to expect FX to remain a significant headwind in the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2017. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $542 million for the quarter compared to $428 million in the prior year. The increase primarily reflect a lower working capital needs as the impact of higher noncash depreciation and amortization in the current year was offset by the benefit of terminating an interest rate swap in the prior year. 
Factoring in capital expenditures of $43 million, free cash flow was $499 million for the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $962 million. 
We're increasing our full-year outlook for free cash flow from $925 million to $975 million. The increase primarily reflects the strong cash flow performance through the first 9 months of the year, which includes nearly $100 million of our working capital improvement target, up from our previous estimate of $60 million.  Partially offsetting this is we now project CapEx of $240 million for the year, an increase from our most recent guidance of $220 million, as we pull forward spending on certain projects into 2016.  As a result, CapEx in the fourth quarter is projected to be approximately $80 million. 
This step up in CapEx, along with planned inventory build and an incremental tax payment are the primary cause of free cash flow increasing only modestly for the fourth quarter.  In addition to this strong free cash flow, we used the after-tax proceeds from the divestiture of the milk business of approximately $165 million to further pay down debt during the third quarter. As a result, we ended the quarter with total debt of just under $5.3 billion and leverage currently stands at approximately 3.5x. 
Let me conclude with an update on our full-year sales and earnings outlook for 2016. We now expect net sales of approximately $7.8 billion, with the reduction from our previous guidance of $7.9 million primarily attributable to Consumer Foods and Pet Food segments. 
For Consumer Foods, this reflects the softer-than-anticipated third quarter results, which we expect to continue into the fourth quarter, particularly for our oil and baking businesses. For Pet, this reflects the continuing challenges in our dry dog food. 
With stronger-than-expected Coffee segment profits and increase in synergies, we expect to offset the net sale shortfall at the bottom line.  As a result, we continue to expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be consistent with our previous guidance range of $5.70 to $5.80.  Adding the $0.14 gain on sale of the milk business to this range, our updated guidance is now $5.84 to $5.94 for the year.  Excluding amortization expense of approximately $1.15 per share, this would result in adjusted earnings per share between $6.99 and $7.09. 
As discussed last week, we expect to recognize a noncash deferred tax benefit related to the integration of Big Heart into the Smucker company during the fourth quarter. While not factored into our revised guidance range, we're estimating this benefit to be approximately $50 million. 
In summary, we continue to be pleased with the earnings performance of the company, and in particular, the ongoing strong results for coffee. Our overall results reflect the success of our key growth initiatives for the current year, including the launch of Dunkin K-Cups, achieving lower price points for Folgers roast and ground coffee, introduction of Natural Balance at PetSmart, at the same time, while delivering on our cost-savings and our working capital initiatives.  And as we move ahead, we're encouraged by the plans in place to deliver continued growth.

We did see a heightening competitive activity in the marketplace in the quarter in the form of price side and weight changes and bonus bags. We have corn and soybean milk continue to be trading at relative lows, and what we have seen is some of that favorability commodities was reinvested in the marketplace and I think what -- on a year-to-date basis, we would -- our margins, our gross margins in the mainstream Pet Food business are actually up. So not all of the commodity favorability has been passed through, from our perspective, and we're using part of our goal on the way in when we set our plans for this fiscal would've been prior to the acquisition of Big Heart by JMS. So we executed those plans. You will see it become a bit more aggressive now as we come into the latter part of the year and the early part of next year to respond to some of the bonus bag activity on the relative pricing side. But I think, overall, it was a little bit more -- it was more down than we would've expected it to be. But the margin structure of the business is still pretty good and there's -- fundamentally, there's a consumer who's going to continue to look at value in the marketplace but there are other consumers who are looking for other benefits, and we will go meet those other benefits in a different way. It won't be a price lever. So I think Barry's point was, we see other segments emerging. We're very pleased with our premium dog food business in this pet specialty channel and in the independent pet channels, but we are not happy with where we are in mass."

And if you bore into that Nielsen data, you'll see that our mainstream roast and ground business, although through a lot of change this year, remember there's an 11% smaller canister, the promotional size, and we took a 6% price decline. So you roll those 2 things in and you actually see volume up. So mainstream volume are going to be up when you take 11% out of the canister. We think it's a nice rebound for that business, and we're hitting price points that excite. I talked about this, both the retailer and the consumer, right? You need the price point to get the retailer excited about merchandising it. So that piece of business is much healthier than it's been in a while. So then you take our Dunkin' K-Cup business, and it's fair to say that, that business has just come out of the gates on fire. We should continue to see good momentum there. So the Dunkin' K-Cup business is very strong. And although small, Bustelo is starting to move our share a little bit, right? It's starting to get big enough that, that business is material. Now the Dunkin' bag business has been a struggle early on the year. And I would say that we've seen price compression in premium that we've never seen before. And part of that is driven by green, and part of that is driven by strategy of the competitive side. And so the good news is the pricing we have in the market we've seen today turned that around, somewhat turned that around, and we expect that business as green helps us to get even better. And frankly, the legacy K-Cup business or the Folgers K-Cup business is performing, I would argue, how the K-Cup category. If you take 2 premium brands out, you take us and the other major premium brand out of the K-Cup business, it's not been that healthy of a category. And so the opportunity for us is to continue the momentum on the Dunkin' business and to fix our K-Cup business. And we are committed, I think it's an important statement, to growing our whole K-Cup portfolio over time. Dunkin' has given us a little bit of a tailwind there, a lot of tailwind right there, but the challenge for us is to get our legacy K-Cup business back on track."

So we have other businesses that are sold in the premium and in channels, and they are not growing as rapidly. So we -- I'm pleased with where we are on -- with Natural Balance. I think we've done a very good job of expanding the footprint this year. We have our first national ad campaign on the business that we've launched into a higher protein offering in the period, and we've gotten good shelf space in the major retailer PetSmart and kept our relationships with Petco and the independents at the same time.

We think the green market as we look out the next quarter or so or 2 looks like it will continue to help us hit those price points to invest in the things I talked about in the earlier question and maintain similar margins.

So cake, frosting -- unfortunately, frosting has been down as well. Brownies are actually doing well for some reason, but it's really in the more on-trend, authentic simple-ingredient items that we're seeing some good growth. That would also be true in our fruit spreads business as well, or even though we had a down quarter in peanut butter, our Jif Natural, our No-Stir natural product is actually up significantly as well. So from a peanut butter perspective, I think we're less concerned because the consumer takeaway has not followed our decline in shipments.

But I think we've all been in that situation where you have -- what had been a great launch in the first year ends up being a tougher comp in the second year.

It's much more difficult to move those types of businesses. So and the dry dog food business in the mass channel is a business that is much more EDLP and planned with some big long-lead customers. So we are looking at all levers, so we're looking at pricing, we're looking at product packaging, we're looking at other opportunities to innovate in the business, not just in the Kibbles 'n Bits brand but across our entire mass dog food business. So we're looking at all the levers. I think what -- in the short-term, the ""easiest"" lever to pull is always pricing promotion. It's not generally the smartest one to pull because when you talk about poor trade spending, poor ROI, the trade spend that's deployed on a short-term basis generally doesn't have great ROI because you don't get the kind of merchandising [indiscernible] that you would expect. So I think we've looked at all of those things, as I mentioned, from a profitability standpoint. When we had our Investor Day, the areas of focus for growth for the pet business were around pet snacks, dog snacks and cat snacks, around the premium business and particularly, Natural Balance and the expansion of Natural Balance and then also focused on our cat business, our Meow Mix business, which is our largest brand in the pet portfolio and innovation that we have coming on that brand next year. So the role of the dry dog food business en masse has not been one of growth. It has been one of profit maintenance, and now that's the role we've taken with -- our margins are up for the year. Our gross margins are up, that's the role of portfolio. As Barry said, we've looked at what we're doing. I don't want to get into specifics. I don't think I want to be forecasting or projecting into the marketplace. What I'm going to do -- but we are looking at all levers, and you will see some changes in terms of how we're going to market across the portfolio. But as I said, yes, we're disappointed with those kind of results. But overall, when I look strategically across the 3 growth levers that we talked about when we had our Investor Day back in October, we're hitting on those 3 levers and this is -- was not going to be a huge area of focus for growth for us. Unfortunately, right now, it's down significantly, and we'll take the steps that we need to fix it."

It's part of launching a new item with a quality way is that you try to stack your marketing so that you get merchandising as well as an attractive price point plus consumer awareness. So a lot of the marketing that you're seeing from us is geared towards that across the portfolio. And then the other area where I think it's more difficult for the industry in general to measure is an investment in digital. And we're trying to make sure that we invest in first party data and first party relationships with consumers. We want to reach them wherever they are, and we want to make sure that we're in -- on their path to purchase. So whether it's free shop or in-store as they're making decisions, we are focused on building a digital network and a digital ecosystem that reaches them there. So there's some infrastructure building there as well. Overall, I think we continue to look at our ROIs, and I think we'll fine-tune them as we go along. But I think it's the right thing to do with the brands that we have to support them the way we're supporting them."

And so while a lot of it you're seeing in the Pet is more on new product initiatives versus Smucker's we're on air with the new ad that is strictly focused on equity. And so again -- but in either case, they're relatively difficult to manage or measure, I should say, and so just trying to get the ROI on those isn't a quarterly exercise. It's more like a 12-month exercise. So -- but we do feel that obviously supporting our brand is very important, and we're going to continue to do that, but I think that's it."

And then two, how should we be thinking about the 3- to 4-year growth targets you set out on a segment basis top line back in October?"

In terms of the dollar investment and guys, jump in here. We would continue to invest as we were. I think it was said earlier on our call, our marketing spend while it's up significantly, it quite keenly is returning to more historical levels. So we don't see that at least year-over-year as another significant incremental jump in marketing as we would consider this a pretty good run rate. So I don't think you got to be too concerned about that being a big headwind going into it. And then, again, we're kind of moving through our planning process for '17, but the expectations is for all the things you've heard today where we're trying to build the business, we would expect to see some benefits out of that and trying to hit sort of our normal growth rate for those business units."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. It was a great pleasure to see many of you last week at CAGNY. We appreciate the opportunity to provide an update on a number of key initiatives that are going on across our businesse",1201,"Thank you, Aaron. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. It was a great pleasure to see many of you last week at CAGNY. We appreciate the opportunity to provide an update on a number of key initiatives that are going on across our businesses. 
One of our takeaways from CAGNY was how aligned the CPG companies were on the trends that we're all seeing in the changing consumer perceptions and shopping habits. The real key to success is how each company responds to these changes and perceptions. We are trying to capitalize early on trends and not the fads, with bigger, longer-lasting bets. 
We also believe that our company, and especially our brands, are well in line with the consumers' desires and we are in a better position than most to capture more of the growth from these trends. 
Today, our comments will primarily focus on the third quarter financial results that we announced earlier this morning and our updated outlook for the rest of the year. I'll begin with an overview of consolidated results. 
First, net sales increased 37% to nearly $2 billion, driven by the addition of the Big Heart Pet Brands. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, sales declined reflect -- the sales decline of 1% was reflected in volume decline in Consumer Foods and the price decline in Coffee. 
Second, non-GAAP operating income grew $108 million or 44% for the third quarter. The addition of the Big Heart business, strong Coffee segment profit growth and the onetime gain on the divestiture of the U.S. canned milk business were all key drivers. 
Third, reflecting increased interest expense and a higher share count, non-GAAP earnings per share increased 14% to $1.76. Excluding amortization, adjusted earnings per share were $2.05, an increase of 21% from the comparable measure in the prior year. Both of these EPS metrics include a $0.14 per share gain on the divestiture of the milk business. 
Lastly, we generated record free cash flow of nearly $500 million in the quarter, bringing the full year total to $962 million. 
Turning to our U.S. Retail segments. I'll start with Coffee, which had another strong quarter as our growth initiatives, along with favorable manufacturing overhead and commodity cost benefited results. 
Looking at the key drivers, Folgers roast and ground coffee volume based on tonnage was up slightly compared to the prior year, while unit shipments increased even more, reflecting the transition to a reduced canister size for the key -- for key Folgers offerings. With our price reduction related to small canisters and an additional list price decrease implemented in July to pass through lower green coffee cost, consumers are seeing lower price points on shelf and our market share continues to grow. During the latest 12-week period, our brands gained 3 points of dollar share within the mainstream Coffee segment. 
For our overall K-Cup portfolio, the Dunkin' Donuts brand continues to drive growth with a 12-week ACB of over 90% and a 6% dollar share of the K-Cup category. Consumer trial and repeat rates also remained strong. We are pleased with the momentum for this business, which has helped offset declines for Folgers K-Cups. 
As with other mainstream brands, Folgers K-Cups continue to be impacted by the proliferation of offerings in the K-Cup space and the resulting competitive pricing. Our team is focused on improving this trend, including price improvements. 
The performance of Dunkin' Donuts bagged coffee was soft in the quarter, reflecting aggressive pricing -- competitive pricing. However, the recent target pricing investments, which are supported by favorable green coffee cost, our price gaps have improved and we are well-positioned as we move ahead. 
Lastly, Café Bustelo brand established a new record for the quarterly sales under our ownership with double-digit gains for both roast and ground and K-Cup offerings in the quarter. Promotional activities such as our Café Bustelo pop-up cafés have successfully broadened the brand awareness, and the brand continues to gain traction especially with millennials. 
Turning to Consumer Foods. Overall results were mixed. Specifically, the Smucker's brand performed well in the quarter. Smucker's Uncrustables frozen sandwiches achieved a 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit volume growth. In addition, net sales for Smucker's Fruit Spreads were in line with last year's third quarter and the brand continues to gain volume and dollar share within the Fruit Spreads category. 
Within Natural Foods, our branded business also had a strong third quarter, led by double-digit sales gains for our R.W. Knudsen family and Santa Cruz Organic brands. 
Volume for the Jif brand was down from the prior year, primarily attributable to a reduction in inventory levels at several key customers. We believe that this is mostly the result of timing as ScanData trends remained positive for our peanut butter business. 
Lastly, in the baking aisle, the overall category remains down, which we believe is partially attributable to continued growth in retailers’ in-store bakeries. Our results have been further impacted by aggressive competitive pricing, as was expected. Our focus remains on providing value-added innovation in these categories and competing responsibly. 
Results for our Pet Food business also fell short of expectations in the quarter. Mainstream Pet Food sales continued to reflect heightened competitive activity in dry dog food, which has impacted the performance of our Kibbles 'n Bits brand. As we discussed last week, we are looking at all levers, including pricing, and are committed to improving the competitive position of our dry dog food business. 
Cat food sales were also down in the quarter, however, similar to peanut butter, we view this as a timing issue with certain key customers as market share trends remain positive. Offsetting much of these declines were the continued strong performance of our premium pet food and pet snack -- our pet snack brands, which both achieved high-single digit sales growth in the quarter. We have been pleased with the rollout of the Natural Balance brand into PetSmart. Also, innovation for Milk-Bone and Meow Mix brand has continued to be a key contributor to the pet snack results. 
Overall, while mainstream dog food has been challenged, we are pleased by solid results in pet specialty and pet snacks, which are the growing segments of the business. 
With respect to both Pet Foods and the broader organization, we continue to make good progress on our integration activities and synergy targets. Our March 1 integration is now just a week away, and through the hard work and dedication of many individuals throughout our company, we are well-prepared for this exciting milestone. 
Lastly, as Mark will discuss in a moment, we continue to expect our full-year earnings per share before factoring in the gain of the sale of the milk business, to be in line with the guidance provided at the end of the second quarter. In addition, we remain confident about our brands and the initiatives we have in place to support future growth across our key platforms of Coffee, Consumer Foods and Pet Foods. 
Finally, I'd like to close by thanking all of our employees. This continues to be an exciting and dynamic time, and we appreciate their ongoing efforts. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark."
303591,321462334,938454,"The J. M. Smucker Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2016",2016-02-23,"Earnings Calls","The J. M. Smucker Company","Executives","Thank you, Richard, and good morning, everyone. I will start by providing additional color on our third quarter results and then conclude by updating our outlook for the year. Net sales increased by $534 million in the quarter, reflecting the addition o",1739,"Thank you, Richard, and good morning, everyone. I will start by providing additional color on our third quarter results and then conclude by updating our outlook for the year. 
Net sales increased by $534 million in the quarter, reflecting the addition of Big Heart. Including pet, sales were down as lower net pricing, primarily for Coffee, detracted 2 percentage points from net sales. Foreign exchange was also unfavorable in the quarter, reducing net sales by about 1 percentage point. Conversely, volume and mix combined to add 1 point of growth as strong contributions from Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups were mostly offset by declines in several key categories. 
GAAP earnings per share were $1.55 this quarter, 2% below the prior year. Included in GAAP earnings were $45 million of special project costs related to merger integration activities compared to $6 million of such cost in the prior year. Also included were $7 million of unallocated derivative gains compared to $13 million last year. Excluding these items, non-GAAP EPS was $1.76, or an increase of 14%, which included a $0.14 per share gain on the divestiture of our U.S. canned milk business. Excluding amortization expense of $52 million, adjusted EPS was $2.05, up 21% for the quarter. 
Non-GAAP gross profit grew 49%, reflecting the addition of Pet Food and favorable volume/mix for the Coffee segment. And commodity costs were also favorable in the third quarter, most notably for green coffee, and were only partially offset by lower net pricing. Combined, this resulted in a 310 basis point increase in gross margin to 38.5%, well ahead of our previous expectations for the quarter. 
SD&A increased at a greater rate than sales, primarily attributable to incremental marketing spend across all 3 U.S. Retail segments. 
For the third quarter, synergy recognition totaled approximately $12 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $20 million, mostly benefiting G&A expenses. As we indicated last week, we're now on track to achieve $35 million in synergies for the full year. 
Amortization expense increased $27 million in the third quarter as a result of the Pet Food acquisition. Factoring all of this in and including a $25 million gain on the sale of the milk business, non-GAAP operating income increased $108 million or 44%, while operating margin increased 80 basis points to 18%. The gain in operating income was partially offset below the line by higher interest expense and an increase in the number of shares outstanding related to the Big Heart acquisition. 
Let me now provide a brief overview of the results for our segments, starting with Coffee. 
Net sales grew 1% as favorable volume/mix of 5% was mostly offset by lower net pricing. 
For the Folgers brand, net sales declined 9%, mostly attributable to a 6% reduction in net price realization. Unfavorable mix, driven by declines in Folgers K-Cups, also was a factor. 
Sales for the Dunkin' Donuts brand increased 55% for the quarter, driven by Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups. 
And lastly, Café Bustelo sales were up 16% as the momentum for this brand continues. 
Segment profit increased 17% for the quarter. Higher volume/mix and lower manufacturing overhead more than offset a double-digit increase in marketing and significantly higher selling expense due to the Dunkin' Donuts royalties. And in addition, we continue to recognize lower green coffee cost in the quarter, which was only partially offset by the lower net pricing. 
As we move ahead, we anticipate fourth quarter segment profit growth to be comparable to the year-to-date rate, reflecting the momentum in the business, additional contributions from Dunkin K-Cups and favorable coffee costs. 
Factored into this outlook is ongoing marketing spend related to new products, along with plans to continue supporting key price points as well as other targeted pricing investments to address competitive activity related to Dunkin' Donuts bagged coffee and Folgers K-Cups. 
Overall, we are very pleased with this level of profit recovery following the decline in the prior year. 
Turning to Consumer Foods. Net sales were down 5% as lower volume, the impact of the canned milk divestiture and lower net price realization all contributed. 
Looking at our key brands. Volume for Jif Peanut Butter was down 7% compared to a strong prior year quarter where volume was up 7%. As Richard indicated, we believe the current year decline is mostly the result of timing as consumer takeaway was up slightly in the quarter based on volume trends reported in IRI's latest 4- and 12-week scan periods. 
Volume for Smucker's Uncrustables was up an impressive 33% for quarter, while Smucker's Fruit Spreads were down 2%. However, similar to peanut butter, we're encouraged that consumer takeaway trends were much better as scan volume was up nearly 4% in the latest 4- and 12-week periods for Smucker's Fruit Spreads. 
And lastly, in the bake aisle, volume for the Crisco and Pillsbury brand declined 3% and 9%, respectively. 
Segment profit increased 6% compared to the prior year, including the $25 million gain on the milk divestiture, a 42% increase in marketing expense, the unfavorable impact of volume and planned increases in manufacturing overhead costs offset much of this gain. The higher overhead costs were primarily attributable to the new peanut butter facility in Memphis, as well as temporarily under-absorbed overhead costs related to our working capital initiatives. 
On a full-year basis, we continue to expect Consumer Foods segment profits to be down as the gain from the milk sale will be more than offset by higher overhead, the unfavorable impact of lower pricing net of cost and higher marketing expenses. 
Net sales for our U.S. Retail Pet Foods segments were $571 million in the third quarter. Sales for pet snacks and premium pet brands both increased high-single digits, driven by distribution gains and new item launches. Conversely, mainstream Pet Food sales declined at low-double digits, resulting in a modest overall decline for the segment. 
Pet Food segment profit was $97 million for the quarter. As anticipated, we realized a sequential increase in segment profit margin from 15.6% in the second quarter to 17% this quarter, and we continue to expect another sequential step up in the fourth quarter. 
Despite the softer-than-anticipated top line and a slight reduction in profitability expectations for 2016, we remain on track to deliver on our target of growing full-year Pet Food gross margin by 100 basis points compared to the prior year. 
Lastly, net sales for International and Foodservice declined 4% in the quarter as the addition of Pet Food in Canada was more than offset by a $17 million impact of FX. Combined segment profit for our International and Foodservice businesses was up 4% over the prior year, primarily in our Canadian business. Favorable mix, along with lower selling expenses, contributed to the profit gains. 
The impact of foreign exchange partially offset these items. We continue to expect FX to remain a significant headwind in the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2017. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $542 million for the quarter compared to $428 million in the prior year. The increase primarily reflected lower working capital needs as the impact of higher noncash depreciation and amortization in the current year was offset by the benefit of terminating an interest rate swap in the prior year. 
Factoring in capital expenditures of $43 million, free cash flow was $499 million for the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $962 million. 
We're increasing our full-year outlook for free cash flow from $925 million to $975 million. The increase primarily reflects the strong cash flow performance through the first 9 months of the year, which includes nearly $100 million of our working capital improvement target, up from our previous estimate of $60 million. Partially offsetting this is we now project CapEx of $240 million for the year, an increase from our most recent guidance of $220 million, as we pull forward spending on certain projects into 2016. As a result, CapEx in the fourth quarter is projected to be approximately $80 million. 
This step up in CapEx, along with planned inventory build and an incremental tax payment are the primary cause of free cash flow increasing only modestly for the fourth quarter. In addition to this strong free cash flow, we used the after-tax proceeds from the divestiture of the milk business of approximately $165 million to further pay down debt during the third quarter. As a result, we ended the quarter with total debt of just under $5.3 billion and leverage currently stands at approximately 3.5x. 
Let me conclude with an update on our full-year sales and earnings outlook for 2016. We now expect net sales of approximately $7.8 billion, with the reduction from our previous guidance of $7.9 million primarily attributable to Consumer Foods and Pet Food segments. 
For Consumer Foods, this reflects the softer-than-anticipated third quarter results, which we expect to continue into the fourth quarter, particularly for our oil and baking businesses. For Pet, this reflects the continuing challenges in our dry dog food. 
With stronger-than-expected Coffee segment profits and an increase in synergies, we expect to offset the net sale shortfall at the bottom line. As a result, we continue to expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be consistent with our previous guidance range of $5.70 to $5.80. Adding the $0.14 gain on sale of the milk business to this range, our updated guidance is now $5.84 to $5.94 for the year. Excluding amortization expense of approximately $1.15 per share, this would result in adjusted earnings per share between $6.99 and $7.09. 
As discussed last week, we expect to recognize a noncash deferred tax benefit related to the integration of Big Heart into the Smucker company during the fourth quarter. While not factored into our revised guidance range, we're estimating this benefit to be approximately $50 million. 
In summary, we continue to be pleased with the earnings performance of the company, and in particular, the ongoing strong results for coffee. Our overall results reflect the success of our key growth initiatives for the current year, including the launch of Dunkin K-Cups, achieving lower price points for Folgers roast and ground coffee, introduction of Natural Balance at PetSmart, at the same time, while delivering on our cost-savings and our working capital initiatives. And as we move ahead, we're encouraged by the plans in place to deliver continued growth.

We did see a heightening competitive activity in the marketplace in the quarter in the form of price side and weight changes and bonus bags. We have corn and soybean meal continue to be trading at relative lows, and what we have seen is some of that favorability commodities was reinvested in the marketplace and I think what -- on a year-to-date basis, we would -- our margins, our gross margins in the mainstream Pet Food business are actually up. So not all of the commodity favorability has been passed through, from our perspective, and we're using part of our goal on the way in when we set our plans for this fiscal would've been prior to the acquisition of Big Heart by JMS. So we executed those plans. You will see it become a bit more aggressive now as we come into the latter part of the year and the early part of next year to respond to some of the bonus bag activity on the relative pricing side. But I think, overall, it was a little bit more -- it was more down than we would've expected it to be. But the margin structure of the business is still pretty good and there's -- fundamentally, there's a consumer who's going to continue to look at value in the marketplace but there are other consumers who are looking for other benefits, and we will go meet those other benefits in a different way. It won't be a price lever. So I think Barry's point was, we see other segments emerging. We're very pleased with our premium dog food business in this pet specialty channel and in the independent pet channels, but we are not happy with where we are in mass."

The Coffee business does have a couple of big segments. And if you bore into that Nielsen data, you'll see that our mainstream roast and ground business all go through a lot of change this year, remember there's an 11% smaller canister, the promotional size, and we took a 6% price decline. So you roll those 2 things in and you actually see volume up. So for mainstream volume to be up when you take 11% out of the canister, we think is a nice rebound for that business, and we're hitting price points that excite. I talked about this, both the retailer and the consumer, right? You need the price point that gets the retailer excited about merchandising it. So that piece of business is much healthier than it's been in a while. So then you take our Dunkin' K-Cup business, and it's fair to say that, that business has just come out of the gates on fire. We should continue to see good momentum there. So the Dunkin' K-Cup business is very strong. And although small, Bustelo is starting to move our share a little bit, right? It's starting to get big enough that, that business is material. Now the Dunkin' bag business has been a struggle early on in the year. And I would say that we've seen price compression in premium that we've never seen before. And part of that is driven by green, and part of that is driven by strategy of the competitive side. And so the good news is the pricing we have in the market we've seen today turned that around, somewhat turned that around, and we expect that business as green helps us to get even better. And frankly, the legacy K-Cup business or the Folgers K-Cup business is performing, I would argue, how the K-Cup category. If you take 2 premium brands out, you take us and the other major premium brand out of the K-Cup business, it's not been that healthy of a category. And so the opportunity for us is to continue the momentum on the Dunkin' business and to fix our K-Cup business.

So we have other businesses that are sold in the premium and independent channels, and they are not growing as rapidly. So we -- I'm pleased with where we are on -- with Natural Balance. I think we've done a very good job of expanding the footprint this year. We have our first national ad campaign on the business that we've launched into a higher protein offering in the brand, and we've gotten good shelf space in the major retailer PetSmart and kept our relationships with Petco and the independents at the same time.

So I think we can see very good margins. We continue to see solid margin growth in this business. We think the green market as we look out the next quarter or so or 2 looks like it will continue to help us hit those price points to invest in the things I talked about in the earlier question and maintain similar margins.

Now obviously, we had the tailwind with a little bit of Green Mountain, or excuse me, the green cost coffee cost and -- but the work on getting the Dunkin' K-Cups was also a 2- or 3-year project. So a lot of those initiatives, really, are 2 to 3 years old, and now they're all coming to fruition this year. So I just want to put in perspective that when we see a tough quarter, we can't respond, and the very next quarter, things turn around.

So cake, frosting -- unfortunately, frosting has been down as well. Brownies are actually doing well for some reason, but it's really in the more on-trend, authentic simple-ingredient items that we're seeing some good growth. That would also be true in our fruit spreads business as well, or even though we had a down quarter in peanut butter, our Jif Natural, our No-Stir natural product is actually up significantly as well.

But -- and I think that in a normal year, I would call that conservative. But there are tougher comparisons in fiscal '17. And I appreciate the comments to grow Natural Balance and Dunkin's K-Cups and Uncrustables. But I think we've all been in that situation where you have -- what had been a great launch in the first year ends up being a tougher comp in the second year. So I guess, is there something you could tell me little bit more about what's going to drive the growth in those businesses while maintaining kind of the core at a flattish basis? Is it distribution, is it advertising? What is it that's going to keep those growing?"

It's much more difficult to move those types of businesses. So and the dry dog food business in the mass channel is a business that is much more EDLP and planned with some big long-lead customers. So we are looking at all levers, so we're looking at pricing, we're looking at product packaging, we're looking at other opportunities to innovate in the business, not just in the Kibbles 'n Bits brand but across our entire mass dog food business. So we're looking at all the levers. I think what -- in the short-term, the ""easiest"" lever to pull is always pricing promotion. It's not generally the smartest one to pull because when you talk about poor trade spend, poor ROI, the trade spend that's deployed on a short-term basis generally doesn't have great ROI because you don't get the kind of merchandising or lift for it that you would expect. So I think we've looked at all of those things, as I mentioned, from a profitability standpoint. When we had our Investor Day, the areas of focus for growth for the pet business were around pet snacks, dog snacks and cat snacks, around the premium business and particularly, Natural Balance and the expansion of Natural Balance and then also focused on our cat business, our Meow Mix business, which is our largest brand in the pet portfolio and innovation that we have coming on that brand next year. So the role of the dry dog food business en masse has not been one of growth. It has been one of profit maintenance, and now that's the role we've taken with -- our margins are up for the year. Our gross margins are up, that's the role of portfolio. As Barry said, we've looked at what we're doing. I don't want to get into specifics. I don't think I want to be forecasting or projecting into the marketplace what I'm going to do. But we are looking at all levers, and you will see some changes in terms of how we're going to market across the portfolio. But as I said, yes, we're disappointed with those kind of results. But overall, when I look strategically across the 3 growth levers that we talked about when we had our Investor Day back in October, we're hitting on those 3 levers and this is -- was not going to be a huge area of focus for growth for us. Unfortunately, right now, it's down significantly, and we'll take the steps that we need to fix it."

We're supporting Milk-Bone, the Milk-Bone brand, we're supporting Meow Mix Irresistibles Cat Snacks, and we're also supporting the Natural Balance brand as we expanded our distribution footprint. I think those 3 initiatives are really against trial and awareness and building, so the ROI on them is initially is tough to measure because you're trying to get to trial and repeat. So I'm not sure that the economic effectiveness of it measuring it in the first quarter it’s in or the first 6 months that it's in. The same is going to be true on Dunkin' K-Cups and Jif Peanut Butter bars and the number of the other things where we're going to advertise new items. It's part of launching a new item with a quality way is that you try to stack your marketing so that you get merchandising as well as an attractive price point plus consumer awareness. So a lot of the marketing that you're seeing from us is geared towards that across the portfolio. And then the other area where I think it's more difficult for the industry in general to measure is an investment in digital. And we're trying to make sure that we invest in first-party data and first-party relationships with consumers. We want to reach them wherever they are, and we want to make sure that we're in -- on their path to purchase. So whether it's pre-shop or in-store as they're making decisions, we are focused on building a digital network and a digital ecosystem that reaches them there. So there's some infrastructure building there as well. Overall, I think we continue to look at our ROIs, and I think we'll fine-tune them as we go along.

The only other thing I -- we would bring in to that is, we mentioned earlier, is just where share repurchases would fall into that. That may cause us to be -- to borrow a bit to do such, but I think generally speaking, I would just hold to our cash deployment model we talked about really since the acquisition was announced a year ago."

I think it was said earlier on our call, our marketing spend while it's up significantly, it quite candidly is returning to more historical levels. So we don't see that at least year-over-year as another significant incremental jump in marketing as we would consider this a pretty good run rate.

So where in the past, I don't want to say -- this is a not a categorical statement that everything would expect to grow evenly, but I do think we are setting different expectations on the brand as somewhat indicated by the growth rates that we've put for the 4 business units. So I think that will just continue -- the maturation of how we look at businesses. And if it makes sense over time, if there are brand or brands that fall out of favor, I think in that process it will surface.

These statements rely on a number of assumptions and estimates, and actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. I encourage you to read the full disclosure statement in this morning's press release concerning forward-looking statements. 
Additionally, please note the company uses non-GAAP results for the purpose of evaluating performance internally as detailed in the press release, which is located on our corporate website at jmsmucker.com. 
As we indicated earlier in the calendar year, we are transitioning to one non-GAAP earnings per share metric in 2017, which excludes noncash intangible amortization. We will refer to this as adjusted EPS.  Amortization expense will also be removed from our definition of segment profits as well as non-GAAP operating income and net income. We will follow Form 8-K later this quarter to recast prior year's segment results to reflect the new definition. We have posted to our website a couple of supplementary slides, including a bridge from our fiscal 2016 results to our fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS guidance. These slides can be accessed through the link to the website of this call. This document and a replay of this call will be archived on our website.

Fiscal 2016 was a dynamic and exciting year for the Smucker company as our teams delivered on a number of key strategic initiatives. These included: Significantly improving the performance of our Coffee business; reflecting the launch of the Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups; and returning momentum to our mainstream Coffee business; expanding distribution for our Natural Balance pet brand; executing a seamless integration of the Pet Food business; exceeding our synergy and working capital targets for the year; divesting our U.S. Canned Milk business, all resulting in record financial performance and earnings and cash flow that exceeded our expectation. 
Let me expand on the results for the year. Net sales increased 37% to $7.8 billion, reflecting the full year contribution by the Big Heart pet brand. 
Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, sales increased 3% for the full year. 
Non-GAAP operating income was up 49% to $1.28 million with the contributions from Pet and strong Coffee segment profit growth being the key drivers.  Non-GAAP earnings per share were $6.57, including a onetime $0.46 per share -- $0.42 per share noncash benefit. 
This compares to our most recent guidance of $5.84 to $5.94, which excluded the tax benefit. 
Lastly, the company generated free cash flow of $1.26 billion, which is well above our [indiscernible]. 
Reflecting the strong cash flow, we exceeded our deleveraging objective for the year, reducing total debt by nearly $750 million. 
We also returned over $750 million of cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. There are numerous accomplishments during the past fiscal year and this performance is a testament to the dedication of our employees, and we thank them for their continued effort. 
We are well positioned to continue this momentum into fiscal 2017. Since the last time we spoke to many of you, we announced several executive appointments that are consistent with the company's history of long-term succession planning and the development of leadership to meet the current and future needs of our business and the constituents that we serve. 
Effectively first, Mark Smucker assumed the role of President and Chief Executive Officer. Mark and his experienced leadership team embody the values that have attributed to the company's success and long-term growth. I am confident that under their direction, the company will continue to innovate the ball and grow in the years to come. 
It's been an honor to serve as CEO of the Smucker company, and I'm grateful to have worked alongside the most talented team in the industry. I will continue to serve the company as Executive Chairman. Among other areas, my efforts will be focused on board related matters, counsel and advice on strategic decisions, enhancing customer relationships and advancing our industry leadership efforts. 
My brother, Tim, has been appointed to the role of Chairman emeritus, and we also look forward to his continued contribution. 
Lastly, I would like to recognize Vince Byrd, who has participating in his final earnings call as his retirement after 39 years with the company is effective tomorrow. Vince's contributions have helped shape the company that we are today and will continue to be reflective in the numerous employees that he has mentored throughout his career. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark."

As you know, our company is unique in being led by only 6 CEOs in its 119-year history. I am honored to succeed Richard as CEO and serve as CEO . Richard has led our company through a period of significant expansion and strategic transformation. As a result, our company is stronger than ever. I am excited to lead our talented team, leveraging the continued counsel of Richard, dad and our outstanding board to drive continued growth and shareholder value. 
I also would like to echo Richard's comment about Vince and thank him for his contribution and mentorship. 
The focus of my comment today will be to provide an update on our business segment, including additional color on full year 2016 performance and initial thoughts on fiscal 2017. 
I'll start with our Coffee business, which far exceeded expectations for the year. Net sales were up 8% and segment profit increased 18% to $646 million, representing a full recovery of the segment profit declined in the prior year. This outperformance was driven by several factors, including the successful launch of Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups, the implementation of the planned Folgers canister downsize, a moderation in competitive activities and the net benefit of lower commodity cost and pricing. 
Providing lower pricing on Folgers roast and ground coffee resulted in improved performance for our mainstream Coffee business in 2016. Tonnage for our mainstream brands was up 3%, while unit shift was up even more given the canister downsize early in the fiscal year. 
In addition, our dollar share within the mainstream segment of that Coffee category increased nearly 2 share points to 55% for the latest 52-week period. 
We anticipate momentum in the Coffee business to continue in 2017. Key initiatives include Folgers sponsorship of the U.S. Olympic team for the upcoming Rio games with marketing activities already underway. 
In addition, last month, we implemented a 6% list price decline across much of our coffee portfolio, reflecting sustained lower grain coffee cost. These lower cost have been reflected in promotional pricing for the past several quarters, and we do not anticipate promoted prices changing significantly. 
With regards to Folgers K-Cups, in 2016, the brand was impacted by the ongoing proliferation and entrance in the K-Cups space, including our introduction of Dunkin' K-Cups. 
This year, we will invest in the product line to improve trends, including lower pricing and new packaging that will leverage the iconic Folgers Red Can brand equity. 
Turning to the Dunkin' Donuts brand. Dunkin' K-Cups achieved nearly $220 million in retail sales for the latest 52-week scan period and gained a 6% dollar share of the K-Cup markets, giving us an overall share of nearly 15% in the K-Cup segment. 
In its first year on the market, the Dunkin' Donuts original SKU has become the #1 K-Cup item in the channels in which we participate. 
As consumer repeat rates remained strong and with opportunities to introduce additional varieties, we anticipate further growth in 2017. 
While challenge through much of 2016, performance improved for Dunkin' Donuts Ag coffee during the fourth quarter. Supported by favorable input cost, we have sharpened pricing to improve gaps to key competitors and we look for positive volume trends to continue. 
Lastly, within Coffee, the Café Bustelo brand experienced a second consecutive year of double-digit sales growth behind strong performance for both roast and ground and K-Cup offerings. This exciting on-trend brand remains well received by millennials, and its growth is expected to continue also in 2017. 
Turning to Consumer Foods. Net sales declined 3% for the year, mostly due to lapping sales from the divested canned and milk business. Segment profit was flat the prior year, supported by the gain on the milk business sales, which offset planned increases in manufacturing overhead costs. 
Looking briefly at the key brands. We are pleased with the overall performance of our spreads business as both Jif Peanut Butter and Smucker's Food Spreads grew volume share over the latest 52-week period. 
In addition, Smucker Uncrustables Frozen Sandwiches had another strong year with volume up 26%, including a 17 consecutive quarter of double-digit volume growth in this most recent fourth quarter. 
On-trend innovation continues to be a focus area for the iconic Jif and Smucker's brand. In fiscal 2017, we look to build on recent successful launches such as Smucker's Fruit and Honey Fruit Spreads and Jif Snack Bars. This includes the upcoming introduction of new snack bar varieties and plans to expand into other snacking platforms. 
In addition, Jif, Smucker's and Uncrustables are all participating in the 2016 Olympics partnership, which will be an integral part of this year's marketing efforts for the brand. 
In the bake aisle, the overall category remains challenged throughout much of this past year, reflecting changing consumer preferences and aggressive competitive pricing. Our focus remains on providing value-added innovation such as our recent gluten-free and simple ingredients offerings. 
We are also excited to announce a licensing arrangement with the Girl Scouts of America. Under this agreement, we are launching new Pillsbury items featuring iconic Girl Scouts cookie flavors. 
Within Natural Foods, our leading R.W. Knudsen family and Santa Cruz Organic brands both achieved solid sales growth in 2016. The key Natural Foods categories in which our brands participate are growing, which gives us confidence in maintaining our momentum in this business. 
We are also excited about our recent investment in the newbie brand and the opportunities this provides in the organic tea category. 
Under our first year of ownership, Pet Foods segment profit of $392 million was generally in line with expectations. Net sales of $2.25 billion fell 1% short of the projections provided at our October Investor Day due to competitive challenges in mainstream dry dog food. 
For the year, mainstream pet food sales decreased mid-single digits, reflecting double-digit declines in dog food and a low single digit decline for the larger cat food business. Offsetting the lower mainstream sales was the strong performance of our Pet Snacks business, which was up mid-single digits over the prior year and our premium pet food brands, which grew double digits behind expanded distribution of the Natural Balance brand. 
As we enter 2017, we anticipate continued growth for Natural Balance as we launch the brand's first national marketing campaign, along with additional in-store support. 
Within pet snacks, innovation for the Milk-Bone and Meow Mix brand for key contributors to 2016 results and we expect to see -- to build on these trends with new product introduction this fiscal year. 
We also continue to focus on opportunities in mainstream pet food, driven by consumer preference for additional protein and natural ingredients. 
Lastly, within the segment, we are excited about our partnership and planned in-store activities related to the animated film, The Secret life of Pets, which will be in theaters next month. 
Turning to International and Foodservice. We are pleased with the full year results despite a significant top and bottom line impacts of foreign currency. Reported net sales were in line with the prior year as the addition of the Pet Food business and the benefit of higher net pricing in Canada offset a $60 million top line impact related to foreign exchange. Segment profit was up 12%, mostly attributable to Foodservice. The introduction of Smucker's Uncrustables into school lunch program contributed to this growth.  The strong underlying performance of our Canadian business was mostly offset by the impact of foreign exchange. 
Let me conclude with an update on our integration and cost-savings activities. We successfully achieved our March 1 integration milestone for the Pet Food business and recognize just over $35 million of synergies for 2016. 
In addition, we have clear visibility and confidence in realizing an incremental $100 million in synergies this fiscal year. 
In total, this would provide approximately $135 million in synergies for 2017. 
Looking ahead, we remain confident in achieving our original goal of $200 million in annual synergies by the end of fiscal 2018. 
In addition to the $200 million of synergies, we are targeting $50 million of incremental annual cost savings to be fully realized over the next few years. Related projects include further optimizing our manufacturing footprint as over the next 18 months, we will close a coffee facility in Harahan, Louisiana and two leased Natural Foods facilities located in Livermore, California, with production being consolidated into existing operation. 
In addition, we are nearly complete with an organizational redesign aimed at further optimizing corporate resources contributing to this cost saving target. 
We expect to initially invest much of these incremental savings in several identified areas. We will continue to prioritize investments that generate top and bottom line growth for key on-trend platform. 
In fiscal 2017, these include opportunities related to Smucker's Uncrustables, Coffee and Snack. 
We are also establishing a new growth and innovation organization, which is being led by a member of my leadership team. The group is being tasked with further building capabilities related to consumer and market insight, digital, innovation, targeted market development strategies for our customers, including pricing and trade spend optimization. 
Lastly, we plan to invest in new growth opportunities to expand our presence in China. 
In closing, 2016 was a historic year for our company and I would like to thank our employees for their efforts. As we enter 2017, key priorities include achieving our synergy goals, building on our product innovation activities and investing in new capabilities to enhance future growth. 
Overall, we remain confident in our long-term strategy, the strength of our brands and our ability to deliver shareholder value in 2017 and beyond. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark Belgya."

I will begin by providing commentary on our fourth quarter results, followed by 2016 cash flow performance and ending with our 2017 outlook. We concluded the fiscal year with strong fourth quarter earnings. Non-G",1562,"Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I will begin by providing commentary on our fourth quarter results, followed by 2016 cash flow performance and ending with our 2017 outlook. 
We concluded the fiscal year with strong fourth quarter earnings. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.86 for the quarter, including a onetime $0.42 per share noncash deferred tax benefit related to the integration of Big Heart into the Smucker company as was previewed during our third quarter call. This strong finish to the year was mostly attributable to coffee, including higher anticipated volume across our mainstream and premium coffee brand and a favorable price cost relationship. 
The comparison of fourth quarter earnings between years is significantly impacted by onetime items reported in each of the respective period. These included deferred tax benefit in the current year as well as the Big Heart acquisition financing-related activities in the prior year. 
As a result, the remainder of my fourth quarter commentary will be focused on the business segment. 
Beginning with Coffee. Fourth quarter net sales grew 9% as favorable volume/mix of 13% was only partially offset by lower net pricing. Sales for the Dunkin' Donuts brand doubled over the prior year with K-Cups driving much of this growth. Double-digit gains for bag Dunkin' Donuts coffee also contributed. 
For the Folgers brand, net sales declined 5% attributable to lower net price realization. And lastly, Café Bustelo sales were up 28% as the momentum for this brand continues. 
Segment profit increased $43 million or 39%. We recognized lower grain coffee cost in the quarter, which were partially offset by lower net pricing. 
In addition, higher volume/mix more than offset increased marketing. 
Turning to Consumer Foods. Net sales were up 5%, excluding the impact of the canned milk divestiture with gains across the majority of our key brands. Sales for Jif were 14% behind higher volume in net pricing, while the Smucker's brand was up 3% and Uncrustables had another strong quarter. 
In the bake aisle, sales for Crisco increased by 6%, driven by higher volume. And lastly, sales for the Pillsbury brand were up modestly as higher price realization offset volume decline. 
Segment profit declined 6% mostly attributable to lapping the prior year earnings of the divested milk business. Planned increases in manufacturing overhead costs also contributed, reflecting the new peanut butter facility in Memphis as well as underreport overhead cost related to our working capital initiatives.  These factors offset lower marketing expense. 
Net sales for U.S. Retail Pet Food segments was $563 million. We estimate this represents an approximate 3% increase compared to the prior year fourth quarter of which 6 weeks were reported under our ownership. 
Sales for our premium Pet Brands will improve low double-digit driven by Natural Balance, while Pet Snacks sales increased in line with the overall segment. Mainstream pet food sales were flat compared to the prior year as growth in our cat food brand offset declines in dog food. 
Pet Food segment profit was $170 million for the quarter. As expected, we realized a sequential increase in segment profit margin from 17% in the third quarter to 20.7% this quarter, primarily reflecting lower marketing expense. Incremental synergy recognition also contributed. 
Net sales for International and Foodservice increased 1% in the quarter, reflecting higher volume/mix in Foodservice. 
In Canada, the addition of Pet Food was potentially offset by the impact of FX. 
Segment profit was up 8% over the prior year, driven by our Foodservice business, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange in Canada. 
Free cash flow was $295 million for the quarter, bringing the 2016 total to $1.26 billion. The outperformance compared to our most recent free cash flow guidance of $975 million was attributable to exceeding our 2016 working capital improvement target, lower than projected CapEx spending, a fourth quarter tax refund of $53 million, which is separate from the deferred tax adjustment impacting earnings and higher net income. 
Expanding on our working capital initiatives. In 2016, we realized the majority of our finished good inventory reduction goal of $200 million nearly a year ahead of schedule. In 2017, we expect to achieve the remainder of the inventory reduction target, along with modest working capital improvements related to accounts payable and receivables, all of which are factored into our 2017 free cash flow outlook i will discuss in a moment. 
We ended the year with debt of $5.4 billion. Based on 2016 EBITDA of $1.58 billion, our leverage stood at 3.4x at April 30, a reduction from 4.1x at the beginning of the year. 
In addition to exceeding our debt pay down target for the year, we were able to restart share repurchase activities, aided by the strong free cash flow and proceeds from the divestiture of the milk business. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased nearly 3% shares outstanding for approximately $430 million. 
In 2017, the lower shares count will offset the EPS impact of the 8 months in loss profit related to the divestment of milk business. 
Turning to our 2017 outlook. We anticipate reported net sales to decrease by 1% compared to the prior year as we will lap approximately $150 million in sales related to the milk divestiture.  Excluding this impact, net sales are projected to be up 1%. Favorable volume/mix across each of the segments, including the benefit of new products is expected to be mostly offset by lower pricing in U.S. Retail Coffee and FX in Canada. 
Approximately $25 million of the incremental $100 million of synergies for 2017 are expected to benefit gross profit. Overall commodity cost are anticipated to be lower. However, our Canadian business is estimating a cogs headwind of $20 million related to FX of which, of course, is expected to be offset.  As a result, we expect gross margins to approximate 39% in 2017. 
Further, SD&A expenses are projected to be comparable with prior year. This reflects a benefit of incremental synergy is related to headcount reductions and other administrative cost savings, offset by increased marketing in support of recently launched product, our Olympic sponsorship, innovation and regulatory expenses. 
We're projecting non-GAAP operating income growth of 4% in 2017 compared to $1.465 billion in the prior year, which excludes amortization and the prior year gain on sales of $25 million. 
Further, excluding the $32 million of profit in last year's operating related to the divestment in milk business, the growth would be 6%. 
Below net operating income, we expect net interest expense of approximately $165 million and a tax rate of 34%. And lastly, a weighted average share count of 116.6 million shares was used based on current shares outstanding. 
Factoring all of these, we are guiding 2017 adjusted EPS in the range of $7.60 to $7.75, which excludes $1.18 per share of estimated noncash amortization. 
Including amortization, this yield a range of $6.42 to $6.57 compared to a 2016 base of $6. This results in year-over-year increases, ranging from 7% to 10%. 
As illustrated on the document posted on our website, we derived the $6 EPS for 2016 by subtracting the $0.42 deferred tax adjustment and the $0.15 milk gain from our reported non-GAAP EPS of $6.57. 
We anticipate much of the EPS growth for the year to be weighted towards the middle 2 quarters of the fiscal years due to several factors. Last year's first quarter included the launch of Dunkin' K-Cups. Also within Coffee, this year's first quarter will be unfavorable impacted due to timing associated with the full quarter impact of the price depreciation taken in July of 2015, along with the additional price point decline taken in May of this year as compared to the recognition of lower cost. Other factors impacting quarterly comparison include the timing of synergy recognition, the timed impact related to trade spent recognition on a quarterly basis and finally, the fourth quarter comparison to this year's strong fourth quarter finish. 
Looking briefly at the segment. Our Coffee profits are projected to be comparable to the record fiscal 2015 level. For Consumer Foods, before the segment profit is expected to be down given the prior year gain on the milk divestiture and the lost milk profit but up mid-single digits when these items are excluded. 
Pet Food segment profit is also projected to be up mid-single digits, reflecting incremental synergies and organic growth, including the contributions of new products. 
And lastly, International and Foodservice is anticipated to be down, primarily reflecting the net impact of FX in Canada. 
We project free cash flow will approximate $1 billion, from which we plan to pay down debt and further reduce leverage to 3.1x by the end of this fiscal year. This assumes projected 2017 EBITDA of $1.63 billion. 
Additional assumptions related to 2017 include amortization expense of nearly $210 million; depreciation of $215 million; share-based compensation expense of $35 million; capital expenditures of $240 million; and lastly, onetime cost of $100 million, which are mostly cash related. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our overall performance in 2016 as it marked a memorable year in our company history. It is with this momentum and excitement that we look forward to executing our plans for 2017 as we remain focused on delivering continued growth.

So I'm just trying to get a sense of what leads to the call it that 8% at the midpoint type of growth range. Is it just conservatism? Is it coffee outperformed pretty dramatically this year and therefore, we just need to tail that back a little bit expectations for '17? Or things that I haven't mentioned?

Obviously, with sponsorship of the Olympics and reestablishing some of the marketing spend from this year. So that is the biggest driver. I think, in terms of the coffee, I would put that more in the category of where we might land in the range. Obviously, we have strong year. We will continue. We feel good about that, but that's probably a factor that comes to play a little bit as well. And then the other one probably to a lesser degree is just the FX impacts. As I mentioned, we're having about a $20 million headwind, and we hope to cover at least half of that, but there's a little bit of that affecting as well."

I wanted to ask a follow-up on Andrew's question on the guidance. So Mark, a different way to look at this would be to say that, that $100 million of synergies, I think, that number alone gets you something like $0.57 a share in incremental EPS benefit in 2017, and that gets you to kind of the top end of the range. So maybe -- could you try to answer just slightly differently and just saying that if synergies kind of gets you just to the top end of the range, doesn't it suggest that the rest of the operations are really on balance flattish? I know there's a share count benefit, there's a milk -- there's milk dilution that goes on in there, but it still just seems like the underlying expectation of the core ex the synergies is basically flat?"

We are up. So we feel very comfortable to be able to invest this marketing dollar back in the business. So there's a little bit of a discussion here on whether or not the business is flat from a performance perspective or it's flat because we've invested in the market, we would choose the latter saying that the market increase is offsetting some of that to some degree. The other thing is, I think, Mark suggested in his expected comments is that we're also investing in innovation and growth and also in China  So obviously, those dollars are embedded in the business portion of it when you just separate between synergy and non-synergy. So you could draw the conclusion coming from the business, but those are the 2 or 3 factors: Marketing, innovation and investment in China and a little bit of FX as I mentioned, that are really kind of bringing that number back down."

If you talk about the number, we did get 1 year or 2 ahead of what we guided. And we got there on two things, really. And the most obvious one is this, the launch of Dunkin' K-Cups, and we all know that was one of the best launches in consumer products in the last 5 [indiscernible]. So that was a wonderful performance. But really, more importantly, financially, if you look at the performance of our core Red Can business, and that's an effort that started 2 years ago. I mean, in the year that we struggled in our Coffee business, Mark and his team went back and did the downsize, started those processes. And then we had an opportunity in this last year to get coffee pricing right to have both the manufacturing and the hedging strategy to get this thing -- to get it to price points that both excited the retailer and the consumer. And the retailers are key piece of this. If you got it, get that merchandising to the floor. So we're really pleased with where we are there. I think, you saw -- I'm sure you saw that there are press release and pricing that we just took. So with all of that behind us, we feel pretty comfortable that we can repeat that performance. And to your comment earlier, that would be repeating a record performance. We actually beat the 2014 numbers here, right? So on our Red Can and our core business and our Dunkin' business, we feel -- or our Dunkin' K-Cup business, we feel really good. So a loss in that though year was -- this segments that didn't perform as elected to and that is and our premium and our legacy K-Cup, our Folgers K-Cup business. So what we intend to do this year is do the same things to those, and so the pricing, we leaned in the early on the Dunkin' bag business. You saw some of the performance in the fourth quarter, we feel great about that going into this quarter. So we need to floor ourselves back on premium good momentum. We will invest to do that, and we need to make sure as the K-Cup segment shakes out, and it will shake out, I mean there's so many items, there's so much going on there that the velocity is on our core legacy items are strong, and we invested right at the end of the quarter in that as well. So I guess, what I'm saying, we feel comfortable we can repeat the record results in Red Can, the Dunkin' K-Cup business will be very solid this year. And then with what we have extra on there, we're going to invest in those other 2 segments. So I would hope we come out of the Coffee business firing on all cylinders versus firing just on those 2 big ones [indiscernible]."

And then maybe Mark can help me as we look at the seasonality of profits. If you go back to the fourth quarter of 2014 with coffee prices hit like 2 20 of [indiscernible], Arabica. And then we saw it came down basically $1 a pound over the time. It's bumped up in the last day or so, but if you think about that, the fastest most efficient way to get that pricing to the consumer was with trade, okay? We can, in fact, shelf price on a promoted period on the trade. So in the short term, that's very efficient. In the long term, it's very inefficient because it promotes all kinds of buying low all inefficiency in the system, right? So over the last year, we've taken a couple of list price declines to mitigate that, to make the promotional aisle deck last. So we leaned in to current coffee pricing on our promotional price points and now, this has allowed us to sort of drain that out, get better list price to promoted price ratio so that our every day price gets better, and we maintained our firm prices. So we try to make that clear in the release that we did to give a little more clarity on that this time. So that the cost has been reflected in total coffee pricing. This is -- this makes over the long term in a more efficient manner."

I'll start and then [indiscernible] can also chime in. So a couple of things. So as you know, as you think about our performance, historically, has been very good, and we have had historically, a very strong cost discipline in multiple areas of our business. Part of what we've embarked on, which really was the catalyst was the Big Heart acquisition was to think a little bit deeper about our overall cost-savings initiatives and how we might do a little bit better. You are right that our productivity measures versus our peers are probably better in many cases, and we are generally leaner, I would say, than some of our peers. But having said that, we have an obligation, obviously, to our shareholders to make sure that we have the best cost discipline that we can have. And so what we've been doing, and this is part of the explanation of the $50 million is on an ongoing basis making sure from a continuous improvement that we have the discipline in our supply chain, our operations, our purchasing and longer term as we think about how do we get more efficient in trade, all of those things should help drive what I would call some incremental savings to the bottom line. So it isn't -- we don't think about it as a onetime benefit, but we are comfortable that we can at least deliver that and then beyond these next couple of years, we should be able to continue to deliver annual cost-savings objectives, which we hold our teams to. The good news about that is, as  Richard mentioned, it is allowing us to invest and enhance capability and in a very high level, what those capabilities are focused on is getting better at engaging with our consumer and getting better in engaging with our retail customers. And so strategically, having the right balance between our leading #1 brand, which are really the engine that fuel our growth as well as having the right emerging brands and our portfolio is part of that strategy. And so making sure that we have dollars that can fund those enhanced capabilities, both in consumer engagement and customer engagement is really going to help drive our growth, both top and bottom line long term."

Having said that, I would argue that the premium segment was maybe the most competitive we've ever seen it last year. And so the Dunkin' bag business, as you know, we're in [indiscernible] year in a couple of tough quarters, and we've talked about how we lean into that in the fourth quarter. Premium green and other for a whole another green coffee is not all the same. There's a coffee that goes in the last premium, coffee, there's a much longer supply chain. You might expect lower coffee cost impact us up for different timing based on the type of green that it is. So in the fourth quarter that we were in a position to support that we did, and it had responded. So if you think about it, the core Red Can pricing had moderated, our competitive set moderated, the premium business probably in that space now and the last piece will be K-Cups and we're going into lean into K-Cups. The proliferation of K-Cups has caused that whole segment to be competing for a slower-growth base. And one of the levers that's been using is price. We're able not to compete in that area, but that's the last piece of the puzzle, and we feel good about the plan we put in front of you today, will give us the dollars to support that and return that business to growth."

So I'm wondering here, if Starbucks can do that with job, why can't Smucker's? So if you could just comment on that. I'm just surprised that they were able to negotiate terms now that there was a change in ownership there and apparently, you haven't. Related to that, I understand the idea of sharpening price points for Folgers and K-Cups. The category has been sticky, of course, while brown moves quite a bit. But as you do that, are you expecting competitors to also cut prices in their K-Cup brands and then K-Cups, as a category, will be down, not sticky, but pass it was as ground. So I see a bit of a risk there. If you can comment on that, please."

So the fact that maybe with the best public some of that stuff, I wouldn't assume that the same things are going on. So there's different companies manage things differently, right? So that process is in process, and we feel good about that relationship. They are committed to have the major brands in the category, in their systems, and we read the same thing you read, so our our assumptions going into those negotiations, our assumptions are similar. So we feel fine there. And with regards to K-Cups, if you dig a little deeper into the IRI and the Nielsen data, you'll  see the K-Cups, although we don't pass through green because green is kind of a small portion of the overall cost structure, it become may be the most promoted category in total cost. So there's the highest reliant each one of those things relies very heavily on promotion. So maybe I'm not clear enough when I talk about leaning in. We've leaned in on promotional price points mostly, and so promotional point are basically down $1 a box what they used to be. It's still a very profitable business, but that migration has already -- that train has already left. So we are where we are.

Not really. I don't think we can really give you more color other to say that as we -- this was a huge year and not only did we make the largest acquisition in our history, but that acquisition was, again, the catalyst to sort of think about things like, are we going to market in the most efficient way, do we have the right capabilities to engage our consumer and our customer? We recently opened our innovation center, which is very much all about our customer retail partners. And so the long and short of it is, as we look at our organization, we took some opportunity across not only our commercial functions, which would be sales and marketing and thinking about how we would organize those differently, but we looked across of her supply chain network, our finance organization, some of our administrative functions as well just to make sure that we were running them in the most efficient way. I would say that one of the key things is that as I mentioned in the script, we have an individual from Big Heart who is leading our growth and innovation organization, and so we're putting sort of a renewed focus on not that we haven't, we've done a good job on innovation, but making sure that our muscle, where we're building muscle is really around innovation longer term and making sure that our understanding of the consumer is sharp and that we can act against insights that we are learning about the consumer as we go forward. So I think that's it."

We feel very comfortable with the $1 billion of free cash flow that we'll be able to continue that debt pay down of planned obviously, continue our dividend payout policies and it allows us a little bit of flexibility as strategic options come in. So whether that's M&A. Again, I don't think we're looking at a huge transformational like a path, at least from a leverage perspective, but certainly, there's M&A opportunity as well as buyback. And I think, buybacks are situational. So we traditionally, do not build that into our plan.

So that as I said on an earlier question, we don't factor that into our plans.

Certainly, when we do it in the year, we'll have less of an impact to do further end of the year, but that's the beauty of being the leverage where we wanted to be, the flexibility."

During this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current expectations about future plans and performance. These statements rely on a number of assumptions and estimates, and actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. I encourage you to read the full disclosure statement in this morning's press release concerning forward-looking statements. 
Additionally, please note the company uses non-GAAP results for the purpose of evaluating performance internally as detailed in the press release, which is located on our corporate website at jmsmucker.com. 
As we indicated earlier in the calendar year, we are transitioning to one non-GAAP earnings per share metric in 2017, which excludes noncash intangible amortization. We will refer to this as adjusted EPS.  Amortization expense will also be removed from our definition of segment profit as well as non-GAAP operating income and net income. We will file Form 8-K later this quarter to recast prior year's segment results to reflect the new definition. We have posted to our website a couple of supplementary slides, including a bridge from our fiscal 2016 results to our fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS guidance. These slides can be accessed through the link to the website of this call. This document and a replay of this call will be archived on our website.

Fiscal 2016 was a dynamic and exciting year for the Smucker company as our teams delivered on a number of key strategic initiatives. These included significantly improving the performance of our coffee business, reflecting the launch of the Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups, and returning momentum to our mainstream coffee business; expanding distribution for our Natural Balance pet brand; executing a seamless integration of the Pet Food business; exceeding our synergy and working capital targets for the year; divesting our U.S. canned milk business, all resulting in record financial performance and earnings and cash flow that exceeded our expectation. 
Let me expand on the results for the year. Net sales increased 37% to $7.8 billion, reflecting the full year contribution of Big Heart pet brand. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, sales increased 3% for the full year. 
Non-GAAP operating income was up 49% to $1.28 billion with the contributions from Pet and strong coffee segment profit growth being the key drivers.  Non-GAAP earnings per share were $6.57, including a onetime $0.46 per -- $0.42 per share noncash benefit. This compares to our most recent guidance of $5.84 to $5.94, which excluded the tax benefit. 
Lastly, the company generated free cash flow of $1.26 billion, which is well above our  original estimate. Reflecting the strong cash flow, we exceeded our deleveraging objective for the year, reducing total debt by nearly $750 million. We also returned over $750 million of cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. 
There are numerous accomplishments during the past fiscal year and this performance is a testament to the dedication of our employees, and we thank them for their continued effort. We are well positioned to continue this momentum into fiscal 2017. Since the last time we spoke to many of you, we announced several executive appointments that are consistent with the company's history of long-term succession planning and the development of leadership to meet the current and future needs of our business and the constituents that we serve. 
Effective May 1, Mark Smucker assumed the role of President and Chief Executive Officer. Mark and his experienced leadership team embody the values that have contributed to the company's success and long-term growth. I am confident that under their direction, the company will continue to innovate, evolve and grow in the years to come. 
It's been an honor to serve as CEO of the Smucker company, and I am grateful to have worked alongside the most talented team in the industry. I will continue to serve the company as Executive Chairman. Among other areas, my efforts will be focused on board-related matters, counsel and advice on strategic decisions, enhancing customer relationships and advancing our industry leadership efforts. 
My brother, Tim, has been appointed to the role of Chairman emeritus, and we also look forward to his continued contribution. 
Lastly, I would like to recognize Vince Byrd, who is participating in his final earnings call as his retirement after 39 years with the company is effective tomorrow. Vince's contributions have helped shape the company that we are today and will continue to be reflected in the numerous employees that he has mentored throughout his career. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark."

I am honored to succeed Richard as CEO and serve as the [indiscernible]. Richard has led our company through a period of significant expansion and strategic transformation. As a result, our company is stronger than ever. I am excited to lead our talented team, leveraging the continued counsel of Richard, dad and our outstanding board to drive continued growth and shareholder value. I also would like to echo Richard's comment about Vince and thank him for his contribution and mentorship. 
The focus of my comment today will be to provide an update on our business segments, including additional color on full year 2016 performance and initial thoughts on fiscal 2017. 
I'll start with our coffee business, which far exceeded expectations for the year. Net sales were up 8% and segment profit increased 18% to $646 million, representing a full recovery of the segment profit decline in the prior year. This outperformance was driven by several factors, including the successful launch of Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups, the implementation of the planned Folgers canister downsize, a moderation in competitive activities and the net benefit of lower commodity cost and pricing. 
Providing lower pricing on Folgers roast and ground coffee resulted in improved performance for our mainstream coffee business in 2016. Tonnage for our mainstream brands was up 3%, while units shipped were up even more given the canister downsize early in the fiscal year. In addition, our dollar share within the mainstream segment of the coffee category increased nearly 2 share points to 55% for the latest 52-week period. 
We anticipate momentum in the coffee business to continue in 2017. Key initiatives include Folgers sponsorship of the U.S. Olympic team for the upcoming Rio games with marketing activities already underway. In addition, last month, we implemented a 6% list price decline across much of our coffee portfolio, reflecting sustained lower grain coffee costs. These lower costs have been reflected in promotional pricing for the past several quarters, and we do not anticipate promoted prices changing significantly. 
With regards to Folgers K-Cups, in 2016, the brand was impacted by the ongoing proliferation of entrants in the K-Cups space, including our introduction of Dunkin' K-Cups. This year, we will invest in the product line to improve trends, including lower pricing and new packaging that will leverage the iconic Folgers Red Can brand equity. 
Turning to the Dunkin' Donuts brand. Dunkin' K-Cups achieved nearly $220 million in retail sales for the latest 52-week scan period and gained a 6% dollar share of the K-Cup market, giving us an overall share of nearly 15% in the K-Cup segment. In its first year on the market, the Dunkin' Donuts original SKU has become the #1 K-Cup item in the channels in which we participate. As consumer repeat rates remain strong and with opportunities to introduce additional variety, we anticipate further growth in 2017. 
While challenged for much of 2016, performance improved for Dunkin' Donuts Ag coffee during the fourth quarter. Supported by favorable input costs, we have sharpened pricing to improve gaps to key competitors, and we look for positive volume trends to continue. 
Lastly, within coffee, the Café Bustelo brand experienced a second consecutive year of double-digit sales growth behind strong performance for both roast and ground and K-Cup offerings. This exciting on-trend brand remains well received by millennials, and its growth is expected to continue also in 2017. 
Turning to Consumer Foods. Net sales declined 3% for the year, mostly due to lapping sales from the divested canned milk business. Segment profit was flat to prior year, supported by the gain on the milk business sale, which offset planned increases in manufacturing overhead costs. 
Looking briefly at the key brands, we are pleased with the overall performance of our spreads business as both Jif Peanut Butter and Smucker's Fruit Spread grew volume share over the latest 52-week period. In addition, Smucker's Uncrustables Frozen Sandwiches had another strong year with volume up 26%, including a 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit volume growth in this most recent fourth quarter. 
On-trend innovation continues to be a focus area for the iconic Jif and Smucker's brand. In fiscal 2017, we look to build on recent successful launches such as Smucker's Fruit & Honey Fruit Spreads and Jif Snack Bars. This includes the upcoming introduction of new snack bar varieties and plans to expand into other snacking platforms. In addition, Jif, Smucker's and Uncrustables are all participating in the 2016 Olympics sponsorship, which will be an integral part of this year's marketing efforts for the brand. 
In the bake aisle, the overall category remains challenged throughout much of this past year, reflecting changing consumer preferences and aggressive competitive pricing. Our focus remains on providing value-added innovation such as our recent gluten-free and simple ingredient offerings. 
We are also excited to announce a licensing arrangement with the Girl Scouts of America. Under this agreement, we are launching new Pillsbury items featuring iconic Girl Scouts cookie flavors. 
Within Natural Foods, our leading R.W. Knudsen Family and Santa Cruz Organic brands both achieved solid sales growth in 2016. The key Natural Foods categories in which our brands participate are growing, which gives us confidence in maintaining our momentum in this business. We are also excited about our recent investment in the Numi brand and the opportunities this provides in the organic tea category. 
Under our first year of ownership, Pet Foods segment profit of $392 million was generally in line with expectations. Net sales of $2.25 billion fell 1% short of the projections provided at our October Investor Day due to competitive challenges in mainstream dry dog food. For the year, mainstream Pet Food sales decreased mid-single digit, reflecting double-digit declines in dog food and a low single-digit decline for the larger cat food business. Offsetting the lower mainstream sales was the strong performance of our pet snacks business, which was up mid-single digits over the prior year; and our premium pet food brands, which grew double digits behind expanded distribution of the Natural Balance brand. 
As we enter 2017, we anticipate continued growth for Natural Balance as we launch the brand's first national marketing campaign, along with additional in-store support. Within pet snacks, innovation for the Milk-Bone and Meow Mix brands were key contributors to 2016 results, and we expect to see on these -- to build on these trends with new product introduction this fiscal year. We also continue to focus on opportunities in mainstream pet food, driven by consumer preference for additional protein and natural ingredients. 
Lastly, within the segment, we are excited about our partnership and planned in-store activities related to the animated film, The Secret life of Pets, which will be in theaters next month. 
Turning to International and Foodservice. We are pleased with the full year results despite the significant top and bottom line impacts of foreign currency. Reported net sales were in line with the prior year as the addition of the Pet Food business and the benefit of higher net pricing in Canada offset a $60 million top line impact related to foreign exchange. Segment profit was up 12%, mostly attributable to Foodservice. The introduction of Smucker's Uncrustables into school lunch program contributed to this growth. The strong underlying performance of our Canadian business was mostly offset by the impact of foreign exchange. 
Let me conclude with an update on our integration and cost-savings activities. We successfully achieved our March 1 integration milestone for the Pet Food business and recognized just over $35 million in synergies for 2016. In addition, we have clear visibility and confidence in realizing an incremental $100 million in synergies this fiscal year. In total, this would provide approximately $135 million in synergies for 2017. 
Looking ahead, we remain confident in achieving our original goal of $200 million in annual synergies by the end of fiscal 2018. In addition to the $200 million of synergies, we are targeting $50 million of incremental annual cost savings to be fully realized over the next few years. Related projects include further optimizing our manufacturing footprint as over the next 18 months, we will close a coffee facility in Harahan, Louisiana and 2 leased Natural Foods facilities located in Livermore, California, with production being consolidated into existing operation. In addition, we are nearly complete with an organizational redesign aimed at further optimizing corporate resources contributing to this cost savings target. 
We expect to initially invest much of these incremental savings in several identified areas. We will continue to prioritize investments that generate top and bottom line growth for key on-trend platform. In fiscal 2017, these include opportunities related to Smucker's Uncrustables, Coffee and Snack. 
We are also establishing a new growth and innovation organization, which is being led by a member of my leadership team. The group is being tasked with further building capabilities related to consumer and market insight; digital; innovation; targeted market development strategies for our customers, including pricing and trade spend optimization. 
Lastly, we plan to invest in new growth opportunities to expand our presence in China. 
In closing, 2016 was a historic year for our company, and I would like to thank our employees for their efforts. As we enter 2017, key priorities include achieving our synergy goal, building on our product innovation activities and investing in new capabilities to enhance future growth. 
Overall, we remain confident in our long-term strategy, the strength of our brands and our ability to deliver shareholder value in 2017 and beyond. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark Belgya."
303591,330362551,998467,"The J. M. Smucker Company, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 09, 2016",2016-06-09,"Earnings Calls","The J. M. Smucker Company","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I will begin by providing commentary on our fourth quarter results, followed by 2016 cash flow performance and ending with our 2017 outlook. We concluded the fiscal year with strong fourth quarter earnings. N",1564,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I will begin by providing commentary on our fourth quarter results, followed by 2016 cash flow performance and ending with our 2017 outlook. 
We concluded the fiscal year with strong fourth quarter earnings. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.86 for the quarter, including a onetime $0.42 per share noncash deferred tax benefit related to the integration of Big Heart into the Smucker company as was previewed during our third quarter call. This strong finish to the year was mostly attributable to coffee, including higher than anticipated volume across our mainstream and premium coffee brand, and a favorable price cost relationship. 
The comparison of fourth quarter earnings between years is significantly impacted by onetime items reported in each of the respective period. These include the deferred tax benefit in the current year as well as the Big Heart acquisition financing-related activities in the prior year. As a result, the remainder of my fourth quarter commentary will be focused on the business segment. 
Beginning with coffee. Fourth quarter net sales grew 9% as favorable volume/mix of 13% was only partially offset by lower net pricing. Sales for the Dunkin' Donuts brand doubled over the prior year with K-Cups driving much of this growth. Double-digit gains for bag Dunkin' Donuts coffee also contributed. 
For the Folgers brand, net sales declined 5% attributable to lower net price realization. And lastly, Café Bustelo sales were up 28% as the momentum for this brand continues. 
Segment profit increased $43 million or 39%. We recognized lower grain coffee costs in the quarter, which were partially offset by lower net pricing. In addition, higher volume/mix more than offset increased marketing. 
Turning to Consumer Foods. Net sales were up 5%, excluding the impact of the canned milk divestiture with gains across the majority of our key brand. Sales for Jif grew 14% behind higher volume and net pricing, while the Smucker's brand was up 3% as Uncrustables had another strong quarter. 
In the bake aisle, sales for Crisco increased 6%, driven by higher volume. And lastly, sales for the Pillsbury brand were up modestly as higher price realization offset volume decline. 
Segment profit declined 6% mostly attributable to lapping the prior year earnings of the divested milk business. Planned increases in manufacturing overhead costs also contributed, reflecting the new peanut butter facility in Memphis as well as underabsorbed overhead cost related to our working capital initiatives.  These factors offset lower marketing expense. 
Net sales for U.S. Retail Pet Food segments was $563 million. We estimate this represents an approximate 3% increase compared to the prior year fourth quarter of which 6 weeks were reported under our ownership. 
Sales from our premium pet brands will improve low double digits driven by Natural Balance, while pet snacks sales increased in line with the overall segment. Mainstream pet food sales were flat compared to the prior year as growth in our cat food brand offset declines in dog food. 
Pet Food segment profit was $170 million for the quarter. As expected, we realized the sequential increase in segment profit margin from 17% in the third quarter to 20.7% this quarter, primarily reflecting lower marketing expense. Incremental synergy recognition also contributed. 
Net sales for International and Foodservice increased 1% in the quarter, reflecting higher volume/mix in Foodservice. In Canada, the addition of pet food was potentially offset by the impact of FX. Segment profit was up 8% over the prior year, driven by our Foodservice business, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange in Canada. 
Free cash flow was $295 million for the quarter, bringing the 2016 total to $1.26 billion. The outperformance compared to our most recent free cash flow guidance of $975 million was attributable to exceeding our 2016 working capital improvement target, lower than projected CapEx spending, a fourth quarter tax refund of $53 million, which is separate from the deferred tax adjustment impacting earning and higher net income. 
Expanding on our working capital initiatives. In 2016, we realized the majority of our finished goods inventory reduction goal of $200 million nearly a year ahead of schedule. In 2017, we expect to achieve the remainder of the inventory reduction target, along with modest working capital improvements related to accounts payable and receivables, all of which are factored into our 2017 free cash flow outlook I will discuss in a moment. 
We ended the year with debt of $5.4 billion. Based on 2016 EBITDA of $1.58 billion, our leverage stood at 3.4x at April 30, a reduction from 4.1x at the beginning of the year. In addition to exceeding our debt pay down target for the year, we were able to restart share repurchase activities, aided by the strong free cash flow and proceeds from the divestiture of the milk business. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased nearly 3% of shares outstanding for approximately $430 million. In 2017, the lower shares count will offset the EPS impact of the 8 months in loss profit related to the divested milk business. 
Turning to our 2017 outlook, we anticipate reported net sales to decrease by 1% compared to the prior year as we will lap approximately $150 million in sales related to the milk divestiture.  Excluding this impact, net sales are projected to be up 1%. Favorable volume/mix across each of the segments, including the benefit of new products, is expected to be mostly offset by lower pricing in U.S. Retail Coffee and FX in Canada. 
Approximately $25 million of the incremental $100 million of synergies for 2017 are expected to benefit gross profit. Overall commodity costs are anticipated to be lower. However, our Canadian business is estimating a COGS headwind of $20 million related to FX of which, of course, is expected to be offset.  As a result, we expect gross margins to approximate 39% in 2017. 
Further, SD&A expenses are projected to be comparable with the prior year. This reflects the benefit of incremental synergies related to headcount reductions and other administrative cost savings, offset by increased marketing in support of recently launched product, our Olympic sponsorship, innovation and regulatory expenses. 
We're projecting non-GAAP operating income growth of 4% in 2017 compared to $1.465 billion in the prior year, which excludes amortization and the prior year gain on sales of $25 million. Further, excluding the $32 million of profit in last year's operating related to the divested milk business, the growth would be 6%. 
Below operating income, we expect net interest expense of approximately $165 million and a tax rate of 34%. And lastly, a weighted average share count of 116.6 million shares was used based on current shares outstanding. 
Factoring in all of these, we are guiding 2017 adjusted EPS in the range of $7.60 to $7.75, which excludes $1.18 per share of estimated noncash amortization. 
Including the amortization, this yield a range of $6.42 to $6.57 compared to a 2016 base of $6. This results in year-over-year increases, ranging from 7% to 10%. 
As illustrated on the document posted on our website, we derived the $6 EPS for 2016 by subtracting the $0.42 deferred tax adjustment and the $0.15 milk gain from our reported non-GAAP EPS of $6.57. We anticipate much of the EPS growth for the year to be weighted towards the middle 2 quarters of the fiscal year due to certain factors. Last year's first quarter included the launch of Dunkin' K-Cups. Also within coffee, this year's first quarter will be unfavorably impacted due to timing associated with the full quarter impact of the price decrease taken in July of 2015, along with the additional price decline taken in May of this year as compared to the recognition of lower costs. Other factors impacting quarterly comparison include the timing of synergy recognition; the timing impact related to trade spend recognition on a quarterly basis; and finally, the fourth quarter comparison to this year's strong fourth quarter finish. 
Looking briefly at the segment. Coffee profits are projected to be comparable to the record fiscal 2015 level. For Consumer Foods, reported segment profit is expected to be down given the prior year gain on the milk divestiture and the lost milk profit, but up mid-single digits when these items are excluded. 
Pet Food segment profit is also projected to be up mid-single digits, reflecting the incremental synergies and organic growth, including the contributions of new product. 
And lastly, International and Foodservice is anticipated to be down, primarily reflecting the net impact of FX in Canada. 
We project free cash flow will approximate $1 billion, from which we plan to pay down debt and further reduce leverage to 3.1x by the end of this fiscal year. This assumes projected 2017 EBITDA of $1.63 billion. 
Additional assumptions related to 2017 include amortization expense of nearly $210 million; depreciation of $215 million; share-based compensation expense of $35 million; capital expenditures of $240 million; and lastly, onetime cost of $100 million, which are mostly cash related. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our overall performance in 2016 as it marked a memorable year in our company's history. It is with this momentum and excitement that we look forward to executing our plans for 2017 as we remain focused on delivering continued growth.

So I'm just trying to get a sense of what leads to the, call it that 8% at the midpoint type of growth range. Is it just conservatism? Is it coffee outperformed pretty dramatically this year and therefore, we need to just tailor that back a little bit, in our expectations for '17? Or things that I haven't mentioned?

What I would say, as Mark and I think we reiterated, we will deliver the $100 million in synergies. We have a clear line of sight on that. Where we'll land in sort of that 8% is we are having a significant increase in marketing spend for the coming year. Obviously, with sponsorship of the Olympics and reestablishing some of the marketing spend from this year. So that is the biggest driver. I think, in terms of the coffee, I would put that more in the category of where we might land in the range. Obviously, we have strong year, and we need things to continue. We feel good about that, but that's probably a factor that comes into play a little bit as well. And then the other one, probably to a lesser degree, is just the FX impacts. As I mentioned, we're having about a $20 million headwind, and we hope to cover at least half of that, but there's a little bit of that affecting as well."

I wanted to ask a follow-up on Andrew's question on the guidance. So Mark, a different way to look at this would be to say that, that $100 million of synergies, I think, that number alone gets you something like $0.57 a share in incremental EPS benefit in 2017, and that gets you to kind of the top end of the range. So maybe -- could you try to answer just slightly differently and just say that if synergies kind of gets you just to the top end of the range, doesn't it suggest that the rest of the operations are really on balance flattish? I know there's a share count benefit, there's a milk -- there's milk dilution that goes on in there, but it still just seems like the underlying expectation of the core ex the synergies is basically flat."

We are up. So we feel very comfortable to be able to invest this marketing dollar back in the business. So there's a little bit of a discussion here on whether or not the business is flat from a performance perspective or it's flat because we've invested in the marketing. We would choose the latter saying that the market increase is offsetting some of that to some degree. The other thing is, I think, Mark suggested in his scripted comments is that we're also investing in innovation and growth and also in China. So obviously, those dollars are embedded in the business portion of it when you just separate it between synergy and nonsynergy. So you can draw the conclusion that's coming from the business, but those are the 2 or 3 factors: Marketing, innovation and investment in China, and a little bit of FX as I mentioned, that are really kind of bringing that number back down."

I'm not complaining, by the way.

If you think about the numbers, we did get there a year or 2 ahead of what we guided. And we got there on 2 things, really. And the most obvious one is this, the launch of Dunkin' K-Cups, and we all know that was one of the best launches in consumer products in the last 5 [indiscernible]. So that was a wonderful performance. But really, more importantly, financially, if you look at the performance of our core Red Can business, and that's an effort that started 2 years ago. I mean, in the year that we struggled in our coffee business, Mark and his team went back and did the downsize and started those processes. And then, we had an opportunity in this last year to get coffee pricing right, to have both the manufacturing and the hedging strategy to get this thing -- to get it to price points that both excited the retailer and the consumer. And the retailers are key piece of this. You got to get that merchandising support. So we're really pleased with where we are there. I think, you saw -- I'm sure you saw there are press release on pricing that we just took. So with all of that behind us, we feel pretty comfortable that we can repeat that performance. And to your comment earlier, that will be repeating a record performance. We actually beat the 2014 number this year, right? So on our Red Can and our core business and our Dunkin' business, we feel -- or our Dunkin' K-Cup business, we feel really good. So a loss in that though year was these segments that didn't perform as well as we want it to. And that's our business in premium and our legacy -- our Folgers K-Cup business. So what we intend to do this year is do the same things to those. And so the pricing, we leaned in early on, on the Dunkin' bag business. You saw some of that performance in the fourth quarter. We feel great about that going into this quarter. So we need to put ourselves back on premium growth momentum. We will invest to do that, and we need to make sure as the K-Cup segment shakes out, and it will shake out, I mean there's so many new items, there's so much going on there, that the velocities on our core legacy items are strong, and we invested right at the end of the quarter in that as well. So I guess, what I'm saying, we feel comfortable we can repeat the record results in Red Can, the Dunkin' K-Cup business will be very solid this year. And then, with what we have extra on there, we're going to invest in those other 2 segments. So I would hope we come out of the coffee business firing on all cylinders versus firing just on those 2 big ones."

Then we saw, it come down basically $1 a pound over that time. It's bumped up in the last day or so a little bit. But if you think about that, the fastest most efficient way to get that pricing to the consumer was with trade. Okay. We can, in fact, shelf price on a promoted period immediately with trade. So in the short term, that's very efficient. In the long term, it's very inefficient because it promotes all kinds of buying -- loading all this inefficiency in the system, right? So over the last year, we've taken a couple of list price declines to mitigate that, to make the promotional allowance less. So we leaned in to current coffee pricing on our promotional price points. And now, this has allowed us to sort of drain that out, get a better list price to promoted price ratio, so that our everyday prices get better, and we maintain the current prices. So we try to make that clear in the release that we did and give a little more clarity on that this time, so that the costs have been reflected in total coffee pricing. This is -- this makes -- it does what I think over the long term in a more efficient manner."

So a couple of things, as you know, as you think about our performance historically, it's been very good. And we have had historically, a very strong cost discipline in multiple areas of our business. Part of what we've embarked on, which really was -- the catalyst was the Big Heart acquisition, was to think a little bit deeper about our overall cost-savings initiatives and how we might -- maybe do a little bit better. You are right that our productivity measures versus our peers are probably better in many cases. And we are generally leaner, I would say, than some of our peers. But having said that, we have an obligation, obviously, to our shareholders to make sure that we have the best cost discipline that we can have. And so what we've been doing, and this is part of the explanation of the $50 million is on an ongoing basis making sure from a continuous improvement that we have the discipline in our supply chain, our operations, our purchasing and longer term as we think about how do we get more efficient in trade. All of those things should help drive, what I would call, some incremental savings to the bottom line. So it isn't -- we don't think about it as a onetime benefit. But we are comfortable that we can, at least, deliver that and then beyond these next couple of years, we should be able to continue to deliver annual cost-savings objectives, which we hold our teams to. The good news about that is it is, as Richard mentioned, it is allowing us to invest and enhance capability and in a very high level, what those capabilities are focused on is getting better at engaging with our consumer and getting better in engaging with our retail customers. And so strategically, having the right balance between our leading #1 brand, which are really the engine that fuel our growth as well as having the right emerging brands in our portfolio is part of that strategy. And so making sure that we have dollars that can fund those enhanced capabilities, both in consumer engagement and customer engagement is really going to help drive our growth, both top and bottom line long term."

I think it's difficult to think that coffee category was one brush competitively. I think, the prepared remarks probably we're focused more on our mainstream Red Can business, right? And I do think we've seen with Arabica falling, with the coffee prices falling where they are, we have found that price points have gotten down into those ranges where it motivates both the competitor and the consumer and the customer, right? So all of us are in price points that really work, okay? And so we're back in that zone, and I think everybody is operating in that zone. Now having said that, I would argue that the premium segment was maybe the most competitive we've ever seen it last year. And so the Dunkin' bag business, as you know, early in the year, had a couple of tough quarters. And we've talked about how we lean into that in the fourth quarter. Premium green and another remnant for a whole another discussion. But green coffee is not all the same. There's a coffee that goes into the last premium coffee. There's a much longer supply chain. You might expect lower -- coffee cost to impact as a different timing based on the type of green that it is. So in the fourth quarter that we were in a position to support that, we did. And it has responded. So if you think about it, the core Red Can pricing had moderated. Our competitive set had moderated. The premium business probably is in that space now. And the last piece will be K-Cups, and we're going into lean into K-Cups. The proliferation of K-Cups has caused that whole segment to be competing for a slower-growth base. And one of the levers that's been used in there is price. We're able now to compete in that area. But that's for the -- maybe the last piece of the puzzle. And we feel good about the plan we put in front of you today, will give us the dollars to support that and return that business to growth."

And so this year, we're going to relaunch that with a little better packaging, a little better messaging. And we're going to -- it's a heavy capital investment because the technology is unique.

So I'm wondering here, if Starbucks can do that with JAB, why can't Smucker's? So if you could just comment on that. I'm just surprised that they were able to negotiate terms, now that there was a change in ownership there and apparently, you haven't. Related to that, I understand the idea of sharpening price points for Folgers and K-Cups. The category has been sticky, of course, while brown moves quite a bit. But as you do that, are we expecting other competitors to also cut prices in their K-Cup brands? And then K-Cups, as a category, will become, not sticky, but pass through as ground.

So those different companies manage those things differently, right? So that process is in process, and we feel good about their relationship. They are committed to have the major brands in the category in their systems. And we read the same things  you read, so our assumptions are going into those negotiations, our assumptions of similar years. So we feel fine there. And with regards to K-Cups, if you dig a little deeper into the IRI and the Nielsen data, you'll  see that K-Cups -- although we don't pass through green, because green's kind of a small portion of the overall cost structure, it's become may be the most promoted category in total cost. So there's the highest reliant -- each one of those brands relies very heavily on promotion. So maybe I'm not clear enough when I talk about leaning in. We've leaned in on our promotional price points mostly. And so those promotional points are basically down $1 a box from what they used to be. It still means -- it's still a very profitable business. But that migration has already -- that train's already left. So we are where we are. We might have been a little late to follow because of the momentum we had from the Dunkin' business."

So if you go back to the early part of the year, we expected quarter-over-quarter improvement on margin that we delivered on in Q2, 3 and 4. I think from a cost perspective going forward, the cost aligned, very similar to what we've seen our Consumer Foods. So the green continue to be favorable. I think as Barry mentioned, we are going to continue bonus bag and things like that, that might have a little bit of effect on gross profit. And then, of course, I think we said over time, of the 3 segments of the business, the Natural has the lowest profitability.

Do we have the right capabilities to engage our consumer and our customer? We recently opened our innovation center, which is very much all about our customer retail partners. And so the long and short of it is, as we looked at our organization, we took some opportunity across not only our commercial functions, which would be sales and marketing and thinking about how we would organize those differently. But we looked across our supply chain network, our finance organization, our -- some of our administrative functions as well, just to make sure that we were running them in the most efficient way. I would say that one of the key things is that -- as I mentioned in the script, we have an individual from Big Heart, who is leading our growth and innovation organization. And so we are putting sort of a renewed focus on -- not that we haven't, we've done a good job on innovation. But making sure that our muscle, where we're building muscle is really around innovation longer term and making sure that our understanding of the consumer is sharp and that we can act against insights that we are learning about the consumer as we go forward.

I mean I'll start and Richard, Mark, if you want to add more from a strategic perspective. But as we look at our deployment of cash coming out of the deal last year, we, obviously, emphasized the importance of paying down debt over the course of 3 to 5 years, which we've made great progress on, as I said earlier. It allowed us to get back into repurchasing shares. We feel very comfortable with the $1 billion of free cash flow that we'll be able to continue that debt pay down of planned obviously, continue our dividend payout policies. And it allows us a little bit of flexibility as strategic options come in. So whether that's M&A -- again, I don't think we're looking at a huge transformational like a pet, at least from a leverage perspective. But certainly, there's M&A opportunity as well as buyback. And I think, buybacks are situational. So we traditionally, do not build that into our plan.

Is the assumption here that there are other kind of below-the-line, like the tax rate to be a little bit better, or interest rates comes down a little bit or the interest expense comes down a little bit? And then lastly, if we look at the shares you bought back in Q4, really, in fiscal '16, I mean that's the most amount you've ever spent on a buyback outside of fiscal '14.

So that kind of leads to the 8%. In terms of buyback, what we've guided indirectly -- we have conversations, particularly with rating agencies. We kind of used a 2% as a long term model. So that's a 2% buyback. So obviously, 116 million shares [indiscernible] 2.2 share -- 2.2 million shares. So that, as I said on an earlier question, we don't factor that into our plans. I would say our cash deployment would allow a portion of that, maybe not the whole 2% without pushing the leverage target we're going after. But certainly and again, it's situational. So I don't want to sit here and say, we're going out and buy it. But if the opportunity were right, I believe we have the cash to do it, and then obviously, would be incremental. Certainly, when we do it in the year, we'll have less of an impact to do further end of the year. But that's the beauty of being the leverage where we want it to be. It's the flexibility."

Also joining us for the Q&A portion of the call are Steve Oakland, President, U.S. Food and Beverage; and Barry Dunaway, President, Pet Food and Pet Snacks. Vince Byrd, Vice Chairman, is also on the line from another location. 
During this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current expectations about future plans and performance. These statements rely on a number of assumptions and estimates, and actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. I encourage you to read the full disclosure statement in this morning's press release concerning forward-looking statements. 
Additionally, please note the company uses non-GAAP results for the purpose of evaluating performance internally as detailed in the press release, which is located on our corporate website at jmsmucker.com. 
As we indicated earlier in the calendar year, we are transitioning to one non-GAAP earnings per share metric in 2017, which excludes noncash intangible amortization. We will refer to this as adjusted EPS.  Amortization expense will also be removed from our definition of segment profit as well as non-GAAP operating income and net income. We will file Form 8-K later this quarter to recast prior year segment results to reflect the new definition. We have posted to our website a couple of supplementary slides, including a bridge from our fiscal 2016 results to our fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS guidance. These slides can be accessed through the link to the webcast of this call. This document and a replay of this call will be archived on our website.

Fiscal 2016 was a dynamic and exciting year for the Smucker company as our teams delivered on a number of key strategic initiatives. These included significantly improving the performance of our coffee business, reflecting the launch of the Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups, and returning momentum to our mainstream coffee business; expanding distribution for our Natural Balance pet brand; executing a seamless integration of the Pet Food business; exceeding our synergy and working capital targets for the year; divesting our U.S. canned milk business, all resulting in record financial performance and earnings and cash flow that exceeded our expectation. 
Let me expand on the results for the year. Net sales increased 37% to $7.8 billion, reflecting the full year contribution of Big Heart Pet Brands. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, sales increased 3% for the full year. 
Non-GAAP operating income was up 49% to $1.28 billion with the contributions from pet and strong coffee segment profit growth being the key drivers.  Non-GAAP earnings per share were $6.57, including a onetime $0.46 per -- $0.42 per share noncash benefit. This compares to our most recent guidance of $5.84 to $5.94, which excluded the tax benefit. 
Lastly, the company generated free cash flow of $1.26 billion, which is well above our original estimate. Reflecting this strong cash flow, we exceeded our deleveraging objective for the year, reducing total debt by nearly $750 million. We also returned over $750 million of cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. 
There are numerous accomplishments during the past fiscal year, and this performance is a testament to the dedication of our employees, and we thank them for their continued effort. We are well positioned to continue this momentum into fiscal 2017. Since the last time we spoke to many of you, we announced several executive appointments that are consistent with the company's history of long-term succession planning and the development of leadership to meet the current and future needs of our business and the constituents that we serve. 
Effective May 1, Mark Smucker assumed the role of President and Chief Executive Officer. Mark and his experienced leadership team embody the values that have contributed to the company's success and long-term growth. I am confident that under their direction, the company will continue to innovate, evolve and grow in the years to come. 
It's been an honor to serve as CEO of the Smucker company, and I'm grateful to have worked alongside the most talented team in the industry. I will continue to serve the company as Executive Chairman. Among other areas, my efforts will be focused on board-related matters, counsel and advice on strategic decisions, enhancing customer relationships, and advancing our industry leadership efforts. 
My brother, Tim, has been appointed to the role of Chairman Emeritus, and we also look forward to his continued contributions. 
Lastly, I would like to recognize Vince Byrd, who is participating in his final earnings call as his retirement after 39 years with the company is effective tomorrow. Vince's contributions have helped shape the company that we are today and will continue to be reflected in the numerous employees that he has mentored throughout his career. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark."

I am excited to lead our talented team, leveraging the continued counsel of Richard, Dad and our outstanding board to drive continued growth and shareholder value. I also would like to echo Richard's comment about Vince and thank him for his contribution and mentorship. 
The focus of my comments today will be to provide an update on our business segments, including additional color on full year 2016 performance and initial thoughts on fiscal 2017. 
I'll start with our coffee business, which far exceeded expectations for the year. Net sales were up 8% and segment profit increased 18% to $646 million, representing a full recovery of the segment profit decline in the prior year. This outperformance was driven by several factors, including the successful launch of Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups, the implementation of the planned Folgers canister downsize, a moderation in competitive activities and the net benefit of lower commodity cost and pricing. 
Providing lower pricing on Folgers roast and ground coffee resulted in improved performance for our mainstream coffee business in 2016. Tonnage for our mainstream brands was up 3%, while units shipped were up even more given the canister downsize early in the fiscal year. In addition, our dollar share within the mainstream segment of the coffee category increased nearly 2 share points to 55% for the latest 52-week period. 
We anticipate momentum in the coffee business to continue in 2017. Key initiatives include Folgers sponsorship of the U.S. Olympic team for the upcoming Rio games with marketing activities already underway. In addition, last month, we implemented a 6% list price decline across much of our coffee portfolio, reflecting sustained lower green coffee costs. These lower costs have been reflected in promotional pricing for the past several quarters, and we do not anticipate promoted prices changing significantly. 
With regards to Folgers K-Cups, in 2016, the brand was impacted by the ongoing proliferation of entrants in the K-Cups space, including our introduction of Dunkin' K-Cups. This year, we will invest further in the product line to improve trends, including lower pricing and new packaging that will leverage the iconic Folgers Red Can brand equity. 
Turning to the Dunkin' Donuts brand. Dunkin' K-Cups achieved nearly $220 million in retail sales for the latest 52-week scan period and gained a 6% dollar share of the K-Cup market, giving us an overall share of nearly 15% in the K-Cup segment. In its first year on the market, the Dunkin' Donuts original SKU has become the #1 K-Cup item in the channels in which we participate. As consumer repeat rates remain strong and with opportunities to introduce additional variety, we anticipate further growth in 2017. 
While challenged for much of 2016, performance improved for Dunkin' Donuts bagged coffee during the fourth quarter. Supported by favorable input costs, we have sharpened pricing to improve gaps to key competitors, and we look for positive volume trends to continue. 
Lastly, within coffee, the Café Bustelo brand experienced a second consecutive year of double-digit sales growth behind strong performance for both roast and ground and K-Cup offerings. This exciting on-trend brand remains well received by millennials, and its growth is expected to continue also in 2017. 
Turning to consumer foods. Net sales declined 3% for the year, mostly due to lapping sales from the divested canned milk business. Segment profit was flat to prior year, supported by the gain on the milk business sale, which offset planned increases in manufacturing overhead costs. 
Looking briefly at the key brands, we are pleased with the overall performance of our spreads business as both Jif Peanut Butter and Smucker's Fruit Spreads grew volume share over the latest 52-week period. In addition, Smucker's Uncrustables Frozen Sandwiches had another strong year with volume up 26%, including a 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit volume growth in this most recent fourth quarter. 
On-trend innovation continues to be a focus area for the iconic Jif and Smucker's brands. In fiscal 2017, we look to build on recent successful launches, such as Smucker's Fruit & Honey Fruit Spreads and Jif Snack Bars. This includes the upcoming introduction of new snack bar varieties and plans to expand into other snacking platforms. In addition, Jif, Smucker's and Uncrustables are all participating in the 2016 Olympics sponsorship, which will be an integral part of this year's marketing efforts for the brands. 
In the bake aisle, the overall category remains challenged throughout much of this past year, reflecting changing consumer preferences and aggressive competitive pricing. Our focus remains on providing value-added innovation, such as our recent gluten-free and simple ingredient offerings. 
We are also excited to announce a licensing arrangement with the Girl Scouts of America. Under this agreement, we are launching new Pillsbury items featuring iconic Girl Scouts cookie flavors. 
Within Natural Foods, our leading R.W. Knudsen Family and Santa Cruz Organic brands both achieved solid sales growth in 2016. The key Natural Foods categories in which our brands participate are growing, which gives us confidence in maintaining our momentum in this business. We are also excited about our recent investment in the Numi brand and the opportunities this provides in the organic tea category. 
Under our first year of ownership, Pet Foods segment profit of $392 million was generally in line with expectations. Net sales of $2.25 billion fell 1% short of the projections provided at our October Investor Day due to competitive challenges in mainstream dry dog food. For the year, mainstream Pet Food sales decreased mid-single digit, reflecting double-digit declines in dog food and a low single-digit decline for the larger cat food business. Offsetting the lower mainstream sales was the strong performance of our pet snacks business, which was up mid-single digits over the prior year, and our premium pet food brands, which grew double digits behind expanded distribution of the Natural Balance brand. 
As we enter 2017, we anticipate continued growth for Natural Balance as we launch the brand's first national marketing campaign, along with additional in-store support. Within pet snacks, innovation for the Milk-Bone and Meow Mix brands were key contributors to 2016 results, and we expect to see on these -- to build on these trends with new product introduction this fiscal year. We also continue to focus on opportunities in mainstream pet food, driven by consumer preference for additional protein and natural ingredients. 
Lastly, within the segment, we are excited about our partnership and planned in-store activities related to the animated film, The Secret Life of Pets, which will be in theaters next month. 
Turning to International and Foodservice. We are pleased with the full year results despite the significant top and bottom line impacts of foreign currency. Reported net sales were in line with the prior year as the addition of the Pet Food business and the benefit of higher net pricing in Canada offset a $60 million top line impact related to foreign exchange. Segment profit was up 12%, mostly attributable -- Foodservice. The introduction of Smucker's Uncrustables into school lunch programs contributed to this growth. The strong underlying performance of our Canadian business was mostly offset by the impact of foreign exchange. 
Let me conclude with an update on our integration and cost-savings activities. We successfully achieved our March 1 integration milestone for the Pet Food business and recognized just over $35 million in synergies for 2016. In addition, we have clear visibility and confidence in realizing an incremental $100 million in synergies this fiscal year. In total, this would provide approximately $135 million in synergies for 2017. 
Looking ahead, we remain confident in achieving our original goal of $200 million in annual synergies by the end of fiscal 2018. In addition to the $200 million of synergies, we are targeting $50 million of incremental annual cost savings to be fully realized over the next few years. Related projects include further optimizing our manufacturing footprint as, over the next 18 months, we will close a coffee facility in Harahan, Louisiana, and 2 leased Natural Foods facilities located in Livermore, California, with production being consolidated into existing operation. In addition, we are nearly complete with an organizational redesign aimed at further optimizing corporate resources contributing to this cost-savings target. 
We expect to initially invest much of these incremental savings in several identified areas. We will continue to prioritize investments that generate top and bottom line growth for key on-trend platforms. In fiscal 2017, these include opportunities related to Smucker's Uncrustables, coffee and snacks. 
We are also establishing a new growth and innovation organization, which is being led by a member of my leadership team. The group is being tasked with further building capabilities related to consumer and market insight; digital; innovation; targeted market development strategies for our customers, including pricing and trade spend optimization. Lastly, we plan to invest in new growth opportunities to expand our presence in China. 
In closing, 2016 was a historic year for our company, and I would like to thank our employees for their effort. As we enter 2017, key priorities include achieving our synergy goals, building on our product innovation activities and investing in new capabilities to enhance future growth. 
Overall, we remain confident in our long-term strategy, the strength of our brands and our ability to deliver shareholder value in 2017 and beyond. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark Belgya."

I will begin by providing commentary on our fourth quarter results, followed by 2016 cash flow performance and ending with our 2017 outlook. We concluded the fiscal year with strong fourth quarter earning. No",1562,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I will begin by providing commentary on our fourth quarter results, followed by 2016 cash flow performance and ending with our 2017 outlook. 
We concluded the fiscal year with strong fourth quarter earning. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.86 for the quarter, including a onetime $0.42 per share noncash deferred tax benefit related to the integration of Big Heart into the Smucker company as was previewed during our third quarter call. This strong finish to the year was mostly attributable to coffee, including higher-than-anticipated volume across our mainstream and premium coffee brand and a favorable price-to-cost relationship. 
The comparison of fourth quarter earnings between years is significantly impacted by onetime items reported in each of the respective period. These include the deferred tax benefit in the current year as well as the Big Heart acquisition and financing-related activities in the prior year. As a result, the remainder of my fourth quarter commentary will be focused on the business segment. 
Beginning with coffee. Fourth quarter net sales grew 9% as favorable volume/mix of 13% was only partially offset by lower net pricing. Sales for the Dunkin' Donuts brand doubled over the prior year with K-Cups driving much of this growth. Double-digit gains for bagging Dunkin' Donut coffee also contributed. 
For the Folgers brand, net sales declined 5% attributable to lower net price realization. And lastly, Café Bustelo sales were up 28% as the momentum for this brand continues. 
Segment profit increased $43 million or 39%. We recognized lower green coffee costs in the quarter, which were partially offset by lower net pricing. In addition, higher volume/mix more than offset increased marketing. 
Turning to consumer foods. Net sales were up 5% excluding the impact of the canned milk divestiture with gains across the majority of our key brands. Sales for Jif grew 14% behind higher volume and net pricing, while the Smucker's brand was up 3% as Uncrustables had another strong quarter. 
In the bake aisle, sales for Crisco increased 6%, driven by higher volume. And lastly, sales for the Pillsbury brand were up modestly as higher price realization offset volume decline. 
Segment profit declined 6% mostly attributable to lapping the prior year earnings of the divested milk business. Planned increases in manufacturing overhead costs also contributed, reflecting the new peanut butter facility in Memphis as well as underabsorbed overhead costs related to our working capital initiatives. These factors offset lower marketing expense. 
Net sales for our U.S. Retail Pet Food segments was $563 million. We estimate this represents an approximate 3% increase compared to the prior year fourth quarter, of which 6 weeks were reported under our ownership. 
Sales from our premium pet brands improved low double digits driven by Natural Balance, while pet snacks sales increased in line with the overall segment. Mainstream pet food sales were flat compared to the prior year as growth in our cat food brands offset declines in dog food. 
Pet Food segment profit was $117 million for the quarter. As expected, we realized a sequential increase in segment profit margin from 17% in the third quarter to 20.7% this quarter, primarily reflecting lower marketing expense. Incremental synergy recognition also contributed. 
Net sales for International and Foodservice increased 1% in the quarter, reflecting higher volume/mix in Foodservice. In Canada, the addition of pet food was essentially offset by the impact of FX. Segment profit was up 8% over the prior year, driven by our Foodservice business, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange in Canada. 
Free cash flow was $295 million for the quarter, bringing the 2016 total to $1.26 billion. The outperformance compared to our most recent free cash flow guidance of $975 million was attributable to exceeding our 2016 working capital improvement target, lower-than-projected CapEx spending, a fourth quarter tax refund of $53 million, which is separate from the deferred tax adjustment impacting earning and higher net income. 
Expanding on our working capital initiatives. In 2016, we realized the majority of our finished goods inventory reduction goal of $200 million nearly a year ahead of schedule. In 2017, we expect to achieve the remainder of the inventory reduction target along with modest working capital improvements related to accounts payable and receivables, all of which are factored into our 2017 free cash flow outlook I will discuss in a moment. 
We ended the year with debt of $5.4 billion. Based on 2016 EBITDA of $1.58 billion, our leverage stood at 3.4x at April 30, a reduction from 4.1x at the beginning of the year. In addition to exceeding our debt paydown target for the year, we were able to restart share repurchase activities, aided by the strong free cash flow and proceeds from the divestiture of the milk business. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased nearly 3% of shares outstanding for approximately $430 million. In 2017, the lower share count will offset the EPS impact of the 8 months of lost profit related to the divested milk business. 
Turning to our 2017 outlook, we anticipate reported net sales to decrease by 1% compared to the prior year as we will lap approximately $150 million in sales related to the milk divestiture. Excluding this impact, net sales are projected to be up 1%. Favorable volume/mix across each of the segments, including the benefit of new products, is expected to be mostly offset by lower pricing in U.S. Retail Coffee and the FX in Canada. 
Approximately $25 million of the incremental $100 million of synergies for 2017 are expected to benefit gross profit. Overall commodity costs are anticipated to be lower. However, our Canadian business is estimating a COGS headwind of $20 million related to FX, of which, unfortunately, we expect to be offset. As a result, we expect gross margin to approximate 39% in 2017. 
Further, SD&A expenses are projected to be comparable with the prior year. This reflects the benefit of incremental synergies related to headcount reductions and other administrative cost savings offset by increased marketing in support of recently launched product, our Olympic sponsorship, innovation and regulatory expenses. 
We're projecting non-GAAP operating income growth of 4% in 2017 compared to $1.465 billion in the prior year, which excludes amortization and the prior year gain on sales of $25 million. Further, excluding the $32 million of profit in last year's operating income [ph] related to the divested milk business, the growth would be 6%. 
Below operating income, we expect net interest expense of approximately $165 million and a tax rate of 34%. And lastly, a weighted average share count of 116.6 million shares was used based on current shares outstanding. 
Factoring in all of this, we're guiding 2017 adjusted EPS in the range of $7.60 to $7.75, which excludes $1.18 per share of estimated noncash amortization. 
Including the amortization, this yields a range of $6.42 to $6.57 compared to a 2016 base of $6. This results in year-over-year increases ranging from 7% to 10%. 
As illustrated on the document posted on our website, we derived the $6 EPS for 2016 by subtracting the $0.42 deferred tax adjustment and the $0.15 milk gain from our reported non-GAAP EPS of $6.57. We anticipate much of the EPS growth for the year to be weighted towards the middle 2 quarters of the fiscal year due to certain factors. Last year's first quarter included the launch of Dunkin' K-Cups. Also within coffee, this year's first quarter will be unfavorably impacted due to timing associated with the full quarter impact of the price decrease taken in July of 2015 along with the additional price decline taken in May of this year as compared to the recognition of lower cost. Other factors impacting quarterly comparison include the timing of synergy recognition; the timing impact related to trade spend recognition on a quarterly basis; and finally, the fourth quarter comparison to this year's strong fourth quarter finish. 
Looking briefly at the segment. Coffee profits are projected to be comparable to the record fiscal 2015 level. For Consumer Foods, reported segment profit is expected to be down given the prior year gain on the milk divestiture and the lost milk profit but up mid-single digits when these items are excluded. 
Pet Food segment profit is also projected to be up mid-single digits, reflecting incremental synergies and organic growth, including the contributions of new product. 
And lastly, International and Foodservice is anticipated to be down, primarily reflecting the net impact of FX in Canada. 
We project free cash flow will approximate $1 billion from which we plan to pay down debt and further reduce leverage to 3.1x by the end of this fiscal year. This assumes projected 2017 EBITDA of a dollar -- $1.63 billion. 
Additional assumptions related to 2017 include amortization expense of nearly $210 million; depreciation of $215 million; share-based compensation expense of $35 million; capital expenditures of $240 million; and lastly, onetime costs of $100 million, which are mostly cash related. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our overall performance in 2016 as it marked a memorable year in our company's history. It is with this momentum and excitement that we look forward to executing our plans for 2017 as we remain focused on delivering continued growth.

What I would say, as Mark -- and I think we reiterated, we will deliver the $100 million in synergies. We have a clear line of sight on that.

So that is the biggest driver. I think, in terms of the coffee, I would put that more in the category of where we might land in the range. Obviously, we need to have strong year, and we need things to continue. We feel good about that, but that's probably a factor that comes into play a little bit as well. And then the other one, probably to a lesser degree, is just the FX impact. As I mentioned, we're having about a $20 million headwind, and we hope to cover at least half of that, but there's a little bit of that affecting as well."

Wanted to ask a follow-up on Andrew's question on the guidance. So Mark, a different way to look at this would be to say that, that $100 million of synergies, I think, that number alone gets you something like $0.57 a share in incremental EPS benefit in 2017, and that gets you to kind of the top end of the range. So maybe -- could you try to answer just slightly differently and just say that if synergies kind of gets you just to the top end of the range, doesn't it suggest that the rest of the operations are really, on balance, flattish? I know there's a share count benefit, there's a milk -- there's milk dilution that goes on in there, but it still just seems like the underlying expectation of the core ex the synergies is basically flat."

So we feel very comfortable to be able to invest those marketing dollar back in the business. So there's a little bit of a discussion here on whether or not the business is flat from a performance perspective or it's flat because we've invested in the marketing. We would choose the latter saying that the market increase is offsetting some of that to some degree. The other thing is, as, I think, Mark suggested in his scripted comments is that we're also investing in innovation and growth in -- also in China. So obviously, those dollars are embedded in the business portion of it when you just separate it between synergy and nonsynergy. So you can draw the conclusion it's coming from the business, but those are the 2 or 3 factors: marketing, innovation and investment in China, and a little bit of FX, as I mentioned, that are really kind of bringing that number back down."

If you think about the numbers, we did get there a year or 2 ahead of what we guided. And we got there on 2 things, really. And the most obvious one is this, the launch of Dunkin' K-Cups, and we all know that was one of the best launches in consumer products in the last 5 [indiscernible]. So that was a wonderful performance. But really, more importantly, financially, if you look at the performance of our core Red Can business, and that's an effort that started 2 years ago. I mean, in the year that we struggled in our coffee business, Mark and his team went back and did the downsize and started those processes. And then, we had an opportunity in this last year to get coffee pricing right, to have both a manufacturing and a hedging strategy to get this thing -- to get it to price points that both excited the retailer and the consumer. And the retailer's a key piece of this. You got to get that merchandising support. So we're really pleased with where we are there. I think, you saw -- I'm sure you saw there our press release on pricing that we just took. So with all of that behind us, we feel pretty comfortable that we can repeat that performance. And to your comment earlier, that will be repeating a record performance. We actually beat the 2014 number this year, right. So on our Red Can and our core business and our Dunkin' business, we feel -- or our Dunkin' K-Cup business, we feel really good. So a loss in that, though, year was the 2 segments that didn't perform as well as we wanted to. And that's our business in premium and our legacy K-Cup, our Folgers K-Cup business. So what we intend to do this year is do the same things to those. And so the pricing, we leaned in early on, on the Dunkin' bag business. You saw some of that performance in the fourth quarter. We feel great about that going into this quarter. So we need to put ourselves back on premium growth momentum. We will invest to do that, and we need to make sure as the K-Cup segment shakes out, and it will shake out, I mean, there's so many new items, there's so much going on there, that the velocities on our core legacy items are strong, and we invested right at the end of the quarter in that as well. So I guess, what I'm saying, we feel comfortable we can repeat the record results in Red Can, the Dunkin' K-Cup business will be very solid this year. And then, with what we have extra on there, we're going to invest in those other 2 segments. So I would hope we come out of the coffee business firing on all cylinders versus firing just on those 2 big ones next year [ph]."

Then we saw it come down basically $1 a pound over that time. It's bumped up in the last day or so a little bit. But if you think about that, the fastest most efficient way to get that pricing to the consumer was with trade. Okay. We can impact shelf price on a promoted period immediately with trade. Okay? So in the short term, that's very efficient. In the long term, it's very inefficient because it promotes all kinds of buying  and loading all this inefficiency in the system, right. So over the last year, we've taken a couple of list price declines to mitigate that, to make the promotional allowance depth less. So we leaned in to current coffee pricing on our promotional price points. And now, this has allowed us to sort of drain that out, get a better list price to promoted price ratio so that our everyday prices get better and we maintain the current prices. So we tried to make that clear in the release that we did and give a little more clarity on that this time so that the costs have been reflected in total coffee pricing.

So a couple things, as you know, as you think about our performance historically, it's been very good. And we have had, historically, a very strong cost discipline in multiple areas of our business. Part of what we've embarked on, which really was -- the catalyst was the Big Heart acquisition, was to think a little bit deeper about our overall cost-savings initiatives and how we might maybe do a little bit better. You are right that our productivity measures versus our peers are probably better in many cases. And we are generally leaner, I would say, than some of our peers. But having said that, we have an obligation, obviously, to our shareholders to make sure that we have the best cost discipline that we can have. And so what we've been doing, and this is part of the explanation of the $50 million, is on an ongoing basis making sure from a continuous improvement that we have the discipline in our supply chain, our operations, our purchasing and, longer term as we think about how do we get more efficient in trade, all of those things should help drive, what I would call, some incremental savings to the bottom line. So it isn't -- we don't think about it as a onetime benefit. But we are comfortable that we can, at least, deliver that, and then beyond these next couple years, we should be able to continue to deliver annual cost-savings objectives, which we hold our teams to. The good news about that is it is, as Richard mentioned, it is allowing us to invest and enhance capability, and at a very high level, what those capabilities are focused on is getting better at engaging with our consumer and getting better at engaging with our retail customers. And so strategically, having the right balance between our leading #1 brand, which are really the engine that fuel our growth as well as having the right emerging brands in our portfolio is part of that strategy. And so making sure that we have dollars that can fund those enhanced capabilities, both in consumer engagement and customer engagement, is really going to help drive our growth, both top and bottom line long term."

I think it's difficult to think the coffee category was one brush competitively. I think, the prepared remarks probably were focused more on our mainstream Red Can business, right. And I do think we've seen, well, with Arabica falling, with the coffee prices falling where they are, we have found that price points have gotten down into those ranges where it motivates both the competitor and the consumer and the customer, right. So all of us are in price points that really work, okay. And so we're back in that zone, and I think everybody is operating in that zone. Now having said that, I would argue that the premium segment was maybe the most competitive we've ever seen it last year. And so the Dunkin' bag business, as you know, early in the year, had a couple of tough quarters. And we've talked about how we leaned into that in the fourth quarter. Premium green is another remnant for a whole nother discussion. But green coffee is not all the same. There's the coffee that goes into a lot of premium coffees. There's a much longer supply chain. You might expect lower -- coffee cost to impact us at different timing based on the type of green that it is. So in the fourth quarter that we were in a position to support that, we did, and it has responded. So if you think about it, the core Red Can pricing had moderated. Our competitive set had moderated. The premium business probably is in that space now. And the last piece will be K-Cups, and we're going to lean into K-Cups. The proliferation of K-Cups has caused that whole segment to be competing for a slower-growth base. And one of the levers that's been used in there is price. We're able now to compete in that area. But that's for the -- maybe the last piece of the puzzle. And we feel good about the plan we put in front of you today will give us the dollars to support that and return that business to growth."

Just to add, Jason, as far as our growth expectations for next year, as you know, our snack business has tremendous momentum behind it. So we expect our snack business to be at high single-digit growth next, next fiscal year, specifically with our Milk-Bone and our Pup-Peroni brands. On the pet specialty side of the business, we're lapping the expanded distribution last year in the pet specialty channel. But we would expect mid-single-digit growth this coming year as we will launch a national advertising campaign behind the Natural Balance brand. We also -- there are 2 major retailers in pet specialty. But -- so there's also a significant amount of sales that moved through the independent trade. We have a push behind our Nature's Recipe brand. We think there's some real opportunities there. That's our gateway specialty brand. So we see some growth there. And then also our snacks plate, a significant role in pet specialty, so widely distributed brands. Also, there's tremendous growth opportunity there. Food is going to be the lower growth this year as far as the portfolio is concerned. You know what our challenges were this past year, specifically with Kibbles 'n Bits. We are encouraged that we've actually seen negative consumption trends start to decelerate at the end of -- at this last fiscal year. We've put some bonus bags into the market. You're going to see more of those going into market in June. So a lot of effort stabilizing our dry dog food business and in trying to get that business back where it needs to be.

We probably got some of the initial communication a little wrong, but we got the concept right. And so this year, we're going to relaunch that with a little better packaging, a little better messaging. And we're going to -- it's a heavy capital investment because the technology is unique.

So I'm wondering here, if Starbucks can do that with JAB, why can't Smucker's? So if you can comment on that. I'm just surprised that they were able to renegotiate terms now there was a change in ownership there, and, apparently, you haven't. Related to that, I understand the idea of sharpening price points for Folgers and K-Cups. The category has been sticky, of course, while ground moves quite a bit. But as you do that, are we expecting our competitors to also cut prices in their K-Cup brands? And then K-Cups, as a category, will become, not sticky but passthrough as ground.

So just different companies manage those things differently, right. So that process is in process, and we feel good about that relationship. They are committed to have the major brands in the category in their systems. And we read the same things you read, so our assumptions are -- going into those negotiations, our assumptions are similar to yours. So we feel fine there. And with regards to K-Cups, if you dig a little deeper into the IRI or Nielsen data, you'll see that K-Cups -- although we don't passthrough green -- because green's kind of a small portion of the overall cost structure, it's become maybe the most promoted category in total cost. So there's the highest reliant -- each one of those brands relies very heavily on promotion. So maybe I'm not clear enough when I talk about leaning in. We've leaned in on our promotional price point mostly. And so those promotional price points are basically down $1 a box from where they used to be. It still means -- it's still a very profitable business. But that migration has already -- that train's already left. So we are where we are.

So if you take the milk loss, the $150 million I mentioned earlier, and then you had 1% of sales, so call it, somewhere between $70 million, $90 million on coffee pricing, that's the 2 big negatives.

So in the fourth quarter, obviously, green pricing to cost was a bigger impact, but we sort of spent that money upfront. So I would say it's a combination of that green pricing. When you get your #1 -- your high-volume item, when you get volume up on those canisters, and our facilities do it, it really -- it falls to the bottom line, so that's very efficient for us. So Mark, I know Mark's digging for the exact percentage number as we speak.

So if you go back to what was [ph] the early part of the year, we expected quarter-over-quarter improvement on margin, which we delivered on in Q2, 3 and 4. I think from a cost perspective going forward, the costs aligned very similar to what we've seen our Consumer Foods. So the green continued to be favorable. I think as Barry mentioned, we are going to continue bonus bags and things like that, that might have a little bit of effect on gross profit. And then, of course, I think, as we said over time, of the 3 segments of the business, the natural has the lowest profitability.

And so the long and short of it is, as we looked at our organization, we took some opportunity across not only our commercial functions, which would be sales and marketing and thinking about how we would organize those differently, but we looked across our supply chain network, our finance organization, our -- some of our administrative functions as well just to make sure that we were running them in the most efficient way.

We feel very comfortable with the $1 billion of free cash flow that we'll be able to continue that debt paydown planned, obviously, continue our dividend payout policies. And it allows us a little bit of flexibility as strategic options come in. So whether that's M&A -- again, I don't think we're looking at a huge transformational like a pet, at least from a leverage perspective. But certainly, there's M&A opportunity as well as buyback.

So could there be additional cash outlays in '17 to incremental buybacks even though you might not have as many of the onetime benefits on your working cap?"

The simple math would say 4% plus operating profit growth, 3% shares and 1 point in tax and interest. So that kind of gets you to the 8%. In terms of buyback, what we've guided indirectly -- we have conversations, particularly with rating agencies. We kind of use a 2% as a long-term model. So that's a 2% buyback. So obviously, at a 116 million shares of -- 2.2 share -- 2.2 million shares. So that, as I said on your earlier question, we don't factor that into our plans. I would say our cash deployment would allow a portion of that, maybe not the whole 2% without pushing the leverage target we're going after. But certainly -- and again, it's situational. So I don't want to sit here and say, we're going out and buy it. But if the opportunity were right, I believe we have the cash to do it, and then obviously, it would be incremental. Certainly, when we do it in the year, we'll have less of an impact to do further into the year. But that's the beauty of being the leverage where we want it to be. It's the flexibility."

During this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current expectations about future plans and performance. These statements rely on a number of assumptions and estimates, and actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. I encourage you to read the full disclosure statement in this morning's press release concerning forward-looking statements. 
Additionally, please note the company uses non-GAAP results for the purpose of evaluating performance internally as detailed in the press release, which is located on our corporate website at jmsmucker.com. 
As we indicated earlier in the calendar year, we are transitioning to one non-GAAP earnings per share metric in 2017, which excludes noncash intangible amortization. We will refer to this as adjusted EPS.  Amortization expense will also be removed from our definition of segment profit as well as non-GAAP operating income and net income. We will file Form 8-K later this quarter to recast prior year segment results to reflect the new definition. We have posted to our website a couple of supplementary slides, including a bridge from our fiscal 2016 results to our fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS guidance. These slides can be accessed through the link to the webcast of this call. This document and a replay of this call will be archived on our website.

Fiscal 2016 was a dynamic and exciting year for the Smucker company as our teams delivered on a number of key strategic initiatives. These included significantly improving the performance of our coffee business, reflecting the launch of the Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups, and returning momentum to our mainstream coffee business; expanding distribution for our Natural Balance pet brand; executing a seamless integration of the Pet Food business; exceeding our synergy and working capital targets for the year; divesting our U.S. canned milk business, all resulting in record financial performance and earnings and cash flow that exceeded our expectation. 
Let me expand on the results for the year. Net sales increased 37% to $7.8 billion, reflecting the full year contribution of Big Heart Pet Brands. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, sales increased 3% for the full year. 
Non-GAAP operating income was up 49% to $1.28 billion with the contributions from pet and strong coffee segment profit growth being the key drivers.  Non-GAAP earnings per share were $6.57, including a onetime $0.46 per -- $0.42 per share noncash benefit. This compares to our most recent guidance of $5.84 to $5.94, which excluded the tax benefit. 
Lastly, the company generated free cash flow of $1.26 billion, which is well above our original estimate. Reflecting this strong cash flow, we exceeded our deleveraging objective for the year, reducing total debt by nearly $750 million. We also returned over $750 million of cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. 
There are numerous accomplishments during the past fiscal year, and this performance is a testament to the dedication of our employees, and we thank them for their continued effort. We are well positioned to continue this momentum into fiscal 2017. Since the last time we spoke to many of you, we announced several executive appointments that are consistent with the company's history of long-term succession planning and the development of leadership to meet the current and future needs of our business and the constituents that we serve. 
Effective May 1, Mark Smucker assumed the role of President and Chief Executive Officer. Mark and his experienced leadership team embody the values that have contributed to the company's success and long-term growth. I am confident that under their direction, the company will continue to innovate, evolve and grow in the years to come. 
It's been an honor to serve as CEO of the Smucker company, and I'm grateful to have worked alongside the most talented team in the industry. I will continue to serve the company as Executive Chairman. Among other areas, my efforts will be focused on board-related matters, counsel and advice on strategic decisions, enhancing customer relationships, and advancing our industry leadership efforts. 
My brother, Tim, has been appointed to the role of Chairman Emeritus, and we also look forward to his continued contributions. 
Lastly, I would like to recognize Vince Byrd, who is participating in his final earnings call as his retirement after 39 years with the company is effective tomorrow. Vince's contributions have helped shape the company that we are today and will continue to be reflected in the numerous employees that he has mentored throughout his career. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark."

I am excited to lead our talented team, leveraging the continued counsel of Richard, Dad and our outstanding board to drive continued growth and shareholder value. I also would like to echo Richard's comment about Vince and thank him for his contribution and mentorship. 
The focus of my comments today will be to provide an update on our business segments, including additional color on full year 2016 performance and initial thoughts on fiscal 2017. 
I'll start with our coffee business, which far exceeded expectations for the year. Net sales were up 8% and segment profit increased 18% to $646 million, representing a full recovery of the segment profit decline in the prior year. This outperformance was driven by several factors, including the successful launch of Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups, the implementation of the planned Folgers canister downsize, a moderation in competitive activities and the net benefit of lower commodity cost and pricing. 
Providing lower pricing on Folgers roast and ground coffee resulted in improved performance for our mainstream coffee business in 2016. Tonnage for our mainstream brands was up 3%, while units shipped were up even more given the canister downsize early in the fiscal year. In addition, our dollar share within the mainstream segment of the coffee category increased nearly 2 share points to 55% for the latest 52-week period. 
We anticipate momentum in the coffee business to continue in 2017. Key initiatives include Folgers sponsorship of the U.S. Olympic team for the upcoming Rio games with marketing activities already underway. In addition, last month, we implemented a 6% list price decline across much of our coffee portfolio, reflecting sustained lower green coffee costs. These lower costs have been reflected in promotional pricing for the past several quarters, and we do not anticipate promoted prices changing significantly. 
With regards to Folgers K-Cups, in 2016, the brand was impacted by the ongoing proliferation of entrants in the K-Cups space, including our introduction of Dunkin' K-Cups. This year, we will invest further in the product line to improve trends, including lower pricing and new packaging that will leverage the iconic Folgers Red Can brand equity. 
Turning to the Dunkin' Donuts brand. Dunkin' K-Cups achieved nearly $220 million in retail sales for the latest 52-week scan period and gained a 6% dollar share of the K-Cup market, giving us an overall share of nearly 15% in the K-Cup segment. In its first year on the market, the Dunkin' Donuts original SKU has become the #1 K-Cup item in the channels in which we participate. As consumer repeat rates remain strong and with opportunities to introduce additional variety, we anticipate further growth in 2017. 
While challenged for much of 2016, performance improved for Dunkin' Donuts bagged coffee during the fourth quarter. Supported by favorable input costs, we have sharpened pricing to improve gaps to key competitors, and we look for positive volume trends to continue. 
Lastly, within coffee, the Café Bustelo brand experienced a second consecutive year of double-digit sales growth behind strong performance for both roast and ground and K-Cup offerings. This exciting on-trend brand remains well received by millennials, and its growth is expected to continue also in 2017. 
Turning to consumer foods. Net sales declined 3% for the year, mostly due to lapping sales from the divested canned milk business. Segment profit was flat to prior year, supported by the gain on the milk business sale, which offset planned increases in manufacturing overhead costs. 
Looking briefly at the key brands, we are pleased with the overall performance of our spreads business as both Jif Peanut Butter and Smucker's Fruit Spreads grew volume share over the latest 52-week period. In addition, Smucker's Uncrustables Frozen Sandwiches had another strong year with volume up 26%, including a 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit volume growth in this most recent fourth quarter. 
On-trend innovation continues to be a focus area for the iconic Jif and Smucker's brands. In fiscal 2017, we look to build on recent successful launches, such as Smucker's Fruit & Honey Fruit Spreads and Jif Snack Bars. This includes the upcoming introduction of new snack bar varieties and plans to expand into other snacking platforms. In addition, Jif, Smucker's and Uncrustables are all participating in the 2016 Olympics sponsorship, which will be an integral part of this year's marketing efforts for the brands. 
In the bake aisle, the overall category remains challenged throughout much of this past year, reflecting changing consumer preferences and aggressive competitive pricing. Our focus remains on providing value-added innovation, such as our recent gluten-free and simple ingredient offerings. 
We are also excited to announce a licensing arrangement with the Girl Scouts of America. Under this agreement, we are launching new Pillsbury items featuring iconic Girl Scouts cookie flavors. 
Within Natural Foods, our leading R.W. Knudsen Family and Santa Cruz Organic brands both achieved solid sales growth in 2016. The key Natural Foods categories in which our brands participate are growing, which gives us confidence in maintaining our momentum in this business. We are also excited about our recent investment in the Numi brand and the opportunities this provides in the organic tea category. 
Under our first year of ownership, Pet Foods segment profit of $392 million was generally in line with expectations. Net sales of $2.25 billion fell 1% short of the projections provided at our October Investor Day due to competitive challenges in mainstream dry dog food. For the year, mainstream Pet Food sales decreased mid-single digit, reflecting double-digit declines in dog food and a low single-digit decline for the larger cat food business. Offsetting the lower mainstream sales was the strong performance of our pet snacks business, which was up mid-single digits over the prior year, and our premium pet food brands, which grew double digits behind expanded distribution of the Natural Balance brand. 
As we enter 2017, we anticipate continued growth for Natural Balance as we launch the brand's first national marketing campaign, along with additional in-store support. Within pet snacks, innovation for the Milk-Bone and Meow Mix brands were key contributors to 2016 results, and we expect to see on these -- to build on these trends with new product introduction this fiscal year. We also continue to focus on opportunities in mainstream pet food, driven by consumer preference for additional protein and natural ingredients. 
Lastly, within the segment, we are excited about our partnership and planned in-store activities related to the animated film, The Secret Life of Pets, which will be in theaters next month. 
Turning to International and Foodservice. We are pleased with the full year results despite the significant top and bottom line impacts of foreign currency. Reported net sales were in line with the prior year as the addition of the Pet Food business and the benefit of higher net pricing in Canada offset a $60 million top line impact related to foreign exchange. Segment profit was up 12%, mostly attributable -- Foodservice. The introduction of Smucker's Uncrustables into school lunch programs contributed to this growth. The strong underlying performance of our Canadian business was mostly offset by the impact of foreign exchange. 
Let me conclude with an update on our integration and cost-savings activities. We successfully achieved our March 1 integration milestone for the Pet Food business and recognized just over $35 million in synergies for 2016. In addition, we have clear visibility and confidence in realizing an incremental $100 million in synergies this fiscal year. In total, this would provide approximately $135 million in synergies for 2017. 
Looking ahead, we remain confident in achieving our original goal of $200 million in annual synergies by the end of fiscal 2018. In addition to the $200 million of synergies, we are targeting $50 million of incremental annual cost savings to be fully realized over the next few years. Related projects include further optimizing our manufacturing footprint as, over the next 18 months, we will close a coffee facility in Harahan, Louisiana, and 2 leased Natural Foods facilities located in Livermore, California, with production being consolidated into existing operation. In addition, we are nearly complete with an organizational redesign aimed at further optimizing corporate resources contributing to this cost-savings target. 
We expect to initially invest much of these incremental savings in several identified areas. We will continue to prioritize investments that generate top and bottom line growth for key on-trend platforms. In fiscal 2017, these include opportunities related to Smucker's Uncrustables, coffee and snacks. 
We are also establishing a new growth and innovation organization, which is being led by a member of my leadership team. The group is being tasked with further building capabilities related to consumer and market insight; digital; innovation; targeted market development strategies for our customers, including pricing and trade spend optimization. Lastly, we plan to invest in new growth opportunities to expand our presence in China. 
In closing, 2016 was a historic year for our company, and I would like to thank our employees for their effort. As we enter 2017, key priorities include achieving our synergy goals, building on our product innovation activities and investing in new capabilities to enhance future growth. 
Overall, we remain confident in our long-term strategy, the strength of our brands and our ability to deliver shareholder value in 2017 and beyond. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark Belgya."

I will begin by providing commentary on our fourth quarter results, followed by 2016 cash flow performance and ending with our 2017 outlook. We concluded the fiscal year with strong fourth quarter earning. No",1562,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I will begin by providing commentary on our fourth quarter results, followed by 2016 cash flow performance and ending with our 2017 outlook. 
We concluded the fiscal year with strong fourth quarter earning. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.86 for the quarter, including a onetime $0.42 per share noncash deferred tax benefit related to the integration of Big Heart into the Smucker company as was previewed during our third quarter call. This strong finish to the year was mostly attributable to coffee, including higher-than-anticipated volume across our mainstream and premium coffee brand and a favorable price-to-cost relationship. 
The comparison of fourth quarter earnings between years is significantly impacted by onetime items reported in each of the respective period. These include the deferred tax benefit in the current year as well as the Big Heart acquisition and financing-related activities in the prior year. As a result, the remainder of my fourth quarter commentary will be focused on the business segment. 
Beginning with coffee. Fourth quarter net sales grew 9% as favorable volume/mix of 13% was only partially offset by lower net pricing. Sales for the Dunkin' Donuts brand doubled over the prior year with K-Cups driving much of this growth. Double-digit gains for bagging Dunkin' Donut coffee also contributed. 
For the Folgers brand, net sales declined 5% attributable to lower net price realization. And lastly, Café Bustelo sales were up 28% as the momentum for this brand continues. 
Segment profit increased $43 million or 39%. We recognized lower green coffee costs in the quarter, which were partially offset by lower net pricing. In addition, higher volume/mix more than offset increased marketing. 
Turning to consumer foods. Net sales were up 5% excluding the impact of the canned milk divestiture with gains across the majority of our key brands. Sales for Jif grew 14% behind higher volume and net pricing, while the Smucker's brand was up 3% as Uncrustables had another strong quarter. 
In the bake aisle, sales for Crisco increased 6%, driven by higher volume. And lastly, sales for the Pillsbury brand were up modestly as higher price realization offset volume decline. 
Segment profit declined 6% mostly attributable to lapping the prior year earnings of the divested milk business. Planned increases in manufacturing overhead costs also contributed, reflecting the new peanut butter facility in Memphis as well as underabsorbed overhead costs related to our working capital initiatives. These factors offset lower marketing expense. 
Net sales for our U.S. Retail Pet Food segments was $563 million. We estimate this represents an approximate 3% increase compared to the prior year fourth quarter, of which 6 weeks were reported under our ownership. 
Sales from our premium pet brands improved low double digits driven by Natural Balance, while pet snacks sales increased in line with the overall segment. Mainstream pet food sales were flat compared to the prior year as growth in our cat food brands offset declines in dog food. 
Pet Food segment profit was $117 million for the quarter. As expected, we realized a sequential increase in segment profit margin from 17% in the third quarter to 20.7% this quarter, primarily reflecting lower marketing expense. Incremental synergy recognition also contributed. 
Net sales for International and Foodservice increased 1% in the quarter, reflecting higher volume/mix in Foodservice. In Canada, the addition of pet food was essentially offset by the impact of FX. Segment profit was up 8% over the prior year, driven by our Foodservice business, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange in Canada. 
Free cash flow was $295 million for the quarter, bringing the 2016 total to $1.26 billion. The outperformance compared to our most recent free cash flow guidance of $975 million was attributable to exceeding our 2016 working capital improvement target, lower-than-projected CapEx spending, a fourth quarter tax refund of $53 million, which is separate from the deferred tax adjustment impacting earning and higher net income. 
Expanding on our working capital initiatives. In 2016, we realized the majority of our finished goods inventory reduction goal of $200 million nearly a year ahead of schedule. In 2017, we expect to achieve the remainder of the inventory reduction target along with modest working capital improvements related to accounts payable and receivables, all of which are factored into our 2017 free cash flow outlook I will discuss in a moment. 
We ended the year with debt of $5.4 billion. Based on 2016 EBITDA of $1.58 billion, our leverage stood at 3.4x at April 30, a reduction from 4.1x at the beginning of the year. In addition to exceeding our debt paydown target for the year, we were able to restart share repurchase activities, aided by the strong free cash flow and proceeds from the divestiture of the milk business. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased nearly 3% of shares outstanding for approximately $430 million. In 2017, the lower share count will offset the EPS impact of the 8 months of lost profit related to the divested milk business. 
Turning to our 2017 outlook, we anticipate reported net sales to decrease by 1% compared to the prior year as we will lap approximately $150 million in sales related to the milk divestiture. Excluding this impact, net sales are projected to be up 1%. Favorable volume/mix across each of the segments, including the benefit of new products, is expected to be mostly offset by lower pricing in U.S. Retail Coffee and the FX in Canada. 
Approximately $25 million of the incremental $100 million of synergies for 2017 are expected to benefit gross profit. Overall commodity costs are anticipated to be lower. However, our Canadian business is estimating a COGS headwind of $20 million related to FX, of which, unfortunately, we expect to be offset. As a result, we expect gross margin to approximate 39% in 2017. 
Further, SD&A expenses are projected to be comparable with the prior year. This reflects the benefit of incremental synergies related to headcount reductions and other administrative cost savings offset by increased marketing in support of recently launched product, our Olympic sponsorship, innovation and regulatory expenses. 
We're projecting non-GAAP operating income growth of 4% in 2017 compared to $1.465 billion in the prior year, which excludes amortization and the prior year gain on sales of $25 million. Further, excluding the $32 million of profit in last year's operating income [ph] related to the divested milk business, the growth would be 6%. 
Below operating income, we expect net interest expense of approximately $165 million and a tax rate of 34%. And lastly, a weighted average share count of 116.6 million shares was used based on current shares outstanding. 
Factoring in all of this, we're guiding 2017 adjusted EPS in the range of $7.60 to $7.75, which excludes $1.18 per share of estimated noncash amortization. 
Including the amortization, this yields a range of $6.42 to $6.57 compared to a 2016 base of $6. This results in year-over-year increases ranging from 7% to 10%. 
As illustrated on the document posted on our website, we derived the $6 EPS for 2016 by subtracting the $0.42 deferred tax adjustment and the $0.15 milk gain from our reported non-GAAP EPS of $6.57. We anticipate much of the EPS growth for the year to be weighted towards the middle 2 quarters of the fiscal year due to certain factors. Last year's first quarter included the launch of Dunkin' K-Cups. Also within coffee, this year's first quarter will be unfavorably impacted due to timing associated with the full quarter impact of the price decrease taken in July of 2015 along with the additional price decline taken in May of this year as compared to the recognition of lower cost. Other factors impacting quarterly comparison include the timing of synergy recognition; the timing impact related to trade spend recognition on a quarterly basis; and finally, the fourth quarter comparison to this year's strong fourth quarter finish. 
Looking briefly at the segment. Coffee profits are projected to be comparable to the record fiscal 2015 level. For Consumer Foods, reported segment profit is expected to be down given the prior year gain on the milk divestiture and the lost milk profit but up mid-single digits when these items are excluded. 
Pet Food segment profit is also projected to be up mid-single digits, reflecting incremental synergies and organic growth, including the contributions of new product. 
And lastly, International and Foodservice is anticipated to be down, primarily reflecting the net impact of FX in Canada. 
We project free cash flow will approximate $1 billion from which we plan to pay down debt and further reduce leverage to 3.1x by the end of this fiscal year. This assumes projected 2017 EBITDA of a dollar -- $1.63 billion. 
Additional assumptions related to 2017 include amortization expense of nearly $210 million; depreciation of $215 million; share-based compensation expense of $35 million; capital expenditures of $240 million; and lastly, onetime costs of $100 million, which are mostly cash related. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our overall performance in 2016 as it marked a memorable year in our company's history. It is with this momentum and excitement that we look forward to executing our plans for 2017 as we remain focused on delivering continued growth.

So that is the biggest driver. I think, in terms of the coffee, I would put that more in the category of where we might land in the range. Obviously, we need to have strong year, and we need things to continue. We feel good about that, but that's probably a factor that comes into play a little bit as well. And then the other one, probably to a lesser degree, is just the FX impact. As I mentioned, we're having about a $20 million headwind, and we hope to cover at least half of that, but there's a little bit of that affecting as well."

Wanted to ask a follow-up on Andrew's question on the guidance. So Mark, a different way to look at this would be to say that, that $100 million of synergies, I think, that number alone gets you something like $0.57 a share in incremental EPS benefit in 2017, and that gets you to kind of the top end of the range. So maybe -- could you try to answer just slightly differently and just say that if synergies kind of gets you just to the top end of the range, doesn't it suggest that the rest of the operations are really, on balance, flattish? I know there's a share count benefit, there's a milk -- there's milk dilution that goes on in there, but it still just seems like the underlying expectation of the core ex the synergies is basically flat."

So we feel very comfortable to be able to invest those marketing dollar back in the business. So there's a little bit of a discussion here on whether or not the business is flat from a performance perspective or it's flat because we've invested in the marketing. We would choose the latter saying that the market increase is offsetting some of that to some degree. The other thing is, as, I think, Mark suggested in his scripted comments is that we're also investing in innovation and growth in -- also in China. So obviously, those dollars are embedded in the business portion of it when you just separate it between synergy and nonsynergy. So you can draw the conclusion it's coming from the business, but those are the 2 or 3 factors: marketing, innovation and investment in China, and a little bit of FX, as I mentioned, that are really kind of bringing that number back down."

If you think about the numbers, we did get there a year or 2 ahead of what we guided. And we got there on 2 things, really. And the most obvious one is this, the launch of Dunkin' K-Cups, and we all know that was one of the best launches in consumer products in the last 5 [indiscernible]. So that was a wonderful performance. But really, more importantly, financially, if you look at the performance of our core Red Can business, and that's an effort that started 2 years ago. I mean, in the year that we struggled in our coffee business, Mark and his team went back and did the downsize and started those processes. And then, we had an opportunity in this last year to get coffee pricing right, to have both a manufacturing and a hedging strategy to get this thing -- to get it to price points that both excited the retailer and the consumer. And the retailer's a key piece of this. You got to get that merchandising support. So we're really pleased with where we are there. I think, you saw -- I'm sure you saw there our press release on pricing that we just took. So with all of that behind us, we feel pretty comfortable that we can repeat that performance. And to your comment earlier, that will be repeating a record performance. We actually beat the 2014 number this year, right. So on our Red Can and our core business and our Dunkin' business, we feel -- or our Dunkin' K-Cup business, we feel really good. So a loss in that, though, year was the 2 segments that didn't perform as well as we wanted to. And that's our business in premium and our legacy K-Cup, our Folgers K-Cup business. So what we intend to do this year is do the same things to those. And so the pricing, we leaned in early on, on the Dunkin' bag business. You saw some of that performance in the fourth quarter. We feel great about that going into this quarter. So we need to put ourselves back on premium growth momentum. We will invest to do that, and we need to make sure as the K-Cup segment shakes out, and it will shake out, I mean, there's so many new items, there's so much going on there, that the velocities on our core legacy items are strong, and we invested right at the end of the quarter in that as well. So I guess, what I'm saying, we feel comfortable we can repeat the record results in Red Can, the Dunkin' K-Cup business will be very solid this year. And then, with what we have extra on there, we're going to invest in those other 2 segments. So I would hope we come out of the coffee business firing on all cylinders versus firing just on those 2 big ones next year [ph]."

Then we saw it come down basically $1 a pound over that time. It's bumped up in the last day or so a little bit. But if you think about that, the fastest most efficient way to get that pricing to the consumer was with trade. Okay. We can impact shelf price on a promoted period immediately with trade. Okay? So in the short term, that's very efficient. In the long term, it's very inefficient because it promotes all kinds of buying  and loading all this inefficiency in the system, right. So over the last year, we've taken a couple of list price declines to mitigate that, to make the promotional allowance depth less. So we leaned in to current coffee pricing on our promotional price points. And now, this has allowed us to sort of drain that out, get a better list price to promoted price ratio so that our everyday prices get better and we maintain the current prices. So we tried to make that clear in the release that we did and give a little more clarity on that this time so that the costs have been reflected in total coffee pricing.

So a couple things, as you know, as you think about our performance historically, it's been very good. And we have had, historically, a very strong cost discipline in multiple areas of our business. Part of what we've embarked on, which really was -- the catalyst was the Big Heart acquisition, was to think a little bit deeper about our overall cost-savings initiatives and how we might maybe do a little bit better. You are right that our productivity measures versus our peers are probably better in many cases. And we are generally leaner, I would say, than some of our peers. But having said that, we have an obligation, obviously, to our shareholders to make sure that we have the best cost discipline that we can have. And so what we've been doing, and this is part of the explanation of the $50 million, is on an ongoing basis making sure from a continuous improvement that we have the discipline in our supply chain, our operations, our purchasing and, longer term as we think about how do we get more efficient in trade, all of those things should help drive, what I would call, some incremental savings to the bottom line. So it isn't -- we don't think about it as a onetime benefit. But we are comfortable that we can, at least, deliver that, and then beyond these next couple years, we should be able to continue to deliver annual cost-savings objectives, which we hold our teams to. The good news about that is it is, as Richard mentioned, it is allowing us to invest and enhance capability, and at a very high level, what those capabilities are focused on is getting better at engaging with our consumer and getting better at engaging with our retail customers. And so strategically, having the right balance between our leading #1 brand, which are really the engine that fuel our growth as well as having the right emerging brands in our portfolio is part of that strategy. And so making sure that we have dollars that can fund those enhanced capabilities, both in consumer engagement and customer engagement, is really going to help drive our growth, both top and bottom line long term."

I think it's difficult to think the coffee category was one brush competitively. I think, the prepared remarks probably were focused more on our mainstream Red Can business, right. And I do think we've seen, well, with Arabica falling, with the coffee prices falling where they are, we have found that price points have gotten down into those ranges where it motivates both the competitor and the consumer and the customer, right. So all of us are in price points that really work, okay. And so we're back in that zone, and I think everybody is operating in that zone. Now having said that, I would argue that the premium segment was maybe the most competitive we've ever seen it last year. And so the Dunkin' bag business, as you know, early in the year, had a couple of tough quarters. And we've talked about how we leaned into that in the fourth quarter. Premium green is another remnant for a whole nother discussion. But green coffee is not all the same. There's the coffee that goes into a lot of premium coffees. There's a much longer supply chain. You might expect lower -- coffee cost to impact us at different timing based on the type of green that it is. So in the fourth quarter that we were in a position to support that, we did, and it has responded. So if you think about it, the core Red Can pricing had moderated. Our competitive set had moderated. The premium business probably is in that space now. And the last piece will be K-Cups, and we're going to lean into K-Cups. The proliferation of K-Cups has caused that whole segment to be competing for a slower-growth base. And one of the levers that's been used in there is price. We're able now to compete in that area. But that's for the -- maybe the last piece of the puzzle. And we feel good about the plan we put in front of you today will give us the dollars to support that and return that business to growth."

So just different companies manage those things differently, right. So that process is in process, and we feel good about that relationship. They are committed to have the major brands in the category in their systems. And we read the same things you read, so our assumptions are -- going into those negotiations, our assumptions are similar to yours. So we feel fine there. And with regards to K-Cups, if you dig a little deeper into the IRI or Nielsen data, you'll see that K-Cups -- although we don't passthrough green -- because green's kind of a small portion of the overall cost structure, it's become maybe the most promoted category in total cost. So there's the highest reliant -- each one of those brands relies very heavily on promotion. So maybe I'm not clear enough when I talk about leaning in. We've leaned in on our promotional price point mostly. And so those promotional price points are basically down $1 a box from where they used to be. It still means -- it's still a very profitable business. But that migration has already -- that train's already left. So we are where we are.

So it sounds like you said in your commentary that adjusted operating profit will be growing about 4%. And I know if we kind of like use that 116.6 million in your diluted shares outstanding, that implies about another 2.5%. So that gets me to 6.5% EPS growth in '17. Is the assumption here that there are other kind of below-the-line -- like the tax rate could be a little bit better, interest rate comes down a little bit or the interest expense comes down a little bit. And then lastly, if we look at the shares you bought back in Q4, really, in fiscal '16, I mean, that's the most amount you've ever spent on a buyback outside of fiscal '14. So could there be additional cash outlays in '17 to incremental buybacks even though you might not have as many of the onetime benefits on your working cap?"

The simple math would say 4% plus operating profit growth, 3% shares and 1 point in tax and interest. So that kind of gets you to the 8%. In terms of buyback, what we've guided indirectly -- we have conversations, particularly with rating agencies. We kind of use a 2% as a long-term model. So that's a 2% buyback. So obviously, at a 116 million shares of -- 2.2 share -- 2.2 million shares. So that, as I said on your earlier question, we don't factor that into our plans. I would say our cash deployment would allow a portion of that, maybe not the whole 2% without pushing the leverage target we're going after. But certainly -- and again, it's situational. So I don't want to sit here and say, we're going out and buy it. But if the opportunity were right, I believe we have the cash to do it, and then obviously, it would be incremental. Certainly, when we do it in the year, we'll have less of an impact to do further into the year. But that's the beauty of being the leverage where we want it to be. It's the flexibility."

These statements rely on a number of assumptions and estimates, and actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. I encourage you to read the full disclosure statement in this morning's press release concerning forward-looking statements. 
Additionally, please note the company uses non-GAAP results for the purpose of evaluating performance internally as detailed in the press release, which is located on our corporate website at jmsmucker.com. 
As we indicated earlier in the calendar year, we are transitioning to one non-GAAP earnings per share metric in 2017, which excludes noncash intangible amortization. We will refer to this as adjusted EPS.  Amortization expense will also be removed from our definition of segment profit as well as non-GAAP operating income and net income. We will file Form 8-K later this quarter to recast prior year segment results to reflect the new definition. We have posted to our website a couple of supplementary slides, including a bridge from our fiscal 2016 results to our fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS guidance. These slides can be accessed through the link to the webcast of this call. This document and a replay of this call will be archived on our website.

Fiscal 2016 was a dynamic and exciting year for the Smucker company as our teams delivered on a number of key strategic initiatives. These included significantly improving the performance of our coffee business, reflecting the launch of the Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups, and returning momentum to our mainstream coffee business; expanding distribution for our Natural Balance pet brand; executing a seamless integration of the Pet Food business; exceeding our synergy and working capital targets for the year; divesting our U.S. canned milk business, all resulting in record financial performance and earnings and cash flow that exceeded our expectation. 
Let me expand on the results for the year. Net sales increased 37% to $7.8 billion, reflecting the full year contribution of Big Heart Pet Brands. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, sales increased 3% for the full year. 
Non-GAAP operating income was up 49% to $1.28 billion with the contributions from pet and strong coffee segment profit growth being the key drivers.  Non-GAAP earnings per share were $6.57, including a onetime $0.46 per -- $0.42 per share noncash benefit. This compares to our most recent guidance of $5.84 to $5.94, which excluded the tax benefit. 
Lastly, the company generated free cash flow of $1.26 billion, which is well above our original estimate. Reflecting this strong cash flow, we exceeded our deleveraging objective for the year, reducing total debt by nearly $750 million. We also returned over $750 million of cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. 
There are numerous accomplishments during the past fiscal year, and this performance is a testament to the dedication of our employees, and we thank them for their continued effort. We are well positioned to continue this momentum into fiscal 2017. Since the last time we spoke to many of you, we announced several executive appointments that are consistent with the company's history of long-term succession planning and the development of leadership to meet the current and future needs of our business and the constituents that we serve. 
Effective May 1, Mark Smucker assumed the role of President and Chief Executive Officer. Mark and his experienced leadership team embody the values that have contributed to the company's success and long-term growth. I am confident that under their direction, the company will continue to innovate, evolve and grow in the years to come. 
It's been an honor to serve as CEO of the Smucker company, and I'm grateful to have worked alongside the most talented team in the industry. I will continue to serve the company as Executive Chairman. Among other areas, my efforts will be focused on board-related matters, counsel and advice on strategic decisions, enhancing customer relationships, and advancing our industry leadership efforts. 
My brother, Tim, has been appointed to the role of Chairman Emeritus, and we also look forward to his continued contributions. 
Lastly, I would like to recognize Vince Byrd, who is participating in his final earnings call as his retirement after 39 years with the company is effective tomorrow. Vince's contributions have helped shape the company that we are today and will continue to be reflected in the numerous employees that he has mentored throughout his career.

I also would like to echo Richard's comment about Vince and thank him for his contribution and mentorship. 
The focus of my comments today will be to provide an update on our business segments, including additional color on full year 2016 performance and initial thoughts on fiscal 2017. 
I'll start with our coffee business, which far exceeded expectations for the year. Net sales were up 8% and segment profit increased 18% to $646 million, representing a full recovery of the segment profit decline in the prior year. This outperformance was driven by several factors, including the successful launch of Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups, the implementation of the planned Folgers canister downsize, a moderation in competitive activities and the net benefit of lower commodity cost and pricing. 
Providing lower pricing on Folgers roast and ground coffee resulted in improved performance for our mainstream coffee business in 2016. Tonnage for our mainstream brands was up 3%, while units shipped were up even more given the canister downsize early in the fiscal year. In addition, our dollar share within the mainstream segment of the coffee category increased nearly 2 share points to 55% for the latest 52-week period. 
We anticipate momentum in the coffee business to continue in 2017. Key initiatives include Folgers sponsorship of the U.S. Olympic team for the upcoming Rio games with marketing activities already underway. In addition, last month, we implemented a 6% list price decline across much of our coffee portfolio, reflecting sustained lower green coffee costs. These lower costs have been reflected in promotional pricing for the past several quarters, and we do not anticipate promoted prices changing significantly. 
With regards to Folgers K-Cups, in 2016, the brand was impacted by the ongoing proliferation of entrants in the K-Cups space, including our introduction of Dunkin' K-Cups. This year, we will invest further in the product line to improve trends, including lower pricing and new packaging that will leverage the iconic Folgers Red Can brand equity. 
Turning to the Dunkin' Donuts brand. Dunkin' K-Cups achieved nearly $220 million in retail sales for the latest 52-week scan period and gained a 6% dollar share of the K-Cup market, giving us an overall share of nearly 15% in the K-Cup segment. In its first year on the market, the Dunkin' Donuts original SKU has become the #1 K-Cup item in the channels in which we participate. As consumer repeat rates remain strong and with opportunities to introduce additional variety, we anticipate further growth in 2017. 
While challenged for much of 2016, performance improved for Dunkin' Donuts bagged coffee during the fourth quarter. Supported by favorable input costs, we have sharpened pricing to improve gaps to key competitors, and we look for positive volume trends to continue. 
Lastly, within coffee, the Café Bustelo brand experienced a second consecutive year of double-digit sales growth behind strong performance for both roast and ground and K-Cup offerings. This exciting on-trend brand remains well received by millennials, and its growth is expected to continue also in 2017. 
Turning to consumer foods. Net sales declined 3% for the year, mostly due to lapping sales from the divested canned milk business. Segment profit was flat to prior year, supported by the gain on the milk business sale, which offset planned increases in manufacturing overhead costs. 
Looking briefly at the key brands, we are pleased with the overall performance of our spreads business as both Jif Peanut Butter and Smucker's Fruit Spreads grew volume share over the latest 52-week period. In addition, Smucker's Uncrustables Frozen Sandwiches had another strong year with volume up 26%, including a 17th consecutive quarter of double-digit volume growth in this most recent fourth quarter. 
On-trend innovation continues to be a focus area for the iconic Jif and Smucker's brands. In fiscal 2017, we look to build on recent successful launches, such as Smucker's Fruit & Honey Fruit Spreads and Jif Snack Bars. This includes the upcoming introduction of new snack bar varieties and plans to expand into other snacking platforms. In addition, Jif, Smucker's and Uncrustables are all participating in the 2016 Olympics sponsorship, which will be an integral part of this year's marketing efforts for the brands. 
In the bake aisle, the overall category remains challenged throughout much of this past year, reflecting changing consumer preferences and aggressive competitive pricing. Our focus remains on providing value-added innovation, such as our recent gluten-free and simple ingredient offerings. 
We are also excited to announce a licensing arrangement with the Girl Scouts of America. Under this agreement, we are launching new Pillsbury items featuring iconic Girl Scouts cookie flavors. 
Within Natural Foods, our leading R.W. Knudsen Family and Santa Cruz Organic brands both achieved solid sales growth in 2016. The key Natural Foods categories in which our brands participate are growing, which gives us confidence in maintaining our momentum in this business. We are also excited about our recent investment in the Numi brand and the opportunities this provides in the organic tea category. 
Under our first year of ownership, Pet Foods segment profit of $392 million was generally in line with expectations. Net sales of $2.25 billion fell 1% short of the projections provided at our October Investor Day due to competitive challenges in mainstream dry dog food. For the year, mainstream Pet Food sales decreased mid-single digit, reflecting double-digit declines in dog food and a low single-digit decline for the larger cat food business. Offsetting the lower mainstream sales was the strong performance of our pet snacks business, which was up mid-single digits over the prior year, and our premium pet food brands, which grew double digits behind expanded distribution of the Natural Balance brand. 
As we enter 2017, we anticipate continued growth for Natural Balance as we launch the brand's first national marketing campaign, along with additional in-store support. Within pet snacks, innovation for the Milk-Bone and Meow Mix brands were key contributors to 2016 results, and we expect to see on these -- to build on these trends with new product introduction this fiscal year. We also continue to focus on opportunities in mainstream pet food, driven by consumer preference for additional protein and natural ingredients. 
Lastly, within the segment, we are excited about our partnership and planned in-store activities related to the animated film, The Secret Life of Pets, which will be in theaters next month. 
Turning to International and Foodservice. We are pleased with the full year results despite the significant top and bottom line impacts of foreign currency. Reported net sales were in line with the prior year as the addition of the Pet Food business and the benefit of higher net pricing in Canada offset a $60 million top line impact related to foreign exchange. Segment profit was up 12%, mostly attributable -- Foodservice. The introduction of Smucker's Uncrustables into school lunch programs contributed to this growth. The strong underlying performance of our Canadian business was mostly offset by the impact of foreign exchange. 
Let me conclude with an update on our integration and cost-savings activities. We successfully achieved our March 1 integration milestone for the Pet Food business and recognized just over $35 million in synergies for 2016. In addition, we have clear visibility and confidence in realizing an incremental $100 million in synergies this fiscal year. In total, this would provide approximately $135 million in synergies for 2017. 
Looking ahead, we remain confident in achieving our original goal of $200 million in annual synergies by the end of fiscal 2018. In addition to the $200 million of synergies, we are targeting $50 million of incremental annual cost savings to be fully realized over the next few years. Related projects include further optimizing our manufacturing footprint as, over the next 18 months, we will close a coffee facility in Harahan, Louisiana, and 2 leased Natural Foods facilities located in Livermore, California, with production being consolidated into existing operation. In addition, we are nearly complete with an organizational redesign aimed at further optimizing corporate resources contributing to this cost-savings target. 
We expect to initially invest much of these incremental savings in several identified areas. We will continue to prioritize investments that generate top and bottom line growth for key on-trend platforms. In fiscal 2017, these include opportunities related to Smucker's Uncrustables, coffee and snacks. 
We are also establishing a new growth and innovation organization, which is being led by a member of my leadership team. The group is being tasked with further building capabilities related to consumer and market insight; digital; innovation; targeted market development strategies for our customers, including pricing and trade spend optimization. Lastly, we plan to invest in new growth opportunities to expand our presence in China. 
In closing, 2016 was a historic year for our company, and I would like to thank our employees for their effort. As we enter 2017, key priorities include achieving our synergy goals, building on our product innovation activities and investing in new capabilities to enhance future growth. 
Overall, we remain confident in our long-term strategy, the strength of our brands and our ability to deliver shareholder value in 2017 and beyond. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark Belgya."

Smucker Company","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I will begin by providing commentary on our fourth quarter results, followed by 2016 cash flow performance and ending with our 2017 outlook. We concluded the fiscal year with strong fourth quarter earning. No",1562,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I will begin by providing commentary on our fourth quarter results, followed by 2016 cash flow performance and ending with our 2017 outlook. 
We concluded the fiscal year with strong fourth quarter earning. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.86 for the quarter, including a onetime $0.42 per share noncash deferred tax benefit related to the integration of Big Heart into the Smucker company as was previewed during our third quarter call. This strong finish to the year was mostly attributable to coffee, including higher-than-anticipated volume across our mainstream and premium coffee brand and a favorable price-to-cost relationship. 
The comparison of fourth quarter earnings between years is significantly impacted by onetime items reported in each of the respective period. These include the deferred tax benefit in the current year as well as the Big Heart acquisition and financing-related activities in the prior year. As a result, the remainder of my fourth quarter commentary will be focused on the business segment. 
Beginning with coffee. Fourth quarter net sales grew 9% as favorable volume/mix of 13% was only partially offset by lower net pricing. Sales for the Dunkin' Donuts brand doubled over the prior year with K-Cups driving much of this growth. Double-digit gains for bagging Dunkin' Donut coffee also contributed. 
For the Folgers brand, net sales declined 5% attributable to lower net price realization. And lastly, Café Bustelo sales were up 28% as the momentum for this brand continues. 
Segment profit increased $43 million or 39%. We recognized lower green coffee costs in the quarter, which were partially offset by lower net pricing. In addition, higher volume/mix more than offset increased marketing. 
Turning to consumer foods. Net sales were up 5% excluding the impact of the canned milk divestiture with gains across the majority of our key brands. Sales for Jif grew 14% behind higher volume and net pricing, while the Smucker's brand was up 3% as Uncrustables had another strong quarter. 
In the bake aisle, sales for Crisco increased 6%, driven by higher volume. And lastly, sales for the Pillsbury brand were up modestly as higher price realization offset volume decline. 
Segment profit declined 6% mostly attributable to lapping the prior year earnings of the divested milk business. Planned increases in manufacturing overhead costs also contributed, reflecting the new peanut butter facility in Memphis as well as underabsorbed overhead costs related to our working capital initiatives. These factors offset lower marketing expense. 
Net sales for our U.S. Retail Pet Food segments was $563 million. We estimate this represents an approximate 3% increase compared to the prior year fourth quarter, of which 6 weeks were reported under our ownership. 
Sales from our premium pet brands improved low double digits driven by Natural Balance, while pet snacks sales increased in line with the overall segment. Mainstream pet food sales were flat compared to the prior year as growth in our cat food brands offset declines in dog food. 
Pet Food segment profit was $117 million for the quarter. As expected, we realized a sequential increase in segment profit margin from 17% in the third quarter to 20.7% this quarter, primarily reflecting lower marketing expense. Incremental synergy recognition also contributed. 
Net sales for International and Foodservice increased 1% in the quarter, reflecting higher volume/mix in Foodservice. In Canada, the addition of pet food was essentially offset by the impact of FX. Segment profit was up 8% over the prior year, driven by our Foodservice business, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange in Canada. 
Free cash flow was $295 million for the quarter, bringing the 2016 total to $1.26 billion. The outperformance compared to our most recent free cash flow guidance of $975 million was attributable to exceeding our 2016 working capital improvement target, lower-than-projected CapEx spending, a fourth quarter tax refund of $53 million, which is separate from the deferred tax adjustment impacting earning and higher net income. 
Expanding on our working capital initiatives. In 2016, we realized the majority of our finished goods inventory reduction goal of $200 million nearly a year ahead of schedule. In 2017, we expect to achieve the remainder of the inventory reduction target along with modest working capital improvements related to accounts payable and receivables, all of which are factored into our 2017 free cash flow outlook I will discuss in a moment. 
We ended the year with debt of $5.4 billion. Based on 2016 EBITDA of $1.58 billion, our leverage stood at 3.4x at April 30, a reduction from 4.1x at the beginning of the year. In addition to exceeding our debt paydown target for the year, we were able to restart share repurchase activities, aided by the strong free cash flow and proceeds from the divestiture of the milk business. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased nearly 3% of shares outstanding for approximately $430 million. In 2017, the lower share count will offset the EPS impact of the 8 months of lost profit related to the divested milk business. 
Turning to our 2017 outlook, we anticipate reported net sales to decrease by 1% compared to the prior year as we will lap approximately $150 million in sales related to the milk divestiture. Excluding this impact, net sales are projected to be up 1%. Favorable volume/mix across each of the segments, including the benefit of new products, is expected to be mostly offset by lower pricing in U.S. Retail Coffee and the FX in Canada. 
Approximately $25 million of the incremental $100 million of synergies for 2017 are expected to benefit gross profit. Overall commodity costs are anticipated to be lower. However, our Canadian business is estimating a COGS headwind of $20 million related to FX, of which, unfortunately, we expect to be offset. As a result, we expect gross margin to approximate 39% in 2017. 
Further, SD&A expenses are projected to be comparable with the prior year. This reflects the benefit of incremental synergies related to headcount reductions and other administrative cost savings offset by increased marketing in support of recently launched product, our Olympic sponsorship, innovation and regulatory expenses. 
We're projecting non-GAAP operating income growth of 4% in 2017 compared to $1.465 billion in the prior year, which excludes amortization and the prior year gain on sales of $25 million. Further, excluding the $32 million of profit in last year's operating income [ph] related to the divested milk business, the growth would be 6%. 
Below operating income, we expect net interest expense of approximately $165 million and a tax rate of 34%. And lastly, a weighted average share count of 116.6 million shares was used based on current shares outstanding. 
Factoring in all of this, we're guiding 2017 adjusted EPS in the range of $7.60 to $7.75, which excludes $1.18 per share of estimated noncash amortization. 
Including the amortization, this yields a range of $6.42 to $6.57 compared to a 2016 base of $6. This results in year-over-year increases ranging from 7% to 10%. 
As illustrated on the document posted on our website, we derived the $6 EPS for 2016 by subtracting the $0.42 deferred tax adjustment and the $0.15 milk gain from our reported non-GAAP EPS of $6.57. We anticipate much of the EPS growth for the year to be weighted towards the middle 2 quarters of the fiscal year due to certain factors. Last year's first quarter included the launch of Dunkin' K-Cups. Also within coffee, this year's first quarter will be unfavorably impacted due to timing associated with the full quarter impact of the price decrease taken in July of 2015 along with the additional price decline taken in May of this year as compared to the recognition of lower cost. Other factors impacting quarterly comparison include the timing of synergy recognition; the timing impact related to trade spend recognition on a quarterly basis; and finally, the fourth quarter comparison to this year's strong fourth quarter finish. 
Looking briefly at the segment. Coffee profits are projected to be comparable to the record fiscal 2015 level. For Consumer Foods, reported segment profit is expected to be down given the prior year gain on the milk divestiture and the lost milk profit but up mid-single digits when these items are excluded. 
Pet Food segment profit is also projected to be up mid-single digits, reflecting incremental synergies and organic growth, including the contributions of new product. 
And lastly, International and Foodservice is anticipated to be down, primarily reflecting the net impact of FX in Canada. 
We project free cash flow will approximate $1 billion from which we plan to pay down debt and further reduce leverage to 3.1x by the end of this fiscal year. This assumes projected 2017 EBITDA of a dollar -- $1.63 billion. 
Additional assumptions related to 2017 include amortization expense of nearly $210 million; depreciation of $215 million; share-based compensation expense of $35 million; capital expenditures of $240 million; and lastly, onetime costs of $100 million, which are mostly cash related. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our overall performance in 2016 as it marked a memorable year in our company's history. It is with this momentum and excitement that we look forward to executing our plans for 2017 as we remain focused on delivering continued growth.

So I'm just trying to get a sense of what leads to the, call it, that 8% at the midpoint type of growth range. Is it just conservatism? Is it coffee outperformed pretty dramatically this year, and therefore, we need to just tailor that back a little bit in our expectations for '17 or things that I haven't mentioned?

Where we'll land in sort of that 8% is we are having a significant increase in marketing spend for the coming year, obviously, with the sponsorship of the Olympics and reestablishing some of the marketing spend from this year. So that is the biggest driver. I think, in terms of the coffee, I would put that more in the category of where we might land in the range. Obviously, we need to have strong year, and we need things to continue. We feel good about that, but that's probably a factor that comes into play a little bit as well. And then the other one, probably to a lesser degree, is just the FX impact. As I mentioned, we're having about a $20 million headwind, and we hope to cover at least half of that, but there's a little bit of that affecting as well."

Wanted to ask a follow-up on Andrew's question on the guidance. So Mark, a different way to look at this would be to say that, that $100 million of synergies, I think, that number alone gets you something like $0.57 a share in incremental EPS benefit in 2017, and that gets you to kind of the top end of the range. So maybe -- could you try to answer just slightly differently and just say that if synergies kind of gets you just to the top end of the range, doesn't it suggest that the rest of the operations are really, on balance, flattish? I know there's a share count benefit, there's a milk -- there's milk dilution that goes on in there, but it still just seems like the underlying expectation of the core ex the synergies is basically flat."

So we feel very comfortable to be able to invest those marketing dollar back in the business. So there's a little bit of a discussion here on whether or not the business is flat from a performance perspective or it's flat because we've invested in the marketing. We would choose the latter saying that the market increase is offsetting some of that to some degree. The other thing is, as, I think, Mark suggested in his scripted comments is that we're also investing in innovation and growth in -- also in China. So obviously, those dollars are embedded in the business portion of it when you just separate it between synergy and nonsynergy. So you can draw the conclusion it's coming from the business, but those are the 2 or 3 factors: marketing, innovation and investment in China, and a little bit of FX, as I mentioned, that are really kind of bringing that number back down."

I'm not complaining, by the way.

If you think about the numbers, we did get there a year or 2 ahead of what we guided. And we got there on 2 things, really. And the most obvious one is this, the launch of Dunkin' K-Cups, and we all know that was one of the best launches in consumer products in the last 5 [indiscernible]. So that was a wonderful performance. But really, more importantly, financially, if you look at the performance of our core Red Can business, and that's an effort that started 2 years ago. I mean, in the year that we struggled in our coffee business, Mark and his team went back and did the downsize and started those processes. And then, we had an opportunity in this last year to get coffee pricing right, to have both a manufacturing and a hedging strategy to get this thing -- to get it to price points that both excited the retailer and the consumer. And the retailer's a key piece of this. You got to get that merchandising support. So we're really pleased with where we are there. I think, you saw -- I'm sure you saw there our press release on pricing that we just took. So with all of that behind us, we feel pretty comfortable that we can repeat that performance. And to your comment earlier, that will be repeating a record performance. We actually beat the 2014 number this year, right. So on our Red Can and our core business and our Dunkin' business, we feel -- or our Dunkin' K-Cup business, we feel really good. So a loss in that, though, year was the 2 segments that didn't perform as well as we wanted to. And that's our business in premium and our legacy K-Cup, our Folgers K-Cup business. So what we intend to do this year is do the same things to those. And so the pricing, we leaned in early on, on the Dunkin' bag business. You saw some of that performance in the fourth quarter. We feel great about that going into this quarter. So we need to put ourselves back on premium growth momentum. We will invest to do that, and we need to make sure as the K-Cup segment shakes out, and it will shake out, I mean, there's so many new items, there's so much going on there, that the velocities on our core legacy items are strong, and we invested right at the end of the quarter in that as well. So I guess, what I'm saying, we feel comfortable we can repeat the record results in Red Can, the Dunkin' K-Cup business will be very solid this year. And then, with what we have extra on there, we're going to invest in those other 2 segments. So I would hope we come out of the coffee business firing on all cylinders versus firing just on those 2 big ones next year [ph]."

And then maybe Mark can help me on how we look at the seasonality of the profits. If you go back to the fourth quarter of 2014 when coffee prices hit like $2.20 a pound, right, Arabica. Then we saw it come down basically $1 a pound over that time. It's bumped up in the last day or so a little bit. But if you think about that, the fastest most efficient way to get that pricing to the consumer was with trade. Okay. We can impact shelf price on a promoted period immediately with trade. Okay? So in the short term, that's very efficient. In the long term, it's very inefficient because it promotes all kinds of buying  and loading all this inefficiency in the system, right. So over the last year, we've taken a couple of list price declines to mitigate that, to make the promotional allowance depth less. So we leaned in to current coffee pricing on our promotional price points. And now, this has allowed us to sort of drain that out, get a better list price to promoted price ratio so that our everyday prices get better and we maintain the current prices. So we tried to make that clear in the release that we did and give a little more clarity on that this time so that the costs have been reflected in total coffee pricing. This is -- this makes -- does it I think over the long term in a more efficient manner."

But it does appear, I think, our team is -- there's going to be great Arabica crop this year, and so we think that coffee will trade in a price range that supports where we're priced between our position and our opinion. The good thing about this business is we have pricing capabilities here. And not only do we have good coverage, but we have the ability to move price should we need to. So we feel pretty good about this. The Arabica crop as it goes forward -- Robusta might be a little tighter.

So a couple things, as you know, as you think about our performance historically, it's been very good. And we have had, historically, a very strong cost discipline in multiple areas of our business. Part of what we've embarked on, which really was -- the catalyst was the Big Heart acquisition, was to think a little bit deeper about our overall cost-savings initiatives and how we might maybe do a little bit better. You are right that our productivity measures versus our peers are probably better in many cases. And we are generally leaner, I would say, than some of our peers. But having said that, we have an obligation, obviously, to our shareholders to make sure that we have the best cost discipline that we can have. And so what we've been doing, and this is part of the explanation of the $50 million, is on an ongoing basis making sure from a continuous improvement that we have the discipline in our supply chain, our operations, our purchasing and, longer term as we think about how do we get more efficient in trade, all of those things should help drive, what I would call, some incremental savings to the bottom line. So it isn't -- we don't think about it as a onetime benefit. But we are comfortable that we can, at least, deliver that, and then beyond these next couple years, we should be able to continue to deliver annual cost-savings objectives, which we hold our teams to. The good news about that is it is, as Richard mentioned, it is allowing us to invest and enhance capability, and at a very high level, what those capabilities are focused on is getting better at engaging with our consumer and getting better at engaging with our retail customers. And so strategically, having the right balance between our leading #1 brand, which are really the engine that fuel our growth as well as having the right emerging brands in our portfolio is part of that strategy. And so making sure that we have dollars that can fund those enhanced capabilities, both in consumer engagement and customer engagement, is really going to help drive our growth, both top and bottom line long term."

I think it's difficult to think the coffee category was one brush competitively. I think, the prepared remarks probably were focused more on our mainstream Red Can business, right. And I do think we've seen, well, with Arabica falling, with the coffee prices falling where they are, we have found that price points have gotten down into those ranges where it motivates both the competitor and the consumer and the customer, right. So all of us are in price points that really work, okay. And so we're back in that zone, and I think everybody is operating in that zone. Now having said that, I would argue that the premium segment was maybe the most competitive we've ever seen it last year. And so the Dunkin' bag business, as you know, early in the year, had a couple of tough quarters. And we've talked about how we leaned into that in the fourth quarter. Premium green is another remnant for a whole nother discussion. But green coffee is not all the same. There's the coffee that goes into a lot of premium coffees. There's a much longer supply chain. You might expect lower -- coffee cost to impact us at different timing based on the type of green that it is. So in the fourth quarter that we were in a position to support that, we did, and it has responded. So if you think about it, the core Red Can pricing had moderated. Our competitive set had moderated. The premium business probably is in that space now. And the last piece will be K-Cups, and we're going to lean into K-Cups. The proliferation of K-Cups has caused that whole segment to be competing for a slower-growth base. And one of the levers that's been used in there is price. We're able now to compete in that area. But that's for the -- maybe the last piece of the puzzle. And we feel good about the plan we put in front of you today will give us the dollars to support that and return that business to growth."

Steve, so, Starbucks, our sales [ph] there in January, you talked about -- pretty much implied to threaten to walk away from Keurig, JAB. And then the April call, you came out and said, at least, 3 or 4x in the conference call that they have been able to renegotiate terms at very favorable terms with Keurig and that those terms gave them also more flexibility. So I'm wondering here, if Starbucks can do that with JAB, why can't Smucker's? So if you can comment on that. I'm just surprised that they were able to renegotiate terms now there was a change in ownership there, and, apparently, you haven't. Related to that, I understand the idea of sharpening price points for Folgers and K-Cups. The category has been sticky, of course, while ground moves quite a bit. But as you do that, are we expecting our competitors to also cut prices in their K-Cup brands? And then K-Cups, as a category, will become, not sticky but passthrough as ground. So I see a bit of a risk there. If you can comment on that, please."

So just different companies manage those things differently, right. So that process is in process, and we feel good about that relationship. They are committed to have the major brands in the category in their systems. And we read the same things you read, so our assumptions are -- going into those negotiations, our assumptions are similar to yours. So we feel fine there. And with regards to K-Cups, if you dig a little deeper into the IRI or Nielsen data, you'll see that K-Cups -- although we don't passthrough green -- because green's kind of a small portion of the overall cost structure, it's become maybe the most promoted category in total cost. So there's the highest reliant -- each one of those brands relies very heavily on promotion. So maybe I'm not clear enough when I talk about leaning in. We've leaned in on our promotional price point mostly. And so those promotional price points are basically down $1 a box from where they used to be. It still means -- it's still a very profitable business. But that migration has already -- that train's already left. So we are where we are. We might have been a little late to follow because of the momentum we had from the Dunkin' business."

I think as Barry mentioned, we are going to continue bonus bags and things like that, that might have a little bit of effect on gross profit. And then, of course, I think, as we said over time, of the 3 segments of the business, the natural has the lowest profitability. And I think Barry and his team worked -- and as well if you integrate that into the overall Smucker companies, there's probably an opportunity there as well."

I don't think we really can give you any more color other than to say that as we -- this was a huge year. And not only did we make the largest acquisition in our history, but that acquisition was, again, the catalyst to sort of think about things like are we going to market in the most efficient way. Do we have the right capabilities to engage our consumer and our customer? We recently opened our innovation center, which is very much all about our customer retail partners. And so the long and short of it is, as we looked at our organization, we took some opportunity across not only our commercial functions, which would be sales and marketing and thinking about how we would organize those differently, but we looked across our supply chain network, our finance organization, our -- some of our administrative functions as well just to make sure that we were running them in the most efficient way. I would say that one of the key things is that -- as I mentioned in the script, we have an individual from Big Heart who is leading our growth and innovation organization. And so we are putting sort of a renewed focus on -- not that we haven't. We've done a good job on innovation but making sure that our muscle, where we're building muscle is really around innovation longer term and making sure that our understanding of the consumer is sharp and that we can act against insights that we are learning about the consumer as we go forward. So I think that's probably it."

I mean, I'll start and Richard or Mark, if you want to add more from a strategic perspective. But as we look at our deployment of cash coming out of the deal last year, we, obviously, emphasized the importance of paying down debt over the course of 3 to 5 years, which we've made great progress on, and as I said earlier, it allowed us to get back into repurchasing shares. We feel very comfortable with the $1 billion of free cash flow that we'll be able to continue that debt paydown planned, obviously, continue our dividend payout policies. And it allows us a little bit of flexibility as strategic options come in. So whether that's M&A -- again, I don't think we're looking at a huge transformational like a pet, at least from a leverage perspective. But certainly, there's M&A opportunity as well as buyback. And I think, buybacks are situational. So we traditionally do not build that into our plan. But if you ask me what is one of the opportunities for any upside of that range, you'd have to throw buyback as an opportunity in there."

So it sounds like you said in your commentary that adjusted operating profit will be growing about 4%. And I know if we kind of like use that 116.6 million in your diluted shares outstanding, that implies about another 2.5%. So that gets me to 6.5% EPS growth in '17. Is the assumption here that there are other kind of below-the-line -- like the tax rate could be a little bit better, interest rate comes down a little bit or the interest expense comes down a little bit. And then lastly, if we look at the shares you bought back in Q4, really, in fiscal '16, I mean, that's the most amount you've ever spent on a buyback outside of fiscal '14. So could there be additional cash outlays in '17 to incremental buybacks even though you might not have as many of the onetime benefits on your working cap?"

The simple math would say 4% plus operating profit growth, 3% shares and 1 point in tax and interest. So that kind of gets you to the 8%. In terms of buyback, what we've guided indirectly -- we have conversations, particularly with rating agencies. We kind of use a 2% as a long-term model. So that's a 2% buyback. So obviously, at a 116 million shares of -- 2.2 share -- 2.2 million shares. So that, as I said on your earlier question, we don't factor that into our plans. I would say our cash deployment would allow a portion of that, maybe not the whole 2% without pushing the leverage target we're going after. But certainly -- and again, it's situational. So I don't want to sit here and say, we're going out and buy it. But if the opportunity were right, I believe we have the cash to do it, and then obviously, it would be incremental. Certainly, when we do it in the year, we'll have less of an impact to do further into the year. But that's the beauty of being the leverage where we want it to be. It's the flexibility."

As we look to continue the momentum from a historic fiscal 2016, we are pleased to have delivered a strong first quarter earnings performance. These results reflect our team's ability to execute and deliver our 2017 financial plan while building for the future. This balance is critical since delivering the core business and achieving our targets for synergies, cost savings and working capital supports our development of new capabilities and the continued growth of key brands and on-trend platforms. Ultimately,, this will allow us to meet our long-term objectives for top and bottom line growth and deliver against our consumer-centric corporate vision as we look to further engage, delight and inspire our consumers. 
With that background, let me provide a brief overview of first quarter results. Excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange, net sales decreased 5% compared to 2016. This decline was largely planned due to a cumulative 12% list price decrease for coffee across most of the quarter and lapping the prior year rollout of Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups. Lower pet food sales also contributed. Adjusted operating income was up 2% as the lower net sales were more than offset by a decrease in commodity cost and incremental synergies. Aided by a more normalized tax rate as compared to the previous year and a decrease in shares, adjusted earnings per share grew 16% to $1.86. Free cash flow was $189 million, a portion, of which was used during the quarter to further reduce our net borrowed position. In addition, last month, we announced a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend rate. While net sales fell slightly short of our projection for the quarter, earnings per share exceeded our expectations. This was mostly attributable to higher-than-anticipated segment profit for coffee and lower-than-anticipated spending in a number of areas. As a portion of the over-delivery is expected to be timing-related, including projected year-over-year increases in marketing spend shifting to the remaining 3 quarters, we remain on track to achieve our previously stated full year guidance for adjusted earnings per share. That said, we expect softness in pet food sales to continue in the near term, leading us to adjust our full year sales guidance, as Mark will discuss in a moment. 
Let me now provide additional comments on our U.S. Retail businesses. We were pleased with the start of the fiscal year for our Coffee business. Profitability was in line with the strong first quarter of 2016 despite the anticipated top line impact of price declines and lapping the prior year launch of Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups. Volume gains for Folgers roast and ground coffee continued in the first quarter, reflecting consumer response to lower price points. Tonnage for our mainstream brands is up 3%, while unit shift were up even more given the prior year canister downsize was not fully lapped until late in the quarter. Folgers K-Cup volume trends improved in the quarter, responding favorably to planned price investments. In addition, we are currently rolling out new K-Cup packaging that leverages the iconic Folgers Red Can brand equity, providing additional support for the product line. For the Dunkin' Donuts brand, we are pleased with the continued consumption growth for our K-Cup offerings, with over $230 million in retail sales for the latest 52-week scan period. While shipments were down significantly in the first quarter, as expected to to the prior year sell-in, we project volume growth for the remaining 9 months, including contributions from new varieties. In addition, volumes for Dunkin' bagged coffee was up 4% in the first quarter, and we expect positive trends to continue as lower prices, supported by favorable input costs, have improved the competitive positioning of the brand. 
Turning to Consumer Foods. First quarter net sales were consistent with our expectations. Across many of our key brands and categories, volume was in line, or in several cases up, compared to the prior year. In addition, our brands maintained or grew both volume and dollar share in the latest 12-week scan period for most of the food categories in which we participate. For the first time in 5 years, volume for Smucker's Uncrustables Frozen Sandwiches experienced a quarterly decline. However, this was related to timing of customer shipments that have already rebounded in August. Overall consumption trends remain strong, and we continue to expect double-digit growth for the full year. In addition, Uncrustables remain a key growth driver for our Foodservice business where volume for the brand was up 40% during the first quarter. For the pet food segment, first quarter sales performance was below our projection. We have revised our full year outlook as we expect this softness to continue in the near term. Our teams are focused on the key factors impacting current performance and are already executing on opportunities to provide future growth. Specifically, improving the performance of our mainstream dog and cat brands remains a key area of focus. We have introduced bonus bags for Kibbles 'n Bits, supported by lower input costs, which entered the market in late June. We expect this will help moderate declines for the brand. We also have plans to introduce new packaging later this fiscal year and enhance brand support, consistent with its heritage around taste and fun to further improve the competitive positioning of Kibbles 'n Bits. In the cat segment, we remain encouraged by the strong equity of the Meow Mix brand. With recent innovation, a new television advertising campaign that began this month and upcoming pricing support, we are confident in our ability to reverse recent softness in this business. In addition to these areas, we continue to progress on whitespace opportunities in mainstream pet food, driven by consumer preference for additional protein and natural ingredient options. Looking at the rest of the Pet Food business, sales for pet snacks were up 2% in the quarter, on top of a 9% increase in the prior year, and were a key driver of overall category growth. Our category leadership in pet snacks and innovation, particularly for the Milk-Bone and Meow Mix brands, continues to be an important component of results. Within premium pet food, sales for the Natural Balance brand were down as we lapped the pipeline fill associated with distribution gains in last year's first quarter. While consumer takeaway for the brand remains strong, we are tempering our near-term growth expectations for our premium brands given the recent softness in the overall pet superstore channel. 
Lastly, as it relates to our Pet Food business and broader organization, let me provide a brief update on our synergy and cost-savings activities, which remain on track. In the first quarter, we realized $32 million of incremental synergies, approximately 25% of which benefited gross profit with the rest related to SD&A savings. We continue to anticipate $100 million of incremental synergies for the full fiscal year, which would bring our total to nearly $140 million of the $200 million targeted by the end of fiscal 2018. In addition, we continue to target $50 million of annual cost savings to be fully realized over the next few years related to our organizational redesign program and the previously announced plant closures. As we have indicated, we expect to initially invest much of these incremental savings in several identified areas to support top and bottom line growth. 
In closing, I would like to thank our employees for their continued efforts towards delivering the core business, building on our product innovation activities and marketing support, expanding our capabilities to enhance future growth and achieving our synergy and cost-savings goals. This strong execution continues to position the company well for 2017 and beyond. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark Belgya."

Smucker Company","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.

The prior year divestitu",1428,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I will begin by providing additional color on our first quarter results and then conclude with our outlook for the full year. 
Net sales decreased by $136 million or 7% in the quarter. The prior year divestiture of the canned milk business detracted 2 percentage points, while lower net price realization, which was mostly attributable to coffee, had a 4-point impact. Volume and mix combined to subtract 1 percentage point, reflecting declines in pet food. The impact of foreign exchange was immaterial to consolidated results. GAAP earnings per share were $1.46 this quarter, 28% above the prior year. Included in GAAP earnings were $8 million of unallocated derivative gain compared to a loss of $10 million last year. In addition, GAAP earnings for both the current and prior year included $26 million of special project cost related to merger and integration and restructuring activities, along with just over $50 million of amortization expense related to intangible assets. Excluding all of these items, adjusted EPS was $1.86, for an increase of 16%. 
Adjusted gross profit declined at a slower rate than sales, resulting in a 160 basis point improvement in gross margin to 39.6%, representing the highest quarterly gross margin percentage since 2011. Year-over-year gross margin expansion was realized by all of our reportable segments, most notably for coffee. Overall commodity costs were lower in the quarter, driven by green coffee and mostly offset the lower net pricing. In addition, $8 million of the incremental synergies in the first quarter contributed to gross margin growth. For the full year, we now anticipate gross margin to be approximately 50 basis points higher than our previous guidance of 39%. 
SD&A decreased $32 million in the first quarter or 8% compared to 2016, mostly attributable to synergies. Lower royalties associated with the Dunkin' donuts business also contributed to reduced selling costs. Excluding the benefits of synergy, marketing spend was in line with the prior year, but 13% lower than forecasted for the quarter. Factoring all of this in, adjusted operating income was up $8 million or 2% compared to the prior year, with operating margin increasing 180 basis points to 20%. Below the line, lower income tax expense and a decrease in a number of shares outstanding were key drivers of the earnings per share growth. As a reminder, the effective tax rate for the prior year first quarter was unusually high due to deferred state tax adjustments. In addition, the current year first quarter rate was slightly lower than anticipated. As a result, we now expect the full year rate to approximate 33.5% compared to our previous guidance of 34%. 
Let me provide a brief overview of segment results beginning with coffee. First quarter net sales decreased 9% due to lower net price realization as the net impact of volume and mix was neutral in the quarter. Lower pricing reflected a full quarter impact of the 6% price decline taken in July 2015, along with the additional 6% decrease taken in mid-May of this year. Incremental price [indiscernible] Folgers K-Cup and Dunkin' Donuts bagged coffee also contributed. 
Net sales for the Folgers brand declined 8% as the lower net price realization was partially offset by mainstream roast and ground volume growth. For the Dunkin' Donuts brand, sales were down 14%, reflecting both lower pricing and the impact of lapping the prior year launch of Dunkin' K-Cups. Lastly, Café Bustelo sales were up 5% as the double-digit growth in volume/mix more than offset lower net pricing. 
Segment profit was flat with the prior year but exceeded expectations. Segment margin increased 310 basis points to 33.9%. The net impact of lower pricing, as compared with the recognition of lower cost, was unfavorable to segment profit in the quarter; however, to a lesser degree than originally anticipated due to timing. The price to cost impact was mostly offset by profit contributions from favorable volume/mix. And increasing marketing spend was offset by lower royalty expense associated with the Dunkin' Donuts brand. 
Turning to Consumer Foods. Net sales were down 2%, excluding the impact of the canned milk divestiture. The decline reflected lower net price realization, which was impacted by the timing of certain trade program expenses compared to the prior year. Volume/mix was flat with the prior year. 
Looking at key brands. Sales for Jif and Smucker's were down generally in line with the overall segment. In the bake aisle, sales for both the Crisco and Pillsbury brands decreased 5% as lower net pricing was partially offset by volume gains. Lastly, the Sahale Snacks brand achieved strong double-digit sales growth in the quarter, benefiting from distribution gains. Segment profit declined 7%, mostly attributable to lapping $6 million of prior year earnings related to the divested milk business. In addition, favorable input cost did not fully offset lower net price realization. 
Net sales for our pet food segment decreased 6%, reflecting unfavorable volume/mix. The lower sales were mostly driven by double-digit declines for our Natural Balance and Kibbles 'n Bits brands. Mid-single-digit declines from Meow Mix and 9Lives cat food also contributed. Sales for our pet snack portfolio were up low single digits with gains across all our key snacking brands, including Milk-Bone, Pup-Peroni, Milo's Kitchen and Canine Carry Outs. Segment profit increased 5% as the impact of unfavorable volume/mix was offset by incremental synergy realization and lower input costs. In addition, marketing spend was down double digits in the first quarter. A significant portion of the marketing impact is timing-related due to a shift of certain key marketing activities into the second quarter. We now anticipate full year pet food segment profit to be up low single digits, which is less than previously projected. 
Net sales for International and Foodservice decreased 3% in the quarter. However, excluding the impact of the canned milk divestiture and FX, net sales were in line with the prior year. Segment profit was up 9%, reflecting the net benefit of lower coffee cost and pricing along with favorable volume/mix. Partially offsetting these factors was lapping $2 million of prior year profit related to the divested milk business and unfavorable impact of foreign exchange in Canada. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $239 million for the quarter. This compares to $307 million in the prior year, which included a $50 million benefit related to the timing of tax payments and refunds. Factoring in capital expenditures of $50 million in the current year, free cash flow was $189 million in the quarter. We continue to project full year free cash flow of $1 billion, assuming CapEx of $240 million. We paid down additional $100 million on our term loan in May and ended the quarter with total debt of $5.35 billion. Based on trailing 12-month EBITDA of $1.6 billion, leverage currently stands at just over 3.3x. 
Let me now conclude with an update on our full year sales and earnings outlook. Excluding the 2 percentage point impact of the divested milk business, we now expect net sales to be in the range of flat to down 1% compared to the prior year. The reduction from our previous guidance of plus 1% is primarily attributable to lower expectations for our pet food segment as projections for the remaining businesses remain relatively unchanged. With input cost lower than originally expected in our Consumer Foods segment, along with a lower effective tax rate, we expect to offset the margin impact of the net sales shortfall. As a result, we continue to project adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.60 to $7.75 with the bias towards the middle to high end of the range. Reflecting the timing impact, which benefited first quarter results, most notably the shift in timing of marketing spend for pet foods segments, we now project our second quarter EPS will be comparable to the prior year. 
In closing, we anticipate the challenges to revenue growth in certain categories will persist in the near term as reflected in our revised sales guidance. However, our long-term expectations remain intact. As Mark indicated, we are executing on plans and initiatives to improve top line trends while investing in our capabilities to enhance future growth. At the same time, we are pleased with the earnings and cash flow performance of the company. Overall, we remain confident in achieving solid earnings growth this fiscal year and beyond.

Our coverage allowed us -- we feel very comfortable with the pricing changes that we made given the coverage that we have. Mark and Mark talked a lot about the pricing lapse and the effect on net sales in coffee for the first quarter. But as we get into the key selling season, I think we get the sharpest price points we've had in quite a while. So the merchandising is strong. The price points are good. And honestly, the coverage supports that. We would have done those things. So if we had to look at pricing change, if that happened, it would be much later in the year. And frankly, I think we have a bias that, over the next few months, we're going to get a good look at what coffee is going to end up at. I think there's a lot of coffee in the farmers field and in Brazil. Typically, the next few months will let us know where that's going to sell out. So we're in good shape until then. And given the fact that we've gone down twice over the last 12 months, I think we've got room if we had to to absorb some of that even if we [indiscernible] pricing."

We still think the brand is relevant. We've shared our marketing plans with our key retail partners. And they also believe the brand still has a relevance in that segment of dry dog food.

I guess, what I'm really trying to get after is what changed just within the last several months that caused the latest of the guide down on revenues?"

No, it's not something that we would necessarily expect we continue to be favorable input cost. I think in my comments in Consumer Foods, in particular. But in terms of the current quarter, what we saw a little bit of, and I think we mentioned this in our call in June and touched on today as well, is that in addition to the price declines we took, we also had some additional trade came through, sort of from a change in timing. So that, too, is considered price. So a combination of those 2 exceeded the net commodity cost reduction, but we wouldn't expect that to continue throughout the year. So obviously, the biggest price impact in general over a year ago hit in Q1 because of the coffee. So just a pricing impact overall would be less as we move here. We obviously still feel the 6% we took on coffee this year, but as you know, we lapped it otherwise. So little bit of anomaly. And I guess, just if I can, while I'm thinking pricing and just sales in general, I think I just a like to lay this out there, and again, I respect everyone's modeling, but if we do look at the combination of the milk and the impact of pricing that coffee had, and I guess I'm just turning back the clock a couple of months, those 2 pieces in total were probably about $90 million to $100 million first quarter sales impact. So I think in Mark's comments, we talked about our sales being just slightly below plans. So we have factored a good portion of that in. But certainly, I can understand the reaction when you see the negative 7 year-over-year. So I just wanted to call that out in additional data point for everybody."

Yes, we do actually have a new head of revenue management. In fact, one of the things that we spoke about, I think, on the last call was that some of the incremental savings that we've targeted are going to be invested in capabilities like that. That is one of several. I would describe some of the capabilities as we've sort of taken a step back and reorganize ourselves to make sure that we're building the right capabilities that relate to the consumer. And that could be things like insights and data to ensure a robust innovation pipeline as well as the customer in terms of how we do business with them and how we ensure that we're giving them the absolute best content. So revenue management would be one piece of that. And we're at the stage now where we've done a nice job of building the organization, and we're in the process of ensuring that those new organizations and functions are wired properly. And so that takes a little bit of time as we get to a full year planning and so forth. But at this point, we're very, very pleased with the leadership we have across many of our functions. And as it relates specifically to the revenue management, our goal over the next year or 2 are to begin to become increasingly more efficient in our trade spend so that we can truly drive incremental sales.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This is truly an exciting time at Smucker. As we look to continue the momentum from an historic fiscal 2016, we are pleased to have delivered a strong first quarter earnings performance. These results reflect our team's ability to execute and deliver our 2017 financial plan while building for the future. This balance is critical since delivering the core business and achieving our targets for synergies, cost savings and working capital supports our development of new capabilities and the continued growth of key brands and on-trend platforms. Ultimately, this will allow us to meet our long-term objectives for top and bottom line growth and deliver against our consumer-centric corporate vision as we look to further engage, delight and inspire our consumers. 
With that background, let me provide a brief overview of first quarter results. Excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange, net sales decreased 5% compared to 2016. This decline was largely planned due to a cumulative 12% list price decrease for coffee across most of the quarter and lapping the prior year rollout of Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups. Lower Pet Food sales also contributed. 
Adjusted operating income was up 2% as the lower net sales were more than offset by a decrease in commodity costs and incremental synergies. Aided by a more normalized tax rate as compared to the previous year and a decrease in shares, adjusted earnings per share grew 16% to $1.86. Free cash flow was $189 million, a portion of which was used during the quarter to further reduce our net borrowed position. In addition, last month, we announced a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend rate. 
While net sales fell slightly short of our projection for the quarter, earnings per share exceeded our expectations. This was mostly attributable to higher-than-anticipated segment profit for coffee and lower-than-anticipated spending in a number of areas. As a portion of the overdelivery is expected to be timing-related, including projected year-over-year increases in marketing spend shifting to the remaining 3 quarters, we remain on track to achieve our previously stated full year guidance for adjusted earnings per share. That said, we expect softness in Pet Food sales to continue in the near term, leading us to adjust our full year sales guidance, as Mark will discuss in a moment. 
Let me now provide additional comments on our U.S. Retail businesses. We were pleased with the start of the fiscal year for our coffee business. Profitability was in line with the strong first quarter of 2016 despite the anticipated top line impact of price declines and lapping the prior year launch of Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups. Volume gains for Folgers roast and ground coffee continued in the first quarter, reflecting consumer response to lower price points. Tonnage for our mainstream brands was up 3%, while units shipped were up even more given the prior year canister downsize was not fully lapped until late in the quarter. 
Folgers K-Cup volume trends improved in the quarter, responding favorably to planned price investments. In addition, we are currently rolling out new K-Cup packaging that leverages the iconic Folgers Red Can brand equity, providing additional support for the product line. 
For the Dunkin' Donuts brand, we are pleased with the continued consumption growth for our K-Cup offerings, with over $230 million in retail sales for the latest 52-week scan period. While shipments were down significantly in the first quarter as expected due to the prior year sell-in, we project volume growth for the remaining 9 months, including contributions from new varieties. In addition, volume for Dunkin' bagged coffee was up 4% in the first quarter, and we expect positive trends to continue as lower prices, supported by favorable input costs, have improved the competitive positioning of the brand. 
Turning to Consumer Foods. First quarter net sales were consistent with our expectations. Across many of our key brands and categories, volume was in line or, in several cases, up compared to the prior year. In addition, our brands maintained or grew both volume and dollar share in the latest 12-week scan period for most of the food categories in which we participate. 
For the first time in 5 years, volume for Smucker's Uncrustables frozen sandwiches experienced a quarterly decline. However, this was related to timing of customer shipments that have already rebounded in August. Overall consumption trends remained strong, and we continue to expect double-digit growth for the full year. In addition, Uncrustables remain a key growth driver for our Foodservice business where volume for the brand was up 40% during the first quarter. 
For the Pet Food segment, first quarter sales performance was below our projection. We have revised our full year outlook as we expect this softness to continue in the near term. Our teams are focused on the key factors impacting current performance and are already executing on opportunities to provide future growth. 
Specifically, improving the performance of our mainstream dog and cat brands remains a key area of focus. We have introduced bonus bags for Kibbles 'n Bits, supported by lower input costs, which entered the market in late June. We expect this will help moderate declines for the brand. We also have plans to introduce new packaging later this fiscal year and enhance brand support, consistent with its heritage around taste and fun to further improve the competitive positioning of Kibbles 'n Bits. 
In the cat segment, we remain encouraged by the strong equity of the Meow Mix brand. With recent innovation, a new television advertising campaign that began this month and upcoming pricing support, we are confident in our ability to reverse recent softness in this business. 
In addition to these areas, we continue to progress on whitespace opportunities in mainstream pet food, driven by consumer preference for additional protein and natural ingredient options. 
Looking at the rest of the Pet Food business, sales for pet snacks were up 2% in the quarter, on top of a 9% increase in the prior year, and were a key driver of overall category growth. Our category leadership in pet snacks and innovation, particularly for the Milk-Bone and Meow Mix brands, continues to be an important component of results. 
Within premium pet food, sales for the Natural Balance brand were down as we lapped the pipeline fill associated with distribution gains in last year's first quarter. While consumer takeaway for the brand remains strong, we are tempering our near-term growth expectations for our premium brands given the recent softness in the overall pet superstore channel. 
Lastly, as it relates to our Pet Food business and broader organization, let me provide a brief update on our synergy and cost-savings activities, which remain on track. In the first quarter, we realized $32 million of incremental synergies, approximately 25% of which benefited gross profit, with the rest related to SD&A savings. We continue to anticipate $100 million of incremental synergies for the full fiscal year, which would bring our total to nearly $140 million of the $200 million targeted by the end of fiscal 2018. 
In addition, we continue to target $50 million of annual cost savings to be fully realized over the next few years related to our organizational redesign program and the previously announced plant closures. As we have indicated, we expect to initially invest much of these incremental savings in several identified areas to support top and bottom line growth. 
In closing, I would like to thank our employees for their continued efforts towards delivering the core business, building on our product innovation activities and marketing support, expanding our capabilities to enhance future growth and achieving our synergy and cost-savings goals. This strong execution continues to position the company well for 2017 and beyond.

Smucker Company","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I will begin by providing additional color on our first quarter results and then conclude with our outlook for the full year. Net sales decreased by $136 million or 7% in the quarter.

I will begin by providing additional color on our first quarter results and then conclude with our outlook for the full year. 
Net sales decreased by $136 million or 7% in the quarter. The prior year divestiture of the canned milk business detracted 2 percentage points, while lower net price realization, which was mostly attributable to coffee, had a 4-point impact. Volume and mix combined to subtract 1 percentage point, reflecting declines in Pet Food. The impact of foreign exchange was immaterial to consolidated results. 
GAAP earnings per share were $1.46 this quarter, 28% above the prior year. Included in GAAP earnings were $8 million of unallocated derivative gains compared to a loss of $10 million last year. In addition, GAAP earnings for both the current and prior years included $26 million of special project costs related to merger and integration and restructuring activities, along with just over $50 million of amortization expense related to intangible assets. Excluding all of these items, adjusted EPS was $1.86 for an increase of 16%. 
Adjusted gross profit declined at a slower rate than sales, resulting in a 160 basis point improvement in gross margin to 39.6%, representing the highest quarterly gross margin percentage since 2011. Year-over-year gross margin expansion was realized by all of our reportable segments, most notably for coffee. Overall commodity costs were lower in the quarter, driven by green coffee, and mostly offset the lower net pricing. In addition, $8 million of the incremental synergies in the first quarter contributed to gross margin growth. For the full year, we now anticipate gross margin to be approximately 50 basis points higher than our previous guidance of 39%. 
SD&A decreased $32 million in the first quarter or 8% compared to 2016, mostly attributable to synergies. Lower royalties associated with the Dunkin' Donuts business also contributed to reduced selling costs. Excluding the benefits of synergy, marketing spend was in line with the prior year but 13% lower than forecasted for the quarter. Factoring all of this in, adjusted operating income was up $8 million or 2% compared to the prior year, with operating margin increasing 180 basis points to 20%. 
Below the line, lower income tax expense and a decrease in the number of shares outstanding were key drivers of the earnings per share growth. As a reminder, the effective tax rate for the prior year first quarter was unusually high due to deferred state tax adjustments. In addition, the current year first quarter rate was slightly lower than anticipated. As a result, we now expect the full year rate to approximate 33.5% compared to our previous guidance of 34%. 
Let me provide a brief overview of segment results, beginning with coffee. First quarter net sales decreased 9% due to lower net price realization as the net impact of volume and mix was neutral in the quarter. Lower pricing reflected the full quarter impact of the 6% price decline taken in July 2015, along with the additional 6% decrease taken in mid-May of this year. Incremental price support of Folgers K-Cup and Dunkin' Donuts bagged coffee also contributed. 
Net sales for the Folgers brand declined 8% as the lower net price realization was partially offset by mainstream roast and ground volume growth. For the Dunkin' Donuts brand, sales were down 14%, reflecting both lower pricing and the impact of lapping the prior year launch of Dunkin' K-Cups. Lastly, Café Bustelo sales were up 5% as double-digit growth in volume/mix more than offset lower net pricing. 
Segment profit was flat with the prior year but exceeded expectations. Segment margin increased 310 basis points to 33.9%. The net impact of lower pricing, as compared to the recognition of lower cost, was unfavorable to segment profit in the quarter, however, to a lesser degree than originally anticipated due to timing. The price-to-cost impact was mostly offset by profit contributions from favorable volume/mix. And the increase in marketing spend was offset by lower royalty expense associated with the Dunkin' Donuts brand. 
Turning to Consumer Foods. Net sales were down 2%, excluding the impact of the canned milk divestiture. The decline reflected lower net price realization, which was impacted by the timing of certain trade program expenses compared to the prior year. Volume/mix was flat with the prior year. 
Looking at key brands. Sales for Jif and Smucker's were down, generally in line with the overall segment. In the bake aisle, sales for both the Crisco and Pillsbury brands decreased 5% as lower net pricing was partially offset by volume gains. Lastly, the Sahale Snacks brand achieved strong double-digit sales growth in the quarter, benefiting from distribution gains. 
Segment profit declined 7%, mostly attributable to lapping $6 million of prior year earnings related to the divested milk business. In addition, favorable input cost did not fully offset lower net price realization. 
Net sales for our Pet Food segment decreased 6%, reflecting unfavorable volume/mix. The lower sales were mostly driven by double-digit declines for our Natural Balance and Kibbles 'n Bits brands. Mid-single-digit declines from Meow Mix and 9Lives cat food also contributed. Sales for our pet snack portfolio were up low single digits, with gains across all our key snacking brands, including Milk-Bone, Pup-Peroni, Milo's Kitchen and Canine Carry Outs. 
Segment profit increased 5% as the impact of unfavorable volume/mix was offset by incremental synergy realization and lower input costs. In addition, marketing spend was down double digits in the first quarter. A significant portion of the marketing impact is timing-related due to a shift of certain key marketing activities into the second quarter. We now anticipate full year Pet Food segment profit to be up low single digits, which is less than previously projected. 
Net sales for International and Foodservice decreased 3% in the quarter. However, excluding the impact of the canned milk divestiture and FX, net sales were in line with the prior year. Segment profit was up 9%, reflecting the net benefit of lower coffee cost and pricing along with favorable volume/mix. Partially offsetting these factors was lapping $2 million of prior year profit related to the divested milk business and unfavorable impact of foreign exchange in Canada. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $239 million for the quarter. This compares to $307 million in the prior year, which included a $50 million benefit related to the timing of tax payments and refunds. Factoring in capital expenditures of $50 million in the current year, free cash flow was $189 million in the quarter. We continue to project full year free cash flow of $1 billion, assuming CapEx of $240 million. 
We paid down an additional $100 million on our term loan in May and ended the quarter with total debt of $5.35 billion. Based on trailing 12-month EBITDA of $1.6 billion, leverage currently stands at just over 3.3x. 
Let me now conclude with an update on our full year sales and earnings outlook. Excluding the 2 percentage point impact of the divested milk business, we now expect net sales to be in the range of flat to down 1% compared to the prior year. The reduction from our previous guidance of plus 1% is primarily attributable to lower expectations for our Pet Food segment as projections for the remaining businesses remain relatively unchanged. With input costs lower than originally expected in our Consumer Foods segment, along with a lower effective tax rate, we expect to offset the margin impact of the net sales shortfall. 
As a result, we continue to project adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.60 to $7.75, with the bias towards the middle to high end of the range. Reflecting the timing impact, which benefited first quarter results, most notably the shift in timing of marketing spend for Pet Food segments, we now project our second quarter EPS will be comparable to the prior year. 
In closing, we anticipate the challenges to revenue growth in certain categories will persist in the near term, as reflected in our revised sales guidance. However, our long-term expectations remain intact. As Mark indicated, we're executing on plans and initiatives to improve top line trends while investing in our capabilities to enhance future growth. At the same time, we are pleased with the earnings and cash flow performance of the company. Overall, we remain confident in achieving solid earnings growth this fiscal year and beyond.

I think if we look at where we are today and where we were then, we wouldn't change our thoughts on the near term. Our coverage allowed us -- we felt very comfortable with the pricing changes that we made given the coverage that we have. Mark and Mark talked a lot about the pricing laps and the effect on net sales in coffee for the first quarter. But as we get into the key selling season, I think we've got the sharpest price points we've had in quite a while. So the merchandising is strong, the price points are good, and honestly, the coverage supports that or we wouldn't have done those things. So if we had to look at pricing change if that happened, it would be much later in the year. And frankly, I think we have a bias that over the next few months, we're going to get a good look at what coffee is going to end up at. I think there's a lot of coffee in the farmers' field and in Brazil, and typically, the next few months will let us know where that's going to sell out. So we're in good shape until then. And given the fact that we've gone down twice over the last 12 months, I think we've got room if we had to, to absorb some of that even if we have to do pricing."

But frankly and just my opinion, they seem a little more like Band-Aid than real sustainable fixes to the product and its positioning. So I'm just curious, in the face of these tough trends, what gives you the confidence that the issues are still only temporary? Is the strategy around dry dog still the right one? Or do you have to make more dramatic changes if things don't get fixed in the next couple of quarters?"

As you know, the Kibbles 'n Bits brand, its struggle is not just recent. That brand has been struggling over the past year or so. As we stepped into the business with a new team, we felt fundamentals had to be right, especially around pricing. So we felt that was the first thing we needed to do to fix the price on shelf. What we're seeing with the bonus bags is it is decelerating the losses that we were seeing previously. So we do think it's working. That was fundamental to fixing the business. We still think the brand is relevant. We've shared our marketing plans with our key retail partners, and they also believe the brand still has a relevance in that segment of dry dog food. They support our plans behind the brand and are willing to continue to work with us in that segment. So we're not going to turn it around in a quarter or 2, but we still think the Kibbles 'n Bits brand has relevance to the consumer in that segment. And then the mass premium segment, which, as you know, we do not have a place in that segment currently, we continue to evaluate acquisitions, licensing or launching one of our existing brands in that segment. That is front and center for our team, and we will continue to focus on a solution for that segment based on what's right long term for us to participate in that category. So we're still committed to the brand. We think it has a place, and we think just getting the fundamentals are just foundational."

Actually, we've actually added some additional items that we've recently presented to those retailers. So overall, we're still pleased with the performance of that brand based on the expanded distribution last year. But I think that, that channel is just seeing some overall slowdown in traffic.

But in terms of the current quarter, what we saw a little bit on -- and I think we mentioned to this at our call in June and then touched on today as well, is that in addition to the price declines we took, we also had some additional trade came through sort of from a change in timing. So that too is considered price. So the combination of those 2 exceeded the net commodity cost reduction, but we wouldn't expect that to continue throughout the year. So obviously, the biggest pricing impact in general versus a year ago hit in Q1 because of the coffee. So just a pricing impact overall would be less as we move through. We'll, obviously, still feel the 6% we took on coffee this year, but as you know, we lapped it otherwise. So a little bit of an anomaly. And I guess, just if I can, while I'm thinking of pricing and just sales in general, I think it's -- I'd like to just laid it out there, and again, I respect everyone's modeling, but if we do look at the combination of the milk and the impact of pricing the coffee had, and I guess I'm just turning back the clock a couple of months, those 2 pieces in total were probably about $90 million to $100 million, the first quarter sales impact. So I think in Mark's scripted comments, we talked about our sales being just slightly below plans. So we had factored a good portion of that in. But certainly, I can understand for the reaction when you see the negative 7 year-over-year. So I just wanted to call that out an additional data point for everybody."

Yes, we do actually have a new head of revenue management. In fact, one of the things that we spoke about, I think, on the last call was that some of the incremental savings that we've targeted are going to be invested in capabilities like that. That is one of several. I would describe some of the capabilities as we've sort of taken a step back and reorganized ourselves to make sure that we're building the right capabilities that related to the consumer. And that could be things like insights and data to ensure a robust innovation pipeline as well as the customer in terms of how we do business with them, and how we ensure that we're giving them the absolute best content. So revenue management would be one piece of that. And we're at a stage now where we've done a nice job of building the organization, and we're in the process of ensuring that those new organizations and functions are wired properly. And so that takes a little bit of time as we get to a full year planning and so forth. But at this point, we're very, very pleased with the leadership we have across many of our functions. And as it relates specifically to the revenue management, our goal over the next year or 2 are to begin to become increasingly more efficient in our trade spend so that we can truly drive incremental sales. That's ultimately the goal."

And I think it might have been a little bit more transparent. But if you think about how different the coffee category is today than it was then, that was pre-K-Cups. That was when blue can was a material piece of this category. And then that was when we had different owners of our competitive brands that had different strategies and different behavior. So I think if you look at the momentum last year, you look at the first quarter in coffee, we feel really good about our balance of cost and our balance of coverage. I think, we think we're uniquely different in that we tie our commodity team to our business team, and that our commodity team not only understands how to buy at the right prices, they understand when we need those prices in the marketplace. So it may be more difficult for the outside world to understand, but I think we're really happy with how is -- what it's delivering for us from a business unit standpoint. I think we'll stick -- we'll probably stay with where we are."

But the broader trend is the pet population seems to have started growing in the recent past, so that's a good trend, and there's a broader trend of premiumization. Your portfolio should be better suited to that than your competitors. I mean, are we entering a stage like we were like, maybe 4 years ago on coffee, where there is a shift from mainstream to premium, a broader shift, that we should be maybe thinking of in light of your exposure to the mainstream side? Is that what we're seeing broadly as people are premiumizing maybe the mainstream category is just over skewed, and that's why we're seeing as much competitive activity as we're seeing?"

It's still a place for our value brands like Kibbles 'n Bits and Gravy Train in that segment. We have some great brands in pet specialty. Our snack brands cut across all other segments as well and are great brands. We've been driving category growth in the snack category, and our retailers attribute that to our innovation efforts. So I think our strategy in pet is going to be like it is in every other segment, is just every other category we participate in, is just make sure we meet the consumer needs however they define value and that will be a consistent strategy we apply in pet.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This is truly an exciting time at Smucker. As we look to continue the momentum from an historic fiscal 2016, we are pleased to have delivered a strong first quarter earnings performance. These results reflect our team's ability to execute and deliver our 2017 financial plan while building for the future. This balance is critical since delivering the core business and achieving our targets for synergies, cost savings and working capital supports our development of new capabilities and the continued growth of key brands and on-trend platforms. Ultimately, this will allow us to meet our long-term objectives for top and bottom line growth and deliver against our consumer-centric corporate vision as we look to further engage, delight and inspire our consumers. 
With that background, let me provide a brief overview of first quarter results. Excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange, net sales decreased 5% compared to 2016. This decline was largely planned due to a cumulative 12% list price decrease for coffee across most of the quarter and lapping the prior year rollout of Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups. Lower Pet Food sales also contributed. 
Adjusted operating income was up 2% as the lower net sales were more than offset by a decrease in commodity costs and incremental synergies. Aided by a more normalized tax rate as compared to the previous year and a decrease in shares, adjusted earnings per share grew 16% to $1.86. Free cash flow was $189 million, a portion of which was used during the quarter to further reduce our net borrowed position. In addition, last month, we announced a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend rate. 
While net sales fell slightly short of our projection for the quarter, earnings per share exceeded our expectations. This was mostly attributable to higher-than-anticipated segment profit for coffee and lower-than-anticipated spending in a number of areas. As a portion of the overdelivery is expected to be timing-related, including projected year-over-year increases in marketing spend shifting to the remaining 3 quarters, we remain on track to achieve our previously stated full year guidance for adjusted earnings per share. That said, we expect softness in Pet Food sales to continue in the near term, leading us to adjust our full year sales guidance, as Mark will discuss in a moment. 
Let me now provide additional comments on our U.S. Retail businesses. We were pleased with the start of the fiscal year for our coffee business. Profitability was in line with the strong first quarter of 2016 despite the anticipated top line impact of price declines and lapping the prior year launch of Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups. Volume gains for Folgers roast and ground coffee continued in the first quarter, reflecting consumer response to lower price points. Tonnage for our mainstream brands was up 3%, while units shipped were up even more given the prior year canister downsize was not fully lapped until late in the quarter. 
Folgers K-Cup volume trends improved in the quarter, responding favorably to planned price investments. In addition, we are currently rolling out new K-Cup packaging that leverages the iconic Folgers Red Can brand equity, providing additional support for the product line. 
For the Dunkin' Donuts brand, we are pleased with the continued consumption growth for our K-Cup offerings, with over $230 million in retail sales for the latest 52-week scan period. While shipments were down significantly in the first quarter as expected due to the prior year sell-in, we project volume growth for the remaining 9 months, including contributions from new varieties. In addition, volume for Dunkin' bagged coffee was up 4% in the first quarter, and we expect positive trends to continue as lower prices, supported by favorable input costs, have improved the competitive positioning of the brand. 
Turning to Consumer Foods. First quarter net sales were consistent with our expectations. Across many of our key brands and categories, volume was in line or, in several cases, up compared to the prior year. In addition, our brands maintained or grew both volume and dollar share in the latest 12-week scan period for most of the food categories in which we participate. 
For the first time in 5 years, volume for Smucker's Uncrustables frozen sandwiches experienced a quarterly decline. However, this was related to timing of customer shipments that have already rebounded in August. Overall consumption trends remained strong, and we continue to expect double-digit growth for the full year. In addition, Uncrustables remain a key growth driver for our Foodservice business, where volume for the brand was up 40% during the first quarter. 
For the Pet Food segment, first quarter sales performance was below our projection. We have revised our full year outlook as we expect this softness to continue in the near term. Our teams are focused on the key factors impacting current performance and are already executing on opportunities to provide future growth. 
Specifically, improving the performance of our mainstream dog and cat brands remains a key area of focus. We have introduced bonus bags for Kibbles 'n Bits, supported by lower input costs, which entered the market in late June. We expect this will help moderate declines for the brand. We also have plans to introduce new packaging later this fiscal year and enhance brand support, consistent with its heritage around taste and fun, to further improve the competitive positioning of Kibbles 'n Bits. 
In the cat segment, we remain encouraged by the strong equity of the Meow Mix brand. With recent innovation, a new television advertising campaign that began this month and upcoming pricing support, we are confident in our ability to reverse recent softness in this business. 
In addition to these areas, we continue to progress on whitespace opportunities in mainstream pet food, driven by consumer preference for additional protein and natural ingredient options. 
Looking at the rest of the Pet Food business, sales for pet snacks were up 2% in the quarter, on top of a 9% increase in the prior year, and were a key driver of overall category growth. Our category leadership in pet snacks and innovation, particularly for the Milk-Bone and Meow Mix brands, continues to be an important component of results. 
Within premium pet food, sales for the Natural Balance brand were down as we lapped the pipeline fill associated with distribution gains in last year's first quarter. While consumer takeaway for the brand remains strong, we are tempering our near-term growth expectations for our premium brands given the recent softness in the overall pet superstore channel. 
Lastly, as it relates to our Pet Food business and broader organization, let me provide a brief update on our synergy and cost-savings activities, which remain on track. In the first quarter, we realized $32 million of incremental synergies, approximately 25% of which benefited gross profit, with the rest related to SD&A savings. We continue to anticipate $100 million of incremental synergies for the full fiscal year, which would bring our total to nearly $140 million of the $200 million targeted by the end of fiscal 2018. 
In addition, we continue to target $50 million of annual cost savings to be fully realized over the next few years related to our organizational redesign program and the previously announced plant closures. As we have indicated, we expect to initially invest much of these incremental savings in several identified areas to support top and bottom line growth. 
In closing, I would like to thank our employees for their continued efforts towards delivering the core business, building on our product innovation activities and marketing support, expanding our capabilities to enhance future growth and achieving our synergy and cost-savings goals. This strong execution continues to position the company well for 2017 and beyond. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark Belgya."

Smucker Company","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.

I will begin by providing additional color on our first quarter results and then conclude with our outlook for the full year. 
Net sales decreased by $136 million or 7% in the quarter. The prior year divestiture of the canned milk business detracted 2 percentage points, while lower net price realization, which was mostly attributable to coffee, had a 4-point impact. Volume and mix combined to subtract 1 percentage point, reflecting declines in Pet Food. The impact of foreign exchange was immaterial to consolidated results. 
GAAP earnings per share were $1.46 this quarter, 28% above the prior year. Included in GAAP earnings were $8 million of unallocated derivative gains compared to a loss of $10 million last year. In addition, GAAP earnings for both the current and prior years included $26 million of special project costs related to merger and integration and restructuring activities, along with just over $50 million of amortization expense related to intangible assets. Excluding all of these items, adjusted EPS was $1.86 for an increase of 16%. 
Adjusted gross profit declined at a slower rate than sales, resulting in a 160 basis point improvement in gross margin to 39.6%, representing the highest quarterly gross margin percentage since 2011. Year-over-year gross margin expansion was realized by all of our reportable segments, most notably for coffee. Overall commodity costs were lower in the quarter, driven by green coffee, and mostly offset the lower net pricing. In addition, $8 million of the incremental synergies in the first quarter contributed to gross margin growth. For the full year, we now anticipate gross margin to be approximately 50 basis points higher than our previous guidance of 39%. 
SD&A decreased $32 million in the first quarter or 8% compared to 2016, mostly attributable to synergies. Lower royalties associated with the Dunkin' Donuts business also contributed to reduced selling costs. Excluding the benefits of synergy, marketing spend was in line with the prior year but 13% lower than forecasted for the quarter. Factoring all of this in, adjusted operating income was up $8 million or 2% compared to the prior year, with operating margin increasing 180 basis points to 20%. 
Below the line, lower income tax expense and a decrease in the number of shares outstanding were key drivers of the earnings per share growth. As a reminder, the effective tax rate for the prior year first quarter was unusually high due to deferred state tax adjustments. In addition, the current year first quarter rate was slightly lower than anticipated. As a result, we now expect the full year rate to approximate 33.5% compared to our previous guidance of 34%. 
Let me provide a brief overview of segment results, beginning with coffee. First quarter net sales decreased 9% due to lower net price realization as the net impact of volume and mix was neutral in the quarter. Lower pricing reflected the full quarter impact of the 6% price decline taken in July 2015, along with the additional 6% decrease taken in mid-May of this year. Incremental price support of Folgers K-Cup and Dunkin' Donuts bagged coffee also contributed. 
Net sales for the Folgers brand declined 8% as the lower net price realization was partially offset by mainstream roast and ground volume growth. For the Dunkin' Donuts brand, sales were down 14%, reflecting both lower pricing and the impact of lapping the prior year launch of Dunkin' K-Cups. Lastly, Café Bustelo sales were up 5% as double-digit growth in volume/mix more than offset lower net pricing. 
Segment profit was flat with the prior year but exceeded expectations. Segment margin increased 310 basis points to 33.9%. The net impact of lower pricing, as compared to the recognition of lower cost, was unfavorable to segment profit in the quarter, however, to a lesser degree than originally anticipated due to timing. The price-to-cost impact was mostly offset by profit contributions from favorable volume/mix. And the increase in marketing spend was offset by lower royalty expense associated with the Dunkin' Donuts brand. 
Turning to Consumer Foods. Net sales were down 2%, excluding the impact of the canned milk divestiture. The decline reflected lower net price realization, which was impacted by the timing of certain trade program expenses compared to the prior year. Volume/mix was flat with the prior year. 
Looking at key brands. Sales for Jif and Smucker's were down, generally in line with the overall segment. In the bake aisle, sales for both the Crisco and Pillsbury brands decreased 5% as lower net pricing was partially offset by volume gains. Lastly, the Sahale Snacks brand achieved strong double-digit sales growth in the quarter, benefiting from distribution gains. 
Segment profit declined 7%, mostly attributable to lapping $6 million of prior year earnings related to the divested milk business. In addition, favorable input cost did not fully offset lower net price realization. 
Net sales for our Pet Food segment decreased 6%, reflecting unfavorable volume/mix. The lower sales were mostly driven by double-digit declines for our Natural Balance and Kibbles 'n Bits brands. Mid-single-digit declines from Meow Mix and 9Lives cat food also contributed. Sales for our pet snack portfolio were up low single digits, with gains across all our key snacking brands, including Milk-Bone, Pup-Peroni, Milo's Kitchen and Canine Carry Outs. 
Segment profit increased 5% as the impact of unfavorable volume/mix was offset by incremental synergy realization and lower input costs. In addition, marketing spend was down double digits in the first quarter. A significant portion of the marketing impact is timing-related due to a shift of certain key marketing activities into the second quarter. We now anticipate full year Pet Food segment profit to be up low single digits, which is less than previously projected. 
Net sales for International and Foodservice decreased 3% in the quarter. However, excluding the impact of the canned milk divestiture and FX, net sales were in line with the prior year. Segment profit was up 9%, reflecting the net benefit of lower coffee cost and pricing along with favorable volume/mix. Partially offsetting these factors was lapping $2 million of prior year profit related to the divested milk business and unfavorable impact of foreign exchange in Canada. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $239 million for the quarter. This compares to $307 million in the prior year, which included a $50 million benefit related to the timing of tax payments and refunds. Factoring in capital expenditures of $50 million in the current year, free cash flow was $189 million in the quarter. We continue to project full year free cash flow of $1 billion, assuming CapEx of $240 million. 
We paid down an additional $100 million on our term loan in May and ended the quarter with total debt of $5.35 billion. Based on trailing 12-month EBITDA of $1.6 billion, leverage currently stands at just over 3.3x. 
Let me now conclude with an update on our full year sales and earnings outlook. Excluding the 2 percentage point impact of the divested milk business, we now expect net sales to be in the range of flat to down 1% compared to the prior year. The reduction from our previous guidance of plus 1% is primarily attributable to lower expectations for our Pet Food segment as projections for the remaining businesses remain relatively unchanged. With input costs lower than originally expected in our Consumer Foods segment, along with a lower effective tax rate, we expect to offset the margin impact of the net sales shortfall. 
As a result, we continue to project adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.60 to $7.75, with the bias towards the middle to high end of the range. Reflecting the timing impact which benefited first quarter results, most notably the shift in timing of marketing spend for Pet Food segments, we now project our second quarter EPS will be comparable to the prior year. 
In closing, we anticipate the challenges to revenue growth in certain categories will persist in the near term, as reflected in our revised sales guidance. However, our long-term expectations remain intact. As Mark indicated, we're executing on plans and initiatives to improve top line trends while investing in our capabilities to enhance future growth. At the same time, we are pleased with the earnings and cash flow performance of the company. Overall, we remain confident in achieving solid earnings growth this fiscal year and beyond. 
We thank you for your time, and we will now open the call up to your questions. Operator, if you would please queue up the first question."

I think if we look at where we are today and where we were then, we wouldn't change our thoughts on the near term. Our coverage allowed us -- we felt very comfortable with the pricing changes that we made given the coverage that we have. Mark and Mark talked a lot about the pricing laps and the effect on net sales in coffee for the first quarter. But as we get into the key selling season, I think we've got the sharpest price points we've had in quite a while. So the merchandising is strong, the price points are good, and honestly, the coverage supports that or we wouldn't have done those things. So if we had to look at pricing change if that happened, it would be much later in the year. And frankly, I think we have a bias that over the next few months, we're going to get a good look at what coffee is going to end up at. I think there's a lot of coffee in the farmers' field and in Brazil, and typically, the next few months will let us know where that's going to sell out. So we're in good shape until then. And given the fact that we've gone down twice over the last 12 months, I think we've got room if we had to, to absorb some of that even if we have to do pricing."

As you know, the Kibbles 'n Bits brand, its struggle is not just recent. That brand has been struggling over the past year or so. As we stepped into the business with a new team, we felt fundamentals had to be right, especially around pricing. So we felt that was the first thing we needed to do to fix the price on shelf. What we're seeing with the bonus bags is it is decelerating the losses that we were seeing previously. So we do think it's working. That was fundamental to fixing the business. We still think the brand is relevant. We've shared our marketing plans with our key retail partners, and they also believe the brand still has a relevance in that segment of dry dog food. They support our plans behind the brand and are willing to continue to work with us in that segment. So we're not going to turn it around in a quarter or 2, but we still think the Kibbles 'n Bits brand has relevance to the consumer in that segment. And then the mass premium segment, which, as you know, we do not have a place in that segment currently, we continue to evaluate acquisitions, licensing or launching one of our existing brands in that segment. That is front and center for our team, and we will continue to focus on a solution for that segment based on what's right long term for us to participate in that category.

Both of the -- our key retailers in the pet specialty channel are supporting the brand and working with us, taking incremental SKUs. Actually, we've actually added some additional items that we've recently presented to those retailers. So overall, we're still pleased with the performance of that brand based on the expanded distribution last year. But I think that, that channel is just seeing some overall slowdown in traffic. Just one other comment I would add is, around that brand, is we are seeing some nice growth in e-commerce. And that channel is growing double digits, high double digits, small base, but we're really seeing some nice growth with that brand in that specific channel.

We continue to be favorable in the input costs, I think, in my comments in Consumer Foods, in particular. But in terms of the current quarter, what we saw a little bit on -- and I think we mentioned this at our call in June and then touched on today as well, is that in addition to the price declines we took, we also had some additional trade came through sort of from a change in timing. So that, too, is considered price. So the combination of those 2 exceeded the net commodity cost reduction, but we wouldn't expect that to continue throughout the year. So obviously, the biggest pricing impact in general versus a year ago hit in Q1 because of the coffee. So just a pricing impact overall would be less as we move through. We'll, obviously, still feel the 6% we took on coffee this year, but as you know, we lapped it otherwise. So a little bit of an anomaly. And I guess, just if I can, while I'm thinking of pricing and just sales in general, I think it's -- I'd like to just lay this out there, and again, I respect everyone's modeling, but if we do look at the combination of the milk and the impact of pricing the coffee had, and I guess I'm just turning back the clock a couple of months, those 2 pieces in total were probably about $90 million to $100 million of first quarter sales impact. So I think in Mark's scripted comments, we talked about our sales being just slightly below plan. So we had factored a good portion of that in. But certainly, I can understand sort of the reaction when you see the negative 7% year-over-year. So I just wanted to call that out as an additional data point for everybody."

Yes, we do actually have a new head of revenue management. In fact, one of the things that we spoke about, I think, on the last call was that some of the incremental savings that we've targeted are going to be invested in capabilities like that. That is one of several. I would describe some of the capabilities as we've sort of taken a step back and reorganized ourselves to make sure that we're building the right capabilities that relate to the consumer. And that could be things like insights and data to ensure a robust innovation pipeline as well as the customer in terms of how we do business with them and how we ensure that we're giving them the absolute best content. So revenue management would be one piece of that. And we're at a stage now where we've done a nice job of building the organization, and we're in the process of ensuring that those new organizations and functions are wired properly. And so that takes a little bit of time as we get to a full year planning and so forth. But at this point, we're very, very pleased with the leadership we have across many of our functions.

I don't think it was in the prepared comments, but we saw what we call legacy or Folgers K-Cups increase in volume for the quarter. And that's a nice turnaround given everything going on in the K-Cup category and all of the noise there and the deflation there. We saw strong K-Cup volume in our legacy brands. We continue to see strong takeaway for Dunkin'. We literally had trucks lined up at the door at midnight on May 1 a year ago when we launched this. So given the strength of that, we did not expect the same results, obviously, a year later. But we have more distribution today than we did a year ago. The turns remain very, very strong. And the Dunkin' Original K-Cup is the #1 K-Cup in most of the channels and most of the customers we sell it to. So that franchise continues to be alive and growing. So we're really pleased with that, but more pleased, I would say, that the legacy business is up over a year ago. So that's a great trend to reverse."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This is truly an exciting time at Smucker. As we look to continue the momentum from an historic fiscal 2016, we are pleased to have delivered a strong first quarter earnings performance. These results reflect our team's ability to execute and deliver our 2017 financial plan while building for the future. This balance is critical since delivering the core business and achieving our targets for synergies, cost savings and working capital supports our development of new capabilities and the continued growth of key brands and on-trend platforms. Ultimately, this will allow us to meet our long-term objectives for top and bottom line growth and deliver against our consumer-centric corporate vision as we look to further engage, delight and inspire our consumers. 
With that background, let me provide a brief overview of first quarter results. Excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange, net sales decreased 5% compared to 2016. This decline was largely planned due to a cumulative 12% list price decrease for coffee across most of the quarter and lapping the prior year rollout of Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups. Lower Pet Food sales also contributed. 
Adjusted operating income was up 2% as the lower net sales were more than offset by a decrease in commodity costs and incremental synergies. Aided by a more normalized tax rate as compared to the previous year and a decrease in shares, adjusted earnings per share grew 16% to $1.86. Free cash flow was $189 million, a portion of which was used during the quarter to further reduce our net borrowed position. In addition, last month, we announced a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend rate. 
While net sales fell slightly short of our projection for the quarter, earnings per share exceeded our expectations. This was mostly attributable to higher-than-anticipated segment profit for coffee and lower-than-anticipated spending in a number of areas. As a portion of the overdelivery is expected to be timing-related, including projected year-over-year increases in marketing spend shifting to the remaining 3 quarters, we remain on track to achieve our previously stated full year guidance for adjusted earnings per share. That said, we expect softness in Pet Food sales to continue in the near term, leading us to adjust our full year sales guidance, as Mark will discuss in a moment. 
Let me now provide additional comments on our U.S. Retail businesses. We were pleased with the start of the fiscal year for our coffee business. Profitability was in line with the strong first quarter of 2016 despite the anticipated top line impact of price declines and lapping the prior year launch of Dunkin' Donuts K-Cups. Volume gains for Folgers roast and ground coffee continued in the first quarter, reflecting consumer response to lower price points. Tonnage for our mainstream brands was up 3%, while units shipped were up even more given the prior year canister downsize was not fully lapped until late in the quarter. 
Folgers K-Cup volume trends improved in the quarter, responding favorably to planned price investments. In addition, we are currently rolling out new K-Cup packaging that leverages the iconic Folgers Red Can brand equity, providing additional support for the product line. 
For the Dunkin' Donuts brand, we are pleased with the continued consumption growth for our K-Cup offerings, with over $230 million in retail sales for the latest 52-week scan period. While shipments were down significantly in the first quarter as expected due to the prior year sell-in, we project volume growth for the remaining 9 months, including contributions from new varieties. In addition, volume for Dunkin' bagged coffee was up 4% in the first quarter, and we expect positive trends to continue as lower prices, supported by favorable input costs, have improved the competitive positioning of the brand. 
Turning to Consumer Foods. First quarter net sales were consistent with our expectations. Across many of our key brands and categories, volume was in line or, in several cases, up compared to the prior year. In addition, our brands maintained or grew both volume and dollar share in the latest 12-week scan period for most of the food categories in which we participate. 
For the first time in 5 years, volume for Smucker's Uncrustables frozen sandwiches experienced a quarterly decline. However, this was related to timing of customer shipments that have already rebounded in August. Overall consumption trends remained strong, and we continue to expect double-digit growth for the full year. In addition, Uncrustables remain a key growth driver for our Foodservice business, where volume for the brand was up 40% during the first quarter. 
For the Pet Food segment, first quarter sales performance was below our projection. We have revised our full year outlook as we expect this softness to continue in the near term. Our teams are focused on the key factors impacting current performance and are already executing on opportunities to provide future growth. 
Specifically, improving the performance of our mainstream dog and cat brands remains a key area of focus. We have introduced bonus bags for Kibbles 'n Bits, supported by lower input costs, which entered the market in late June. We expect this will help moderate declines for the brand. We also have plans to introduce new packaging later this fiscal year and enhance brand support, consistent with its heritage around taste and fun, to further improve the competitive positioning of Kibbles 'n Bits. 
In the cat segment, we remain encouraged by the strong equity of the Meow Mix brand. With recent innovation, a new television advertising campaign that began this month and upcoming pricing support, we are confident in our ability to reverse recent softness in this business. 
In addition to these areas, we continue to progress on whitespace opportunities in mainstream pet food, driven by consumer preference for additional protein and natural ingredient options. 
Looking at the rest of the Pet Food business, sales for pet snacks were up 2% in the quarter, on top of a 9% increase in the prior year, and were a key driver of overall category growth. Our category leadership in pet snacks and innovation, particularly for the Milk-Bone and Meow Mix brands, continues to be an important component of results. 
Within premium pet food, sales for the Natural Balance brand were down as we lapped the pipeline fill associated with distribution gains in last year's first quarter. While consumer takeaway for the brand remains strong, we are tempering our near-term growth expectations for our premium brands given the recent softness in the overall pet superstore channel. 
Lastly, as it relates to our Pet Food business and broader organization, let me provide a brief update on our synergy and cost-savings activities, which remain on track. In the first quarter, we realized $32 million of incremental synergies, approximately 25% of which benefited gross profit, with the rest related to SD&A savings. We continue to anticipate $100 million of incremental synergies for the full fiscal year, which would bring our total to nearly $140 million of the $200 million targeted by the end of fiscal 2018. 
In addition, we continue to target $50 million of annual cost savings to be fully realized over the next few years related to our organizational redesign program and the previously announced plant closures. As we have indicated, we expect to initially invest much of these incremental savings in several identified areas to support top and bottom line growth. 
In closing, I would like to thank our employees for their continued efforts towards delivering the core business, building on our product innovation activities and marketing support, expanding our capabilities to enhance future growth and achieving our synergy and cost-savings goals. This strong execution continues to position the company well for 2017 and beyond. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark Belgya."

I will begin by providing additional color on our first quarter results and then conclude with our outlook for the full year. 
Net sales decreased by $136 million or 7% in the quarter. The prior year divestiture of the canned milk business detracted 2 percentage points, while lower net price realization, which was mostly attributable to coffee, had a 4-point impact. Volume and mix combined to subtract 1 percentage point, reflecting declines in Pet Food. The impact of foreign exchange was immaterial to consolidated results. 
GAAP earnings per share were $1.46 this quarter, 28% above the prior year. Included in GAAP earnings were $8 million of unallocated derivative gains compared to a loss of $10 million last year. In addition, GAAP earnings for both the current and prior years included $26 million of special project costs related to merger and integration and restructuring activities, along with just over $50 million of amortization expense related to intangible assets. Excluding all of these items, adjusted EPS was $1.86 for an increase of 16%. 
Adjusted gross profit declined at a slower rate than sales, resulting in a 160 basis point improvement in gross margin to 39.6%, representing the highest quarterly gross margin percentage since 2011. Year-over-year gross margin expansion was realized by all of our reportable segments, most notably for coffee. Overall commodity costs were lower in the quarter, driven by green coffee, and mostly offset the lower net pricing. In addition, $8 million of the incremental synergies in the first quarter contributed to gross margin growth. For the full year, we now anticipate gross margin to be approximately 50 basis points higher than our previous guidance of 39%. 
SD&A decreased $32 million in the first quarter or 8% compared to 2016, mostly attributable to synergies. Lower royalties associated with the Dunkin' Donuts business also contributed to reduced selling costs. Excluding the benefits of synergy, marketing spend was in line with the prior year but 13% lower than forecasted for the quarter. Factoring all of this in, adjusted operating income was up $8 million or 2% compared to the prior year, with operating margin increasing 180 basis points to 20%. 
Below the line, lower income tax expense and a decrease in the number of shares outstanding were key drivers of the earnings per share growth. As a reminder, the effective tax rate for the prior year first quarter was unusually high due to deferred state tax adjustments. In addition, the current year first quarter rate was slightly lower than anticipated. As a result, we now expect the full year rate to approximate 33.5% compared to our previous guidance of 34%. 
Let me provide a brief overview of segment results, beginning with coffee. First quarter net sales decreased 9% due to lower net price realization as the net impact of volume and mix was neutral in the quarter. Lower pricing reflected the full quarter impact of the 6% price decline taken in July 2015, along with the additional 6% decrease taken in mid-May of this year. Incremental price support of Folgers K-Cup and Dunkin' Donuts bagged coffee also contributed. 
Net sales for the Folgers brand declined 8% as the lower net price realization was partially offset by mainstream roast and ground volume growth. For the Dunkin' Donuts brand, sales were down 14%, reflecting both lower pricing and the impact of lapping the prior year launch of Dunkin' K-Cups. Lastly, Café Bustelo sales were up 5% as double-digit growth in volume/mix more than offset lower net pricing. 
Segment profit was flat with the prior year but exceeded expectations. Segment margin increased 310 basis points to 33.9%. The net impact of lower pricing, as compared to the recognition of lower cost, was unfavorable to segment profit in the quarter, however, to a lesser degree than originally anticipated due to timing. The price-to-cost impact was mostly offset by profit contributions from favorable volume/mix. And the increase in marketing spend was offset by lower royalty expense associated with the Dunkin' Donuts brand. 
Turning to Consumer Foods. Net sales were down 2%, excluding the impact of the canned milk divestiture. The decline reflected lower net price realization, which was impacted by the timing of certain trade program expenses compared to the prior year. Volume/mix was flat with the prior year. 
Looking at key brands. Sales for Jif and Smucker's were down, generally in line with the overall segment. In the bake aisle, sales for both the Crisco and Pillsbury brands decreased 5% as lower net pricing was partially offset by volume gains. Lastly, the Sahale Snacks brand achieved strong double-digit sales growth in the quarter, benefiting from distribution gains. 
Segment profit declined 7%, mostly attributable to lapping $6 million of prior year earnings related to the divested milk business. In addition, favorable input cost did not fully offset lower net price realization. 
Net sales for our Pet Food segment decreased 6%, reflecting unfavorable volume/mix. The lower sales were mostly driven by double-digit declines for our Natural Balance and Kibbles 'n Bits brands. Mid-single-digit declines from Meow Mix and 9Lives cat food also contributed. Sales for our pet snack portfolio were up low single digits, with gains across all our key snacking brands, including Milk-Bone, Pup-Peroni, Milo's Kitchen and Canine Carry Outs. 
Segment profit increased 5% as the impact of unfavorable volume/mix was offset by incremental synergy realization and lower input costs. In addition, marketing spend was down double digits in the first quarter. A significant portion of the marketing impact is timing-related due to a shift of certain key marketing activities into the second quarter. We now anticipate full year Pet Food segment profit to be up low single digits, which is less than previously projected. 
Net sales for International and Foodservice decreased 3% in the quarter. However, excluding the impact of the canned milk divestiture and FX, net sales were in line with the prior year. Segment profit was up 9%, reflecting the net benefit of lower coffee cost and pricing along with favorable volume/mix. Partially offsetting these factors was lapping $2 million of prior year profit related to the divested milk business and unfavorable impact of foreign exchange in Canada. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $239 million for the quarter. This compares to $307 million in the prior year, which included a $50 million benefit related to the timing of tax payments and refunds. Factoring in capital expenditures of $50 million in the current year, free cash flow was $189 million in the quarter. We continue to project full year free cash flow of $1 billion, assuming CapEx of $240 million. 
We paid down an additional $100 million on our term loan in May and ended the quarter with total debt of $5.35 billion. Based on trailing 12-month EBITDA of $1.6 billion, leverage currently stands at just over 3.3x. 
Let me now conclude with an update on our full year sales and earnings outlook. Excluding the 2 percentage point impact of the divested milk business, we now expect net sales to be in the range of flat to down 1% compared to the prior year. The reduction from our previous guidance of plus 1% is primarily attributable to lower expectations for our Pet Food segment as projections for the remaining businesses remain relatively unchanged. With input costs lower than originally expected in our Consumer Foods segment, along with a lower effective tax rate, we expect to offset the margin impact of the net sales shortfall. 
As a result, we continue to project adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.60 to $7.75, with the bias towards the middle to high end of the range. Reflecting the timing impact which benefited first quarter results, most notably the shift in timing of marketing spend for Pet Food segments, we now project our second quarter EPS will be comparable to the prior year. 
In closing, we anticipate the challenges to revenue growth in certain categories will persist in the near term, as reflected in our revised sales guidance. However, our long-term expectations remain intact. As Mark indicated, we're executing on plans and initiatives to improve top line trends while investing in our capabilities to enhance future growth. At the same time, we are pleased with the earnings and cash flow performance of the company. Overall, we remain confident in achieving solid earnings growth this fiscal year and beyond.

I think if we look at where we are today and where we were then, we wouldn't change our thoughts on the near term. Our coverage allowed us -- we felt very comfortable with the pricing changes that we made given the coverage that we have. Mark and Mark talked a lot about the pricing laps and the effect on net sales in coffee for the first quarter. But as we get into the key selling season, I think we've got the sharpest price points we've had in quite a while. So the merchandising is strong, the price points are good, and honestly, the coverage supports that or we wouldn't have done those things. So if we had to look at pricing change if that happened, it would be much later in the year. And frankly, I think we have a bias that over the next few months, we're going to get a good look at what coffee is going to end up at. I think there's a lot of coffee in the farmers' field and in Brazil, and typically, the next few months will let us know where that's going to sell out. So we're in good shape until then. And given the fact that we've gone down twice over the last 12 months, I think we've got room if we had to, to absorb some of that even if we have to do pricing."

And then my next question for Barry or Mark Smucker, I realize turning around dry dog food is not easy, and you guys cautioned us at CAGNY it would take some time.

But frankly and just my opinion, they seem a little more like Band-Aids than real sustainable fixes to the product and its positioning. So I'm just curious, in the face of these tough trends, what gives you the confidence that the issues are still only temporary? Is the strategy around dry dog still the right one? Or do you have to make more dramatic changes if things don't get fixed in the next couple of quarters?"

As you know, the Kibbles 'n Bits brand, its struggle is not just recent. That brand has been struggling over the past year or so. As we stepped into the business with a new team, we felt fundamentals had to be right, especially around pricing. So we felt that was the first thing we needed to do to fix the price on shelf. What we're seeing with the bonus bags is it is decelerating the losses that we were seeing previously. So we do think it's working. That was fundamental to fixing the business. We still think the brand is relevant. We've shared our marketing plans with our key retail partners, and they also believe the brand still has a relevance in that segment of dry dog food. They support our plans behind the brand and are willing to continue to work with us in that segment. So we're not going to turn it around in a quarter or 2, but we still think the Kibbles 'n Bits brand has relevance to the consumer in that segment. And then the mass premium segment, which, as you know, we do not have a place in that segment currently, we continue to evaluate acquisitions, licensing or launching one of our existing brands in that segment. That is front and center for our team, and we will continue to focus on a solution for that segment based on what's right long term for us to participate in that category.

Actually, we've actually added some additional items that we've recently presented to those retailers. So overall, we're still pleased with the performance of that brand based on the expanded distribution last year. But I think that, that channel is just seeing some overall slowdown in traffic. Just one other comment I would add is, around that brand, is we are seeing some nice growth in e-commerce.

We continue to be favorable in the input costs, I think, in my comments in Consumer Foods, in particular. But in terms of the current quarter, what we saw a little bit on -- and I think we mentioned this at our call in June and then touched on today as well, is that in addition to the price declines we took, we also had some additional trade came through sort of from a change in timing. So that, too, is considered price. So the combination of those 2 exceeded the net commodity cost reduction, but we wouldn't expect that to continue throughout the year. So obviously, the biggest pricing impact in general versus a year ago hit in Q1 because of the coffee. So just a pricing impact overall would be less as we move through. We'll, obviously, still feel the 6% we took on coffee this year, but as you know, we lapped it otherwise. So a little bit of an anomaly. And I guess, just if I can, while I'm thinking of pricing and just sales in general, I think it's -- I'd like to just lay this out there, and again, I respect everyone's modeling, but if we do look at the combination of the milk and the impact of pricing the coffee had, and I guess I'm just turning back the clock a couple of months, those 2 pieces in total were probably about $90 million to $100 million of first quarter sales impact. So I think in Mark's scripted comments, we talked about our sales being just slightly below plan. So we had factored a good portion of that in. But certainly, I can understand sort of the reaction when you see the negative 7% year-over-year. So I just wanted to call that out as an additional data point for everybody."

Yes, we do actually have a new head of revenue management. In fact, one of the things that we spoke about, I think, on the last call was that some of the incremental savings that we've targeted are going to be invested in capabilities like that. That is one of several. I would describe some of the capabilities as we've sort of taken a step back and reorganized ourselves to make sure that we're building the right capabilities that relate to the consumer. And that could be things like insights and data to ensure a robust innovation pipeline as well as the customer in terms of how we do business with them and how we ensure that we're giving them the absolute best content. So revenue management would be one piece of that. And we're at a stage now where we've done a nice job of building the organization, and we're in the process of ensuring that those new organizations and functions are wired properly. And so that takes a little bit of time as we get to a full year planning and so forth. But at this point, we're very, very pleased with the leadership we have across many of our functions.

And as you think about the bits that are growing nicely, like Sahale and Knudsen, does that shape how you think about your bolt-on acquisition strategy going forward? I know you're probably not in a position to do acquisitions yet, but might you have to shore up that business with some more softer-growing health and wellness-type brands?"

But short of that, we will see some volume growth come back, which will offset a little bit of that price impact. So the math probably works out to somewhere kind of flattish, I would guess, if you just look at the Consumer Foods and the coffee together is -- what you're calling U.S. Retail.

And although we've talked quite a bit about mainstream dog today, we feel very good about where we're at in our premium segment, our ability to address, and we started to do that on the mainstream side. And very importantly, our snacks business, pet snacks is going very well, our shares are very healthy there. And so as with all of the other categories that we're in, we're very comfortable and confident in competing with our peers, and we compete against many of the same players in some of the other categories, and we've got a proven ability to grow brands in mature categories. So wanted to leave you with that thought. And then, again, we didn't talk much today about the Olympics, but the Olympics has been very good for our brands. We're going to probably see some halo affect from a consumer perspective. And then we're going to continue to focus on what we're good at: executing, blocking and tackling, making sure that we have the best consumer engagement possible by supporting our products that we have in market; and then of course, delivering against or exceeding our synergy and our working capital targets. So once again, just want to thank our talented team of employees. They are fantastic. We would not have been able to deliver the fantastic results this quarter without them. And so many, many thanks to our dedicated employees, and thank you to all of you for joining us today. Have a great week."

This continues to be an exciting and dynamic time at Smucker as we are delivering on both our current year priorities and our long-term goals. This includes another quarter of record adjusted earnings per share as we continue to achieve our targets for synergies and cost savings. 
Second quarter results also benefited from the strong performance of the Uncrustables, Dunkin' Donuts, Café Bustelo and Smucker's brands, along with contributions from innovation as new products introduced in the past 3 years contributed 9% of our net sales in the quarter. 
In addition, we are investing in new capabilities to support the growth of our brands and on-trend platforms. We are making good progress on our journey to enhance innovation, e-commerce, our go-to-market skill set and revenue management capabilities. 
One of the key initiatives that we are thrilled to share this morning is the decision to launch our Nature's Recipe premium pet food brand into the mainstream grocery and mass channel, which I will discuss in a moment. 
All of these efforts will position us to meet our long-term objectives for top and bottom line growth and deliver against our consumer-centric vision to engage, delight and inspire our consumers. 
With that background, let me provide a brief overview of our second quarter results. Excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange, net sales decreased 5% compared to 2016. This included a 2% impact from lower pricing, primarily reflecting a list price decline in coffee taken earlier in the fiscal year. Lower pet food and peanut butter sales also contributed. With the anticipated impact of commodity inflation in certain categories and contributions from the launch of Nature's Recipe, we continue to project full year net sales to be in the range of flat to down 1% compared to 2016. 
For the second quarter, adjusted operating income was in line with the prior year as the decrease in net sales was more than offset by lower input costs and incremental synergies. Aided by a lower tax rate and a decrease in shares, adjusted earnings per share grew 7% to $2.05, exceeding our previous estimate for the quarter. This was mostly attributable to higher-than-planned segment profit for pet food and a continued focus on controlling administrative expenses. 
For pets, the over-delivery reflected a decision to reallocate a portion of our planned second quarter marketing spend to the fourth quarter to support the Nature's Recipe launch. For the full year, we remain on track to achieve our previously stated guidance for adjusted earnings per share. 
As I turn to the U.S. Retail segments, I would highlight that in each of our businesses, not only do we compete in every segment of each category, but are strategically focused on those segments where we can achieve the most long-term growth. 
Beginning with coffee. Profit was up 3% over the prior year despite the anticipated top line impact of price declines. In terms of the brands, volume for Folgers Roast and Ground coffee decreased 5%, reflecting a decline in our opening price point value offerings. However, Folgers K-Cup volume increased in the quarter, responding favorably to planned price investments. 
For the Dunkin' Donuts brand, bagged coffee volume was up 6% as lower prices supported by favorable input cost have improved the competitive position of the brand. In addition, Dunkin' K-Cups achieved double-digit volume growth in the quarter, including contributions from new varieties. And the brand continues to gain market share in the one-cup segment. 
Our Café Bustelo brand also realized double-digit growth in the second quarter for both its roast and ground and K-Cup offerings, and we anticipate this trend to carry into the back half of the year. 
Turning briefly to the green coffee market, both Arabica and Robusta futures increased further lately. However, we continue to recognize lower green coffee cost in the second quarter. 
While we do not disclose our hedged position, we remain confident in our ability to adjust pricing when warranted by our recognized costs as we have managed pricing in the past during periods of significantly higher green coffee markets. 
Within our Consumer Foods segment, the second quarter performance of peanut butter was weaker than last year with a high single digit volume decline for the Jif brand. This was partially attributable  to the timing of shipments as consumption and market share trends remain comparable to the prior year.  With upcoming merchandising support in additional marketing investments, we anticipate peanut butter sales to improve in the back half of the year. 
The Smucker's brand delivered solid performance in the second quarter. As expected, volume rebounded in the quarter for Uncrustables frozen sandwiches following a softer first quarter, which was related to timing of customer shipments. Volume was up 13% in the second quarter. And year-to-date, Uncrustables' volume is now up 6% in our retail business. We expect double-digit growth for the full year. 
In addition, our snacking platform continues to gain traction beyond Uncrustables as Sahale Snacks and Jif Bars also delivered sales growth in the quarter and gained new points of distribution. 
Lastly, as it relates to the Pillsbury brand, aggressive competitive activities continue to influence the overall baking category and impact top line performance, trends we expect to continue as we proceed through the Fall Bake period. However, Pillsbury and all our bake aisle brands remain key contributors to overall segment profit, which we also expect to continue. 
Turning to the Pet Food segment, we are excited to share our plans to offer premium dog food in grocery and mass outlets through the introduction of the Nature's Recipe brand on these channels. Nature's Recipe premium pet food has a long history participating in the pet specialty channel and is uniquely positioned to meet the consumers' increasing desire for natural and wellness offerings at accessible price points. This launch allows us to participate in the fast-growing premium segment with within traditional grocery outlets and leverage our scale in these channels. 
Retailer response to the introduction has been very enthusiastic, and our teams are doing a fantastic job executing our launch plans. Initial shipments should occur near the beginning of the fourth quarter, supported by strong marketing and merchandising efforts. We expect this launch will complement our actions to stabilize the Kibbles 'n Bits brand and will benefit our entire dog food portfolio, providing a strong presence in each segment of the mainstream dog food category. 
Looking at the rest of the Pet Food business. Top line performance for Meow Mix cat food was soft in the second quarter as anticipated. As we transition out underperforming SKUs, we are confident about driving future growth with new on-trend offerings, such as our latest innovation, Meow Mix Bistro, along with investments in TV advertising and pricing support. 
Sales for pet snacks were down mid-single digits in the quarter against a strong prior year comp. For the Milk-Bone brand, sales were down low single digits with a portion of that -- of the decline being timing-related, reflecting a shift in the promotional calendar. For the rest of the snacks portfolio, the exit of certain private label businesses and the impact of competitive activities, particularly on our Milo's Kitchen brand, also contributed. With future innovation underway and an upcoming package redesign, we anticipate growth of Milo's Kitchen over the long term as protein-based snacks increase in popularity. 
Within premium pet food, sales for the Natural Balance brand were down slightly in the quarter, reflecting the recent slowdown in the overall pet superstore channel. However, we project a stronger back half of the year for Natural Balance supported by the ongoing national advertising campaign. 
Finally, our synergy and cost-savings activities remain on track as our diligence around cost management and a continuous improvement mindset is greater than ever. In the second quarter, we realized $29 million of incremental synergies, bringing our year-to-date total to approximately $60 million. We continue to anticipate $100 million of incremental synergies for the full fiscal year, with the potential for some upside to this estimate. Including the $37 million realized in fiscal 2016, this would bring our total to nearly $140 million of the $200 million anticipated by the end of fiscal 2018. 
In addition, we continue to target $50 million of additional annual cost savings to be realized over the next few years related to our previously announced organizational redesign program and plant closures. As we have indicated, we expect to initially invest much of these incremental savings in several identified areas that I mentioned earlier that will ultimately support top line growth. 
In closing, I would like to thank our employees for their continued efforts towards delivering results in our core business building on our products innovation activities and marketing support, expanding our capabilities to enhance future growth and achieving our synergy and cost-savings goals. This strong execution continues to position the company well for the remainder of this fiscal year and the longer term. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark Belgya."

Smucker Company","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.

The prior year's divest",1325,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I will begin by providing additional color on our second quarter results and then conclude with our outlook for the full year. 
Net sales decreased by $164 million or 8% in the quarter. The prior year's divestiture of the canned milk business detracted 3 percentage points as did volume/mix, which was driven by pet food, coffee and peanut butter. Lower net price realization had a 2% impact and was mostly attributable to coffee. The impact of foreign exchange was immaterial. 
GAAP earnings per share were $1.52 this quarter, 3% above the prior year. Factoring in non-GAAP adjustment for unallocated derivative gains and losses, amortization expense and special project costs, which are all summarized in this morning's press release, adjusted EPS was $2.05, an increase of 7%. 
Adjusted growth profit declined at a significantly slower rate than sales, resulting in a 190 basis point improvement in gross margin to 39.6%. Year-over-year, gross margin expansion was realized in all 3 U.S. Retail segments, most significantly for coffee. 
Overall commodity costs were lower in the quarter, driven by green coffee and offset the impact of lower net pricing. Reduced manufacturing overhead costs and incremental synergies contributed to gross margin growth. 
SD&A decreased $27 million in the second quarter or 7% compared to 2016, mostly attributable to incremental synergies. Excluding the benefits of synergies, marketing expense increased slightly for the quarter. 
As Mark indicated, a portion of the marketing spend originally planned for the second quarter is now being shifted to the fourth quarter to support the launch of Nature's Recipe brand in grocery and mass channels. For the full year, we expect marketing expense to be up approximately $35 million or 8% across the company. 
Adjusted operating income for the second quarter was flat with the prior year while operating margin increased 170 basis points to 20.7%. Below the operating income line, lower interest and income tax expenses and a decrease in the number of shares outstanding contributed to the earnings per share growth. We now expect the full year effective tax rate to be consistent with our year-to-date rate of approximately 33% compared to our previous guidance of 33.5%. 
Let me expand our segment results. Beginning with coffee, second quarter net sales decreased 6%. Lower net price realization drove 5 percentage points of this decline, reflecting the full quarter impact of the 6% list price decline taken in May of this year across most of the coffee portfolio. Negative volume/mix had a 1% impact in the quarter. 
Net sales for the Folgers brand  declined 10% with lower net price realization and volume/mix contributing somewhat equally. 
For the Dunkin' Donuts brand, sales were up 4% as lower pricing was offset by strong volume/mix growth for bag and K-Cup offerings. 
Lastly, Café Bustelo sales were up 20% as the momentum for this brand continues. 
Coffee segment profit grew 3% compared to the prior year, with segment margin increasing 300 basis points to 33.8%. The net impact of lower pricing, as compared to the recognition of lower cost, was favorable to segment profit in the quarter and more than offset unfavorable volume/mix and a higher marketing spend. 
Turning to Consumer Foods. Net sales were down 4%, excluding the canned milk divestiture, mostly due to unfavorable volume/mix. 
Looking at the key brands, Jif was down 12%. For nut butters, this reflected lower volume, partially attributed to the timing of shipments, along with lower pricing while Jif Bars continue to have strong growth. 
Sales for the Smucker brands were up 4%, driven by the return to double-digit growth for Uncrustables frozen sandwiches. 
In the bake aisle, sales for Crisco were down slightly as growth in oil was offset by a decline in shortening. And Pillsbury brand sales decreased high single digits on lower volume. 
Consumer Foods segment profit declined 7%, attributable to lapping $12 million of prior year earnings related to the divested milk business. Excluding this impact, segment profit was up 3% as reduced manufacturing cost offset lower volume/mix and net price realization and an increase in marketing. 
Net sales for our pet food segment decreased 6%, primarily reflecting volume/mix. Lower sales were driven by a high single digit declines for our mainstream pet food brands, including Meow Mix and Kibbles 'n Bits. 
While sales for our largest pet snacks brands, Milk-Bone and Pepperoni were comparable to a strong performance in the prior year, a decline for Milo's Kitchen and the exit of some private label businesses were key drivers with 6% decrease across our pet snacks portfolio. Sales for our premium Natural Balance brand declined 1%. 
Pet Food segment profit was consistent with the prior year as the sales shortfall was offset by reduced input cost, incremental synergy realization and a slight reduction in marketing for the quarter. 
Net sales for International and Foodservice declined 3% compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of the canned milk divestiture, net sales were down 1% as favorable volume/mix was offset by lower price realization. Segment profit decreased 7% compared to a very strong second quarter in the prior year. Approximately half of this decline was due to lapping $2 million of prior year profit related to the divested milk business. 
In addition, the net impact of pricing and cost was unfavorable and only partially offset by favorable volume/mix and lower marketing. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $136 million for the quarter. This compares to $276 million in the prior year, which included benefits related to our working capital initiatives. Factoring in capital expenditures of $34 million, free cash flow was $103 million in the second quarter, bringing the first half total to $291 million. We continue to project full year free cash flow of $1 billion assuming CapEx of $240 million. While this implies a significant acceleration of free cash flow in the back half the year, this is consistent with our historical trends and our current working capital assumptions. 
During the second quarter, we paid down an additional $100 million on our term loan and ended the quarter with total debt of $5.35 billion. 
Based on trailing 12-month EBITDA of nearly $1.6 billion, our leverage currently stands at just under 3.4x. We continue to target a leverage ratio of 3.1x by the end of this fiscal year. 
Let me conclude with an update on our full year sales and earnings outlook, which remain unchanged from our most recent guidance. Excluding the 2 percentage point impact of the divested milk business, we continue to expect net sales to be in the range of flat to down 1% compared to the prior year. This implies a return to organic sales growth for the back half of fiscal 2017, including the anticipated impact of commodity inflation in certain categories, contributions from the launch of Nature's Recipe and the continued strong growth of Uncrustables in both retail and the foodservice channel. 
In addition, we continue to project adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.60 to $7.75 with a bias toward the middle to high end of this range. While this is unchanged from our previous guidance, there are a few puts and takes reflected on our outlook. Most notably, the benefit from the lower projected tax rate is expected to be offset by incremental investments in support of the Nature's Recipe launch. 
In closing, while the challenges to revenue growth persist in certain categories, partially driven by the benefit of favorable commodity cost being passed on to our consumers, we remain pleased with our earnings performance. In addition, we continue to make meaningful progress executing on our key initiatives to improve top line trends moving forward. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to achieve solid financial results this fiscal year and beyond.

And then Steve's point, of course, around inflation, we already have taken actually a price increase on the Smucker's brand. And then I would also point to consumption data. As we look at consumption data on most of our categories, the share loss, if there is one, is very modest. And so we're seeing turns remain relatively strong. I would point to peanut butter as an example. We had a very soft quarter in peanut butter. But as we dug into those numbers, we did see several customers adjusting inventories. We would expect some of that to come back. And the consumption data around peanut butter remains reasonably strong as well. So I think that all of those things put together give us some confidence in the back half."

So I'm just try to get a sense of a little bit more on the thinking behind the -- choosing that as the brand that was right one for the mass premium launch. Just a little bit more on your thinking into that.

And as we look in our portfolio, we really believe the Nature's Recipe is the right brand. That brand has about 35 years of history and heritage in the pet specialty channel. And as we look at what the consumer is looking for in the mass and grocery channels, we believe that is the right brand. The acceptance from the retailers, as we've taken that out as part of the launch, has been -- has exceeded our expectations. So we definitely believe that's the right brand. Our retailers have confirmed with us. It's the right brand, it's the right time and we're the right company to bring that brand into the segment. From a growth perspective, we are developing a marketing communications plan. We'll have marketing in place fourth quarter to support the launch. And then we'll have a national campaign next year, really, to speak to the attributes of the brand. From a competitive or a reaction from the pet specialty retailers, we shared our decision with them when -- right upfront when we made the decision to launch. And we anticipate that both of those retailers will continue to support the brand in their stores. And so again, I think it speaks to the strength of the brand of both pet specialty as well as the potential that it has in mass and grocery."

Just to give some color there, if we think about our key -- one of our major retailers, the #1 retailer, who over indexes on Kibbles 'n Bits, that brand was down -- if you look at a 12-month period, we're down 12%. If you look in the last quarter, we're down just under 6%. So I think that speaks to the positive trends when you get priced right. You also have to market the brand and have communications directed at the consumer. So we will be back marketing that brand in FY '18. We are refreshing packaging. We're bringing some innovation to the category. So I think those are -- it's just the fundamentals of marketing a brand, especially when you're up against major competitors like we are. So I think these are some of the learnings. And we're seeing some nice positive trends.

I think the one thing that I would like to maybe address here while we're on the subject of marketing, it's probably on some folks' mind. But I'm sure everyone recalls at the end of Q1, we had indicated that part of the over-delivery. I guess our first quarter was due to a time shift in marketing spend. And we had anticipated that a fair amount of that, which was pet related would slide into Q2 and kind of guided to that. As it turned out, shortly after we got into Q2, we had landed on our decision around Nature's Recipe. And just as I think, and Barry, I want to  speak for you, but I think that the pet team sort of stepped back and said, ""How do we want to make sure that we have a successful launch?"" We really took pause and challenged them on their working spend and some of the other areas. So what happened then is we've shifted it, once again, if you will, into Q4. So a lot of these dollars we've talked about in Q2 shifting or just moving into Q4 and that clearly contributed a little bit to the earnings for the quarter.

What if you think about premium pet, whether it is pet specialty, which is a very important channel for us as well as the mass channel, our goal is really to have a stronger presence in both.

And again, going just to the fact that we really believe this Nature's Recipe because it's an existing brand and because even though it is a smaller brand in that channel, it is known as a premium, a more premium brand at an affordable price.

And so we have been looking and have not necessarily limited ourselves just because we are from a leverage position, particularly as it relates to bolt ons, and we'll continue to do that. In terms of where we would lever, we went over 4x with the transaction of Big Heart. And what I would frame is to say that we were comfortable there. And the reason we were comfortable is to cash generation that came out the transaction, both from the business itself and the synergy opportunities and the quickness of the pay down made it comfortable.

Coffee cost were relatively low even compared to any kind of averages, right? So it would be reasonable to think that in that kind of environment, we would have been longer than normal, right? And so as we've seen coffee cost go up, yes, they're up, but they're only up if you think about $1.70 Arabica, it's not much over the 5- or 10-year average, right? So those are not high coffee cost. If you think about what we've seen in past years in the $2, $2.52, $2.70 type of thing, so we don't think Arabica is in anywhere in those kinds of price points. We've also learned a lot from that 1 instance where we took price up, and we crossed 2 deciles. If you remember, we took 2 deciles on our key promoted sizes, and we would have coverage a place that will not cause us to have to do that. So if there is pricing in coffee, we think it will be much more measured. And then the last thing I'll remind you is the downsize we did in a container. And so if you remember in that time frame, our competitor was promoting an 11% smaller container than we were. And now that our containers are similar. So I think there's a couple of dynamics that would suggest the coffee pricing that we would see today are project -- certainly through this fiscal year but well into next year. It's not going to put us in the position that we were in when it impacted our margins. So we feel good about it."

Sorry if you haven't seen that, but we are supporting that launch.

And then's specialty, I know that we commented previously the channel has slowed some -- I think other competitors have noted similarities, but Barry's point albeit somewhat still small but growing, the e-commerce cannot be taken lightly, and we still think there's a lot of opportunity in the channel. I think the other thing I'd reinforce in the Natural -- or in the specialty area of for us, in particular, is there still profitability opportunity. And we've seen that -- start to talk about that, that was certainly an under indexed category for us related to our segment profit we're seeing in terms of that.

So yes, that would be a backstop for those consumers as coffee pricing moves up. But moving coffee price from say $6.99 to $7.99 doesn't scare me there. I think as Mark mentioned in his opening, when OPP becomes very attractive is when you get to those $9.99, $10.99 price points, we have seen that in history. Remember we downsized the canister, so I think we're insulated from some of that. So I don't want us to think that $1.70 Arabica takes us into any price points that we should all be afraid of, right? We obviously still think this is relatively moderately priced Arabica. So I think we're some way away from us having a discussion where we will be concerned about that the absolute price points kind of dramatic effect in swinging our volume within our mix."

Yes, our performance of synergies has exceed our expansions for Q2. And you're right, we haven't adjusted, I think, we would like to get a little bit more time, but there's no indications that we will not continue down our strategic path. I think one way to think about our synergy number is we're talking about $100 million incremental through this year and $140 million capture through the end of this fiscal. But with programs in place, I would say that we're probably on a run rate right now at $180 million to $185 million. So said differently, we've got about $15 million to $20 million to tie down here in the next several months, and we'll have that $200 million locked in as we head into fiscal '18. So we're in really good shape. And the other comment, Akshay, I would say about synergies is on the SD&A, one of the things we talk about marketing I know there's probably some discussion about the market shift being a major contributor to the earnings. But we did deliver pretty significant reductions in our administrative cost so the accommodation of synergy recognition so some of the additional synergies we're falling there and some quite candidly just very strong cost management across those organizations. So some of the dollars are just incremental savings program that people put in place beyond the $200 million synergy target."

So in order to understand each one of those slopes, in order to better understand, they hit the penny business, right? So if we can get a couple of pennies right on each one of those slopes -- if our slope between 18-ounce and 32 ounces is right on, what's going to drive the most volume at the best price point. We can make some headway on that. And I think the technology is there today and I think us as well as my of our peers has invested in human capital to leverage that technology to get some of those details right.

This continues to be an exciting and dynamic time at Smucker as we are delivering on both our current year priorities and our long-term goals. This includes another quarter of record adjusted earnings per share as we continue to achieve our targets for synergies and cost savings. 
Second quarter results also benefited from the strong performance of the Uncrustables, Dunkin' Donuts, Café Bustelo and Smucker's brands, along with contributions from innovation as new products introduced in the past 3 years contributed 9% of our net sales in the quarter. 
In addition, we are investing in new capabilities to support the growth of our brands and on-trend platforms. We are making good progress on our journey to enhance innovation, e-commerce, our go-to-market skill set and revenue management capabilities. 
One of the key initiatives that we are thrilled to share this morning is the decision to launch our Nature's Recipe premium pet food brand into the mainstream grocery and mass channel, which I will discuss in a moment. 
All of these efforts will position us to meet our long-term objectives for top and bottom line growth and deliver against our consumer-centric vision to engage, delight and inspire our consumers. 
With that background, let me provide a brief overview of our second quarter results. Excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange, net sales decreased 5% compared to 2016. This included a 2% impact from lower pricing, primarily reflecting a list price decline in coffee taken earlier in the fiscal year. Lower pet food and peanut butter sales also contributed. With the anticipated impact of commodity inflation in certain categories and contributions from the launch of Nature's Recipe, we continue to project full year net sales to be in the range of flat to down 1% compared to 2016. 
For the second quarter, adjusted operating income was in line with the prior year as the decrease in net sales was more than offset by lower input costs and incremental synergies. Aided by a lower tax rate and a decrease in shares, adjusted earnings per share grew 7% to $2.05, exceeding our previous estimate for the quarter. This was mostly attributable to higher-than-planned segment profit for pet food and a continued focus on controlling administrative expenses. 
For pets, the over-delivery reflected a decision to reallocate a portion of our planned second quarter marketing spend to the fourth quarter to support the Nature's Recipe launch. For the full year, we remain on track to achieve our previously stated guidance for adjusted earnings per share. 
As I turn to the U.S. Retail segments, I would highlight that in each of our businesses, not only do we compete in every segment of each category, but are strategically focused on those segments where we can achieve the most long-term growth. 
Beginning with coffee. Profit was up 3% over the prior year despite the anticipated top line impact of price declines. In terms of the brands, volume for Folgers Roast and Ground coffee decreased 5%, reflecting a decline in our opening price point value offerings. However, Folgers K-Cup volume increased in the quarter, responding favorably to planned price investments. 
For the Dunkin' Donuts brand, bagged coffee volume was up 6% as lower prices supported by favorable input cost have improved the competitive position of the brand. In addition, Dunkin' K-Cups achieved double-digit volume growth in the quarter, including contributions from new varieties. And the brand continues to gain market share in the one-cup segment. 
Our Café Bustelo brand also realized double-digit growth in the second quarter for both its roast and ground and K-Cup offerings, and we anticipate this trend to carry into the back half of the year. 
Turning briefly to the green coffee market, both Arabica and Robusta futures increased further lately. However, we continue to recognize lower green coffee cost in the second quarter. 
While we do not disclose our hedged position, we remain confident in our ability to adjust pricing when warranted by our recognized costs as we have managed pricing in the past during periods of significantly higher green coffee markets. 
Within our Consumer Foods segment, the second quarter performance of peanut butter was weaker than last year with a high single digit volume decline for the Jif brand. This was partially attributable  to the timing of shipments as consumption and market share trends remain comparable to the prior year.  With upcoming merchandising support in additional marketing investments, we anticipate peanut butter sales to improve in the back half of the year. 
The Smucker's brand delivered solid performance in the second quarter. As expected, volume rebounded in the quarter for Uncrustables frozen sandwiches following a softer first quarter, which was related to timing of customer shipments. Volume was up 13% in the second quarter. And year-to-date, Uncrustables' volume is now up 6% in our retail business. We expect double-digit growth for the full year. 
In addition, our snacking platform continues to gain traction beyond Uncrustables as Sahale Snacks and Jif Bars also delivered sales growth in the quarter and gained new points of distribution. 
Lastly, as it relates to the Pillsbury brand, aggressive competitive activities continue to influence the overall baking category and impact top line performance, trends we expect to continue as we proceed through the Fall Bake period. However, Pillsbury and all our bake aisle brands remain key contributors to overall segment profit, which we also expect to continue. 
Turning to the Pet Food segment, we are excited to share our plans to offer premium dog food in grocery and mass outlets through the introduction of the Nature's Recipe brand on these channels. Nature's Recipe premium pet food has a long history participating in the pet specialty channel and is uniquely positioned to meet the consumers' increasing desire for natural and wellness offerings at accessible price points. This launch allows us to participate in the fast-growing premium segment with within traditional grocery outlets and leverage our scale in these channels. 
Retailer response to the introduction has been very enthusiastic, and our teams are doing a fantastic job executing our launch plans. Initial shipments should occur near the beginning of the fourth quarter, supported by strong marketing and merchandising efforts. We expect this launch will complement our actions to stabilize the Kibbles 'n Bits brand and will benefit our entire dog food portfolio, providing a strong presence in each segment of the mainstream dog food category. 
Looking at the rest of the Pet Food business. Top line performance for Meow Mix cat food was soft in the second quarter as anticipated. As we transition out underperforming SKUs, we are confident about driving future growth with new on-trend offerings, such as our latest innovation, Meow Mix Bistro, along with investments in TV advertising and pricing support. 
Sales for pet snacks were down mid-single digits in the quarter against a strong prior year comp. For the Milk-Bone brand, sales were down low single digits with a portion of that -- of the decline being timing-related, reflecting a shift in the promotional calendar. For the rest of the snacks portfolio, the exit of certain private label businesses and the impact of competitive activities, particularly on our Milo's Kitchen brand, also contributed. With future innovation underway and an upcoming package redesign, we anticipate growth of Milo's Kitchen over the long term as protein-based snacks increase in popularity. 
Within premium pet food, sales for the Natural Balance brand were down slightly in the quarter, reflecting the recent slowdown in the overall pet superstore channel. However, we project a stronger back half of the year for Natural Balance supported by the ongoing national advertising campaign. 
Finally, our synergy and cost-savings activities remain on track as our diligence around cost management and a continuous improvement mindset is greater than ever. In the second quarter, we realized $29 million of incremental synergies, bringing our year-to-date total to approximately $60 million. We continue to anticipate $100 million of incremental synergies for the full fiscal year, with the potential for some upside to this estimate. Including the $37 million realized in fiscal 2016, this would bring our total to nearly $140 million of the $200 million anticipated by the end of fiscal 2018. 
In addition, we continue to target $50 million of additional annual cost savings to be realized over the next few years related to our previously announced organizational redesign program and plant closures. As we have indicated, we expect to initially invest much of these incremental savings in several identified areas that I mentioned earlier that will ultimately support top line growth. 
In closing, I would like to thank our employees for their continued efforts towards delivering results in our core business building on our products innovation activities and marketing support, expanding our capabilities to enhance future growth and achieving our synergy and cost-savings goals. This strong execution continues to position the company well for the remainder of this fiscal year and the longer term. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark Belgya."

I will begin by providing additional color on our second quarter results and then conclude with our outlook for the full year. 
Net sales decreased by $164 million or 8% in the quarter. The prior year's divestiture of the canned milk business detracted 3 percentage points as did volume/mix, which was driven by pet food, coffee and peanut butter. Lower net price realization had a 2% impact and was mostly attributable to coffee. The impact of foreign exchange was immaterial. 
GAAP earnings per share were $1.52 this quarter, 3% above the prior year. Factoring in non-GAAP adjustment for unallocated derivative gains and losses, amortization expense and special project costs, which are all summarized in this morning's press release, adjusted EPS was $2.05, an increase of 7%. 
Adjusted growth profit declined at a significantly slower rate than sales, resulting in a 190 basis point improvement in gross margin to 39.6%. Year-over-year, gross margin expansion was realized in all 3 U.S. Retail segments, most significantly for coffee. 
Overall commodity costs were lower in the quarter, driven by green coffee and offset the impact of lower net pricing. Reduced manufacturing overhead costs and incremental synergies contributed to gross margin growth. 
SD&A decreased $27 million in the second quarter or 7% compared to 2016, mostly attributable to incremental synergies. Excluding the benefits of synergies, marketing expense increased slightly for the quarter. 
As Mark indicated, a portion of the marketing spend originally planned for the second quarter is now being shifted to the fourth quarter to support the launch of Nature's Recipe brand in grocery and mass channels. For the full year, we expect marketing expense to be up approximately $35 million or 8% across the company. 
Adjusted operating income for the second quarter was flat with the prior year while operating margin increased 170 basis points to 20.7%. Below the operating income line, lower interest and income tax expenses and a decrease in the number of shares outstanding contributed to the earnings per share growth. We now expect the full year effective tax rate to be consistent with our year-to-date rate of approximately 33% compared to our previous guidance of 33.5%. 
Let me expand our segment results. Beginning with coffee, second quarter net sales decreased 6%. Lower net price realization drove 5 percentage points of this decline, reflecting the full quarter impact of the 6% list price decline taken in May of this year across most of the coffee portfolio. Negative volume/mix had a 1% impact in the quarter. 
Net sales for the Folgers brand  declined 10% with lower net price realization and volume/mix contributing somewhat equally. 
For the Dunkin' Donuts brand, sales were up 4% as lower pricing was offset by strong volume/mix growth for bag and K-Cup offerings. 
Lastly, Café Bustelo sales were up 20% as the momentum for this brand continues. 
Coffee segment profit grew 3% compared to the prior year, with segment margin increasing 300 basis points to 33.8%. The net impact of lower pricing, as compared to the recognition of lower cost, was favorable to segment profit in the quarter and more than offset unfavorable volume/mix and a higher marketing spend. 
Turning to Consumer Foods. Net sales were down 4%, excluding the canned milk divestiture, mostly due to unfavorable volume/mix. 
Looking at the key brands, Jif was down 12%. For nut butters, this reflected lower volume, partially attributed to the timing of shipments, along with lower pricing while Jif Bars continue to have strong growth. 
Sales for the Smucker brands were up 4%, driven by the return to double-digit growth for Uncrustables frozen sandwiches. 
In the bake aisle, sales for Crisco were down slightly as growth in oil was offset by a decline in shortening. And Pillsbury brand sales decreased high single digits on lower volume. 
Consumer Foods segment profit declined 7%, attributable to lapping $12 million of prior year earnings related to the divested milk business. Excluding this impact, segment profit was up 3% as reduced manufacturing cost offset lower volume/mix and net price realization and an increase in marketing. 
Net sales for our pet food segment decreased 6%, primarily reflecting volume/mix. Lower sales were driven by a high single digit declines for our mainstream pet food brands, including Meow Mix and Kibbles 'n Bits. 
While sales for our largest pet snacks brands, Milk-Bone and Pepperoni were comparable to a strong performance in the prior year, a decline for Milo's Kitchen and the exit of some private label businesses were key drivers with 6% decrease across our pet snacks portfolio. Sales for our premium Natural Balance brand declined 1%. 
Pet Food segment profit was consistent with the prior year as the sales shortfall was offset by reduced input cost, incremental synergy realization and a slight reduction in marketing for the quarter. 
Net sales for International and Foodservice declined 3% compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of the canned milk divestiture, net sales were down 1% as favorable volume/mix was offset by lower price realization. Segment profit decreased 7% compared to a very strong second quarter in the prior year. Approximately half of this decline was due to lapping $2 million of prior year profit related to the divested milk business. 
In addition, the net impact of pricing and cost was unfavorable and only partially offset by favorable volume/mix and lower marketing. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $136 million for the quarter. This compares to $276 million in the prior year, which included benefits related to our working capital initiatives. Factoring in capital expenditures of $34 million, free cash flow was $103 million in the second quarter, bringing the first half total to $291 million. We continue to project full year free cash flow of $1 billion assuming CapEx of $240 million. While this implies a significant acceleration of free cash flow in the back half the year, this is consistent with our historical trends and our current working capital assumptions. 
During the second quarter, we paid down an additional $100 million on our term loan and ended the quarter with total debt of $5.35 billion. 
Based on trailing 12-month EBITDA of nearly $1.6 billion, our leverage currently stands at just under 3.4x. We continue to target a leverage ratio of 3.1x by the end of this fiscal year. 
Let me conclude with an update on our full year sales and earnings outlook, which remain unchanged from our most recent guidance. Excluding the 2 percentage point impact of the divested milk business, we continue to expect net sales to be in the range of flat to down 1% compared to the prior year. This implies a return to organic sales growth for the back half of fiscal 2017, including the anticipated impact of commodity inflation in certain categories, contributions from the launch of Nature's Recipe and the continued strong growth of Uncrustables in both retail and the foodservice channel. 
In addition, we continue to project adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.60 to $7.75 with a bias toward the middle to high end of this range. While this is unchanged from our previous guidance, there are a few puts and takes reflected on our outlook. Most notably, the benefit from the lower projected tax rate is expected to be offset by incremental investments in support of the Nature's Recipe launch. 
In closing, while the challenges to revenue growth persist in certain categories, partially driven by the benefit of favorable commodity cost being passed on to our consumers, we remain pleased with our earnings performance. In addition, we continue to make meaningful progress executing on our key initiatives to improve top line trends moving forward. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to achieve solid financial results this fiscal year and beyond.

And that large mainstream business has provided a platform. And I think, in Mark's comments, we talked about 20% growth on Bustelo. Our Dunkin' K-Cup business up 12%, our Dunkin' bag business up. So I think it's allowed us to really manage the mix game. It's allowed us to manage where we are large and where we can scratch out those segments that are growing. You've got to dig into the details in our coffee business. I think in Mark's scripted comments, the OPP item is down, our lowest-priced item is down, but our mainstream 30.9 ounce classic roast item is up 2%. So there's a lot of work going on  within each one of these businesses. And we're able to, by managing mix, bring both margin and the right things in. Same thing in Consumer Foods, we've got Sahale, we had good performance from Sahale in the quarter, the Jif bars snacks.

It will be the Nature's Recipe rollout. It will be Uncrustables. But then in some of the other businesses, for example, Jif, I think you're going to see a turnaround there.

First of all, the Nature's Recipe piece is important. And we do expect a very healthy launch of that product. And then Steve's point, of course, around inflation, we already have taken actually a price increase on the Smucker's brand. And then I would also point to consumption data. As we look at consumption data on most of our categories, the share loss, if there is one, is very modest. And so we're seeing turns remain relatively strong. I would point to peanut butter as an example. We had a very soft quarter in peanut butter. But as we dug into those numbers, we did see several customers adjusting inventories. We would expect some of that to come back. And the consumption data around peanut butter remains reasonably strong as well. So I think that all of those things put together give us some confidence in the back half."

And as we look at what the consumer is looking for in the mass and grocery channels, we believe that is the right brand. The acceptance from the retailers, as we've taken that out as part of the launch, has been -- has exceeded our expectations. So we definitely believe that's the right brand. Our retailers have confirmed with us. It's the right brand, it's the right time and we're the right company to bring that brand into the segment. From a growth perspective, we are developing a marketing communications plan. We'll have marketing in place fourth quarter to support the launch. And then we'll have a national campaign next year, really, to speak to the attributes of the brand. From a competitive or a reaction from the pet specialty retailers, we shared our decision with them when -- right upfront when we made the decision to launch. And we anticipate that both of those retailers will continue to support the brand in their stores.

If you look in the last quarter, we're down just under 6%. So I think that speaks to the positive trends when you get priced right. You also have to market the brand and have communications directed at the consumer. So we will be back marketing that brand in FY '18. We are refreshing packaging. We're bringing some innovation to the category. So I think those are -- it's just the fundamentals of marketing a brand, especially when you're up against major competitors like we are.

I think the one thing that I would like to maybe address here while we're on the subject of marketing, it's probably on some folks' mind. But I'm sure everyone recalls at the end of Q1, we had indicated that part of the over-delivery. I guess our first quarter was due to a time shift in marketing spend. And we had anticipated that a fair amount of that, which was pet related would slide into Q2 and kind of guided to that. As it turned out, shortly after we got into Q2, we had landed on our decision around Nature's Recipe. And just as I think, and Barry, I want to  speak for you, but I think that the pet team sort of stepped back and said, ""How do we want to make sure that we have a successful launch?"" We really took pause and challenged them on their working spend and some of the other areas. So what happened then is we've shifted it, once again, if you will, into Q4. So a lot of these dollars we've talked about in Q2 shifting or just moving into Q4 and that clearly contributed a little bit to the earnings for the quarter.

It's a -- predominantly a branded category across multiple segments. Obviously, snacks and this premium segment are very important. And so if you think about similarly to other businesses that we're in, our strategy is always to play in all of the segments if we can and then make sure that when we're thinking about growth and incrementality, we really want to make sure we're focusing on those areas where we can achieve the most growth. So obviously, snacks will be -- we'll continue to focus on. But if you think about premium pet, whether it is pet specialty, which is a very important channel for us as well as the mass channel, our goal is really to have a stronger presence in both. So we obviously went into -- we expanded our presence in -- with Natural Balance early on after we acquired the business, which is, obviously, a good thing, and we're going to continue to support that brand. There's national advertising as well as just leveraging our scale in the mainstream channels. And again, going back to just the fact that we really believe with this Nature's Recipe because it's an existing brand and because, even though it is a smaller brand in that channel, it is known as a premium -- a more premium brand at an affordable price. And so that's why we think it fits nicely in that channel. So just really, it is about strategy and making sure we're in the growth segments."

I think in terms -- and maybe I'll ask for Mark to comment on this in a moment, but just in terms of what we're looking for and what's out there, there are a number of assets that you can imagine that I would call more of the small to mid-sized bolt-on opportunities, a lot around sort of the trends, whether it's convenience, good -- and good-for-you type products, clean label products, a lot in the natural space. And so we have been looking and have not necessarily limited ourselves just because where we are from a leveraged position, particularly as it relates to bolt-ons, and we'll continue to do that. In terms of where we would lever, we went over 4x with the transaction of Big Heart. And what I would frame in is to say that we were comfortable there. And the reason we were comfortable is the cash generation that came out of that transaction, both from the business itself and the synergy opportunities, and the quickness of the pay down made it comfortable. So is that a hard and fast target? Maybe, maybe not. But certainly, we've proven that we were willing to go up there as long as there is a good sense of the cash generation out of that."

Rob, I think there's a couple of things we need to think about today versus then. Obviously, we took coffee pricing down because we had coffee cost that could support that. Coffee costs were relatively low even compared to any kind of averages, right? So it would be reasonable to think that in that kind of environment, we would have been longer than normal, right? And so as we've seen coffee cost go up, yes, they're up, but they're only up. If you think about $1.70 Arabica, it's not that much over the 5- or 10-year average, right? So those are not high coffee costs. If you think about what we've seen in past years in the $2, $2.50, $2.70 type of thing. So we don't think Arabica is in -- anywhere near those kinds of price points. We've also learned a lot from that one instance where we took price up and we crossed 2 deciles. If you remember, we took 2 deciles on our key promoted sizes. And we would have coverage in place that would not cause us to have to do that. So if there is pricing in coffee, we think it will be much more measured. And then the last thing I'll remind you, Rob, is the downsize we did in the container. And so if you remember in that time frame, our competitor was promoting an 11% smaller container than we were, and now that our containers are similar. So I think there's a couple of dynamics that would suggest the coffee pricing that we would see today are project, certainly through this fiscal year, but well into next year. It's not going to put us in the position that we were in when it impacted our margins. So we feel good about it."

I mean, mass right now has always been sort of a flat to just modestly above. We clearly have been running below that, but that's kind of where we see that category. It's a little plenary quite candidly to give you a really good number on the traditional grocery and mass channel just because we need to sort of see the effect of Nature's Recipe. I just --  I think Barry has commented about what we expect from the distribution capability of that Nature's Recipe. And there's enough out there that you can do some comparables to see kind of where the expectation is there. And then in specialty, I know that we've commented previously that the channel has slowed some. I think other competitors have noted similarities. But to Barry's point, albeit somewhat still small, but growing, the e-commerce cannot be taken lightly. And we still think there's a lot of opportunity in that channel. I think the other thing I'd reinforce in the Natural -- or the specialty area of for us, in particular, is there's still profitability opportunity. And we've seen that start to turn. We've talked about that. That was certainly an under-indexed category force as it related to our segment profit, we're seeing turns on that. So we still feel good about those channels. And again, I think with e-commerce, the Natural Balance focus, we'll see good growth."

I think you've heard that talked about in our peers, our competitors' releases. And so our K-Cups in actual units and equivalent volume are up, both in Folgers, in Dunkin' and up dramatically, and quite frankly, in Bustelo, although a small business. That volume gain translates into dollar gains in Bustelo and in Dunkin'. The dollars are down a little bit in Folgers only because of the pricing that we've taken to support that. But the total K-Cup business is up nicely. So we feel really good the fact that our legacy K-Cup business grew in units. Our Dunkin' business is up dramatically. And our Bustelo business, frankly, is on fire. So those segments, all 3 were helping drive the mix on our coffee business."

Our OPP business is relatively small in the mix, and it's concentrated in the retailers you would expect it to become concentrated in. It's a big business at the value retailers, right, whether that be the dollar channel, mass retail channel, the club channel, okay? So those SKUs exist in those environments where the consumer goes for value. When you're promoting our 30.9 ounce canister at $6.99, a small difference in the everyday price of OPP does -- is not that exciting to the consumer. So yes, that will be a backstop for those consumers as coffee pricing moves up. But moving coffee price from, say, $6.99 to $7.99 doesn't scare me there. I think, Mark mentioned this in his opening, when OPP becomes very attractive is when you get to those $9.99, $10.99 price points. We have seen that in history. Remember, we downsized the canister. So I think we're insulated from some of that. So I don't want us to think that $1.70 Arabica takes us into any price point that we should all be afraid of, right? We obviously still think this is relatively moderately priced Arabica. So I think we're some way away from us having a discussion where we will be concerned about that the absolute price points having some kind of dramatic effect and swinging our volume within our mix."

I think one way to think about our synergy number is we're talking about $100 million incremental through this year and $140 million capture through the end of this fiscal. But with programs in place, I would say that we're probably on a run rate right now at $180 million to $185 million. So said differently, we've got about $15 million to $20 million to tie down here in the next several months, and we'll have that $200 million locked in as we head into fiscal '18. So we're in really good shape. And the other comment, Akshay, I would say about synergies is on the SD&A, one of the things -- we talked about marketing. I know there's probably some discussion about the market shift being a major contributor to the earnings. But we did deliver pretty significant reductions in our, what I would call, administrative costs. So is that a combination of synergy recognitions? Though some of the additional synergies were falling there and some are quite candidly just very strong cost management across those organizations. So some of those dollars are just incremental savings program that people put in place above and beyond the $200 million synergy target."

So if we can get a couple of pennies right on each one of those slopes, if our slope between 18 ounce and 32 ounces is right on, what's going to drive the most volume at the best price point? We can make some headway on that.

This continues to be an exciting and dynamic time at Smucker, as we are delivering on both our current year priorities and our long-term goals. This includes another quarter of record adjusted earnings per share as we continue to achieve our targets for synergies and cost savings. 
Second quarter results also benefited from the strong performance of the Uncrustables, Dunkin' Donuts, Café Bustelo and Smucker's brands, along with contributions from innovation, as new products introduced in the past 3 years contributed 9% of our net sales in the quarter. 
In addition, we are investing in new capabilities to support the growth of our brands and on-trend platforms. We are making good progress on our journey to enhance innovation, e-commerce, our go-to-market skill set and revenue management capabilities. 
One of the key initiatives that we are thrilled to share this morning is the decision to launch our Nature's Recipe premium pet food brand into the mainstream grocery and mass channels, which I will discuss in a moment. 
All of these efforts will position us to meet our long-term objectives for top and bottom line growth and deliver against our consumer-centric vision to engage, delight and inspire our consumers. 
With that background, let me provide a brief overview of our second quarter results. Excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange, net sales decreased 5% compared to 2016. This included a 2% impact from lower pricing, primarily reflecting a list price decline in coffee taken earlier in the fiscal year. Lower pet food and peanut butter sales also contributed. With the anticipated impact of commodity inflation in certain categories and contributions from the launch of Nature's Recipe, we continue to project full year net sales to be in the range of flat to down 1% compared to 2016. 
For the second quarter, adjusted operating income was in line with the prior year, as the decrease in net sales was more than offset by lower input costs and incremental synergies. Aided by a lower tax rate and a decrease in shares, adjusted earnings per share grew 7% to $2.05, exceeding our previous estimate for the quarter. This was mostly attributable to higher-than-planned segment profit for Pet Food and a continued focus on controlling administrative expenses. 
For Pet, the over-delivery reflected a decision to reallocate a portion of our planned second quarter marketing spend to the fourth quarter to support the Nature's Recipe launch. For the full year, we remain on track to achieve our previously stated guidance for adjusted earnings per share. 
As I turn to the U.S. Retail segments, I would highlight that in each of our businesses, not only do we compete in every segment of each category, but are strategically focused on those segments where we can achieve the most long-term growth. 
Beginning with coffee. Profit was up 3% over the prior year despite the anticipated top line impact of price declines. In terms of the brands, volume for Folgers roast and ground coffee decreased 5%, reflecting a decline in our opening price point value offerings. However, Folgers K-Cup volume increased in the quarter, responding favorably to planned price investments. 
For the Dunkin' Donuts brand, bagged coffee volume was up 6%, as lower prices supported by favorable input cost have improved the competitive position of the brand. In addition, Dunkin' K-Cups achieved double-digit volume growth in the quarter, including contributions from new varieties. And the brand continues to gain market share in the one-cup segment. 
Our Café Bustelo brand also realized double-digit growth in the second quarter for both its roast and ground and K-Cup offerings, and we anticipate this trend to carry into the back half of the year. 
Turning briefly to the green coffee market, both Arabica and Robusta futures increased further lately. However, we continue to recognize lower green coffee cost in the second quarter. 
While we do not disclose our hedged position, we remain confident in our ability to adjust pricing when warranted by our recognized costs as we have managed pricing in the past during periods of significantly higher green coffee markets. 
Within our Consumer Foods segment, the second quarter performance of peanut butter was weaker than last year, with a high single-digit volume decline for the Jif brand. This was partially attributable to the timing of shipments, as consumption and market share trends remained comparable to the prior year. With upcoming merchandising support and additional marketing investments, we anticipate peanut butter sales to improve in the back half of the year. 
The Smucker's brand delivered solid performance in the second quarter. As expected, volume rebounded in the quarter for Uncrustables frozen sandwiches following a softer first quarter, which was related to timing of customer shipments. Volume was up 13% in the second quarter. And year-to-date, Uncrustables' volume is now up 6% in our Retail business. We expect double-digit growth for the full year. 
In addition, our snacking platform continues to gain traction beyond Uncrustables, as Sahale Snacks and Jif Bars also delivered sales growth in the quarter and gained new points of distribution. 
Lastly, as it relates to the Pillsbury brand, aggressive competitive activities continue to influence the overall baking category and impact top line performance, trends we expect to continue as we proceed through the Fall Bake period. However, Pillsbury and all our bake aisle brands remain key contributors to overall segment profit, which we also expect to continue. 
Turning to the Pet Food segment, we are excited to share our plans to offer premium dog food in grocery and mass outlets through the introduction of the Nature's Recipe brand in these channels. Nature's Recipe premium pet food has a long history participating in the pet specialty channel and is uniquely positioned to meet the consumers' increasing desire for natural and wellness offerings at accessible price points. This launch allows us to participate in the fast-growing premium segment within traditional grocery outlets and leverage our scale in these channels. 
Retailer response to the introduction has been very enthusiastic, and our teams are doing a fantastic job executing our launch plans. Initial shipments should occur near the beginning of the fourth quarter, supported by strong marketing and merchandising efforts. We expect this launch will complement our actions to stabilize the Kibbles 'n Bits brand and will benefit our entire dog food portfolio, providing a strong presence in each segment of the mainstream dog food category. 
Looking at the rest of the Pet Food business. Top line performance for Meow Mix cat food was soft in the second quarter, as anticipated. As we transition out underperforming SKUs, we are confident about driving future growth with new on-trend offerings, such as our latest innovation, Meow Mix Bistro, along with investments in TV advertising and pricing support. 
Sales for pet snacks were down mid-single digits in the quarter against a strong prior year comp. For the Milk-Bone brand, sales were down low single digits, with a portion of that -- of the decline being timing-related, reflecting a shift in the promotional calendar. For the rest of the snacks portfolio, the exit of certain private label businesses and the impact of competitive activities, particularly on our Milo's Kitchen brand, also contributed. With future innovation underway and an upcoming package redesign, we anticipate growth of Milo's Kitchen over the long term as protein-based snacks increase in popularity. 
Within premium pet food, sales for the Natural Balance brand were down slightly in the quarter, reflecting the recent slowdown in the overall pet superstore channel. However, we project a stronger back half of the year for Natural Balance, supported by the ongoing national advertising campaign. 
Finally, our synergy and cost-savings activities remain on track, as our diligence around cost management and a continuous improvement mindset is greater than ever. In the second quarter, we realized $29 million of incremental synergies, bringing our year-to-date total to approximately $60 million. We continue to anticipate $100 million of incremental synergies for the full fiscal year, with the potential for some upside to this estimate. Including the $37 million realized in fiscal 2016, this would bring our total to nearly $140 million of the $200 million anticipated by the end of fiscal 2018. 
In addition, we continue to target $50 million of additional annual cost savings to be realized over the next few years related to our previously announced organizational redesign program and plant closures. As we have indicated, we expect to initially invest much of these incremental savings in several identified areas that I mentioned earlier that will ultimately support top line growth. 
In closing, I would like to thank our employees for their continued efforts towards delivering results in our core business building on our product innovation activities and marketing support, expanding our capabilities to enhance future growth and achieving our synergy and cost-savings goals. This strong execution continues to position the company well for the remainder of this fiscal year and the longer term. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark Belgya."

Smucker Company","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I will begin by providing additional color on our second quarter results and then conclude with our outlook for the full year. Net sales decreased by $164 million or 8% in the quarter. The prior year's divest",1325,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I will begin by providing additional color on our second quarter results and then conclude with our outlook for the full year. 
Net sales decreased by $164 million or 8% in the quarter. The prior year's divestiture of the canned milk business detracted 3 percentage points, as did volume/mix, which was driven by pet food, coffee and peanut butter. Lower net price realization had a 2% impact and was mostly attributable to coffee. The impact of foreign exchange was immaterial. 
GAAP earnings per share were $1.52 this quarter, 3% above the prior year. Factoring in non-GAAP adjustments for unallocated derivative gains and losses, amortization expense and special project costs, which are all summarized in this morning's press release, adjusted EPS was $2.05, an increase of 7%. 
Adjusted gross profit declined at a significantly slower rate than sales, resulting in a 190 basis point improvement in gross margin to 39.6%. Year-over-year gross margin expansion was realized in all 3 U.S. Retail segments, most significantly for coffee. 
Overall commodity costs were lower in the quarter, driven by green coffee and offset the impact of lower net pricing. Reduced manufacturing overhead costs and incremental synergies contributed to gross margin growth. 
SD&A decreased $27 million in the second quarter or 7% compared to 2016, mostly attributable to incremental synergies. Excluding the benefits of synergies, marketing expense increased slightly for the quarter. 
As Mark indicated, a portion of the marketing spend originally planned for the second quarter is now being shifted to the fourth quarter to support the launch of Nature's Recipe brand in grocery and mass channels. For the full year, we expect marketing expense to be up approximately $35 million or 8% across the company. 
Adjusted operating income for the second quarter was flat with the prior year while operating margin increased 170 basis points to 20.7%. Below the operating income line, lower interest and income tax expenses and a decrease in the number of shares outstanding contributed to the earnings per share growth. We now expect the full year effective tax rate to be consistent with our year-to-date rate of approximately 33% compared to our previous guidance of 33.5%. 
Let me expand on our segment results. Beginning with coffee, second quarter net sales decreased 6%. Lower net price realization drove 5 percentage points of this decline, reflecting the full quarter impact of the 6% list price decline taken in May of this year across most of the coffee portfolio. Negative volume/mix had a 1% impact in the quarter. 
Net sales for the Folgers brand declined 10%, with lower net price realization and volume/mix contributing somewhat equally. 
For the Dunkin' Donuts brand, sales were up 4%, as lower pricing was offset by strong volume/mix growth for bagged and K-Cup offerings. 
Lastly, Café Bustelo sales were up 20%, as the momentum for this brand continues. 
Coffee segment profit grew 3% compared to the prior year, with segment margin increasing 300 basis points to 33.8%. The net impact of lower pricing, as compared to the recognition of lower cost, was favorable to segment profit in the quarter and more than offset unfavorable volume/mix and a higher marketing spend. 
Turning to Consumer Foods. Net sales were down 4%, excluding the canned milk divestiture, mostly due to unfavorable volume/mix. 
Looking at the key brands. Jif was down 12%. For nut butters, this reflected lower volume, partially attributed to the timing of shipments, along with lower pricing, while Jif Bars continue to have strong growth. 
Sales for the Smucker brands were up 4%, driven by the return to double-digit growth for Uncrustables frozen sandwiches. 
In the bake aisle, sales for Crisco were down slightly, as growth in oils was offset by a decline in shortening. And Pillsbury brand sales decreased high single digits on lower volume. 
Consumer Foods segment profit declined 7%, attributable to lapping $12 million of prior year earnings related to the divested milk business. Excluding this impact, segment profit was up 3%, as reduced manufacturing cost offset lower volume/mix and net price realization and an increase in marketing. 
Net sales for our Pet Food segment decreased 6%, primarily reflecting volume/mix. Lower sales were driven by a high single-digit declines for our mainstream pet food brands, including Meow Mix and Kibbles 'n Bits. 
While sales for our largest pet snack brands, Milk-Bone and Pup-Peroni, were comparable to a strong performance in the prior year, a decline for Milo's Kitchen and the exit of some private label businesses were key drivers, with 6% decrease across our pet snacks portfolio. Sales for our premium Natural Balance brand declined 1%. 
Pet Food segment profit was consistent with the prior year, as the sales shortfall was offset by reduced input cost, incremental synergy realization and a slight reduction in marketing for the quarter. 
Net sales for International and Foodservice declined 3% compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of the canned milk divestiture, net sales were down 1%, as favorable volume/mix was offset by lower price realization. Segment profit decreased 7% compared to a very strong second quarter in the prior year. Approximately half of this decline was due to lapping $2 million of prior year profit related to the divested milk business. 
In addition, the net impact of pricing and cost was unfavorable and only partially offset by favorable volume/mix and lower marketing. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $136 million for the quarter. This compares to $276 million in the prior year, which included benefits related to our working capital initiatives. Factoring in capital expenditures of $34 million, free cash flow was $103 million in the second quarter, bringing the first half total to $291 million. We continue to project full year free cash flow of $1 billion, assuming CapEx of $240 million. While this implies a significant acceleration of free cash flow in the back half the year, this is consistent with our historical trends and our current working capital assumptions. 
During the second quarter, we paid down an additional $100 million on our term loan and ended the quarter with total debt of $5.35 billion. 
Based on trailing 12-month EBITDA of nearly $1.6 billion, our leverage currently stands at just under 3.4x. We continue to target a leverage ratio of 3.1x by the end of this fiscal year. 
Let me conclude with an update on our full year sales and earnings outlook, which remain unchanged from our most recent guidance. Excluding the 2 percentage point impact of the divested milk business, we continue to expect net sales to be in the range of flat to down 1% compared to the prior year. This implies a return to organic sales growth for the back half of fiscal 2017, including the anticipated impact of commodity inflation in certain categories, contributions from the launch of Nature's Recipe and the continued strong growth of Uncrustables in both retail and the foodservice channel. 
In addition, we continue to project adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.60 to $7.75, with a bias toward the middle to high end of this range. While this is unchanged from our previous guidance, there are a few puts and takes reflected in our outlook. Most notably, the benefit from the lower projected tax rate is expected to be offset by incremental investments in support of the Nature's Recipe launch. 
In closing, while the challenges to revenue growth persist in certain categories, partially driven by the benefit of favorable commodity cost being passed on to our consumers, we remain pleased with our earnings performance. In addition, we continue to make meaningful progress executing on our key initiatives to improve top line trends moving forward. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to achieve solid financial results this fiscal year and beyond.

So I think it's allowed us to really manage the mix game. It's allowed us to manage where we are large and where we can scratch out those segments that are growing. You've got to dig into the details in our coffee business. I think in Mark's scripted comments, the OPP item is down, our lowest-priced item is down, but our mainstream 30.9-ounce classic roast item is up 2%.

As we look at consumption data on most of our categories, the share loss, if there is one, is very modest. And so we're seeing turns remain relatively strong. I would point to peanut butter as an example. We had a very soft quarter in peanut butter. But as we dug into those numbers, we did see several customers adjusting inventories. We would expect some of that to come back. And the consumption data around peanut butter remains reasonably strong as well. So I think that all of those things put together give us some confidence in the back half."

The acceptance from the retailers, as we've taken that out as part of the launch, has been -- has exceeded our expectations. So we definitely believe that's the right brand. Our retailers have confirmed with us it's the right brand, it's the right time and we're the right company to bring that brand into the segment. From a growth perspective, we are developing a marketing communications plan. We'll have marketing in place fourth quarter to support the launch. And then we'll have a national campaign next year, really, to speak to the attributes of the brand. From a competitive or a reaction from the pet specialty retailers, we shared our decision with them when -- right upfront when we made the decision to launch. And we anticipate that both of those retailers will continue to support the brand in their stores. And so again, I think it speaks to the strength of the brand in both pet specialty as well as the potential that it has in mass and grocery."

And I think with our bonus bags in place, we're certainly seeing the benefit of being priced right. Just to give some color there, if we think about our key -- one of our major retailers, the #1 retailer, who over-indexes on Kibbles 'n Bits, that brand was down -- if you look at a 12-month period, we're down 12%. If you look in the last quarter, we're down just under 6%. So I think that speaks to the positive trends when you get price right. You also have to market the brand and have communications directed at the consumer. So we will be back marketing that brand in FY '18. We are refreshing packaging. We're bringing some innovation to the category. So I think those are -- it's just the fundamentals of marketing a brand, especially when you're up against major competitors like we are. So I think those are some of the learnings and we're seeing some nice positive trends.

I think the one thing that I would like to maybe address here while we're on the subject of marketing, because it's probably on some folks' mind. But I'm sure everyone recalls at the end of Q1, we had indicated that part of the over-delivery against our first quarter was due to a time shift in marketing spend. And we had anticipated that a fair amount of that, which was pet related, would slide into Q2 and kind of guided to that. As it turned out, shortly after we got into Q2, we had landed on our decision around Nature's Recipe. And just as I think, and Barry, I don't want to speak for you, but I think that the Pet team sort of stepped back and said, ""How do we want to make sure that we have a successful launch?"" We really took pause and challenged some of our marketing spend in some of the other areas. So what's happened then is we've shifted it, once again, if you will, into Q4. So a lot of those dollars we talked about in Q2 shifting or just moving into Q4, and that clearly contributed a little bit to the earnings for the quarter. So I don't know, guys, if you had any other comments around trade spend trend that you're seeing?"

But if you come out of -- if you look at peanut butter, if you look at coffee, if you look at our baking businesses, our oils business, those are traditionally trade spend businesses. I don't think there any surprises competitively across our Fall Bake merchandising or the merchandising into the third quarter."

But if you think about premium pet, whether it is pet specialty, which is a very important channel for us, as well as the mass channel, our goal is really to have a stronger presence in both. So we obviously went into -- we expanded our presence in -- with Natural Balance early on after we acquired the business, which was obviously a good thing, and we're going to continue to support that brand, there's national advertising, as well as just leveraging our scale in the mainstream channels. And again, going back to just the fact that we really believe with this Nature's Recipe, because it's an existing brand and because, even though it is a smaller brand in that channel, it is known as a premium -- a more premium brand at an affordable price.

And so we have been looking and have not necessarily limited ourselves just because where we are from a leverage position, particularly as it relates to bolt-ons, and we'll continue to do that. In terms of where we would lever, we went over 4x with the transaction of Big Heart. And what I would frame in is to say that we were comfortable there. And the reason we were comfortable is the cash generation that came out of that transaction, both from the business itself and the synergy opportunities, and the quickness of the pay down, made it comfortable. So is that a hard and fast target? Maybe, maybe not. But certainly, we've proven that we're willing to go up there as long as there is a good sense of the cash generation out of that."

Rob, I think there's a couple of things we need to think about today versus then. Obviously, we took coffee pricing down because we had coffee cost that could support that. Coffee costs were relatively low, even compared to any kind of averages, right? So it would be reasonable to think that in that kind of environment, we would have been longer than normal, right? And so as we've seen coffee cost go up, yes, they're up, but they're only up, if you think about a $1.70 Arabica, it's not that much over the 5- or 10-year average, right? So those are not high coffee costs. If you think about what we've seen in past years in the $2, $2.50, $2.70 type of thing. So we don't think Arabica is in -- in anywhere near those kinds of price points. We've also learned a lot from that one instance where we took price up and we crossed 2 deciles. If you remember, we took 2 deciles on our key promoted sizes. And we would have coverage in place that would not cause us to have to do that. So if there is pricing in coffee, we think it will be much more measured. And then the last thing I'd remind you of is the downsize we did in the container. And so if you remember in that time frame, our competitor was promoting an 11% smaller container than we were, and now that our containers are similar. So I think there's a couple of dynamics that would suggest the coffee pricing that we would see today or project, certainly through this fiscal year, but well into next year, is not going to put us in the position that we were in when it impacted our margins. So we feel good about it."

Just happy to answer that for you as well. As far as Meow Mix is concerned, we have had some of the most significant innovation against that brand this past year in the form of our Bistro launch, with the strategy of how do we leverage our strength in dry across wet and treats. The -- that launch, where we have that product placed has gone very well. We've seen trial and repeat strong. And we have advertising in place supporting that brand and that launch. So we're not off air. We're actually on air advertising. Sorry if you haven't seen that. But we are supporting that launch. And we're starting to see some nice momentum behind our total Meow Mix brand as a result of that launch. And we'll continue to fill distribution gaps with Bistro based on its performance in market. So we think that was the right decision across our -- what we're calling our Meow Mix total solution across each segment in cat. So innovation is performing well and we think that has strengthened our position across the cat food category."

I just --  I think Barry's comment about what we expect from the distribution capability of that Nature's Recipe. And there's enough out there that you can do some comparables to see kind of where the expectation is there. And then in specialty, I know that we've commented previously that the channel has slowed some. I think other competitors have noted similarities. But Barry's point, albeit somewhat still small, but growing, the e-commerce cannot be taken lightly. And we still think there's a lot of opportunity in that channel. I think the other thing I'd reinforce in the Natural -- or the specialty area for us, in particular, is there's still profitability opportunity. And we've seen that start to turn. We've talked about that. That was certainly an under-indexed category for us in Pet as it related to our segment profit, we're seeing turns on that. So we still feel good about those channels.

And so our K-Cups in actual units and equivalent volume are up, both in Folgers, in Dunkin' and up dramatically, and quite frankly, in Bustelo, although a small business. That volume gain translates into dollar gains in Bustelo and in Dunkin'. The dollars are down a little bit in Folgers, only because of the pricing that we've taken to support that. But the total K-Cup business is up nicely. So we feel really good that the fact that our legacy K-Cup business grew in units.

So those SKUs exist in those environments where the consumer goes for value. When you're promoting our 30.9-ounce canister at $6.99, a small difference in the everyday price of OPP does -- is not that exciting to the consumer. So yes, that will be a backstop for those consumers as coffee pricing moves up. But moving coffee price from, say, $6.99 to $7.99 doesn't scare me there. I think, Mark mentioned this in his opening, when OPP becomes very attractive is when you get to those $9.99, $10.99 price points. We have seen that in history. Remember, we downsized the canister. So I think we're insulated from some of that. So I don't want us to think that a $1.70 Arabica takes us into any price point that we should all be afraid of, right? We obviously still think this is relatively moderately priced Arabica.

And you're right, we haven't adjusted. I think, we would like to get a little bit more time. But there's no indications that we will not continue down our synergy path. I think one way to think about our synergy number is we're talking about $100 million incremental through this year and $140 million capture through the end of this fiscal. But with programs in place, I would say that we're probably on a run rate right now to $180 million to $185 million. So said differently, we've got about $15 million to $20 million to tie down here in the next several months, and we'll have that $200 million locked in as we head into fiscal '18. So we're in really good shape. And the other comment, Akshay, I would say about synergies is on the SD&A, one of the things -- we talked about marketing. I know there's probably some discussion about the marketing shift being a major contributor to the earnings. But we did deliver pretty significant reductions in our, what I would call, our administrative costs. So and that's a combination of synergy recognitions, so some of the additional synergies were falling there and some are, quite candidly, just very strong cost management across those organizations. So some of those dollars are just incremental savings program that people put in place above and beyond the $200 million synergy target."

If you think about the fruit spread category, it includes a number of segments, a number of sizes and a number of different retailer environments, right?

So if we can get a couple of pennies right on each one of those slopes, if our slope between 18 ounce and 32 ounces is right on, what's going to drive the most volume at the best price point? We can make some headway on that. And I think the technology is there today and I think us, as well as many of our peers, have invested in human capital to leverage that technology to get some of those details right.

This continues to be an exciting and dynamic time at Smucker, as we are delivering on both our current year priorities and our long-term goals. This includes another quarter of record adjusted earnings per share as we continue to achieve our targets for synergies and cost savings. 
Second quarter results also benefited from the strong performance of the Uncrustables, Dunkin' Donuts, Café Bustelo and Smucker's brands, along with contributions from innovation, as new products introduced in the past 3 years contributed 9% of our net sales in the quarter. 
In addition, we are investing in new capabilities to support the growth of our brands and on-trend platforms. We are making good progress on our journey to enhance innovation, e-commerce, our go-to-market skill set and revenue management capabilities. 
One of the key initiatives that we are thrilled to share this morning is the decision to launch our Nature's Recipe premium pet food brand into the mainstream grocery and mass channels, which I will discuss in a moment. 
All of these efforts will position us to meet our long-term objectives for top and bottom line growth and deliver against our consumer-centric vision to engage, delight and inspire our consumers. 
With that background, let me provide a brief overview of our second quarter results. Excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange, net sales decreased 5% compared to 2016. This included a 2% impact from lower pricing, primarily reflecting a list price decline in coffee taken earlier in the fiscal year. Lower pet food and peanut butter sales also contributed. With the anticipated impact of commodity inflation in certain categories and contributions from the launch of Nature's Recipe, we continue to project full year net sales to be in the range of flat to down 1% compared to 2016. 
For the second quarter, adjusted operating income was in line with the prior year, as the decrease in net sales was more than offset by lower input costs and incremental synergies. Aided by a lower tax rate and a decrease in shares, adjusted earnings per share grew 7% to $2.05, exceeding our previous estimate for the quarter. This was mostly attributable to higher-than-planned segment profit for Pet Food and a continued focus on controlling administrative expenses. 
For Pet, the over-delivery reflected a decision to reallocate a portion of our planned second quarter marketing spend to the fourth quarter to support the Nature's Recipe launch. For the full year, we remain on track to achieve our previously stated guidance for adjusted earnings per share. 
As I turn to the U.S. Retail segments, I would highlight that in each of our businesses, not only do we compete in every segment of each category, but are strategically focused on those segments where we can achieve the most long-term growth. 
Beginning with coffee. Profit was up 3% over the prior year despite the anticipated top line impact of price declines. In terms of the brands, volume for Folgers roast and ground coffee decreased 5%, reflecting a decline in our opening price point value offerings. However, Folgers K-Cup volume increased in the quarter, responding favorably to planned price investments. 
For the Dunkin' Donuts brand, bagged coffee volume was up 6%, as lower prices supported by favorable input cost have improved the competitive position of the brand. In addition, Dunkin' K-Cups achieved double-digit volume growth in the quarter, including contributions from new varieties. And the brand continues to gain market share in the one-cup segment. 
Our Café Bustelo brand also realized double-digit growth in the second quarter for both its roast and ground and K-Cup offerings, and we anticipate this trend to carry into the back half of the year. 
Turning briefly to the green coffee market, both Arabica and Robusta futures increased further lately. However, we continue to recognize lower green coffee cost in the second quarter. 
While we do not disclose our hedged position, we remain confident in our ability to adjust pricing when warranted by our recognized costs as we have managed pricing in the past during periods of significantly higher green coffee markets. 
Within our Consumer Foods segment, the second quarter performance of peanut butter was weaker than last year, with a high single-digit volume decline for the Jif brand. This was partially attributable to the timing of shipments, as consumption and market share trends remained comparable to the prior year. With upcoming merchandising support and additional marketing investments, we anticipate peanut butter sales to improve in the back half of the year. 
The Smucker's brand delivered solid performance in the second quarter. As expected, volume rebounded in the quarter for Uncrustables frozen sandwiches following a softer first quarter, which was related to timing of customer shipments. Volume was up 13% in the second quarter. And year-to-date, Uncrustables' volume is now up 6% in our Retail business. We expect double-digit growth for the full year. 
In addition, our snacking platform continues to gain traction beyond Uncrustables, as Sahale Snacks and Jif Bars also delivered sales growth in the quarter and gained new points of distribution. 
Lastly, as it relates to the Pillsbury brand, aggressive competitive activities continue to influence the overall baking category and impact top line performance, trends we expect to continue as we proceed through the Fall Bake period. However, Pillsbury and all our bake aisle brands remain key contributors to overall segment profit, which we also expect to continue. 
Turning to the Pet Food segment, we are excited to share our plans to offer premium dog food in grocery and mass outlets through the introduction of the Nature's Recipe brand in these channels. Nature's Recipe premium pet food has a long history participating in the pet specialty channel and is uniquely positioned to meet the consumers' increasing desire for natural and wellness offerings at accessible price points. This launch allows us to participate in the fast-growing premium segment within traditional grocery outlets and leverage our scale in these channels. 
Retailer response to the introduction has been very enthusiastic, and our teams are doing a fantastic job executing our launch plans. Initial shipments should occur near the beginning of the fourth quarter, supported by strong marketing and merchandising efforts. We expect this launch will complement our actions to stabilize the Kibbles 'n Bits brand and will benefit our entire dog food portfolio, providing a strong presence in each segment of the mainstream dog food category. 
Looking at the rest of the Pet Food business. Top line performance for Meow Mix cat food was soft in the second quarter, as anticipated. As we transition out underperforming SKUs, we are confident about driving future growth with new on-trend offerings, such as our latest innovation, Meow Mix Bistro, along with investments in TV advertising and pricing support. 
Sales for pet snacks were down mid-single digits in the quarter against a strong prior year comp. For the Milk-Bone brand, sales were down low single digits, with a portion of that -- of the decline being timing-related, reflecting a shift in the promotional calendar. For the rest of the snacks portfolio, the exit of certain private label businesses and the impact of competitive activities, particularly on our Milo's Kitchen brand, also contributed. With future innovation underway and an upcoming package redesign, we anticipate growth of Milo's Kitchen over the long term as protein-based snacks increase in popularity. 
Within premium pet food, sales for the Natural Balance brand were down slightly in the quarter, reflecting the recent slowdown in the overall pet superstore channel. However, we project a stronger back half of the year for Natural Balance, supported by the ongoing national advertising campaign. 
Finally, our synergy and cost-savings activities remain on track, as our diligence around cost management and a continuous improvement mindset is greater than ever. In the second quarter, we realized $29 million of incremental synergies, bringing our year-to-date total to approximately $60 million. We continue to anticipate $100 million of incremental synergies for the full fiscal year, with the potential for some upside to this estimate. Including the $37 million realized in fiscal 2016, this would bring our total to nearly $140 million of the $200 million anticipated by the end of fiscal 2018. 
In addition, we continue to target $50 million of additional annual cost savings to be realized over the next few years related to our previously announced organizational redesign program and plant closures. As we have indicated, we expect to initially invest much of these incremental savings in several identified areas that I mentioned earlier that will ultimately support top line growth. 
In closing, I would like to thank our employees for their continued efforts towards delivering results in our core business building on our product innovation activities and marketing support, expanding our capabilities to enhance future growth and achieving our synergy and cost-savings goals. This strong execution continues to position the company well for the remainder of this fiscal year and the longer term. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark Belgya."

I will begin by providing additional color on our second quarter results and then conclude with our outlook for the full year. 
Net sales decreased by $164 million or 8% in the quarter. The prior year's divestiture of the canned milk business detracted 3 percentage points, as did volume/mix, which was driven by pet food, coffee and peanut butter. Lower net price realization had a 2% impact and was mostly attributable to coffee. The impact of foreign exchange was immaterial. 
GAAP earnings per share were $1.52 this quarter, 3% above the prior year. Factoring in non-GAAP adjustments for unallocated derivative gains and losses, amortization expense and special project costs, which are all summarized in this morning's press release, adjusted EPS was $2.05, an increase of 7%. 
Adjusted gross profit declined at a significantly slower rate than sales, resulting in a 190 basis point improvement in gross margin to 39.6%. Year-over-year gross margin expansion was realized in all 3 U.S. Retail segments, most significantly for coffee. 
Overall commodity costs were lower in the quarter, driven by green coffee and offset the impact of lower net pricing. Reduced manufacturing overhead costs and incremental synergies contributed to gross margin growth. 
SD&A decreased $27 million in the second quarter or 7% compared to 2016, mostly attributable to incremental synergies. Excluding the benefits of synergies, marketing expense increased slightly for the quarter. 
As Mark indicated, a portion of the marketing spend originally planned for the second quarter is now being shifted to the fourth quarter to support the launch of Nature's Recipe brand in grocery and mass channels. For the full year, we expect marketing expense to be up approximately $35 million or 8% across the company. 
Adjusted operating income for the second quarter was flat with the prior year while operating margin increased 170 basis points to 20.7%. Below the operating income line, lower interest and income tax expenses and a decrease in the number of shares outstanding contributed to the earnings per share growth. We now expect the full year effective tax rate to be consistent with our year-to-date rate of approximately 33% compared to our previous guidance of 33.5%. 
Let me expand on our segment results. Beginning with coffee, second quarter net sales decreased 6%. Lower net price realization drove 5 percentage points of this decline, reflecting the full quarter impact of the 6% list price decline taken in May of this year across most of the coffee portfolio. Negative volume/mix had a 1% impact in the quarter. 
Net sales for the Folgers brand declined 10%, with lower net price realization and volume/mix contributing somewhat equally. 
For the Dunkin' Donuts brand, sales were up 4%, as lower pricing was offset by strong volume/mix growth for bagged and K-Cup offerings. 
Lastly, Café Bustelo sales were up 20%, as the momentum for this brand continues. 
Coffee segment profit grew 3% compared to the prior year, with segment margin increasing 300 basis points to 33.8%. The net impact of lower pricing, as compared to the recognition of lower cost, was favorable to segment profit in the quarter and more than offset unfavorable volume/mix and a higher marketing spend. 
Turning to Consumer Foods. Net sales were down 4%, excluding the canned milk divestiture, mostly due to unfavorable volume/mix. 
Looking at the key brands. Jif was down 12%. For nut butters, this reflected lower volume, partially attributed to the timing of shipments, along with lower pricing, while Jif Bars continue to have strong growth. 
Sales for the Smucker brands were up 4%, driven by the return to double-digit growth for Uncrustables frozen sandwiches. 
In the bake aisle, sales for Crisco were down slightly, as growth in oils was offset by a decline in shortening. And Pillsbury brand sales decreased high single digits on lower volume. 
Consumer Foods segment profit declined 7%, attributable to lapping $12 million of prior year earnings related to the divested milk business. Excluding this impact, segment profit was up 3%, as reduced manufacturing cost offset lower volume/mix and net price realization and an increase in marketing. 
Net sales for our Pet Food segment decreased 6%, primarily reflecting volume/mix. Lower sales were driven by a high single-digit declines for our mainstream pet food brands, including Meow Mix and Kibbles 'n Bits. 
While sales for our largest pet snack brands, Milk-Bone and Pup-Peroni, were comparable to a strong performance in the prior year, a decline for Milo's Kitchen and the exit of some private label businesses were key drivers, with 6% decrease across our pet snacks portfolio. Sales for our premium Natural Balance brand declined 1%. 
Pet Food segment profit was consistent with the prior year, as the sales shortfall was offset by reduced input cost, incremental synergy realization and a slight reduction in marketing for the quarter. 
Net sales for International and Foodservice declined 3% compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of the canned milk divestiture, net sales were down 1%, as favorable volume/mix was offset by lower price realization. Segment profit decreased 7% compared to a very strong second quarter in the prior year. Approximately half of this decline was due to lapping $2 million of prior year profit related to the divested milk business. 
In addition, the net impact of pricing and cost was unfavorable and only partially offset by favorable volume/mix and lower marketing. 
Turning to cash flow. Cash provided by operations was $136 million for the quarter. This compares to $276 million in the prior year, which included benefits related to our working capital initiatives. Factoring in capital expenditures of $34 million, free cash flow was $103 million in the second quarter, bringing the first half total to $291 million. We continue to project full year free cash flow of $1 billion, assuming CapEx of $240 million. While this implies a significant acceleration of free cash flow in the back half the year, this is consistent with our historical trends and our current working capital assumptions. 
During the second quarter, we paid down an additional $100 million on our term loan and ended the quarter with total debt of $5.35 billion. 
Based on trailing 12-month EBITDA of nearly $1.6 billion, our leverage currently stands at just under 3.4x. We continue to target a leverage ratio of 3.1x by the end of this fiscal year. 
Let me conclude with an update on our full year sales and earnings outlook, which remain unchanged from our most recent guidance. Excluding the 2 percentage point impact of the divested milk business, we continue to expect net sales to be in the range of flat to down 1% compared to the prior year. This implies a return to organic sales growth for the back half of fiscal 2017, including the anticipated impact of commodity inflation in certain categories, contributions from the launch of Nature's Recipe and the continued strong growth of Uncrustables in both retail and the foodservice channel. 
In addition, we continue to project adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.60 to $7.75, with a bias toward the middle to high end of this range. While this is unchanged from our previous guidance, there are a few puts and takes reflected in our outlook. Most notably, the benefit from the lower projected tax rate is expected to be offset by incremental investments in support of the Nature's Recipe launch. 
In closing, while the challenges to revenue growth persist in certain categories, partially driven by the benefit of favorable commodity cost being passed on to our consumers, we remain pleased with our earnings performance. In addition, we continue to make meaningful progress executing on our key initiatives to improve top line trends moving forward. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to achieve solid financial results this fiscal year and beyond.

And that large mainstream business has provided a platform. And I think in Mark's comments, we talked about 20% growth on Bustelo. Our Dunkin' K-Cup business up 12%, our Dunkin' bagged business up. So I think it's allowed us to really manage the mix game. It's allowed us to manage where we are large and where we can scratch out those segments that are growing. You've got to dig into the details in our coffee business. I think in Mark's scripted comments, the OPP item is down, our lowest-priced item is down, but our mainstream 30.9-ounce classic roast item is up 2%. So there's a lot of work going on within each one of these businesses. And we're able to, by managing mix, bring both margin and the right things in. Same thing in Consumer Foods, we've got Sahale, we had good performance from Sahale in the quarter, the Jif Bars, snacks, there's nice mix and margin opportunities within each one of these categories."

It will be the Nature's Recipe rollout. It will be Uncrustables. But then in some of the other businesses, for example, Jif, I think you're going to see a turnaround there.

As we look at consumption data on most of our categories, the share loss, if there is one, is very modest. And so we're seeing turns remain relatively strong. I would point to peanut butter as an example. We had a very soft quarter in peanut butter. But as we dug into those numbers, we did see several customers adjusting inventories. We would expect some of that to come back. And the consumption data around peanut butter remains reasonably strong as well. So I think that all of those things put together give us some confidence in the back half."

And as we look at what the consumer is looking for in the mass and grocery channels, we believe that is the right brand. The acceptance from the retailers, as we've taken that out as part of the launch, has been -- has exceeded our expectations. So we definitely believe that's the right brand. Our retailers have confirmed with us it's the right brand, it's the right time and we're the right company to bring that brand into the segment. From a growth perspective, we are developing a marketing communications plan. We'll have marketing in place fourth quarter to support the launch. And then we'll have a national campaign next year, really, to speak to the attributes of the brand. From a competitive or a reaction from the pet specialty retailers, we shared our decision with them when -- right upfront when we made the decision to launch. And we anticipate that both of those retailers will continue to support the brand in their stores.

If you look in the last quarter, we're down just under 6%. So I think that speaks to the positive trends when you get price right. You also have to market the brand and have communications directed at the consumer. So we will be back marketing that brand in FY '18. We are refreshing packaging. We're bringing some innovation to the category. So I think those are -- it's just the fundamentals of marketing a brand, especially when you're up against major competitors like we are.

I think the one thing that I would like to maybe address here while we're on the subject of marketing, because it's probably on some folks' mind. But I'm sure everyone recalls at the end of Q1, we had indicated that part of the over-delivery against our first quarter was due to a time shift in marketing spend. And we had anticipated that a fair amount of that, which was pet related, would slide into Q2 and kind of guided to that. As it turned out, shortly after we got into Q2, we had landed on our decision around Nature's Recipe. And just as I think, and Barry, I don't want to speak for you, but I think that the Pet team sort of stepped back and said, ""How do we want to make sure that we have a successful launch?"" We really took pause and challenged some of our marketing spend in some of the other areas. So what's happened then is we've shifted it, once again, if you will, into Q4. So a lot of those dollars we talked about in Q2 shifting or just moving into Q4, and that clearly contributed a little bit to the earnings for the quarter. So I don't know, guys, if you had any other comments around trade spend trend that you're seeing?"

Just on the sort of the pet business and this -- both Nature's Recipe and Natural Balance, if you take -- just strategically, take a step back, obviously, you guys all know that we got in the pet business for -- obviously, a great category, it's a, predominantly a branded category across multiple segments. Obviously, snacks and this premium segment are very important. And so if you think about similarly to other businesses that we're in, our strategy is always to play in all of the segments if we can and then make sure that when we're thinking about growth and incrementality, we really want to make sure we're focusing on those areas where we can achieve the most growth. So obviously, snacks will be -- we'll continue to focus on. But if you think about premium pet, whether it is pet specialty, which is a very important channel for us, as well as the mass channel, our goal is really to have a stronger presence in both. So we obviously went into -- we expanded our presence in -- with Natural Balance early on after we acquired the business, which was obviously a good thing, and we're going to continue to support that brand, there's national advertising, as well as just leveraging our scale in the mainstream channels. And again, going back to just the fact that we really believe with this Nature's Recipe, because it's an existing brand and because, even though it is a smaller brand in that channel, it is known as a premium -- a more premium brand at an affordable price. And so that's why we think it fits nicely in that channel. So just really, it is about strategy and making sure we're in the growth segments."

As we have consistently said, probably the better part of over a year now, is the closer we get to a 3x or under levered, it opens up the doors to some of the strategic things we can do.

I think in terms -- and maybe I'll ask for Mark to comment on this in a moment, but just in terms of what we're looking for and what's out there, there are a number of assets, as you can imagine, that I would call more of the small to mid-sized bolt-on opportunities, a lot around sort of the trends, whether it's convenience, good and good-for-you type products, clean label products, a lot in the natural space. And so we have been looking and have not necessarily limited ourselves just because where we are from a leverage position, particularly as it relates to bolt-ons, and we'll continue to do that. In terms of where we would lever, we went over 4x with the transaction of Big Heart. And what I would frame in is to say that we were comfortable there. And the reason we were comfortable is the cash generation that came out of that transaction, both from the business itself and the synergy opportunities, and the quickness of the pay down, made it comfortable. So is that a hard and fast target? Maybe, maybe not. But certainly, we've proven that we're willing to go up there as long as there is a good sense of the cash generation out of that."

And I remember you said that the advertising campaign had actually started in August, but you were on air in August. Did you have to take that ad campaign off air?

Rob, I think there's a couple of things we need to think about today versus then. Obviously, we took coffee pricing down because we had coffee cost that could support that. Coffee costs were relatively low, even compared to any kind of averages, right? So it would be reasonable to think that in that kind of environment, we would have been longer than normal, right? And so as we've seen coffee cost go up, yes, they're up, but they're only up, if you think about a $1.70 Arabica, it's not that much over the 5- or 10-year average, right? So those are not high coffee costs. If you think about what we've seen in past years in the $2, $2.50, $2.70 type of thing. So we don't think Arabica is in -- in anywhere near those kinds of price points. We've also learned a lot from that one instance where we took price up and we crossed 2 deciles. If you remember, we took 2 deciles on our key promoted sizes. And we would have coverage in place that would not cause us to have to do that. So if there is pricing in coffee, we think it will be much more measured. And then the last thing I'd remind you of is the downsize we did in the container. And so if you remember in that time frame, our competitor was promoting an 11% smaller container than we were, and now that our containers are similar. So I think there's a couple of dynamics that would suggest the coffee pricing that we would see today or project, certainly through this fiscal year, but well into next year, is not going to put us in the position that we were in when it impacted our margins. So we feel good about it."

I mean, mass right now has always been sort of a flat to just modestly above. We clearly have been running below that, but that's kind of where we see that category. It's a little preliminary, quite candidly, to give you a really good number on the traditional grocery and mass channel, just because we need to sort of see the effect of Nature's Recipe. I just --  I think Barry's comment about what we expect from the distribution capability of that Nature's Recipe. And there's enough out there that you can do some comparables to see kind of where the expectation is there. And then in specialty, I know that we've commented previously that the channel has slowed some. I think other competitors have noted similarities. But Barry's point, albeit somewhat still small, but growing, the e-commerce cannot be taken lightly. And we still think there's a lot of opportunity in that channel. I think the other thing I'd reinforce in the Natural -- or the specialty area for us, in particular, is there's still profitability opportunity. And we've seen that start to turn. We've talked about that. That was certainly an under-indexed category for us in Pet as it related to our segment profit, we're seeing turns on that. So we still feel good about those channels. And again, I think with e-commerce, the Natural Balance focus, we'll see good growth."

I think you've heard that talked about in our peers, our competitors' releases. And so our K-Cups in actual units and equivalent volume are up, both in Folgers, in Dunkin' and up dramatically, and quite frankly, in Bustelo, although a small business. That volume gain translates into dollar gains in Bustelo and in Dunkin'. The dollars are down a little bit in Folgers, only because of the pricing that we've taken to support that. But the total K-Cup business is up nicely. So we feel really good that the fact that our legacy K-Cup business grew in units. Our Dunkin' business is up dramatically, and our Bustelo business, frankly, is on fire. So those segments, all 3, are what are helping drive the mix on our coffee business."

Our OPP business is relatively small in the mix, and it's concentrated in the retailers you would expect it to be concentrated in. It's a big business at the value retailers, right, whether that be the dollar channel, mass retail channel, the club channel, okay? So those SKUs exist in those environments where the consumer goes for value. When you're promoting our 30.9-ounce canister at $6.99, a small difference in the everyday price of OPP does -- is not that exciting to the consumer. So yes, that will be a backstop for those consumers as coffee pricing moves up. But moving coffee price from, say, $6.99 to $7.99 doesn't scare me there. I think, Mark mentioned this in his opening, when OPP becomes very attractive is when you get to those $9.99, $10.99 price points. We have seen that in history. Remember, we downsized the canister. So I think we're insulated from some of that. So I don't want us to think that a $1.70 Arabica takes us into any price point that we should all be afraid of, right? We obviously still think this is relatively moderately priced Arabica. So I think we're some way away from us having a discussion where we would be concerned about that the absolute price points having some kind of dramatic effect and swinging our volume within our mix."

And you're right, we haven't adjusted. I think, we would like to get a little bit more time. But there's no indications that we will not continue down our synergy path. I think one way to think about our synergy number is we're talking about $100 million incremental through this year and $140 million capture through the end of this fiscal. But with programs in place, I would say that we're probably on a run rate right now to $180 million to $185 million. So said differently, we've got about $15 million to $20 million to tie down here in the next several months, and we'll have that $200 million locked in as we head into fiscal '18. So we're in really good shape. And the other comment, Akshay, I would say about synergies is on the SD&A, one of the things -- we talked about marketing. I know there's probably some discussion about the marketing shift being a major contributor to the earnings. But we did deliver pretty significant reductions in our, what I would call, our administrative costs. So and that's a combination of synergy recognitions, so some of the additional synergies were falling there and some are, quite candidly, just very strong cost management across those organizations. So some of those dollars are just incremental savings program that people put in place above and beyond the $200 million synergy target."
