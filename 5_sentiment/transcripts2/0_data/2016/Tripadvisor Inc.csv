TripAdvisor is rapidly building the best end-to-end user experience in travel. Helping users plan and book the perfect trip is our North Star, and 2015 was a foundational year in pursuit of this mission. We are reinventing how users book and have awesome trips. Think about how it's been for the past 5 to 10 years. You've gone online. You'd likely search on TripAdvisor. You booked on search engines. You've searched estimation sites. You've checked travel booking sites and trip supplier sites. At the end of it all, you've searched at least 15 to 20 different sites to try to figure out where do you want to go, where are you going to have a great time, where are you going to stay, how are you going to book it. And then you've got to go do the whole search all over again to go find the best price and feel safe about where you're booking. 
At TripAdvisor, we've sought to solve these inefficiencies in that travel booking journey. Recently, we found this in 3 ways. First, we've widened our content mode, reinforcing our leadership position as the most trusted brand in travel research. Since 2011, network effects have intensified as user content has accelerated from 30 contributions per minute to more than 200 per minute. In 2015 alone, users added 82 million contributions on TripAdvisor and we now offer users 320 million reviews and opinions on 6.2 million businesses around the globe. Second in 2013, anticipating changing consumer preferences, we had a total metasearch, enabling users to find all the best prices for more than 200 different booking engines across the web. And third, over the past couple of years, again anticipating consumer's growing desire to transact in a one-stop shopping fashion on local devices, we started to add bookability to our offering. So now imagine this, rather than visiting those 15 to 20 sites again and again to make sure that you're finding the best hotel, getting the best price and booking with a brand you trust, consider this more efficient booking journey. A user goes to TripAdvisor for the trusted review content to find out where to go. We have all the information you need to plan that perfect trip. And when they're shopping for a hotel, they stay on TripAdvisor because we have all the best prices and information regarding availability on the web. And when they're comparing prices on TripAdvisor, they see that book on TripAdvisor button, which has room prices better, at least as good or better than the metasearch options. They connect the TripAdvisor is the brand I trust with TripAdvisor is where I find the lowest price with TripAdvisor is where I can find and book the lowest price. So they click, they book, they're done right then and there. 
This improved hotel shopping experience isn't just a hypothetical future. It's here today. It's the improved travel booking journey TripAdvisor's delivering to more and more users and more and more markets today. In 2015, we took some major steps in establishing Instant Booking as a strong platform. As you may know, we've partnered with 8 of the 10 large hotel chains. And in October, we announced an Instant Booking partnership with the Priceline Group the largest OTA in the world. As a result, users are able to book 450,000 hotels worldwide on TripAdvisor. Following our full Instant Book launch to U.S. and U.K. users in September, we launched to all English-language countries this January. Instant Booking is diluting our near-term financial results but we see good leading indicators of success. Conversion rates are comparable to metasearch. Users are coming back to TripAdvisor more frequently and repeat booking rates are up, all suggesting that more users are coming to know TripAdvisor as a great place to book. 
As a result, we're moving quickly with Instant Booking. In February, we rolled out to the rest of our major European markets. In March, our plan is to roll out additional countries in Asia Pacific and LatAm markets, and the exciting result is that in Q2, in time for the seasonal pickup in travel planning, we will be live to the vast majority of our hotel shoppers around the globe. Our job doesn't end there. We're working to improve the room level content, the descriptions and photos that give users more confidence to book. We're working to onboard more partners including more hotel chains like Starwood and more independent hotels to give users the comfort of booking supplier direct. It may take a year or 2 to perfect our Instant Booking offering to get all their content [indiscernible] to make an even better more seamless booking experience and to educate more users about our unbeatable offer. Over the past 2 years, we've leveraged our strong profitable hotel base to invest in our next-generation booking technology. While the global Instant Booking launch will mask our core growth this year, it is an imperative step as we follow our North Star, navigating the path towards creating the best user experience in travel. 
Now shifting gears a bit. How many people book a vacation simply because they want to stay at a particular hotel? Answer, not many. We travel because we want to relax, we want to discover, we seek adventure, we want to create great memories with friends or family. In short, we want to do stuff. TripAdvisor is in the business of delivering these memorable experiences. The TripAdvisor brand is synonymous with inspiration and discovery and helping users plan and have a great trip. And unlike most other travel brands, users bring TripAdvisor with them on the trip. Over 50% of our traffic visits are on mobile devices, the majority of that on the phone, and users have downloaded our apps more than 290 million times. When you arrive in your destination, TripAdvisor is your own personal travel guide, helping you find what to do, where to eat, what businesses to visit and which to avoid. 
Our profitable hotel business enables us to invest in complementary categories, attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals. These are businesses that help users have a great trip, engage more users in more moments and create a sticker end-to-end travel experience. The categories also open up our global platform to more advertising partners helping them grow their business. 
Drilling down on this Other segment. Over the long-term we believe attractions can be our next $1 billion dollar revenue business. It's a fragmented, $80 billion market opportunity in the U.S. and Europe alone. It has attractive commission rates. We already -- we're already the clear leader in terms of content and audience, and having Viator's transaction capabilities reinforces our lead. We're growing quickly, leveraging the best of what TripAdvisor and Viator have to offer. 
In 2015, the Viator team did a great job launching Marketplace, really tripling the number of bookable properties from 11,000 to 32,000. Matching great attractions content with more supply to us for more consumers, we saw TripAdvisor's worst bookings on Viator grow rapidly in 2015. In 2016, we're focused on making it even easier for users to book. This quarter, we're launching Instant Booking on TripAdvisor for attractions on both mobile and desktop. We're leveraging our large installed base of app users to deliver timely app notifications, making bookings an easier experience for travelers when they are in market. We believe that capturing only single-digit market share will enable attractions to become our next $1 billion revenue business. 
We have a great opportunity in restaurants as well. We've rapidly expanded the fourth both organically and inorganically launching in Denmark during the fourth quarter. We now operate in 12 countries and have more than 33,000 bookable restaurants for travelers and locals alike. User demand is growing rapidly as well. We love restaurants for a few reasons: one, we're delighting users more frequently with helpful rich content all around the world; two, through the 4, we're helping users seamlessly book great places to eat; and three, our content drives millions of visitors to TripAdvisor more frequently, keeping us top of mind even when the user isn't in travel planning mode. 
Rounding up the Other segment. Our Vacation Rentals business continues to pose great results as it hones its free-to-list transaction model. We generated more than 65% of Vacation Rentals revenue from free-to-list in 2015 and more than 70% of the 770,000 properties are now bookable online. 
As I conclude, 2016 is another important year on our journey to build the best user experience in travel. We're in a great position right now but our industry continues to evolve and competition abounds. For these reasons, we have to move quickly and launch Instant Booking around the globe. We also need to continue to invest in our end-to-end user experience, invest in mobile and invest in growing supply in driving higher conversion in all of our major product categories. As a result, expenses will likely grow faster than revenue this year as they did in 2015, but this is the right path forward on our journey. We always manage our business for the long term. It's the best way to build the business that creates the most value for our users, our clients and our shareholders. 
Now here's Ernst."

My first 3 months on the job has allowed me to understand our business close up. And what strikes me is that while the company has achieved so much in that short history from Steve all the way down to the organization, the company is deeply committed to make sure our future is even better still. This commitment to improve and willingness to adapt, to achieve greatness is very unique our company culture. 
When I look at the $1.3 trillion travel market, I compare TripAdvisor's significant influence on travel commerce with how undermonetized we are and see a massive growth opportunity ahead. We're experiencing near-term headwinds as we roll out Instant Booking, but once we've established our end-to-end product offering, we'll have positioned ourselves to drive growth and better monetization in the future. 
With that as a backdrop, let's review our Q4 and our full year 2015 results. First comment is that our financial results will be viewed in light of significant currency headwinds. Full year 2015 revenue grew 20% in reported currency versus 27% in constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA was flat in reported currency versus 40% growth in constant currency. Q4 revenue grew 7% in reported currency or 12% in constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA growth in Q4 was negative 11% in reported currency versus negative 2% in constant currency. 
Note that our Q4 GAAP net income of $3 million or $0.02 per diluted share was largely impacted by a one-time noncash item to settle our pledge obligation with the TripAdvisor Charitable Foundation. A total of $67 million was paid in company common stock. This one-time settlement means that, moving forward, we will not contribute part of our profits to the foundation, which will be a net benefit to EBITDA. To give you a sense of the size of its impact, this would've been a net reduction of $8 million in 2015 without the settlement. 
Q4 hotel segment revenue growth was 4% or approximately 8% in constant currency, and hotel adjusted EBITDA margin was 37%. Digging into the hotel business, as expected, Q4 click-based revenue declined 1% in reported currency or grew 5% in constant currency. 
2015 can really be characterized as a tale of 2 halves. We had nice growth in the first half followed by deceleration due to lower meta CPC pricing as well as dilution from our Instant Booking rollout in the U.S. and the U.K. These trends were most pronounced in Q4. We estimate that our accelerated Instant Booking rollout in the U.S. in the U.K., our 2 largest markets, negatively impacted Q4 revenue by $9 million and EBITDA by $6 million. For the full year 2015, we estimate Instant Booking negatively impacted revenue by $36 million and EBITDA by $26 million. 
Another trend is the ongoing consumer shift to mobile devices. Phone hotel shoppers grew 36% during 2015, while combined desktop and tablet shoppers grew 10%. Phone hotel shoppers accounted for approximately 30% of our total hotel shoppers during Q4 and monetized at approximately 30% the rate of desktop and tablet in Q4. This compares to 19% rate last year. Obviously, the continued lower monetization rate relative to other devices poses a continued headwind to aggregate revenue per shopper growth, resulting revenue per shopper growth decelerating even while both desktop and phone individually are growing in revenue per shopper. 
These ongoing U.S. user shift to mobile is a key strategic driver for Instant Booking as the frequency of use and smaller screen size plays an even higher premium on delivering a simple end-to-end value proposition. We're seeing strong repeat booking rates on our mobile apps experience, and we continue to optimize helping more users find and book hotels with ease. 
Now moving to our Other segment. Revenue growth normalized to 32% in Q4 as we fully lapped our 2014 acquisitions. Q4 adjusted EBITDA margins were negative 16% due to this category's high revenue seasonality and, therefore, low relative Q4 revenues against this largely fixed cost structure. 
Moving on to consolidated expenses and cash flow. Consolidated expenses grew ahead of revenue for Q4 and for the full year, reflecting the continued investment in our future growth. As for taxes, our Q4 GAAP effective tax rate was 17%, which was lower than our expectations due to a change in jurisdictional earnings and certain discrete items. We expect our 2016 GAAP effective tax rate to be in the mid-20s and is dependent, of course, on international revenue and expense mix among other factors. 
Cash flow. On cash flow, we generated $74 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter or 24% of revenue. CapEx for the quarter was $16 million or 5% of revenue. In 2016, we expect CapEx to decrease. Q4 free cash flow was $58 million or 19% of revenue and we generated $273 million of free cash flow during the full year. 
Our liquidity remains strong as our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities balanced the $698 million at the end of Q4. We also ended the year with an undrawn balance of about $800 million from our $1 billion credit facility. We also have $104 million remaining under our share repurchase program. 
That was my summary of 2015 financial results. Now let's look ahead to 2016 and beyond. We operated a very dynamic travel market space, and within that dynamic marketplace, we are shifting our business rapidly to capture the long-term opportunity. We will be faced with important decision points throughout 2016 as we execute, such as how to best promote this great new booking experience. Because we manage our business for the long term, throughout 2016, we will do what we think is necessary to optimize a multi-year financial outcome, not necessarily what will make us hit any specific 2016 financial result. For this reason, we are discontinuing our past practice of providing a guidance range for annual revenue and EBITDA. Instead, I will provide you with directional expectations for 2016 and 2017 for our 2 reporting segments as well as our total expenses. We believe that these building blocks provide a good foundation for modeling our business and actually provide greater insight into underlying trends than we've offered in the past. Moreover, I will share some early data points of our Instant Booking progress. 
So let's start with the Hotel segment. As we think about 2016, we need to first start with our 2015 exit base. We exited Q4 2015 with 4% growth in the Hotel segment and a negative 1% growth for click-based revenue. Note that these growth rates decelerated from 8% to 6%, respectively, in Q3. As we look at the first half of 2016, we expect that these growth rates will decelerate further due to the tougher first half of 2015 meta CPC comps as well as near-term dilution from our Instant Booking rollout this quarter and next. Importantly, we anticipate that revenue per hotel shopper and therefore, book click-based revenue growth and Hotel segment growth rates will reaccelerate in the back half of the year as we started lapping that Instant Booking rollout in the U.S. and the U.K. and also meet easier meta CPC pricing comps. Despite this reacceleration in the second half, we expect growth for the full year to be muted. 
Throughout 2016, we will continue to invest to improve supply, content and marketing, and as such, we expect expense growth to outpace revenue growth in the Hotel segment, resulting in margin contraction in the Hotel segment. As we look out to 2017, we believe the higher second half of 2016 exit rates and lapping the full Instant Booking rollout portend to growth acceleration. We also believe our Hotel segment margins will stabilize in 2017 and potentially expand as revenue reacceleration does not require similar expense growth. 
So a reasonable question is, why are we willing to take such significant near-term financial impact from this Instant Booking rollout. Firstly, we believe Instant Booking brings a massive long-term growth opportunity for us. Our revenue per hotel shopper is currently in order of magnitude lower than that of our largest partners. That monetization difference represents a multibillion dollar opportunity for us. Instant Booking plays a key role. 
Looking at our longer standing cohort, the U.S., Instant Booking is already more than 50% of revenues on our mobile app. That percentage is much lower on other devices, but it speaks to the Instant Booking's potential to become a potential business over the next few years. Our second reason is that we are seeing some positive trends. One, Instant Booking conversion rates improved throughout 2015 and are now comparable to meta, showing that we are improving the product and the users are getting increasingly comfortable booking on TripAdvisor. We fully expect to improve conversion rates further. Two, average booking values increased by more than 10% over the course of the year. We attribute this to our success partnering with big global hotel partners as well as adding the Priceline Group on to the platform. Three, partners are paying double-digit commission rates for bookings on average, and we think this is perhaps misunderstood. This is consistent across each of our different partner types, OTAs, chains and independents. Four, and perhaps more importantly, we're seeing positive early signs of repeat usage. Hotel shoppers are increasingly returning to TripAdvisor to complete their booking that was previously attempted but abandoned. Additionally, 10% of Instant Bookings are coming from users who have booked with us before, which is great, because this is still such a new product for most of our users. 
Now the addition of Instant Booking doesn't mean metasearch is going away, far from it. We expect metasearch will remain a large part of our total revenues, and we see significant opportunity and continue to grow as huge number of hotel shoppers are in research mode and we're aiming to turn most of these lookers into clickers. In meta, only a fraction of hotel shoppers click on a paid link. This represents an additional source of leakage in our hotel business and is a large monetization opportunity in its own right. Additionally, given the success other instant companies have had with retargeting, we're launching a similar product this year, enabling metasearch partners to buy in a more targeted profitable fashion. 
In 2016, our focus as a management team is on revenue per hotel shopper, as this is -- as this metric is key to the long-term growth of our Hotel segment. Revenue per hotel shopper includes both Instant Booking and meta and growing this aggregate total is ultimately what we're after. We expect revenue per shopper growth to decelerate as a result of our Instant Booking launch, and later in the year, we believe that growth will improve similar to what we saw in our metasearch rollout in 2013. 
Now turning our attention to the 2016 trends in the Other segment. Our Other segment exited 2015 at a 32% growth in Q4, and we expect continued solid top line growth in 2016. We've operated the segment as slightly below breakeven EBITDA margins over the past year and we will continue to reinvest in 2016 as we focus on product improvements and supply acquisitions. Therefore, EBITDA margins are likely to contract and lower absolute EBITDA [indiscernible] results. In line with the 3- to 5-year time horizon we outlined for the segment last year, in 2017, we believe margins will begin to stabilize and could potentially expand as greater revenue scale does not require similar levels of investment. Of course, these trends do not include any acquisitions that we may make over this time frame. 
Finally, some specific thoughts on our 2016 organic investments as well as how we might deploy capital during the year. We built the business with significant operational scale on -- one that enables us to execute this major business shift at speed and maintain our focus on the long term. In 2016, we will continue to invest in people to pursue our product and sales initiatives, and indirect expense growth rates should be similar to 2015. We expect that our direct sales and marketing expenses to continue to grow but at materially lower rates than the 48% growth we experienced in 2015. 
In addition to organic investments, we continue to have significant financial capacity for inorganic growth. We are very pleased with the acquisitions we've made over the last few years and remain open to similar opportunities to consolidate great businesses with innovative products and great management teams. Although we look at many opportunities, we remain very selective and are focused on return on investment and long-term value creation. We also continue to evaluate alternative ways to deploy our capital including share repurchases. 
In conclusion, I leave you with 4 structural advantages unique to our business. First, we are extending our lead as a trusted brand in user-generated content, which is making our product better every day, driving audience and helps support low overall customer acquisition costs. Second, we have a superior consumer value proposition, helping users plan, compare prices and book hotels all in one place. Third, we have complementary businesses that help users throughout the entire trip, driving increased loyalty, usage frequency and additional revenue streams. Fourth, or ownership structure is an advantage, as Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings supports our long-term view. 
So to summarize, we believe we're on the right path to create long-term value. After some near-term pressures on revenues and profits, we believe our results will improve later this year and into 2017.

So it really kind upped the opportunity for TripAdvisor to be showing a great price with all this content. Very hard for us to tease out exactly what causes conversion rate to lift, but we're confident in saying the extra or the better content that we added to the site certainly helped. As we look forward, it's mostly tuning, if you will. There's a lot of properties that are available. We want to make sure that we have great pricing on as many of them or all of them as we can. We want to make sure we have a great experience in terms of someone entering the booking flow and getting all the information that they need in order to make that -- in order to trust us with their credit card, storing the credit card. So we're doing all the things and that's why we're seeing the improved rate. I'm not sure I would point to a single big win factor that's going to be out there versus incremental improvement, and I said the incremental improvement will likely translate to all points of sale at the same time. We're not seeing a big difference per market in terms of how consumers are behaving. Conversion, you asked about phone or -- versus desktop. And so the conversion naturally is different. Some of that, I believe, this can be structural for quite some time, but we measure -- when we talk about rev per shopper with you folks, we're also, of course, measuring it both mobile web, mobile app, tablet, desktop. We've got to broke it down in [indiscernible] different ways here and we're constantly making improvements in each of those categories."

So we're very happy with the Priceline deal, the content that it provides, the pricing so -- and their ability to handle the infrastructure of payments in all these different countries. And as I alluded to last quarter, we thought that would allow us to roll it out fairly quickly, and we've delivered on that. Priceline has been great to work with. So as you know, as we disclosed, we launched in Europe -- launching LatAm and other markets so mostly we done over the next 90, 120 days, so that's great. It absolutely was the meaningful factor in us to accelerate our global rollout, which kind of starts the training purpose or training clock going because we know we have a hill decline to teach people that TripAdvisor is not only also awesome for research but a safe place to book. But offering great content, great prices, we think we're doing that where it's available. So we're not doing that yet in a bunch of other countries because we don't have any Instant Booking rolled out in those countries. So if you think -- backing up a little bit, when we look at this consumer journey, I talk about instead of searching around lots and lots of different sites for all the information and then all the prices, our vision, our strategic plan here is you come to TripAdvisor because of all that great content. And then, of course, you see that we've done the work for you. We've searched the web, we've pulled back all of these prices. And with Instant Booking, odds are good and becoming great that we'll be able to feature the lowest price if you want to book on TripAdvisor. If in fact, you have loyalty to a different site, that's great. There's a meta button clicks over there. If you prefer booking brand direct and you really want to be on that brand site, great, there's a brand click. If you're happy booking on TripAdvisor if they're being fulfilled by brand, we'll have that option. If you're happy booking on TripAdvisor fulfilled by a great OTA partner, excellent. We'd like to look at it as no matter what your preferences are, we'll have you -- we'll be able to address your need in our store. And then you made the purchase, you stay at the hotel, you're in market, you get to use all of our attractions, you're using our app as so many people do and so we've stayed with you during this travel purchase. And all of that is supposed to yield more, great, I'll now use the TripAdvisor as a research and a booking tool. And the leading indicator I like to look at the most is that repeat rate. Is it exactly a perfect metric for showing that Instant Booking is working? Can't tell or time will tell, but it is the thing that we are looking to address and build as a long-term advantage in the Instant Booking path versus the meta path because as people are comfortable booking with us and for some people try us is the only way they're going to get comfortable, then we're delivering good experience, the product works and they come back and book again. So that's why I love the repeat rate. Did I forget your first question now, first half of your question?"

There is -- when we say we launched it, it gives us Instant Booking capabilities primarily with Booking.com as our partner and then we are working aggressively to bring the rest of our suppliers, all the different brands and, obviously, the independents to all these new markets.

When I talk about it being a year or  2 to get Instant Booking and to really be fully rolled out with all of the value that I talk about, all the room content, all the best pricing, it's because there's a lot of work still to be done to get all the partners with all the content in all the languages handling payments in all the markets, and we're on that road and we're accelerating our pace."

We have a very competitive product in that space but we come at it more from a, look, the individual who's looking for a great place to stay in London and they might pick a hotel, they might pick an apartment, they might pick even a more traditional vacation rental, our supply footprint covers them all and we're doing that around the globe. So in a sense, Airbnb as a competitor, we don't particularly view their traffic or the person looking for the shared room is someone that's naturally on TripAdvisor but for the other piece for the city or for the urban inventory we do. Hard to say given the strength of the hotel industry currently, but Airbnb is a problem. They've just added a lot of supply into the equation and I personally believe that they are generating more travel on the part of consumers because of the supply that they've added. I have no data points to back that up, but it's kind of logical to me as they continue to grow with the hotel companies and [indiscernible] like us and other OTAs continue to be very strong in our markets. In terms of the mobile experience, a tough question. There's various aspects of our app and our experience that I think are just terrific. You can find great places to eat where nearby where you're standing all around the globe. You can book the hotel, we've stored your credit cards, it's 2 clicks and you're done. There's tremendous amount of benefit that we've achieved, I believe, by delivering a great user experience for closing hotel shopping, places to eat, things to do, bringing the bookability of our attraction inventory on the phone, really nice. From a -- is there more to do? Absolutely. I just think the amount of data that TripAdvisor has that can help you plan a trip that is so hard for us to figure out how to surface at the right time, really hard to read your mind to know what you're going to be looking for next, but we've got it because we have so much users, so many users. We have so much data on all topics related to travel, plus we've got the communities standing behind us. So do we bring that all to the forefront in a perfect way on the mobile smallscreen? No. So I still think we're in very early days in what we can do, but we're incredibly well positioned because of the rich content across all travel categories and because of our installed app footprint, which is, as you know, just huge.

The second factor you have to consider is that this is an aggregate number across all devices, and our mobile revenue per shopper is growing much more quickly. Sorry, our number of mobile shoppers is growing much more quickly. So you got a mix shift, which drags down the average. Having said that, we are very seriously improving our revenue per shopper in mobile. In constant currency terms, in 2015, we improved revenue per shopper in mobile by about 30%. So we're improving but it's still significantly lower monetization than desktop, which is a negative impact. And then we had, of course, Instant Book in the fourth quarter, which also negatively impacts that revenue per hotel shopper growth. So as you think about that going forward, we do expect further pressure on -- for if you just aggregate now the desktop revenue per hotel shopper and the mobile revenue per hotel shopper.

Simply put, if we make more money you per hotel shopper visit, we can build more on search engines and other traffic generating sources.

And when -- and the biggest thing that we can do, to your question, is to actually get Instant Booking available on more properties and more markets then sort of build more partners underneath the Instant Booking placement. So in the U.S., for instance, we have really good coverage right now. You look at most any city for most any hotel and there's probably [indiscernible] bookable online. There's probably an Instant Booking option because we have a good selection of partners between the brands and the OTAs, not as good in one of our newer foreign language markets because we don't have some of that room level content yet."

The meta rollout, some of those challenges were more driven by our clients' ability to upgrade or change their bidding mechanisms and styles and measurement based upon what we were doing. And we have a lot of partners, a lot of clients so we can -- they've all had to move forward on the change. With Instant Booking, our client is an Instant Booking partner has to do with this amount or some technical work to get integrated but doesn't really have much perfect on all the rest of the partners, so -- all the rest of the meta partners. So the rollout schedule and timing is much more under our control because  most especially with the Priceline Group now, we can basically roll out in just about any market that we want to and we don't need the other partners to do any technical work. So lessons learned, look, with meta, we needed to give our partners a warning, more sample, more time, a bunch of things, but it doesn't apply quite as well to the IP rollout here. To the question of hey, users' change in their behavior, well, I think it is meta was a lot easier as with users back then because they put in their dates and they just get more information, hip hip hooray. Here, we actually have to teach them what this book on TripAdvisor button means because it's not the site -- it's not what they're used to getting on our site. And that's new ground for us and we're doing a bunch of stuff right, then I'm sure I know we'll be doing a bunch of stuff differently in the coming year to help drive home this new functionality and the benefits our travelers will receive when they experience Instant Booking."

TripAdvisor is rapidly building the best end-to-end user experience in travel. Helping users plan and book the perfect trip is our North Star, and 2015 was a foundational year in pursuit of this mission. We are reinventing how users book and have awesome trips. Think about how it's been for the past 5 to 10 years. You've gone online. You've likely searched on TripAdvisor. You've looked on search engines. You've searched destination sites. You've checked travel booking sites and trip supplier sites. At the end of it all, you've searched at least 15 to 20 different sites to try to figure out where do you want to go, where are you going to have a great time, where are you going to stay, how are you going to book it. And then you've got to go do the whole search all over again to go find the best price and feel safe about where you're booking.
At TripAdvisor, we've sought to solve these inefficiencies in that travel booking journey. Recently, we found this in 3 ways. First, we've widened our content mode, reinforcing our leadership position as the most trusted brand in travel research. Since 2011, network effects have intensified as user content has accelerated from 30 contributions per minute to more than 200 per minute. In 2015 alone, users added 82 million contributions on TripAdvisor, and we now offer users 320 million reviews and opinions on 6.2 million businesses around the globe. Second, in 2013, anticipating changing consumer preferences, we added hotel metasearch, enabling users to find all the best prices for more than 200 different booking engines across the web. And third, over the past couple of years, again, anticipating consumers' growing desire to transact in a one-stop shopping fashion on mobile devices, we started to add bookability to our offering. So now imagine this, rather than visiting those 15 to 20 sites again and again to make sure that you're finding the best hotel, getting the best price and booking with the brand you trust, consider this more efficient booking journey. A user goes to TripAdvisor for the trusted review content to find out where to go. We have all the information you need to plan that perfect trip. And when they're shopping for a hotel, they stay on TripAdvisor because we have all the best prices and information regarding availability on the web. And when they're comparing prices on TripAdvisor, they see that Book on TripAdvisor button, which has room prices better at least as good or better than the metasearch options. They connect the TripAdvisor is the brand I trust with TripAdvisor is where I find the lowest price with TripAdvisor is where I can find and book the lowest price. So they click, they book, they're done right then and there.
This improved hotel shopping experience isn't just a hypothetical future. It's here today. It's the improved travel booking journey TripAdvisor is delivering to more and more users and more and more markets today. In 2015, we took some major steps in establishing Instant Booking as a strong platform. As you may know, we've partnered with 8 of the 10 large hotel chains. And in October, we announced an Instant Booking partnership with the Priceline Group, the largest OTA in the world. As a result, users are able to book 450,000 hotels worldwide on TripAdvisor. Following our full Instant Book launch to U.S. and U.K. users in September, we launched all English language countries this January. Instant Booking is diluting our near-term financial results, but we see good leading indicators of success. 
Conversion rates are comparable to metasearch. Users are coming back to TripAdvisor more frequently, and repeat booking rates are up, all suggesting that more users are coming to know TripAdvisor as a great place to book.
As a result, we're moving quickly with Instant Booking. In February, we rolled out to the rest of our major European markets. In March, our plan is to roll out additional countries in Asia Pacific and LATAM markets. And the exciting result is that in Q2, in time for the seasonal pickup in travel planning, we will be live to the vast majority of our hotel shoppers around the globe. Our job doesn't end there. We're working to improve the room level content, the descriptions and photos that give users more confidence to book. We're working to onboard more partners, including more hotel chains like Starwood and more independent hotels to give users the comfort of booking supplier direct. It may take a year or 2 to perfect our Instant Booking offering to get all the room content wide to make an even better more seamless booking experience and to educate more users about our unbeatable offer. Over the past 2 years, we've leveraged our strong profitable hotel base to invest in our next-generation booking technology. While the global Instant Booking launch will mask our core growth this year, it is an imperative step as we follow our North Star, navigating the path towards creating the best user experience in travel.
Now shifting gears a bit. How many people book a vacation simply because they want to stay at a particular hotel? The answer, not many. We travel because we want to relax, we want to discover, we seek adventure, we want to create great memories with friends or family. In short, we want to do stuff. TripAdvisor is in the business of delivering these memorable experiences. The TripAdvisor brand is synonymous with inspiration, discovery and helping users plan and have a great trip. And unlike most other travel brands, users bring TripAdvisor with them on the trip. Over 50% of our traffic visits are on mobile devices: the majority of that on the phone. And users have downloaded our apps more than 290 million times. When you arrive in your destination, TripAdvisor is your own personal travel guide, helping you find what to do, where to eat  and what businesses to visit and which to avoid. 
Our profitable hotel business enables us to invest in complementary categories, attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals. These are businesses that help users have a great trip, engage more users in more moments and create a sticker end-to-end travel experience. The categories also open up our global platform to more advertising partners helping them grow their business.
Drilling down on this Other segment. Over the long term, we believe attractions can be our next $1 billion revenue business. It's a fragmented $80 billion market opportunity in the U.S. and Europe alone. It has attractive commission rates. We already -- we're already the clear leader in terms of content and audience and adding Viator's transaction capabilities reinforces our lead. We're growing quickly, leveraging the best to what TripAdvisor and Viator have to offer. 
In 2015, the Viator team did a great job launching Marketplace nearly tripling the number of bookable properties from 11,000 to 32,000. Matching great attractions content with more supply tourists for more consumers, we saw TripAdvisor's source bookings on Viator grow rapidly in 2015. 
In 2016, we're focused on making it even easier for users to book. This quarter, we're launching Instant Booking on TripAdvisor for attractions on both mobile and desktop. We're leveraging our large installed base of app users to deliver timely app notifications, making bookings an easier experience for travelers when they are in market. We believe that capturing only single-digit market share will enable attractions to become our next $1 billion revenue business.
We have a great opportunity in restaurants as well. We've rapidly expanded the fork [ph], both organically and inorganically, launching in Denmark during the fourth quarter. We now operate in 12 countries and have more than 33,000 bookable restaurants for travelers and locals alike. User demand is growing rapidly as well. 
We love restaurants for a few reasons: one, we're delighting users more frequently with helpful rich content all around the world; two, through fork [ph], we're helping users seamlessly book great places to eat; and three, our content drives millions of visitors to TripAdvisor more frequently, keeping us top of mind, even when the user isn't in travel planning mode.
Rounding up the Other segment. Our Vacation Rentals business continues to post great results as it hones its free-to-list transaction model. We generated more than 65% of Vacation Rentals revenue from free-to-list in 2015 and more than 70% of the 770,000 properties are now bookable online.
As I conclude, 2016 is another important year on our journey to build the best user experience in travel. We're in a great position right now, but our industry continues to evolve and competition abounds. For these reasons, we have to move quickly and launch Instant Booking around the globe. We also need to continue to invest in our end-to-end user experience, invest in mobile and invest in growing supply in driving higher conversion in all our major product categories. As a result, expenses will likely grow faster than revenue this year as they did in 2015, but this is the right path forward on our journey. We always manage our business for the long term. It is the best way to build the business that creates the most value for our users, our clients and our shareholders.
Now here's Ernst."

My first 3 months on the job has allowed me to understand our business close up. And what strikes me is that while the company has achieved so much in it's short history, from Steve all the way down in the organization, the company is deeply committed to make sure our future is even better still. This commitment to improve and willingness to adapt to achieve greatness is very unique our company culture. 
When I look at the $1.3 trillion travel market, and I compare TripAdvisor's significant influence on travel commerce with how undermonetized we are and see a massive growth opportunity ahead. We're experiencing near-term headwinds as we roll out Instant Booking, but once we've established our end-to-end product offering, we'll have positioned ourselves to drive growth and better monetization in the future. 
With that as a backdrop, let's review our Q4 and our full year 2015 results. First comment is that our financial results are viewed in light of significant currency headwinds. Full year 2015 revenue grew 20% in reported currency versus 27% in constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA was flat in reported currency versus 40% growth in constant currency. Q4 revenue grew 7% in reported currency or 12% in constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA growth in Q4 was negative 11% in reported currency versus negative 2% in constant currency. 
Note that our Q4 GAAP net income of $3 million or $0.02 per diluted share was largely impacted by a one-time noncash item to settle our pledge obligation with the TripAdvisor Charitable Foundation. A total of $67 million was paid in company common stock. This one-time settlement means that moving forward we will not contribute part of our profits to the foundation, which will be a net benefit to EBITDA. To give you a sense of the size of its impact, this would've been a net reduction of $8 million in 2015 without the settlement.
Q4 Hotel segment revenue growth was 4% or approximately 8% in constant currency, and Hotel adjusted EBITDA margin was 37%. Digging into the hotel business, as expected, Q4 click-based revenue declined 1% in reported currency or grew 5% in constant currency.
2015 can really be characterized as a tale of 2 halves. We had nice growth in the first half, followed by deceleration due to lower meta CPC pricing as well as dilution from our Instant Booking rollout in the U.S. and the U.K. These trends were most pronounced in Q4. We estimate that our accelerated Instant Booking rollout in the U.S. in the U.K., our 2 largest markets, negatively impacted Q4 revenue by $9 million and EBITDA by $6 million. For the full year 2015, we estimate Instant Booking negatively impacted revenue by $36 million and EBITDA by $26 million.
Another trend is the ongoing consumer shift to mobile devices. Phone hotel shoppers grew 36% during 2015, while combined desktop and tablet shoppers grew 10%. Phone hotel shoppers accounted for approximately 30% of our total hotel shoppers during Q4 and monetized at approximately 30% the rate of desktop and tablet in Q4. This compares to 19% rate last year. Obviously, the continued lower monetization rate relative to other devices poses a continued headwind to aggregate revenue per shopper growth, resulting in revenue per shopper growth decelerating even -- while both desktop and phone individually are growing in revenue per shopper.
This ongoing U.S. user shift to mobile is a key strategic driver for Instant Booking as the frequency of use and smaller screen size plays an even higher premium on delivering a simple end-to-end value proposition. We're seeing strong repeat booking rates on our mobile app experience and continue to optimize helping more users find and book hotels with ease.
Now moving to our Other segment. Revenue growth normalized to 32% in Q4 as we fully lapped our 2014 acquisitions. Q4 adjusted EBITDA margins were negative 16% due to this category's high revenue seasonality and, therefore, low relative Q4 revenues against this largely fixed cost structure.
Moving on to consolidated expenses and cash flow. Consolidated expenses grew ahead of revenue for Q4 and for the full year, reflecting the continued investment in our future growth. As for taxes, our Q4 GAAP effective tax rate was 17%, which was lower than our expectations due to a change in jurisdictional earnings and certain discrete items. We expect our 2016 GAAP effective tax rate to be in the mid-20s and is dependent, of course, on international revenue and expense mix among other factors.
Cash flow. On cash flow, we generated $74 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter or 24% of revenue. CapEx for the quarter was $16 million or 5% of revenue. In 2016, we expect CapEx to decrease. Q4 free cash flow was $58 million or 19% of revenue, and we generated $273 million of free cash flow during the full year.
Our liquidity remains strong as our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities' balance was $698 million at the end of Q4. We also ended the year with an undrawn balance of about $800 million from our $1 billion credit facility. We also have $104 million remaining under our share repurchase program.
That was my summary of 2015 financial results. Now let's look ahead to 2016 and beyond. We operated a very dynamic travel market space, and within that dynamic marketplace, we are shifting our business rapidly to capture the long-term opportunity. We will be faced with important decision points throughout 2016 as we execute, such as how to best promote this great new booking experience. Because we manage our business for the long term, throughout 2016, we will do what we think is necessary to optimize a multi-year financial outcome, not necessarily what will make us to hit any specific 2016 financial result. For this reason, we are discontinuing our past practice of providing a guidance range for annual revenue and EBITDA. Instead, I will provide you with directional expectations for 2016 and 2017 for our 2 reporting segments as well as for total expenses. We believe that these building blocks provide a good foundation for modeling our business and actually provide greater insight into underlying trends than we've offered in the past. Moreover, I will share some early data points of our Instant Booking progress.
So let's start with the Hotel segment. As we think about 2016, we need to first start with our 2015 exit base. We exited Q4 2015 with 4% growth in the Hotel segment and a negative 1% growth for click-based revenue. Note that these growth rates decelerated from 8% to 6%, respectively, in Q3. As we look at the first half of 2016, we expect that these growth rates to decelerate further, due to the tougher first half of 2015 meta CPC comps as well as near-term dilution from our Instant Booking rollout this quarter and next. 
Importantly, we anticipate that revenue per hotel shopper, and therefore, book click-based revenue growth and Hotel segment growth rates will reaccelerate in the back half of the year, as we start lapping the Instant Booking rollout in the U.S. and the U.K. and also meet easier meta CPC pricing comps. Despite this reacceleration in the second half, we expect growth for the full year to be muted. 
Throughout 2016, we will continue to invest to improve supply, content and marketing, and as such, we expect expense growth to outpace revenue growth in the Hotel segment, resulting in margin contraction in the Hotel segment. As we look out to 2017, we believe the higher second half of 2016 exit rates and lapping the full Instant Booking rollout portend to growth acceleration. We also believe our Hotel segment margins will stabilize in 2017 and potentially expand, as revenue reacceleration does not require similar expense growth.
So a reasonable question is, why are we willing to take such significant near-term financial impact from this Instant Booking rollout? Firstly, we believe Instant Booking presents a massive long-term growth opportunity for us. Our revenue per hotel shopper is currently in order of magnitude lower than that of our largest partners. That monetization difference represents a multibillion dollar opportunity for us. Instant Booking plays a key role. 
Looking at our longer standing cohort, the U.S., Instant Booking is already more than 50% of revenues on our mobile app. That percentage is much lower on other devices, but it speaks to the Instant Booking's potential to become a substantial part of our business over the next few years. 
Our second reason is that we are seeing some positive trends. One, Instant Booking conversion rates improved throughout 2015 and are now comparable to meta, showing that we are improving the product and the users are getting increasingly comfortable booking on TripAdvisor. We fully expect to improve conversion rates further. Two, average booking values increased by more than 10% over the course of the year. We attribute this to our success partnering with big global hotel partners as well as adding the Priceline Group on to the platform. Three, partners are paying double-digit commission rates for bookings on average, and we think this is perhaps misunderstood. This is consistent across each of our different partner types: OTAs, chains and independents. Four, and perhaps more -- most importantly, we're seeing positive early signs of repeat usage. Hotel shoppers are increasingly returning to TripAdvisor to complete their booking that was previously attempted but abandoned. Additionally, 10% of Instant Bookings are coming from users who have booked with us before, which is great, because this is still such a new product for most of our users.
Now the addition of Instant Booking doesn't mean metasearch is going away far from it. We expect metasearch will remain a large part of our total revenues, and we see significant opportunity to continue to grow as huge number of hotel shoppers are in research mode and we're aiming to turn most of these lookers into clickers. In meta, only a fraction of hotel shoppers click on a paid link. This represents an additional source of leakage in our hotel business and is a large monetization opportunity in its own right. Additionally, given the success other instant companies have had with retargeting, we're launching a similar product this year, enabling metasearch partners to buy in a more targeted profitable fashion.
In 2016, our focus as a management team is on revenue per hotel shopper, as this is -- as this metric is key to the long-term growth of our Hotel segment. Revenue per hotel shopper includes both Instant Booking and meta, and growing this aggregate total is ultimately what we're after. We expect revenue per shopper growth to decelerate as a result of our Instant Booking launch, and later in the year, we believe that growth will improve similar to what we saw in our metasearch rollout in 2013. 
Now turning our attention to the 2016 trends in the Other segment. Our Other segment exited 2015 at a 32% growth in Q4, and we expect continued solid top line growth in 2016. We've operated the segment as slightly below breakeven EBITDA margins over the past year, and we will continue to reinvest in 2016 as we focus on product improvements and supply acquisition. Therefore, EBITDA margins are likely to contract and lower absolute EBITDA could result. In line with the 3- to 5-year time horizon we outlined for this segment last year, in 2017, we believe margins will begin to stabilize and could potentially expand, as greater revenue scale does not require similar levels of investment. Of course, these trends do not include any acquisitions that we may make over this time frame.
Finally, some specific thoughts on our 2016 organic investments as well as how we might deploy capital during the year. We built the business with significant operational scale on -- one that enables us to execute this major business shift at speed and maintain our focus on the long term. In 2016, we will continue to invest in people to pursue our product and sales initiatives, and indirect expense growth rates should be similar to 2015. We expect that our direct sales and marketing expenses to continue to grow, but at materially lower rates than the 48% growth we experienced in 2015.
In addition to organic investments, we continue to have significant financial capacity for inorganic growth. We are very pleased with the acquisitions we've made over the last few years and remain open to similar opportunities to consolidate great businesses with innovative products and great management teams. Although we look at many opportunities, we remain very selective and are focused on return on investment and long-term value creation. We also continue to evaluate alternative ways to deploy our capital, including share repurchases. 
In conclusion, I leave you with 4 structural advantages unique to our business. First, we are extending our lead as a trusted brand in user-generated content, which is making our product better every day, driving audience and helps support low overall customer acquisition cost. Second, we have a superior consumer value proposition, helping users plan, compare prices and book hotels all in one place. Third, we have complementary businesses that help users throughout their entire trip, driving increased loyalty, usage frequency and additional revenue streams. Fourth, our ownership structure is an advantage as Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings supports our long-term view.
So to summarize, we believe we're on the right path to create long-term value. After some near-term pressures on revenues and profits, we believe our results will improve later this year and into 2017.
We'll now open up the call to your questions."

So it really kind of upped the opportunity for TripAdvisor to be showing a great price with all this content. Very hard for us to tease out exactly what causes conversion rate to lift, but we're confident in saying the extra or the better content that we added to the site certainly helped. As we look forward, it's mostly tuning, if you will. There's a lot of properties that are available. We want to make sure that we have great pricing on as many of them or all of them as we can. We want to make sure we have a great experience in terms of someone entering the booking flow and getting all the information that they need in order to make that -- in order to trust us with their credit card or storing the credit card. So we're doing all the things, and that's why we're seeing the improved rate. I'm not sure I would point to a single big win factor that's going to be out there versus incremental improvement, and I said the incremental improvement will likely translate to all points of sale at the same time. We're not seeing a big difference per market in terms of how consumers are behaving. Conversion, you asked about phone or -- versus desktop. And so the conversion naturally is different. Some of that, I believe, is going to structural for quite some time. But we measure -- when we talk about rev per shopper with you folks, we're also, of course, measuring it, both mobile web, mobile app, tablet, desktop. We've got to broke it down and lost different ways here, and we're constantly making improvements in each of those categories."

And as I alluded to last quarter, we thought that would allow us to roll it out fairly quickly, and we've delivered on that. Priceline team has been great to work with. So as you know, as we disclosed, we launched in Europe -- launching LATAM and other markets. So that will mostly we done over the next 90, 120 days. So that's great. It absolutely was the meaningful factor in us to accelerate our global rollout, which kind of starts the training purpose or training clock going, because we know we have a hill decline to teach people that TripAdvisor is not only also awesome for research but a safe place to book. And by offering great content, great prices, we think we're doing that where it's available. So we're not doing that yet in a bunch of countries because we don't have any Instant Booking rolled out in those countries. So if you think -- backing up a little bit, when we look at this consumer journey, I talk about instead of searching around lots and lots of different sites for all the information and then all the prices, our vision, our strategic plan here is you come to TripAdvisor because of all that great content. And then, of course, you see that we've done the work for you. We've searched the web, we've pulled back all of these prices. And with Instant Booking, odds are good and becoming great that we'll be able to feature the lowest price if you want to book on TripAdvisor. If in fact, you have loyalty to a different site, that's great. There's a meta button that clicks over there. If you prefer booking brand direct and you really want to be on that brand site, great, there's a brand click. If you're happy booking on TripAdvisor with it being fulfilled by brand, we'll have that option. If you're happy booking on TripAdvisor fulfilled by a great OTA partner, excellent. We'd like to look at it as no matter what your preferences are, we'll have you -- we'll be able to address your need in our store. And then you made the purchase, you stay at the hotel, you're in market, you get to use all of our attractions, you're using our app because so many people do. And so we've stayed with you during this travel purchase. And all of that is supposed to yield more. Great, I am now used to TripAdvisor as a research and a booking tool. And the leading indicator I like to look at the most is that repeat rate. Is it exactly a perfect metric for showing that Instant Booking is working? Can't tell or time will tell, but it is the thing that we are looking to address and build as a long-term advantage in the Instant Booking path versus the meta path. Because as people are comfortable booking with us and for some people try was the only way they're going to get comfortable, then we're delivering good experience if the product works and they come back and book again. So that's why I love the repeat rate. Did I forget your first question now -- first half of your question?"

We were able to test a lot of the scalability question marks that we had and kind of we passed those, and that was a slower rollout as we went to percentage of traffic. And then as we roll out to the rest of the world, we're lot more comfortable that our infrastructure can handle load, and so we tend to roll out quicker. Again, as example, in the past 45 days, rolled out to probably a dozen more markets since the beginning of the year. And as I indicated, we expect the pace to continue at that rate such that we'll be out in the next quarter or so with all or almost all of our major markets. The product looks good. There is -- when we say we launched it, it gives us Instant Booking capabilities primarily with Booking.com as our partner, and then we are working aggressively to bring the rest of our suppliers, all the different brands and, obviously, the independence to all these new markets. One thing that slows us down is that for some of our partners, we don't have all of the room content in the language that we're rolling out in. So we need to go back and get that before we can turn some of those partners live. When I talk about it being a year or  2 to get Instant Booking to really be fully rolled out with all of the value that I talk about, all the room content, all the best pricing, it's because there's a lot of work still to be done to get all the partners with all the content in all the languages, handling payments in all the markets.

So in a sense, Airbnb as a competitor, we don't particularly view their traffic or the person looking for the shared room is someone that's naturally on TripAdvisor, but for the other piece for the city or for the urban inventory we do. Hard to say given the strength of the hotel industry currently, that Airbnb is a problem. They've just added a lot of supply into the equation, and I personally believe that they are generating more travel on the part of consumers because of the supply that they've added. I have no data point to back that up, but it's kind of logical to me as they continue to grow with the hotel companies and folks like us and other OTAs continue to be very strong in our markets. In terms of the mobile experience, a tough question. There's various aspects of our app and our experience that I think are just terrific. You can find great places to eat where -- nearby where you're standing all around the globe. You can book the hotel, we've stored your credit cards, it's 2 clicks and you're done.

From a -- is there more to do? Absolutely. I just think the amount of data that TripAdvisor has that can help you plan a trip, that is so hard for us to figure out how to surface at the right time, really hard to read your mind to know what you're going to be looking for next, but we've got it because we have so much users -- so many users. We have so much data on all topics related to travel, plus we've got the community standing behind us. So do we bring that all to the forefront in a perfect way on the mobile small screen? No. So I still think we're in very early days in what we can do, but we're incredibly well positioned because of the rich content across all travel categories and because of our installed app footprint, which is, as you know, just huge.

The second factor you have to consider is that this is an aggregate number across all devices, and our mobile revenue per shopper is growing much more quickly. Sorry, our number of mobile shoppers is growing much more quickly. So you got a mix shift, which drags down the average. Having said that, we are very seriously improving our revenue per shopper in mobile. In constant currency terms, in 2015, we improved revenue per shopper in mobile by about 30%. So we're improving, but it's still significantly lower monetization than desktop, which is a negative impact.

And if you're dividing the revenue from a consolidated basis, you are including subsidiary revenue. So just keep that in mind as you're looking at that ratio."

So the display that you currently see on our site, I can almost promise you it will change somehow at some point because we're still iterating. What you're referring to, I believe, is we internally call it click distribution. So when someone's looking at a hotel page, what percentage are clicking on Instant Book versus top meta offering versus the second, third, et cetera. And so a majority of the clicks are still going into the meta flow versus Instant Book on average, and we don't necessarily view that as a bad thing for where we are today. We know we can influence that a lot depending on how we choose to present Instant Book as an option. We do carefully measure, I don't disclose, but we carefully measure the conversion rate for Instant Book when our prices are as good versus not as good versus better than the meta options, and you can imagine that has an impact. And when -- and the biggest thing that we can do to your question is to actually get Instant Booking available on more properties and more markets than sort of build more partners underneath the Instant Booking placement. So in the U.S., for instance, we have really good coverage right now. You look out most any city for most any hotel and there's probably -- if it's bookable online, there's probably an Instant Booking option, because we have a good selection of partners between the brands and the OTAs not as good in one of our newer foreign language markets because we don't have some of that room level content yet."

The meta rollout, some of those challenges were more driven by our clients' ability to upgrade or change their bidding mechanism and styles and measurement based upon what we were doing. And we have a lot of partners, a lot of clients. So we can -- they all had to move forward on the change. With Instant Booking, our client who is an Instant Booking partner has to do a decent amount of some technical work to get integrated, but it doesn't really have much an effect on all the rest of the partners so -- all the rest of the meta partners. So the rollout schedule and timing is much more under our control because -- especially with the Priceline Group now, we can basically roll out in just about any market that we want to, and we don't need the other partners to do any technical work. So lessons learned, look, with meta, we needed to -- we've given our partners more warning, more sample and more time, a bunch of things. But it doesn't apply quite as well to the IB rollout here. To the question of hey, users changing the behavior, well, I think it was lot -- meta was a lot easier on the users back then, because well, they put in their dates and they just get more information, hip hip hooray. Here, we actually have to teach them what this book on TripAdvisor button means because it's not the site -- it's not what they're used to getting on our site.

TripAdvisor is rapidly building the best end-to-end user experience in travel. Helping users plan and book the perfect trip is our North Star, and 2015 was a foundational year in pursuit of this mission. We are reinventing how users book and have awesome trips. Think about how it's been for the past 5 to 10 years. You've gone online. You've likely searched on TripAdvisor. You've looked on search engines. You've searched destination sites. You've checked travel booking sites. You've checked supplier sites. At the end of it all, you've searched at least 15 to 20 different sites to try to figure out where do you want to go, where are you going to have a great time, where are you going to stay, how are you going to book it. And then you've got to go do the whole search all over again to go find the best price and feel safe about where you're booking.
At TripAdvisor, we've sought to solve these inefficiencies in that travel booking journey. Recently, we've done this in 3 ways. First, we've widened our content moat, reinforcing our leadership position as the most trusted brand in travel research. Since 2011, network effects have intensified as user content has accelerated from 30 contributions per minute to more than 200 per minute. In 2015 alone, users added 82 million contributions on TripAdvisor, and we now offer users 320 million reviews and opinions on 6.2 million businesses around the globe. Second, in 2013, anticipating changing consumer preferences, we added hotel metasearch, enabling users to find all the best prices from more than 200 different booking engines across the web. And third, over the past couple of years, again, anticipating consumers' growing desire to transact in a one-stop shopping fashion on mobile devices, we started to add bookability to our offering. So now imagine this, rather than visiting those 15 to 20 sites again and again to make sure that you're finding the best hotel, getting the best price and booking with a brand you trust, consider this more efficient booking journey. A user goes to TripAdvisor for the trusted review content to find out where to go. We have all the information you need to plan that perfect trip. And when they're shopping for a hotel, they stay on TripAdvisor because we have all the best prices and information regarding availability on the web. And when they're comparing prices on TripAdvisor, they see that Book on TripAdvisor button, which has room prices that are at least as good or better than the metasearch options. They connect the TripAdvisor is the brand I trust, with TripAdvisor is where I find the lowest price, with TripAdvisor is where I can find and book the lowest price. So they click, they book, they're done right then and there.
This improved hotel shopping experience isn't just a hypothetical future. It's here today. It's the improved travel booking journey TripAdvisor is delivering to more and more users in more and more markets today. In 2015, we took some major steps in establishing Instant Booking as a strong platform. As you may know, we've partnered with 8 of the 10 largest hotel chains. And in October, we announced an Instant Booking partnership with the Priceline Group, the largest OTA in the world. As a result, users are able to book 450,000 hotels worldwide on TripAdvisor. Following our full Instant Book launch to U.S. and U.K. users in September, we launched to all English language countries this January. Instant Booking is diluting our near-term financial results, but we see good leading indicators of success. 
Conversion rates are comparable to metasearch. Users are coming back to TripAdvisor more frequently, and repeat booking rates are up, all suggesting that more users are coming to know TripAdvisor as a great place to book.
As a result, we're moving quickly with Instant Booking. In February, we rolled out to the rest of our major European markets. In March, our plan is to roll out additional countries in Asia Pacific and LATAM markets. And the exciting result is that in Q2, in time for the seasonal pickup in travel planning, we will be live to the vast majority of our hotel shoppers around the globe. Our job doesn't end there. We're working to improve the room level content, the descriptions and photos that give users more confidence to book. We're working to onboard more partners, including more hotel chains like Starwood and more independent hotels to give users the comfort of booking supplier direct. It may take a year or 2 to perfect our Instant Booking offering, to get all the room content right, to make an even better more seamless booking experience and to educate more users about our unbeatable offer. Over the past 2 years, we've leveraged our strong profitable hotel base to invest in our next-generation booking technology. While the global Instant Booking launch will mask our core growth this year, it is an imperative step as we follow our North Star, navigating the path towards creating the best user experience in travel.
Now shifting gears a bit. How many people book a vacation simply because they want to stay at a particular hotel? The answer, not many. We travel because we want to relax, we want to discover, we seek adventure, we want to create great memories with friends or family. In short, we want to do stuff. TripAdvisor is in the business of delivering these memorable experiences. The TripAdvisor brand is synonymous with inspiration, discovery and helping users plan and have a great trip. And unlike most other travel brands, users bring TripAdvisor with them on the trip. Over 50% of our traffic visits are on mobile devices, the majority of that's on the phone. And users have downloaded our apps more than 290 million times. When you arrive in your destination, TripAdvisor is your own personal travel guide, helping you find what to do, where to eat  and what businesses to visit and which to avoid. 
Our profitable hotel business enables us to invest in complementary categories, attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals. These are businesses that help users have a great trip, engage more users in more moments and create a stickier end-to-end travel experience. The categories also open up our global platform to more advertising partners helping them grow their business.
Drilling down on this Other segment. Over the long term, we believe attractions can be our next $1 billion revenue business. It's a fragmented $80 billion market opportunity in the U.S. and Europe alone. It has attractive commission rates. We already -- we're already the clear leader in terms of content and audience and adding Viator's transaction capabilities reinforces our lead. We're growing quickly, leveraging the best to what TripAdvisor and Viator have to offer. 
In 2015, the Viator team did a great job launching Marketplace nearly tripling the number of bookable properties from 11,000 to 32,000. Matching great attractions content with more supply choice for more consumers, we saw TripAdvisor sourced bookings on Viator grow rapidly in 2015. 
In 2016, we're focused on making it even easier for users to book. This quarter, we're launching Instant Booking on TripAdvisor for attractions on both mobile and desktop. We're leveraging our large installed base of app users to deliver timely app notifications, making bookings an easier experience for travelers when they are in-market. We believe that capturing only single-digit market share will enable attractions to become our next $1 billion revenue business.
We have a great opportunity in restaurants as well. We've rapidly expanded TheFork, both organically and inorganically, launching in Denmark during the fourth quarter. We now operate in 12 countries and have more than 33,000 bookable restaurants for travelers and locals alike. User demand is growing rapidly as well. 
We love restaurants for a few reasons: one, we're delighting users more frequently with helpful rich content all around the world; two, through TheFork, we're helping users seamlessly book great places to eat; and three, our content drives millions of visitors to TripAdvisor more frequently, keeping us top of mind, even when the user isn't in travel planning mode.
Rounding out the Other segment. Our Vacation Rentals business continues to post great results as it hones its free-to-list transaction model. We generated more than 65% of Vacation Rentals revenue from free-to-list in 2015 and more than 70% of the 770,000 properties are now bookable online.
As I conclude, 2016 is another important year on our journey to build the best user experience in travel. We're in a great position right now, but our industry continues to evolve and competition abounds. For these reasons, we have to move quickly and launch Instant Booking around the globe. We also need to continue to invest in our end-to-end user experience, invest in mobile and invest in growing supply and driving higher conversion in all of our major product categories. As a result, expenses will likely grow faster than revenue this year as they did in 2015, but this is the right path forward on our journey. We always manage our business for the long term. It is the best way to build a business that creates the most value for our users, our clients and our shareholders.
Now here's Ernst."

My first 3 months on the job have allowed me to understand our business close up. And what strikes me is that while the company has achieved so much in it's short history, from Steve all the way down in the organization, the company is deeply committed to make sure our future is even better still. This commitment to improve and willingness to adapt to achieve greatness is very unique to our company culture. 
When I look at the $1.3 trillion travel market, and I compare TripAdvisor's significant influence on travel commerce with how undermonetized we are, I see a massive growth opportunity ahead. We're experiencing near-term headwinds as we roll out Instant Booking, but once we've established our end-to-end product offering, we will have positioned ourselves to drive growth and better monetization in the future. 
With that as a backdrop, let's review our Q4 and our full year 2015 results. First comment is that our financial results should be viewed in light of significant currency headwinds. Full year 2015 revenue grew 20% in reported currency versus 27% in constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA was flat in reported currency versus 14% growth in constant currency. Q4 revenue grew 7% in reported currency or 12% in constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA growth in Q4 was negative 11% in reported currency versus negative 2% in constant currency. 
Note that our Q4 GAAP net income of $3 million or $0.02 per diluted share was largely impacted by a one-time noncash item to settle our pledge obligation with the TripAdvisor Charitable Foundation. A total of $67 million was paid in company common stock. This one-time settlement means that moving forward we will not contribute part of our profits to the foundation, which will be a net benefit to EBITDA. To give you a sense of the size of this impact, this would've been a net reduction of $8 million in 2015 without the settlement.
Q4 Hotel segment revenue growth was 4% or approximately 8% in constant currency, and Hotel adjusted EBITDA margin was 37%. Digging into the hotel business, as expected, Q4 click-based revenue declined 1% in reported currency or grew 5% in constant currency.
2015 can really be characterized as a tale of 2 halves. We had nice growth in the first half, followed by deceleration due to lower meta CPC pricing as well as dilution from our Instant Booking rollout in the U.S. and the U.K. These trends were most pronounced in Q4. We estimate that our accelerated Instant Booking rollout in the U.S. and in the U.K., our 2 largest markets, negatively impacted Q4 revenue by $9 million and EBITDA by $6 million. For the full year 2015, we estimate Instant Booking negatively impacted revenue by $36 million and EBITDA by $26 million.
Another trend is the ongoing consumer shift to mobile devices. Phone hotel shoppers grew 36% during 2015, while combined desktop and tablet shoppers grew 10%. Phone hotel shoppers accounted for approximately 30% of our total hotel shoppers during Q4 and monetized at approximately 30% the rate of desktop and tablet in Q4. This compares to a 19% rate last year. Obviously, the continued lower monetization rate relative to other devices poses a continued headwind to aggregate revenue per shopper growth, resulting in revenue per shopper growth decelerating even -- while both desktop and phone individually are growing in revenue per shopper.
This ongoing U.S. user shift to mobile is a key strategic driver for Instant Booking as the frequency of use and smaller screen size places an even higher premium on delivering a simple end-to-end value proposition. We're seeing strong repeat booking rates on our mobile app experience and we continue to optimize helping more users find and book hotels with ease.
Now moving to our Other segment. Revenue growth normalized to 32% in Q4 as we fully lapped our 2014 acquisitions. Q4 adjusted EBITDA margins were a negative 16% due to this category's high revenue seasonality and, therefore, low relative Q4 revenues against its largely fixed cost structure.
Moving on to consolidated expenses and cash flow. Consolidated expenses grew ahead of revenue for Q4 and for the full year, reflecting the continued investment in our future growth. As for taxes, our Q4 GAAP effective tax rate was 17%, which was lower than our expectations due to a change in jurisdictional earnings and certain discrete items. We expect our 2016 GAAP effective tax rate to be in the mid-20s and is dependent, of course, on international revenue and expense mix among other factors.
Cash flow. On cash flow, we generated $74 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter or 24% of revenue. CapEx for the quarter was $16 million or 5% of revenue. In 2016, we expect CapEx to decrease. Q4 free cash flow was $58 million or 19% of revenue, and we generated $273 million of free cash flow during the full year.
Our liquidity remains strong as our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities' balance was $698 million at the end of Q4. We also ended the year with an undrawn balance of about $800 million from our $1 billion credit facility. We also have $104 million remaining under our share repurchase program.
That was my summary of the 2015 financial results. Now let's look ahead to 2016 and beyond. We operate in a very dynamic travel market space, and within that dynamic marketplace, we are shifting our business rapidly to capture the long-term opportunity. We will be faced with important decision points throughout 2016 as we execute, such as how to best promote this great new booking experience. Because we manage our business for the long term, throughout 2016, we will do what we think is necessary to optimize the multi-year financial outcome, not necessarily what will make us hit any specific 2016 financial result. For this reason, we are discontinuing our past practice of providing a guidance range for annual revenue and EBITDA. Instead, I will provide you with directional expectations for 2016 and 2017 for our 2 reporting segments as well as for total expenses. We believe that these building blocks provide a good foundation for modeling our business and actually provide greater insight into underlying trends than we've offered in the past. Moreover, I will share some early data points of our Instant Booking progress.
So let's start with the Hotel segment. As we think about 2016, we need to first start with our 2015 exit base. We exited Q4 2015 with 4% growth in the Hotel segment and negative 1% growth for click-based revenue. Note that these growth rates decelerated from 8% and 6%, respectively, in Q3. As we look at the first half of 2016, we expect that these growth rates to decelerate further, due to the tougher first half of 2015 meta CPC comps as well as near-term dilution from our Instant Booking rollout this quarter and next. 
Importantly, we anticipate that revenue per hotel shopper, and therefore, both click-based revenue growth and Hotel segment growth rates will reaccelerate in the back half of the year, as we start lapping the Instant Booking rollout in the U.S. and the U.K. and also meet easier meta CPC pricing comps. Despite this reacceleration in the second half, we expect growth for the full year to be muted. 
Throughout 2016, we will continue to invest to improve supply, content and marketing, and as such, we expect expense growth to outpace revenue growth in the Hotel segment, resulting in margin contraction in the Hotel segment. As we look out to 2017, we believe the higher second half of 2016 exit rates and lapping the full Instant Booking rollout portend to growth acceleration. We also believe our Hotel segment margins will stabilize in 2017 and potentially expand, as revenue reacceleration does not require similar expense growth.
So a reasonable question is, why are we willing to take such significant near-term financial impact from this Instant Booking rollout? Firstly, we believe Instant Booking presents a massive long-term growth opportunity for us. Our revenue per hotel shopper is currently an order of magnitude lower than that of our largest partners. That monetization difference represents a multibillion dollar opportunity for us. Instant Booking plays a key role. 
Looking at our longest standing cohort, the U.S., Instant Booking is already more than 50% of revenues on our mobile app. That percentage is much lower on other devices, but it speaks to the Instant Booking's potential to become a substantial part of our business over the next few years. 
Our second reason is that we are seeing some positive trends. One, Instant Booking conversion rates improved throughout 2015 and are now comparable to meta, showing that we are improving the product and the users are getting increasingly comfortable booking on TripAdvisor. We fully expect to improve conversion rates further. Two, average booking values increased by more than 10% over the course of the year. We attribute this to our success partnering with big global hotel partners as well as adding the Priceline Group onto the platform. Three, partners are paying double-digit commission rates for bookings on average, and we think this is perhaps misunderstood. This is consistent across each of our different partner types: OTAs, chains and independents. Four, and perhaps more -- most importantly, we're seeing positive early signs of repeat usage. Hotel shoppers are increasingly returning to TripAdvisor to complete a booking that was previously attempted but abandoned. Additionally, 10% of Instant Bookings are coming from users who have booked with us before, which is great, because this is still such a new product for most of our users.
Now the addition of Instant Booking doesn't mean metasearch is going away, far from it. We expect metasearch will remain a large part of our total revenues, and we see significant opportunity to continue to grow. A huge number of hotel shoppers are in research mode and we're aiming to turn most of these lookers into clickers. In meta, only a fraction of hotel shoppers click on a paid link. This represents an additional source of leakage in our hotel business and is a large monetization opportunity in its own right. Additionally, given the success other internet companies have had with retargeting, we're launching a similar product this year, enabling metasearch partners to buy in a more targeted profitable fashion.
In 2016, our focus as a management team is on revenue per hotel shopper, as this is -- as this metric is key to the long-term growth of our Hotel segment. Revenue per hotel shopper includes both Instant Booking and meta, and growing this aggregate total is ultimately what we're after. We expect revenue per shopper growth to decelerate as a result of our Instant Booking launch, and later in the year, we believe that growth will improve similar to what we saw in our metasearch rollout in 2013. 
Now turning our attention to the 2016 trends in the Other segment. Our Other segment exited 2015 at a 32% growth in Q4, and we expect continued solid top line growth in 2016. We've operated this segment at slightly below breakeven EBITDA margins over the past year, and we will continue to reinvest in 2016 as we focus on product improvements and supply acquisition. Therefore, EBITDA margins are likely to contract and lower absolute EBITDA could result. In line with the 3- to 5-year time horizon we outlined for this segment last year, in 2017, we believe margins will begin to stabilize and could potentially expand, as greater revenue scale does not require similar levels of investment. Of course, these trends do not include any acquisitions that we may make over this time frame.
Finally, some specific thoughts on our 2016 organic investments as well as how we might deploy capital during the year. We've built a business with significant operational scale on -- one that enables us to execute this major business shift at speed and maintain our focus on the long term. In 2016, we will continue to invest in people to pursue our product and sales initiatives, and indirect expense growth rates should be similar to 2015. We expect that our direct sales and marketing expenses to continue to grow, but at materially lower rates than the 48% growth we experienced in 2015.
In addition to organic investments, we continue to have significant financial capacity for inorganic growth. We are very pleased with the acquisitions we've made over the last few years and remain open to similar opportunities to consolidate great businesses with innovative products and great management teams. Although we look at many opportunities, we remain very selective and are focused on return on investment and long-term value creation. We also continue to evaluate alternative ways to deploy our capital, including share repurchases. 
In conclusion, I'll leave you with 4 structural advantages unique to our business. First, we are extending our lead as the trusted brand in user-generated content, which is making our product better every day, driving audience and helps support low overall customer acquisition costs. Second, we have a superior consumer value proposition, helping users plan, compare prices and book hotels all in one place. Third, we have complementary businesses that help users throughout their entire trip, driving increased loyalty, usage frequency and additional revenue streams. Fourth, our ownership structure is an advantage as Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings supports our long-term view.
So to summarize, we believe we're on the right path to create long-term value. After some near-term pressures on revenues and profits, we believe our results will improve later this year and into 2017.
We'll now open up the call to your questions."

So it really kind of upped the opportunity for TripAdvisor to be showing a great price with all this content. Very hard for us to tease out exactly what causes conversion rate to lift, but we're confident in saying the extra or the better content that we added to the site certainly helped. As we look forward, it's mostly tuning, if you will. There's a lot of properties that are available. We want to make sure that we have great pricing on as many of them or all of them as we can. We want to make sure we have a great experience in terms of someone entering the booking flow and getting all the information that they need in order to make that -- in order to trust us with their credit card or storing the credit card. So we're doing all the things, and that's why we're seeing the improved rate. I'm not sure I would point to a single big win factor that's going to be out there versus incremental improvement, and I said the incremental improvement will likely translate to all points of sale at the same time. We're not seeing a big difference per market in terms of how consumers are behaving. Conversion, you asked about phone versus desktop. And so the conversion naturally is different. Some of that, I believe, is going to structural for quite some time. But we measure -- when we talk about rev per shopper with you folks, we're also, of course, measuring it, both mobile web, mobile app, tablet, desktop. We've got it broken down in lots of different ways here, and we're constantly making improvements in each of those categories."

So as you know, as we disclosed, we launched in Europe -- launching LATAM and other markets. So that will mostly we done over the next 90, 120 days. So that's great. It absolutely was the meaningful factor in us accelerating our global rollout, which kind of starts the training purpose or training clock going, because we know we have a hill to climb to teach people that TripAdvisor is not only also awesome for research but a safe place to book. And by offering great content, great prices, we think we're doing that where it's available. So we're not doing that yet in a bunch of countries because we don't have any Instant Booking rolled out in those countries. So if you think -- backing up a little bit, when we look at this consumer journey, I talk about instead of searching around lots and lots of different sites for all the information and then all the prices, our vision, our strategic plan here is you come to TripAdvisor because of all that great content. And then, of course, you see that we've done the work for you. We've searched the web, we've pulled back all of these prices. And with Instant Booking, odds are good and becoming great that we'll be able to feature the lowest price if you want to book on TripAdvisor. If in fact, you have loyalty to a different site, that's great. There's a meta button that clicks over there. If you prefer booking brand direct and you really want to be on that brand site, great, there's a brand click. If you're happy booking on TripAdvisor with it being fulfilled by brand, we'll have that option. If you're happy booking on TripAdvisor fulfilled by a great OTA partner, excellent. We'd like to look at it as no matter what your preferences are, we'll have you -- we'll be able to address your need in our store. And then you made the purchase, you stay at the hotel, you're in market, you get to use all of our attractions, you're using our app because so many people do. And so we've stayed with you during this travel purchase. And all of that is supposed to yield more, ""Great, I am now used to TripAdvisor as a research and a booking tool."" And the leading indicator I like to look at the most is that repeat rate. Is it exactly a perfect metric for showing that Instant Booking is working? Can't tell or time will tell, but it is the thing that we are looking to address and build as a long-term advantage in the Instant Booking path versus the meta path. Because as people are comfortable booking with us and for some people trial is the only way they're going to get comfortable, then we're delivering a good experience, the product works and they come back and book again. So that's why I love the repeat rate. Did I forget your first question now -- first half of your question?"

We have a very competitive product in that space, but we come at it more from a, look, the individual who's looking for a great place to stay in London and they might pick a hotel, they might pick an apartment, they might pick even a more traditional vacation rental, our supply footprint covers them all, and we're growing that around the globe. So in a sense, Airbnb is a competitor, we don't particularly view their traffic or the person looking for the shared room is someone that's naturally on TripAdvisor, but for the other piece for the city or for the urban inventory we do. Hard to say, given the strength of the hotel industry currently, that Airbnb is a problem. They've just added a lot of supply into the equation, and I personally believe that they are generating more travel on the part of consumers because of the supply that they've added. I have no data point to back that up, but it's kind of logical to me as they continue to grow with the hotel companies and folks like us and the other OTAs continue to be very strong in our markets. In terms of the mobile experience, a tough question. There's various aspects of our app, in our experience, that I think are just terrific. You can find great places to eat where -- nearby where you're standing all around the globe. You can book the hotel, we've stored your credit card, it's 2 clicks and you're done. There's tremendous amount of benefit that we've achieved, I believe, by delivering a great user experience for close-in hotel shopping, places to eat, things to do, bringing the bookability of our attraction inventory onto the phone, really, really nice. From a -- is there more to do? Absolutely. I just think the amount of data that TripAdvisor has that can help you plan a trip, that is so hard for us to figure out how to surface at the right time, really hard to read your mind to know what you're going to be looking for next, but we've got it because we have so much users -- so many users. We have so much data on all topics related to travel, plus we've got the community standing behind us. So do we bring that all to the forefront in a perfect way on the mobile small screen? No. So I still think we're in very early days in what we can do, but we're incredibly well positioned because of the rich content across all travel categories and because of our installed app footprint, which is, as you know, just huge. So I'd say way more opportunity ahead of us than we have tackled already."

So on the revenue per shopper, as you pointed out, we did decelerate in Q4 on the revenue per hotel shopper. In total, revenue per hotel shopper declined by 12%, and there's a couple of things if you unpack that and if you think about modeling that for the future. There's a couple of things going on there. One important driver is currency, which had a significant impact on the -- on that in the fourth quarter in particular. The second factor you have to consider is that this is an aggregate number across all devices, and our mobile revenue per shopper is growing much more quickly. Sorry, our number of mobile shoppers is growing much more quickly. So you got a mix shift, which drags down the average. Having said that, we are very seriously improving our revenue per shopper in mobile. In constant currency terms, in 2015, we improved revenue per shopper in mobile by about 30%. So we're improving, but it's still significantly lower monetization than desktop, which is a negative impact. And then we had, of course, Instant Book in the fourth quarter, which also negatively impacts that revenue per hotel shopper growth. So as you think about that going forward, we do expect further pressure on for -- if you just aggregate now the desktop revenue per hotel shopper and the mobile revenue per hotel shopper, particularly on desktop but also on mobile, we expect negative pressure on that in the first half before the growth rate improves, again, on the revenue per hotel shopper."

To the part of the question on the kind of absolute number of hotel shoppers, it's clearly growing stronger on the phone. We're not projecting a lot of growth going forward on the desktop, tablet simply because the user behavior is shifting. When we look at modeling going forward, it's tough for us to do as well, but I would point out the cycle, if you will, of -- as our revenue per hotel shopper improves, we're able to acquire more traffic on our sort of break-even traffic basis. And of course, we're always trying to acquire more hotel shopper traffic growth. Simply put, if we make more money per hotel shopper visitor, we can bid more on search engines and other traffic generating sources. So some of the decline in the hotel shopper absolute number in Q4 would be related to our lower rev per shopper number, which in turn means we were able to buy a bit less. As that flips around second half of next year or whenever it does, you'll get to see some of that growth reappear."

So the display that you currently see on our site, I can almost promise you it will change somehow at some point because we're still iterating. What you're referring to, I believe, is what we internally call the click distribution. So when someone's looking at a hotel page, what percentage are clicking on Instant Book versus the top meta offering versus the second, third, et cetera. And so a majority of the clicks are still going into the meta flow versus Instant Book on average, and we don't necessarily view that as a bad thing for where we are today. We know we can influence that a lot depending on how we choose to present Instant Book as an option. We do carefully measure, I don't disclose, but we carefully measure the conversion rate for Instant Book when our prices are as good versus not as good versus better than the meta options, and you can imagine that has an impact. And when -- and the biggest thing that we can do to your question is to actually get Instant Booking available on more properties in more markets than sort of build more partners underneath the Instant Booking placement. So in the U.S., for instance, we have really good coverage right now. You look at most any city for most any hotel and there's probably -- if it's bookable online, there's probably an Instant Booking option, because we have a good selection of partners between the brands and the OTAs not as good in one of our newer foreign language markets because we don't have some of that room level content yet."

The meta rollout, some of those challenges were more driven by our clients' ability to upgrade or change their bidding mechanism and styles and measurement based upon what we were doing. And we have a lot of partners, a lot of clients. So we kind of -- they all had to move forward on the change. With Instant Booking, a client who is an Instant Booking partner has to do a decent amount of -- or some technical work to get integrated, but it doesn't really have much of an effect on all the rest of the partners so -- all the rest of the meta partners. So the rollout schedule and timing is much more under our control because -- especially with the Priceline Group now, we can basically roll out in just about any market that we want to, and we don't need the other partners to do any technical work. So lessons learned, look, with the meta, we needed to have given our partners more warning, more sample and more time, a bunch of things. But it doesn't apply quite as well to the IB rollout here. To the question of hey, users changing the behavior, well, I think it was a lot -- meta was a lot easier on the users back then, because wowl, they put in their dates and they just get more information, hip hip hooray.

TripAdvisor is rapidly building the best end-to-end user experience in travel. Helping users plan and book the perfect trip is our North Star, and 2015 was a foundational year in pursuit of this mission. We are reinventing how users book and have awesome trips. Think about how it's been for the past 5 to 10 years. You've gone online. You've likely searched on TripAdvisor. You've looked on search engines. You've searched destination sites. You've checked travel booking sites. You've checked supplier sites. At the end of it all, you've searched at least 15 to 20 different sites to try to figure out where do you want to go, where are you going to have a great time, where are you going to stay, how are you going to book it. And then you've got to go do the whole search all over again to go find the best price and feel safe about where you're booking.
At TripAdvisor, we've sought to solve these inefficiencies in that travel booking journey. Recently, we've done this in 3 ways. First, we've widened our content moat, reinforcing our leadership position as the most trusted brand in travel research. Since 2011, network effects have intensified as user content has accelerated from 30 contributions per minute to more than 200 per minute. In 2015 alone, users added 82 million contributions on TripAdvisor, and we now offer users 320 million reviews and opinions on 6.2 million businesses around the globe. Second, in 2013, anticipating changing consumer preferences, we added hotel metasearch, enabling users to find all the best prices from more than 200 different booking engines across the web. And third, over the past couple of years, again, anticipating consumers' growing desire to transact in a one-stop shopping fashion on mobile devices, we started to add bookability to our offering. So now imagine this, rather than visiting those 15 to 20 sites again and again to make sure that you're finding the best hotel, getting the best price and booking with a brand you trust, consider this more efficient booking journey. A user goes to TripAdvisor for the trusted review content to find out where to go. We have all the information you need to plan that perfect trip. And when they're shopping for a hotel, they stay on TripAdvisor because we have all the best prices and information regarding availability on the web. And when they're comparing prices on TripAdvisor, they see that Book on TripAdvisor button, which has room prices that are at least as good or better than the metasearch options. They connect the TripAdvisor is the brand I trust, with TripAdvisor is where I find the lowest price, with TripAdvisor is where I can find and book the lowest price. So they click, they book, they're done right then and there.
This improved hotel shopping experience isn't just a hypothetical future. It's here today. It's the improved travel booking journey TripAdvisor is delivering to more and more users in more and more markets today. In 2015, we took some major steps in establishing Instant Booking as a strong platform. As you may know, we've partnered with 8 of the 10 largest hotel chains. And in October, we announced an Instant Booking partnership with the Priceline Group, the largest OTA in the world. As a result, users are able to book 450,000 hotels worldwide on TripAdvisor. Following our full Instant Book launch to U.S. and U.K. users in September, we launched to all English language countries this January. Instant Booking is diluting our near-term financial results, but we see good leading indicators of success. 
Conversion rates are comparable to metasearch. Users are coming back to TripAdvisor more frequently, and repeat booking rates are up, all suggesting that more users are coming to know TripAdvisor as a great place to book.
As a result, we're moving quickly with Instant Booking. In February, we rolled out to the rest of our major European markets. In March, our plan is to roll out additional countries in Asia Pacific and LATAM markets. And the exciting result is that in Q2, in time for the seasonal pickup in travel planning, we will be live to the vast majority of our hotel shoppers around the globe. Our job doesn't end there. We're working to improve the room level content, the descriptions and photos that give users more confidence to book. We're working to onboard more partners, including more hotel chains like Starwood and more independent hotels to give users the comfort of booking supplier direct. It may take a year or 2 to perfect our Instant Booking offering, to get all the room content right, to make an even better more seamless booking experience and to educate more users about our unbeatable offer. Over the past 2 years, we've leveraged our strong profitable hotel base to invest in our next-generation booking technology. While the global Instant Booking launch will mask our core growth this year, it is an imperative step as we follow our North Star, navigating the path towards creating the best user experience in travel.
Now shifting gears a bit. How many people book a vacation simply because they want to stay at a particular hotel? The answer, not many. We travel because we want to relax, we want to discover, we seek adventure, we want to create great memories with friends or family. In short, we want to do stuff. TripAdvisor is in the business of delivering these memorable experiences. The TripAdvisor brand is synonymous with inspiration, discovery and helping users plan and have a great trip. And unlike most other travel brands, users bring TripAdvisor with them on the trip. Over 50% of our traffic visits are on mobile devices, the majority of that's on the phone. And users have downloaded our apps more than 290 million times. When you arrive in your destination, TripAdvisor is your own personal travel guide, helping you find what to do, where to eat and what businesses to visit and which to avoid. 
Our profitable hotel business enables us to invest in complementary categories, attractions, restaurants and vacation rentals. These are businesses that help users have a great trip, engage more users in more moments and create a stickier end-to-end travel experience. The categories also open up our global platform to more advertising partners helping them grow their business.
Drilling down on this Other segment. Over the long term, we believe attractions can be our next $1 billion revenue business. It's a fragmented $80 billion market opportunity in the U.S. and Europe alone. It has attractive commission rates. We already -- we're already the clear leader in terms of content and audience and adding Viator's transaction capabilities reinforces our lead. We're growing quickly, leveraging the best to what TripAdvisor and Viator have to offer. 
In 2015, the Viator team did a great job launching Marketplace nearly tripling the number of bookable properties from 11,000 to 32,000. Matching great attractions content with more supply choice for more consumers, we saw TripAdvisor sourced bookings on Viator grow rapidly in 2015. 
In 2016, we're focused on making it even easier for users to book. This quarter, we're launching Instant Booking on TripAdvisor for attractions on both mobile and desktop. We're leveraging our large installed base of app users to deliver timely app notifications, making bookings an easier experience for travelers when they are in-market. We believe that capturing only single-digit market share will enable attractions to become our next $1 billion revenue business.
We have a great opportunity in restaurants as well. We've rapidly expanded TheFork, both organically and inorganically, launching in Denmark during the fourth quarter. We now operate in 12 countries and have more than 33,000 bookable restaurants for travelers and locals alike. User demand is growing rapidly as well. 
We love restaurants for a few reasons: one, we're delighting users more frequently with helpful rich content all around the world; two, through TheFork, we're helping users seamlessly book great places to eat; and three, our content drives millions of visitors to TripAdvisor more frequently, keeping us top of mind, even when the user isn't in travel planning mode.
Rounding out the Other segment. Our Vacation Rentals business continues to post great results as it hones its free-to-list transaction model. We generated more than 65% of Vacation Rentals revenue from free-to-list in 2015 and more than 70% of the 770,000 properties are now bookable online.
As I conclude, 2016 is another important year on our journey to build the best user experience in travel. We're in a great position right now, but our industry continues to evolve and competition abounds. For these reasons, we have to move quickly and launch Instant Booking around the globe. We also need to continue to invest in our end-to-end user experience, invest in mobile and invest in growing supply and driving higher conversion in all of our major product categories. As a result, expenses will likely grow faster than revenue this year as they did in 2015, but this is the right path forward on our journey. We always manage our business for the long term. It is the best way to build a business that creates the most value for our users, our clients and our shareholders.
Now here's Ernst."

My first 3 months on the job have allowed me to understand our business close up. And what strikes me is that while the company has achieved so much in its short history, from Steve all the way down in the organization, the company is deeply committed to make sure our future is even better still. This commitment to improve and willingness to adapt to achieve greatness is very unique to our company culture. 
When I look at the $1.3 trillion travel market, and I compare TripAdvisor's significant influence on travel commerce with how undermonetized we are, I see a massive growth opportunity ahead. We're experiencing near-term headwinds as we roll out Instant Booking, but once we've established our end-to-end product offering, we will have positioned ourselves to drive growth and better monetization in the future. 
With that as a backdrop, let's review our Q4 and our full year 2015 results. First comment is that our financial results should be viewed in light of significant currency headwinds. Full year 2015 revenue grew 20% in reported currency versus 27% in constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA was flat in reported currency versus 14% growth in constant currency. Q4 revenue grew 7% in reported currency or 12% in constant currency, and adjusted EBITDA growth in Q4 was negative 11% in reported currency versus negative 2% in constant currency. 
Note that our Q4 GAAP net income of $3 million or $0.02 per diluted share was largely impacted by a one-time noncash item to settle our pledge obligation with the TripAdvisor Charitable Foundation. A total of $67 million was paid in company common stock. This one-time settlement means that moving forward we will not contribute part of our profits to the foundation, which will be a net benefit to EBITDA. To give you a sense of the size of this impact, this would've been a net reduction of $8 million in 2015 without the settlement.
Q4 Hotel segment revenue growth was 4% or approximately 8% in constant currency, and Hotel adjusted EBITDA margin was 37%. Digging into the hotel business, as expected, Q4 click-based revenue declined 1% in reported currency or grew 5% in constant currency.
2015 can really be characterized as a tale of 2 halves. We had nice growth in the first half, followed by deceleration due to lower meta CPC pricing as well as dilution from our Instant Booking rollout in the U.S. and the U.K. These trends were most pronounced in Q4. We estimate that our accelerated Instant Booking rollout in the U.S. and in the U.K., our 2 largest markets, negatively impacted Q4 revenue by $9 million and EBITDA by $6 million. For the full year 2015, we estimate Instant Booking negatively impacted revenue by $36 million and EBITDA by $26 million.
Another trend is the ongoing consumer shift to mobile devices. Phone hotel shoppers grew 36% during 2015, while combined desktop and tablet shoppers grew 10%. Phone hotel shoppers accounted for approximately 30% of our total hotel shoppers during Q4 and monetized at approximately 30% the rate of desktop and tablet in Q4. This compares to a 19% rate last year. Obviously, the continued lower monetization rate relative to other devices poses a continued headwind to aggregate revenue per shopper growth, resulting in revenue per shopper growth decelerating even -- while both desktop and phone individually are growing in revenue per shopper.
This ongoing U.S. user shift to mobile is a key strategic driver for Instant Booking as the frequency of use and smaller screen size places an even higher premium on delivering a simple end-to-end value proposition. We're seeing strong repeat booking rates on our mobile app experience and we continue to optimize helping more users find and book hotels with ease.
Now moving to our Other segment. Revenue growth normalized to 32% in Q4 as we fully lapped our 2014 acquisitions. Q4 adjusted EBITDA margins were a negative 16% due to this category's high revenue seasonality and, therefore, low relative Q4 revenues against its largely fixed cost structure.
Moving on to consolidated expenses and cash flow. Consolidated expenses grew ahead of revenue for Q4 and for the full year, reflecting the continued investment in our future growth. As for taxes, our Q4 GAAP effective tax rate was 17%, which was lower than our expectations due to a change in jurisdictional earnings and certain discrete items. We expect our 2016 GAAP effective tax rate to be in the mid-20s and is dependent, of course, on international revenue and expense mix among other factors.
Cash flow. On cash flow, we generated $74 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter or 24% of revenue. CapEx for the quarter was $16 million or 5% of revenue. In 2016, we expect CapEx to decrease. Q4 free cash flow was $58 million or 19% of revenue, and we generated $273 million of free cash flow during the full year.
Our liquidity remains strong as our cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities' balance was $698 million at the end of Q4. We also ended the year with an undrawn balance of about $800 million from our $1 billion credit facility. We also have $104 million remaining under our share repurchase program.
That was my summary of the 2015 financial results. Now let's look ahead to 2016 and beyond. We operate in a very dynamic travel market space, and within that dynamic marketplace, we are shifting our business rapidly to capture the long-term opportunity. We will be faced with important decision points throughout 2016 as we execute, such as how to best promote this great new booking experience. Because we manage our business for the long term, throughout 2016, we will do what we think is necessary to optimize the multi-year financial outcome, not necessarily what will make us hit any specific 2016 financial result. For this reason, we are discontinuing our past practice of providing a guidance range for annual revenue and EBITDA. Instead, I will provide you with directional expectations for 2016 and 2017 for our 2 reporting segments as well as for total expenses. We believe that these building blocks provide a good foundation for modeling our business and actually provide greater insight into underlying trends than we've offered in the past. Moreover, I will share some early data points of our Instant Booking progress.
So let's start with the Hotel segment. As we think about 2016, we need to first start with our 2015 exit base. We exited Q4 2015 with 4% growth in the Hotel segment and negative 1% growth for click-based revenue. Note that these growth rates decelerated from 8% and 6%, respectively, in Q3. As we look at the first half of 2016, we expect that these growth rates to decelerate further, due to the tougher first half of 2015 meta CPC comps as well as near-term dilution from our Instant Booking rollout this quarter and next. 
Importantly, we anticipate that revenue per hotel shopper, and therefore, both click-based revenue growth and Hotel segment growth rates will reaccelerate in the back half of the year, as we start lapping the Instant Booking rollout in the U.S. and the U.K. and also meet easier meta CPC pricing comps. Despite this reacceleration in the second half, we expect growth for the full year to be muted. 
Throughout 2016, we will continue to invest to improve supply, content and marketing, and as such, we expect expense growth to outpace revenue growth in the Hotel segment, resulting in margin contraction in the Hotel segment. As we look out to 2017, we believe the higher second half of 2016 exit rates and lapping the full Instant Booking rollout portend to growth acceleration. We also believe our Hotel segment margins will stabilize in 2017 and potentially expand, as revenue reacceleration does not require similar expense growth.
So a reasonable question is, why are we willing to take such significant near-term financial impact from this Instant Booking rollout? Firstly, we believe Instant Booking presents a massive long-term growth opportunity for us. Our revenue per hotel shopper is currently an order of magnitude lower than that of our largest partners. That monetization difference represents a multibillion dollar opportunity for us. Instant Booking plays a key role. 
Looking at our longest standing cohort, the U.S., Instant Booking is already more than 50% of revenues on our mobile app. That percentage is much lower on other devices, but it speaks to the Instant Booking's potential to become a substantial part of our business over the next few years. 
Our second reason is that we are seeing some positive trends. One, Instant Booking conversion rates improved throughout 2015 and are now comparable to meta, showing that we are improving the product and the users are getting increasingly comfortable booking on TripAdvisor. We fully expect to improve conversion rates further. Two, average booking values increased by more than 10% over the course of the year. We attribute this to our success partnering with big global hotel partners as well as adding the Priceline Group onto the platform. Three, partners are paying double-digit commission rates for bookings on average, and we think this is perhaps misunderstood. This is consistent across each of our different partner types: OTAs, chains and independents. Four, and perhaps more -- most importantly, we're seeing positive early signs of repeat usage. Hotel shoppers are increasingly returning to TripAdvisor to complete a booking that was previously attempted but abandoned. Additionally, 10% of Instant Bookings are coming from users who have booked with us before, which is great, because this is still such a new product for most of our users.
Now the addition of Instant Booking doesn't mean metasearch is going away, far from it. We expect metasearch will remain a large part of our total revenues, and we see significant opportunity to continue to grow. A huge number of hotel shoppers are in research mode and we're aiming to turn most of these lookers into clickers. In meta, only a fraction of hotel shoppers click on a paid link. This represents an additional source of leakage in our hotel business and is a large monetization opportunity in its own right. Additionally, given the success other internet companies have had with retargeting, we're launching a similar product this year, enabling metasearch partners to buy in a more targeted profitable fashion.
In 2016, our focus as a management team is on revenue per hotel shopper, as this is -- as this metric is key to the long-term growth of our Hotel segment. Revenue per hotel shopper includes both Instant Booking and meta, and growing this aggregate total is ultimately what we're after. We expect revenue per shopper growth to decelerate as a result of our Instant Booking launch, and later in the year, we believe that growth will improve similar to what we saw in our metasearch rollout in 2013. 
Now turning our attention to the 2016 trends in the Other segment. Our Other segment exited 2015 at a 32% growth in Q4, and we expect continued solid top line growth in 2016. We've operated this segment at slightly below breakeven EBITDA margins over the past year, and we will continue to reinvest in 2016 as we focus on product improvements and supply acquisition. Therefore, EBITDA margins are likely to contract and lower absolute EBITDA could result. In line with the 3- to 5-year time horizon we outlined for this segment last year, in 2017, we believe margins will begin to stabilize and could potentially expand, as greater revenue scale does not require similar levels of investment. Of course, these trends do not include any acquisitions that we may make over this time frame.
Finally, some specific thoughts on our 2016 organic investments as well as how we might deploy capital during the year. We've built a business with significant operational scale on -- one that enables us to execute this major business shift at speed and maintain our focus on the long term. In 2016, we will continue to invest in people to pursue our product and sales initiatives, and indirect expense growth rates should be similar to 2015. We expect that our direct sales and marketing expenses to continue to grow, but at materially lower rates than the 48% growth we experienced in 2015.
In addition to organic investments, we continue to have significant financial capacity for inorganic growth. We are very pleased with the acquisitions we've made over the last few years and remain open to similar opportunities to consolidate great businesses with innovative products and great management teams. Although we look at many opportunities, we remain very selective and are focused on return on investment and long-term value creation. We also continue to evaluate alternative ways to deploy our capital, including share repurchases. 
In conclusion, I'll leave you with 4 structural advantages unique to our business. First, we are extending our lead as the trusted brand in user-generated content, which is making our product better every day, driving audience and helps support low overall customer acquisition costs. Second, we have a superior consumer value proposition, helping users plan, compare prices and book hotels all in one place. Third, we have complementary businesses that help users throughout their entire trip, driving increased loyalty, usage frequency and additional revenue streams. Fourth, our ownership structure is an advantage as Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings supports our long-term view.
So to summarize, we believe we're on the right path to create long-term value. After some near-term pressures on revenues and profits, we believe our results will improve later this year and into 2017.
We'll now open up the call to your questions."

So it really kind of upped the opportunity for TripAdvisor to be showing a great price with all this content. Very hard for us to tease out exactly what causes conversion rate to lift, but we're confident in saying the extra or the better content that we added to the site certainly helped. As we look forward, it's mostly tuning, if you will. There's a lot of properties that are available. We want to make sure that we have great pricing on as many of them or all of them as we can. We want to make sure we have a great experience in terms of someone entering the booking flow and getting all the information that they need in order to make that -- in order to trust us with their credit card or storing the credit card. So we're doing all the things, and that's why we're seeing the improved rate. I'm not sure I would point to a single big win factor that's going to be out there versus incremental improvement, and I said the incremental improvement will likely translate to all points of sale at the same time. We're not seeing a big difference per market in terms of how consumers are behaving. Conversion, you asked about phone versus desktop. And so the conversion naturally is different. Some of that, I believe, is going to structural for quite some time. But we measure -- when we talk about rev per shopper with you folks, we're also, of course, measuring it, both mobile web, mobile app, tablet, desktop. We've got it broken down in lots of different ways here, and we're constantly making improvements in each of those categories."

One of the changes that you made to Instant Book is to feature the brand of your partners in the booking process. So what is the feedback then from your partners to date in terms of their satisfaction with the product? And you talked a bit about how the repeat booking rates are getting better. So does that mean that you're starting to see some of those repeat economics accrue to TripAdvisor rather than necessarily to the supplier? And then just a second question, as you roll out Instant Book internationally, have you been able to get all the content you need globally, especially after the Priceline deal to drive further improvements in conversion? And maybe relative to the domestic rollout, can you just tell us a bit about how the international rollout has been performing at this stage of the game?"

So we're very happy with the Priceline deal, the content that it provides, the pricing so -- and their ability to handle the infrastructure of payments in all these different countries. And as I alluded to last quarter, we thought that would allow us to roll it out fairly quickly, and we've delivered on that. The Priceline team has been great to work with. So as you know, as we disclosed, we launched in Europe -- launching LATAM and other markets. So that will mostly we done over the next 90, 120 days. So that's great. It absolutely was the meaningful factor in us accelerating our global rollout, which kind of starts the training purpose or training clock going, because we know we have a hill to climb to teach people that TripAdvisor is not only also awesome for research but a safe place to book. And by offering great content, great prices, we think we're doing that where it's available. So we're not doing that yet in a bunch of countries because we don't have any Instant Booking rolled out in those countries. So if you think -- backing up a little bit, when we look at this consumer journey, I talk about instead of searching around lots and lots of different sites for all the information and then all the prices, our vision, our strategic plan here is you come to TripAdvisor because of all that great content. And then, of course, you see that we've done the work for you. We've searched the web, we've pulled back all of these prices. And with Instant Booking, odds are good and becoming great that we'll be able to feature the lowest price if you want to book on TripAdvisor. If in fact, you have loyalty to a different site, that's great. There's a meta button that clicks over there. If you prefer booking brand direct and you really want to be on that brand site, great, there's a brand click. If you're happy booking on TripAdvisor with it being fulfilled by brand, we'll have that option. If you're happy booking on TripAdvisor fulfilled by a great OTA partner, excellent. We'd like to look at it as no matter what your preferences are, we'll have you -- we'll be able to address your need in our store. And then you made the purchase, you stay at the hotel, you're in market, you get to use all of our attractions, you're using our app because so many people do. And so we've stayed with you during this travel purchase. And all of that is supposed to yield more, ""Great, I am now used to TripAdvisor as a research and a booking tool."" And the leading indicator I like to look at the most is that repeat rate. Is it exactly a perfect metric for showing that Instant Booking is working? Can't tell or time will tell, but it is the thing that we are looking to address and build as a long-term advantage in the Instant Booking path versus the meta path. Because as people are comfortable booking with us and for some people trial is the only way they're going to get comfortable, then we're delivering a good experience, the product works and they come back and book again. So that's why I love the repeat rate. Did I forget your first question now -- first half of your question?"

And then as we roll out to the rest of the world, we're a lot more comfortable that our infrastructure can handle loads, and so we tend to roll out quicker. Again, as example, in the past 45 days, rolled out to probably a dozen more markets since the beginning of the year. And as I indicated, we expect the pace to continue at that rate such that we'll be out in the next quarter or so with all or almost all of our major markets. The product looks good. There is -- when we say we launched it, it gives us Instant Booking capabilities primarily with Booking.com as our partner, and then we are working aggressively to bring the rest of our suppliers, all the different brands and, obviously, the independents to all these new markets. One thing that slows us down is that for some of our partners, we don't have all of the room content in the language that we're rolling out in. So we need to go back and get that before we can turn some of those partners live. When I talk about it being a year or 2 to get Instant Booking to really be fully rolled out with all of the value that I talk about, all the room content, all the best pricing, it's because there's a lot of work still to be done to get all the partners with all the content in all the languages, handling payments in all the markets.

We have a very competitive product in that space, but we come at it more from a, look, the individual who's looking for a great place to stay in London and they might pick a hotel, they might pick an apartment, they might pick even a more traditional vacation rental, our supply footprint covers them all, and we're growing that around the globe. So in a sense, Airbnb is a competitor, we don't particularly view their traffic or the person looking for the shared room is someone that's naturally on TripAdvisor, but for the other piece for the city or for the urban inventory we do. Hard to say, given the strength of the hotel industry currently, that Airbnb is a problem. They've just added a lot of supply into the equation, and I personally believe that they are generating more travel on the part of consumers because of the supply that they've added. I have no data point to back that up, but it's kind of logical to me as they continue to grow with the hotel companies and folks like us and the other OTAs continue to be very strong in our markets. In terms of the mobile experience, a tough question. There's various aspects of our app, in our experience, that I think are just terrific. You can find great places to eat where -- nearby where you're standing all around the globe. You can book the hotel, we've stored your credit card, it's 2 clicks and you're done. There's tremendous amount of benefit that we've achieved, I believe, by delivering a great user experience for close-in hotel shopping, places to eat, things to do, bringing the bookability of our attraction inventory onto the phone, really, really nice. From a -- is there more to do? Absolutely. I just think the amount of data that TripAdvisor has that can help you plan a trip, that is so hard for us to figure out how to surface at the right time, really hard to read your mind to know what you're going to be looking for next, but we've got it because we have so much users -- so many users. We have so much data on all topics related to travel, plus we've got the community standing behind us. So do we bring that all to the forefront in a perfect way on the mobile small screen? No. So I still think we're in very early days in what we can do, but we're incredibly well positioned because of the rich content across all travel categories and because of our installed app footprint, which is, as you know, just huge. So I'd say way more opportunity ahead of us than we have tackled already."

The second factor you have to consider is that this is an aggregate number across all devices, and our mobile revenue per shopper is growing much more quickly. Sorry, our number of mobile shoppers is growing much more quickly. So you got a mix shift, which drags down the average. Having said that, we are very seriously improving our revenue per shopper in mobile. In constant currency terms, in 2015, we improved revenue per shopper in mobile by about 30%. So we're improving, but it's still significantly lower monetization than desktop, which is a negative impact.

And of course, we're always trying to acquire more hotel shopper traffic growth. Simply put, if we make more money per hotel shopper visitor, we can bid more on search engines and other traffic generating sources. So some of the decline in the hotel shopper absolute number in Q4 would be related to our lower rev per shopper number, which in turn means we were able to buy a bit less.

Our first quarter results were in line with our internal forecast and I want to reiterate that our growth outlook and margin commentary for the full year remains intact. In our Hotel segment, we saw significant revenue growth deceleration due to our global Instant Booking launched with the corresponding impact on EBITDA. Both were expected and communicated in February. In our non-hotel segment, revenue growth was masked this quarter as we shift towards a transactional model in vacation rentals, which resulted in a substantial portion of bookings made in Q1 being recognized as revenue when the stay happens later in the year. This increased seasonality of non-hotel is another driver we communicated in February. 
As we have discussed, 2016 is an important transition year. We're executing on our long-term strategy, and in the near term, we expect decelerating growth in the first half and improving growth rates in the back half. 
With that, we'll now open it up for questions."

And the most important lever for us has been to work on the supply both in terms of the number of hotels available in Instant Booking as well as on the content that we provide for those hotels. So we've been working hard on that throughout the year, and we saw -- and we continue to see improvements in our ability to improve that monetization in the United States. In the rest of the world, where we have just rolled out in the first quarter, not surprisingly, we see that, that monetization is less good than it is in the U.S. today and like it was in the U.S. early days. So we're seeing that we have a larger gap in outside the U.S. between meta and IB than we have in the U.S., and that's to be expected. And when you just roll out, you have a few [indiscernible] problems that are working hard to improve and expect to improve over the year. In terms of some of the underlying repeat metrics, so we've seen in the U.S., because that's where the data is most relevant because we have a longer series year, we see month on month and quarter-on-quarter, we see improvements in repeat rates, and not just what percentage of bookings is repeated, as you said, in your opening but also the percentage of first-time bookers that come back in any period of time, that percentage is improving quarter-on-quarter and month-on-month. But we also see that bookers and to come back and tend to convert better. We also see that bookers that come back tend to convert better than meta clickers that come back and click again. And so we see a couple of very important trends here that we believe are indications that the thesis is at least starting to work in the U.S. Now as I said before, outside of the U.S., it's very early days and we have that path to climb in the rest of the year."

Thanks, Mike, for the question. So there's actually quite a few components and it's great to finally have the product rolled out almost everywhere because that's a lot of heavy lifting that takes a bunch of resources, but it is now about making sure everyone in all of our markets understand that you can book on TripAdvisor, and we started this approach over a year ago on desktop U.S. and we found it's taken a while to get that repeat rate up, but we've seen that kind of steadily climb, and that's kind of the signs that we're looking for. And we're now on day 1 or day 30 for a bunch of our other international markets. So as that grows and we can kind of count on it growing globally, it's fundamentally taking the audience that's on TripAdvisor, helping them, guiding them where appropriate down the Instant Book path. We see that when they do go down the Instant Book path, they tend to come back more frequently than if they went down a meta path, but we are very cognizant that pricing is a critical factor and where the Instant Book price isn't the best, we have meta available everywhere. And as I've said before and for the [indiscernible], we expect our meta business to be strong for -- in that kind of forever time frame, want folks travelers to be able to come to TripAdvisor, find the best price. If Instant Booking has that great price and a great experience, that's going to be where that initial booker's going to book. And as we have your credit card stored, it's going to be where the repeat booker might well prefer to transact out of ease of use, out of simplicity, out of offering a great price and a past great experience. That takes a while. In terms of the actual kind of interface of Instant Booking and what we can do on the site and how we can do more promotions to help drive awareness of the fact that you can book on TripAdvisor, I think you see a lot of change on the site on a frequent basis and you see a number of different marketing programs that we launched on the site in many countries. We had a sweepstakes running. We have a Viator attraction coupon running right, just lots of different ways to steadily, and frankly not so steadily, remind people/let people know that trip is a great place to complete your booking."

I remind folks that was one of the reasons we launched Instant Book a while ago because we saw this coming. We want to make sure we're the best platform to be able to plan and book your trip. And so as you look at the phone, we're in the U.S., certainly fully rolled out with Instant Booking, we're building that repeat usage, we're bolting the cards, we're getting more and more repeat booking, so our revenue per hotel shopper, not only is our hotel shopper growing nicely on the phone but the revenue per hotel shopper had that very nice lift in Q1. What really changed, well, it wasn't IB rollout per se because we were already rolled out on the phone. It was the better -- some combination of the better experiences, better pricing, better content, all the things that we work on from supply perspective, better optimization of the user experience, so all the good work that the UI team has been doing, and the fact that folks are comfortable booking on the phone on TripAdvisor because they've experienced it in the past. So that was a nice 20%-plus lift. And as we look forward, and as we start to see that in some other markets, we're excited about closing the gap on phone to desktop.

We're so well positioned because of the number of folks currently using the TripAdvisor app in market. And then you combine that with the supply that Viator already had before we made the acquisition and then the tremendous effort of that team, super kudos to that team for picking up that much more supply on a regular repeatable basis. And we're by no means done, but we've now aggregated, we think, the best supplier footprint around the globe. That's [indiscernible] the rest demand footprint around the globe, and we think this is an awesome, awesome business to be in. It's a pain in the neck to aggregate all of the individual suppliers, many of whom aren't using a lot of technology, with a lot of individual pieces along the way, again one of the reasons why we enter the space via the supply piece via acquisition. But how that we have it, now that a lot is bookable online instantly, now that we've learned how to match it with the TripAdvisor demand, not only on the phone for Instant Booking for attractions but on the desktop for Instant Booking and attractions. And you look at a business with a margin profile that's quite similar to hotels, and like, all the ingredients are there, and it's not to say that we're the leader in every single market. It's not to say that it's straight sailing from here to there. We certainly have competition, but it's a natural fit for what travelers currently turn to TripAdvisor for. We have global reach and we have global supply in a nice margin business with some competitors, but it's not like we're coming behind in any shape or in any sense. So that's my short thesis to the $1 billion business because it's a market that, as you know, is phenomenally sized by itself. To the second question on sort of Instant Book versus meta in the longer-term mix, obviously, we expect Instant Book share to grow as we continue to roll it out, as we drive more repeat usage. But I really don't foresee the time when meta is an afterthought and it's just Instant Booking. I think there will be a large segment of the consumer base that has loyalty to a brand direct or an OTA or another OTA, one of our other clients, and they're very comfortable keeping that booking path, if you will, and TripAdvisor hopefully will facilitate that preference be it directly with the brand in Instant Book for the brand online or any of the OTA partners. And we would hope that a number of OTA partners around the globe would wish to participate in our Instant Book marketplace, as Priceline and Get a Room and others have. So I don't model out a specific, but I do expect IB to grow and I would never expect meta to disappear."

So restaurants, a large component of our traffic is currently on restaurants. We've been investing over the past year and kind of building up the usefulness of the product, both expanding the number of restaurants that we have all around the globe. We have a lot of restaurant reviews and info and engagement with restaurant owners around the globe, and we really haven't paid all that much attention to it product-wise prior -- from a minor monetization-wise prior to LaFourchette to us purchasing LaFourchette. We feel on the restaurant reservations basis that the model that OpenTable has, we have the model enhanced with discounts in other parts of the world and geographically tends to be shaping up as OpenTable is super strong in their set of markets and TheFork or LaFourchette is super strong in our set of markets. And it's hard for one to make an inroad into the other in any direction. But that's not the only thing that we view. I presume OpenTable can do in the restaurant space. So we have a lot of traffic, we have a lot of eyeballs, we have a lot of app downloads, we have a lot of users engaging in learning about restaurants. We look at it as not only how can we help users find the best restaurant, how can we help users come back to TripAdvisor more and more often, leveraging the fact that they may only -- or noting the fact that they may only travel a few times a year but they're actually eating out several times a month. And how can we leverage that sort of restaurant used case to drive overall adoption and engagement of our app. And those plans have been in place, and that's in part why we continue to invest in that category, not just the reservations piece but the whole restaurants as part of the TripAdvisor solution."

So on the marketing side, we do believe that we can make significant inroads in any particular market by focusing on the audience that is already in travel research and purchase mode, and we have 100-plus million of those already on our site in any given month. So that's a lot of traffic and we really want them to hone that message. So I wouldn't put, or at least we don't think of, our on-site promotions as kind of small or kind of not being able to move the needle for us in terms of awareness. U.S. is where we're sort of choosing to focus now because the product is more mature, the pricing is the best and we've had longer to tune the user experience. So I'd say steady as she goes from a marketing perspective on teaching folks to do -- to trial Instant Book as we improve their ability to come back and use Instant Book again. In terms of price, we don't -- as you know, we don't take the booking ourselves from a charging the credit card perspective. We're taking all of this information and we're sending it along to our Instant Book partner, be it the independent hotel, the brand or the OTA. So we don't have the ability, which was not to create the ability, to offer a price discount ourselves. We have no interest in having our OTA -- or we're looking to offer the best price that is out there on the web via the TripAdvisor Instant Book strategy. So no matter who the OTA is, no matter who the individual hoteliers, come put your pricing in our Instant Book environment, and therefore, we'll be able to offer it as the best. And if we don't have the best, well, our meta offering -- if you're a meta partner can also show an even better price than IB, and you do see that on the site sometimes. Pricing, as any OTA will tell you, is a longtail game. There's no one magic bullet. No one site out there has the absolute best pricing anywhere, but that is in the Holy Grail that everyone looks for and we're no exception to that. We think our model is extremely well suited to being able to offer consumers the best pricing period full stop via meta, and great pricing in almost all cases using our Instant Book initiative where we've stored the credit cards or building user convenience to come back because you'll always find the best price, but that takes a while and we wouldn't be trying to do that by offering sort of price discounts on our end because we're not the merchant on record."

So yes, we see a difference, and yes, it's kind of as expected. The second question is, are loyalty programs a threat? Yes, every program that tries to drive a consumer to go straight to a booking site that's not TripAdvisor is taking customer that we would like to service and making them loyal somewhere else. We know they've been around for a long time. Some of the biggest players don't have them and seem to be doing great. So I obviously have no inside knowledge, but I would assume those programs would continue to grow in terms of visibility and everyone has some set of reasons why a secret deal here or there as to why one might want to go back to the site. TripAdvisor has our set of reasons why you want to come to TripAdvisor, namely the incredible content, the candid photos, the room tips, to being able to compare all the prices because nobody wants a secret deal on a particular site if, in fact, that's not better than what you can find elsewhere. And of course, through Instant Book or through meta, we can allow our clients to offer their special deals or their special offers to our audience as well should they choose. We don't think the dynamics around consumer loyalty have changed all that much over the last set of years. So while it's on the horizon, it's not something that I think will materially change behavior over the next several years."

What we outlined is, and this is happening in both Instant Booking and in Vacation Rentals, is as we move our business models and we've talked about Instant Booking, but if you look at Vacation Rentals, we're moving our business model in Vacation Rental, we have progressively over the last year. So if you look at Q1 2015, we had a small portion of the revenues recognized on stay and other elements of revenue but recognized on book or subscription. And as we migrate it over the year, now we're in Q1 '16, we see the substantial portion of our revenues is recognized on stay. So that has a significant impact, particularly on the seasonality of our business. Q1 is a quarter in Vacation Rentals in which there are a lot of bookings for later in the year for Q2, but specifically for the summer in Q3. And so what you see, if you compare the year-on-year growth rates is what you see is that the total of 14% year-on-year growth for non-hotel, which is not just Vacation Rentals obviously, is suppressed by that impact. And as we look at outlook for the full year, we believe the growth rate for non-hotel will be significantly north of that 14% for the whole year.

They make the bookings on TripAdvisor if the price is great, and brands play into that. They're giving us their best pricing. They find what they want to do.

In our Hotel segment, we saw significant revenue growth deceleration due to our global Instant Booking launch with a corresponding impact on EBITDA. Both were expected and communicated in February. 
In our non-hotel segment, revenue growth was masked this quarter as we shift towards a transactional model in vacation rentals, which results in a substantial portion of bookings made in Q1 being recognized as revenue when we -- when the stay happens later in the year. This increased seasonality of non-hotel is another driver we communicated in February. 
As we have discussed, 2016 is an important transition year. We're executing on a long-term strategy, and in the near term, we expect decelerating growth in the first half and improving growth rates in the back half.

So we've been working hard on that throughout the year and we saw -- and we continue to see improvements in our ability to improve that monetization in the United States. 
In the rest of the world where we have just rolled out in the first quarter, not surprisingly, we see that, that monetization is less good than it is in the U.S. today, that like -- and like it was in the U.S. early days. So we're seeing that we are -- we have a larger gap in outside the U.S. between meta and IB than we have in the U.S., and that's to be expected. And when you just roll out, you have a few thieving [ph] problems that we're working hard on to improve and expect to improve over the year. 
In terms of some of the underlying repeat metrics, so we've seen in the U.S., because that's where the data is most relevant because we have a longer series year, we see month on month and quarter on quarter, we see improvements in repeat rates, and not just what percentage of bookings is repeated, as you said, in your opening but also the percentage of first-time bookers that come back in any period of time. That percentage is improving quarter-on-quarter, month-on-month. 
What we also see is that bookers that do come back then tend to convert better. We also see that bookers that come back tend to convert better than meta clickers that come back and click again. And so we see a couple of very important trends here that we believe are indications that the thesis is at least starting to work in the U.S. Now in -- as I said before, outside of U.S., it's very early days and we have that path to climb in the rest of the year."

So there's actually quite a few components, and it's great to finally have the product rolled out almost everywhere because that's a lot of heavy lifting that takes a bunch of resources. But it is now about making sure everyone in all of our markets understand that you can book on TripAdvisor, and we started this approach over a year ago on desktop U.S., and we found it's taken a while to get that repeat rate up, but we've seen that kind of steadily climb. And that's kind of the signs that we're looking for. And we're now on day 1 or day 30 for a bunch of our other international markets. So as that grows, and now we can kind of count on it growing globally, it's fundamentally taking the audience that's on TripAdvisor, helping them, guiding them where appropriate down the Instant Book path. We see that when they do go down the Instant Book path, they tend to come back more frequently than if they went down on meta path, but we're very cognizant that pricing is a critical factor and where the Instant Book price isn't the best, we have meta available everywhere. And as I've said before and for the the avoidance of doubt, we expect our meta business to continue to be strong for -- in that kind of forever time frame, want folks to -- travelers to be able to come to TripAdvisor, find the best price. If Instant Booking has that great price and the great experience, that's going to be where that initial booker is going to book. And as we have your credit card stored, it's going to be where the repeat booker might well prefer to transact out of ease of use, out of simplicity, out of offering a great price and a past great experience. That takes a while. In terms of the actual kind of interface of Instant Booking and what we can do on the site and how we can do more promotions to help drive awareness of the fact that you can book on TripAdvisor, I think you see a lot of change on the site on a frequent basis and you see a number of different marketing programs that we've launched on the site in many countries. We had a sweepstakes running. We have a Viator attraction coupon running right now, just lots of different ways to steadily and, frankly, not so steadily, remind people/let people know that Trip is a great place to complete your booking."

There's no question that as our traffic shifts from the traditional desktop platform to the phone, we've been facing a monetization headwind because the phone had just monetized. I remind folks, that was one of the reasons we launched Instant Book a while ago because we saw this coming. We want to make sure we're the best platform to be able to plan and book your trip. And so as you look at the phone, we're in the U.S., certainly fully rolled out with Instant Booking. We're building that repeat usage. We're bolting the cards. We're getting more and more repeat booking so our revenue per hotel shopper, not only is our hotel shopper growing nicely on the phone, but the revenue per hotel shopper had that very nice lift in Q1. What really changed? Well, it wasn't IB rollout per se because we were already rolled out on the phone, it was the better -- some combination of the better experience, better pricing, better content, all the things that we work on from a supply perspective, better optimization of the user experience, so all the good work that the UI team has been doing, and the fact that folks are comfortable booking on the phone on TripAdvisor because they've experienced it in the past. So that was a nice 20%-plus lift. And as we look forward, and as we start to see that in some other markets, we're excited about closing the gap on phone to desktop. As we know, phone is a huge percentage where our business will be."

We're so well-positioned because of the number of folks currently using the TripAdvisor app in market. And then you combine that with the supply that Viator already had before we made the acquisition, and then the tremendous effort of that team. Super kudos to that team for picking up that much more supply on a regular repeatable basis. And we're by no means done, but we're -- we've now aggregated, we think, the best supply footprint around the globe. That's that with the best demand footprint around the. globe, and we think this is an awesome, awesome business to be in. It's a pain in the neck to aggregate all of the individual suppliers, many of whom aren't using a lot of technology with a lot of individual pieces along the way. Again, one of the reasons why we enter the space via the supply piece via an acquisition, but now that we have it, now that a lot is bookable online instantly, now that we've learned how to match it with the TripAdvisor demand, not only on the phone for Instant Booking for attractions but now on the desktop for Instant Booking on attractions, and you look at a business with a margin profile that's quite similar to hotels and like, wow, all the ingredients are there. And that's not to say that we're the leader in every single market. It's not to say that it's straight sailing from here to there. We certainly have competition, but it's a natural fit for what travelers currently turn to TripAdvisor for. We have global reach and we have global supply in a nice-margin business with some competitors, but it's not like we're coming from behind in any shape or in any sense. So that's my short thesis to the $1 billion business because it's a market that, as you know, is phenomenally sized by itself. 
To the second question on sort of Instant Book versus meta in the longer-term mix, obviously, we expect Instant Book share to grow as we continue to roll it out as we drive more repeat usage, but I really don't foresee the time when meta is an afterthought and it's just Instant Booking. I think there will be a large segment of the consumer base that has loyalty to the -- a brand direct or an OTA or another OTA, one of our other clients, and they're very comfortable keeping that booking path, if you will, and TripAdvisor hopefully will facilitate that preference, be it directly with the brand in Instant Book for the brand online or any of the OTA partners. And we would hope that a number of OTA partners around the globe would wish to participate in our Instant Book marketplace as Priceline and getaroom and others have. 
So I don't model out a specific, but I do expect IB to grow, and I would never expect meta to disappear."

We've been investing over the past year and kind of building up the usefulness of the product, both expanding the number of restaurants that we have all around the globe. We have a lot of restaurant reviews and info and engagement with restaurant owners around the globe, and we really haven't paid all that much attention to it product-wise prior to -- from a monetization-wise prior to LaFourchette, to us purchasing LaFourchette. So we feel on the restaurant-reservations basis, the model that OpenTable has, we have the model enhanced with discounts in other parts of the world and geographically tends to be shaping up as OpenTable is super strong in their set of markets, and TheFork or LaFourchette is super strong in our set of markets, and it's hard for one to make an inroad into the other in any direction. But that's not the only thing that we do. I presume OpenTable can do in the restaurant space. So we have a lot of traffic. We have a lot of eyeballs. We have a lot of app downloads. We have a lot of users engaging in learning about restaurants. We look at it as not only how can we help users find the best restaurant, how can we help users come back to TripAdvisor more and more often, leveraging the fact that they may only -- or noting the fact that they may only travel a few times a year but they're actually eating out several times a month. And how can we leverage that sort of restaurant used case to drive overall adoption and engagement of our app?

So on the marketing side, we do believe that we can make significant inroads in any particular market by focusing on the audience that is already in travel research and purchase mode, and we have 100-plus million of those already on our site in any given month. So that's a lot of traffic, and we really want to hone that message. So I wouldn't put -- or at least we don't think of our on-site promotions as kind of small or kind of not being able to move the needle for us in terms of awareness. U.S. is where we're sort of choosing to focus now because the product is the most mature, the pricing is the best, and we've had longer to tune the user experience. So I'd say steady as she goes from a marketing perspective on teaching folks to do -- to trial Instant Book as we improve their ability to come back and use Instant Book again. 
In terms of price, we don't -- as you know, we don't take the booking ourselves from a ""charging the credit card"" perspective. We're taking all these information and we're sending it along to our Instant Book partner, be it the independent hotel, the brand or the OTA. So we don't have the ability here [ph], which is not to create the ability to offer a price discount ourselves. We have no interest in having our OTA -- or we're looking to offer the best price that is out there on the web via the TripAdvisor Instant Book strategy. So no matter who the OTA is, no matter who the individual hoteliers, come put your pricing in our Instant Book environment, and therefore, we'll be able to offer it as the best. And if we don't have the best, well, our meta offering, if you're a meta partner, can also show an even better price than IB. And you do see that on the site sometimes. 
Pricing, as any OTA will tell you, is a long-tail game. There's no one magic bullet. No one site out there has the absolute best pricing anywhere, but that is in the holy grail that everyone looks for, and we're no exception to that. We think our model is extremely well-suited to being able to offer consumers the best pricing period full stop via meta, and great pricing in almost all cases using our Instant Book initiative where we've stored the credit cards or building you the convenience to come back because you'll always find the best price. But that takes a while, and we wouldn't be trying to do that by offering sort of price discounts on our end because we're not the merchant on record."

As you know, we are not giving explicit guidance for the full year nor for the second quarter. However, we did 3 months ago, and we're reiterating that. Described the pattern of the year, and what we described is, in the first half of the year, we expect revenue deceleration, and you've seen that in Q1. And in the back half of the year, we're going to see revenue growth rates expand again. And that is as much as we want to comment on the profile for the year. 
In terms of HouseTrip, we have not disclosed a purchase price for HouseTrip which, in itself, indicates that it wasn't very material, and the impact it will make will be helpful for our Vacation Rental business but not significantly material for their overall financial results for the year."

And then secondly, wondering if -- on a separate topic, wondering if you could comment on loyalty programs. Is an expansion of loyalty program activity by various partners a threat to Trip? There's obviously different opinions among your partners on how valuable they are. I wonder if you could offer your thoughts on that topic."

Not surprisingly, Instant Book is used a lot more and represents a higher percentage of our phone revenue. The credit card vault rate, as we call it, how many people store their credit card after the transaction, it's much higher on the phone. Credit card usage, or vaulted credit card usage rate, is higher on the phone, again, all kind of after the fact evidence that having Instant Book on the phone, as people move more and more their transactions to the phone, is a good thing to have, we believe a requirement to have to be a credible offering in the future. So yes, we see a difference, and yes, it's kind of as expected. 
The second question is, are loyalty programs a threat? Yes. Every program that tries to drive a consumer to go straight to a booking site that's not TripAdvisor is taking customer that we would like to service and making them loyal somewhere else. I -- we know they've been around for a long time. Some of the biggest players don't have them and seem to be doing great. So I obviously have no inside knowledge, but I would assume those programs would continue to grow in terms of visibility, and everyone has some set of reasons why a secret deal here or there as to why one might want to go back to the site. TripAdvisor has our set of reasons why you want to come to TripAdvisor, namely the incredible content, the candid photos, the room tips, to being able to compare all the prices because nobody wants a secret deal on a particular site if, in fact, that's not better than what you can find elsewhere. And of course, through Instant Book or through meta, we can allow our clients to offer their special deals or their special offers to our audience as well should they choose. We don't think the dynamics around consumer loyalty have changed all that much over the last set of years. So while it's on the horizon, it's not something that, I think, will materially change behavior over the next several years."

We have progressively over the last year. So if you look at Q1 2015, we had a small portion of the revenues recognized on stay and other elements of revenue but recognized on book or on subscription. And as we migrate it over the year, now we're in Q1 '16, we see the substantial portion of our revenues is recognized on stay. So that has a significant impact, particularly on the seasonality of our business. Q1 is a quarter in Vacation Rentals in which there are a lot of bookings for later in the year for Q2, but specifically for the summer in Q3. And so what you see, if you compare the year-on-year growth rates, is what you see is that the total of 14% year-on-year growth for non-hotel, which is not just Vacation Rentals, obviously, is suppressed by that impact. And as we look at outlook for the full year, we believe the growth rate for non-hotel will be significantly north of that 14% for the whole year because of that seasonal -- additional seasonality that has been built in with this change of business model."

Our first quarter results were in line with our internal forecast, and I want to reiterate that our growth outlook and margin commentary for the full year remains intact. 
In our Hotel segment, we saw significant revenue growth deceleration due to our global Instant Booking launch with a corresponding impact on EBITDA. Both were expected and communicated in February. 
In our non-hotel segment, revenue growth was masked this quarter as we shift towards a transactional model in vacation rentals, which results in a substantial portion of bookings made in Q1 being recognized as revenue when we -- when the stay happens later in the year. This increased seasonality of non-hotel is another driver we communicated in February. 
As we have discussed, 2016 is an important transition year. We're executing on a long-term strategy, and in the near term, we expect decelerating growth in the first half and improving growth rates in the back half.

Indeed, in the U.S., we have seen -- since the launch in the U.S. improvement that we've been able to make in the monetization of Instant Booking. And the most important lever for us has been to work on the supply, both in terms of the number of hotels available in Instant Booking as well as on the content that we provide for those hotels. So we've been working hard on that throughout the year and we saw -- and we continue to see improvements in our ability to improve that monetization in the United States. 
In the rest of the world where we have just rolled out in the first quarter, not surprisingly, we see that, that monetization is less good than it is in the U.S. today, but like -- and like it was in the U.S. early days. So we're seeing that we are -- we have a larger gap in -- outside the U.S. between meta and IB than we have in the U.S., and that's to be expected. And when you just roll out, you have a few teething problems that we're working hard on to improve and expect to improve over the year. 
In terms of some of the underlying repeat metrics, so we've seen in the U.S., because that's where the data is most relevant because we have a longer series here. We see month on month and quarter on quarter, we see improvements in repeat rates, and not just what percentage of bookings is repeated, as you said, in your opening but also the percentage of first-time bookers that come back in any period of time. That percentage is improving quarter-on-quarter, month-on-month. 
What we also see is that bookers that do come back then tend to convert better. We also see that bookers that come back tend to convert better than meta clickers that come back and click again. And so we see a couple of very important trends here that we believe are indications that the thesis is at least starting to work in the U.S. Now in -- as I said before, outside of U.S., it's very early days and we have that path to climb in the rest of the year."

So there's actually quite a few components, and it's great to finally have the product rolled out almost everywhere because that's a lot of heavy lifting that takes a bunch of resources. But it is now about making sure everyone in all of our markets understand that you can book on TripAdvisor, and we started this approach over a year ago on desktop U.S., and we found it's taken a while to get that repeat rate up, but we've seen that kind of steadily climb. And that's kind of the signs that we're looking for. And we're now on day 1 or day 30 for a bunch of our other international markets. So as that grows, and now we can kind of count on it growing globally, it's fundamentally taking the audience that's on TripAdvisor, helping them, guiding them where appropriate down the Instant Book path. We see that when they do go down the Instant Book path, they tend to come back more frequently than if they went down on meta path, but we're very cognizant that pricing is a critical factor and where the Instant Book price isn't the best, we have meta available everywhere. And as I've said before and for the avoidance of doubt, we expect our meta business to continue to be strong for -- in that kind of forever time frame, we want folks to -- travelers to be able to come to TripAdvisor, find the best price. If Instant Booking has that great price and the great experience, that's going to be where that initial booker is going to book. And as we have your credit card stored, it's going to be where the repeat booker might well prefer to transact out of ease of use, out of simplicity, out of offering a great price and a past great experience. That takes a while. In terms of the actual kind of interface of Instant Booking and what we can do on the site and how we can do more promotions to help drive awareness of the fact that you can book on TripAdvisor, I think you see a lot of change on the site on a frequent basis and you see a number of different marketing programs that we've launched on the site in many countries. We had a sweepstakes running. We have a Viator attraction coupon running right now, just lots of different ways to subtly and, frankly, not so subtly, remind people/let people know that Trip is a great place to complete your booking."

And so as you look at the phone, we're in the U.S., certainly fully rolled out with Instant Booking. We're building that repeat usage. We're vaulting the cards. We're getting more and more repeat booking so our revenue per hotel shopper, not only is our hotel shopper growing nicely on the phone, but the revenue per hotel shopper had that very nice lift in Q1. What really changed? Well, it wasn't IB rollout per se because we were already rolled out on the phone, it was the better -- some combination of the better experience, better pricing, better content, all the things that we work on from a supply perspective, better optimization of the user experience, so all the good work that the UI team has been doing, and the fact that folks are comfortable booking on the phone on TripAdvisor because they've experienced it in the past. So that was a nice 20%-plus lift. And as we look forward, and as we start to see that in some other markets, we're excited about closing the gap on phone to desktop. As we know, phone is a huge percentage where our business will be."

We're so well-positioned because of the number of folks currently using the TripAdvisor app in market. And then you combine that with the supply that Viator already had before we made the acquisition, and then the tremendous effort of that team. Super kudos to that team for picking up that much more supply on a regular repeatable basis. And we're by no means done, but we're -- we've now aggregated, we think, the best supply footprint around the globe, match that with the best demand footprint around the globe, and we think this is an awesome, awesome business to be in. It's a pain in the neck to aggregate all of the individual suppliers, many of whom aren't using a lot of technology, with a lot of individual pieces along the way. Again, one of the reasons why we enter the space via -- the supply piece via an acquisition, but now that we have it, now that a lot is bookable online instantly, now that we've learned how to match it with the TripAdvisor demand, not only on the phone for Instant Booking for attractions but now on the desktop for Instant Booking on attractions, and you look at a business with a margin profile that's quite similar to hotels and like, wow, all the ingredients are there. And that's not to say that we're the leader in every single market. It's not to say that it's straight sailing from here to there. We certainly have competition, but it's a natural fit for what travelers currently turn to TripAdvisor for. We have a global reach and we have global supply in a nice-margin business with some competitors, but it's not like we're coming from behind in any shape or in any sense. So that's my short thesis to the $1 billion business because it's a market that, as you know, is phenomenally sized by itself. 
To the second question on sort of Instant Book versus meta in the longer-term mix, obviously, we expect Instant Book share to grow as we continue to roll it out as we drive more repeat usage, but I really don't foresee the time when meta is an afterthought and it's just Instant Booking. I think there will be a large segment of the consumer base that has loyalty to the -- a brand direct or an OTA or another OTA, one of our other clients, and they're very comfortable keeping that booking path, if you will, and TripAdvisor hopefully will facilitate that preference, be it directly with the brand in Instant Book for the brand online or any of the OTA partners. And we would hope that a number of OTA partners around the globe would wish to participate in our Instant Book marketplace as Priceline and getaroom and others have. 
So I don't model out a specific, but I do expect IB to grow, and I would never expect meta to disappear."

We have a lot of restaurant reviews and info and engagement with restaurant owners around the globe, and we really haven't paid all that much attention to it product-wise prior to -- from a monetization-wise prior to LaFourchette, to us purchasing LaFourchette. So we feel on the restaurant-reservations basis, the model that OpenTable has, we have the model enhanced with discounts in other parts of the world and geographically tends to be shaping up as OpenTable is super strong in their set of markets, and TheFork or LaFourchette is super strong in our set of markets, and it's hard for one to make an inroad into the other in any direction. But that's not the only thing that we or, I presume, OpenTable can do in the restaurant space. So we have a lot of traffic. We have a lot of eyeballs. We have a lot of app downloads. We have a lot of users engaging in learning about restaurants. We look at it as not only how can we help users find the best restaurant, how can we help users come back to TripAdvisor more and more often, leveraging the fact that they may only -- or noting the fact that they may only travel a few times a year but they're actually eating out several times a month. And how can we leverage that -- sort of restaurant use case to drive overall adoption and engagement of our app? And those plans have been in place, and that's, in part, why we continue to invest in that category, not just the reservations piece but the whole restaurants as part of the TripAdvisor solution."

So on the marketing side, we do believe that we can make significant inroads in any particular market by focusing on the audience that is already in travel research and purchase mode, and we have 100-plus million of those",459,"Sure. Two good questions. Thanks. So on the marketing side, we do believe that we can make significant inroads in any particular market by focusing on the audience that is already in travel research and purchase mode, and we have 100-plus million of those already on our site in any given month. So that's a lot of traffic, and we really want to hone that message. So I wouldn't put -- or at least we don't think of our on-site promotions as kind of small or kind of not being able to move the needle for us in terms of awareness. U.S. is where we're sort of choosing to focus now because the product is the most mature, the pricing is the best, and we've had longer to tune the user experience. So I'd say steady as she goes from a marketing perspective on teaching folks to do -- to trial Instant Book as we improve their ability to come back and use Instant Book again. 
In terms of price, we don't -- as you know, we don't take the booking ourselves from a ""charging the credit card"" perspective. We're taking all these information and we're sending it along to our Instant Book partner, be it the independent hotel, the brand or the OTA. So we don't have the ability, or we choose not to create the ability to offer a price discount ourselves. We have no interest in having our OTA -- or we're looking to offer the best price that is out there on the web via the TripAdvisor Instant Book strategy. So no matter who the OTA is, no matter who the individual hotelier is, come put your pricing in our Instant Book environment, and therefore, we'll be able to offer it as the best. And if we don't have the best, well, our meta offering, if you're a meta partner, can also show an even better price than IB. And you do see that on the site sometimes. 
Pricing, as any OTA will tell you, is a long-tail game. There's no one magic bullet. No one site out there has the absolute best pricing anywhere, but that is in the holy grail that everyone looks for, and we're no exception to that. We think our model is extremely well-suited to being able to offer consumers the best pricing, period full stop, via meta and great pricing in almost all cases using our Instant Book initiative where we've stored the credit cards or building you the convenience to come back because you'll always find the best price. But that takes a while, and we wouldn't be trying to do that by offering sort of price discounts on our end because we're not the merchant on record."

Not surprisingly, Instant Book is used a lot more and represents a higher percentage of our phone revenue. Our credit card vault rate, as we call it, how many people store their credit card after the transaction, it's much higher on the phone. Credit card usage -- our vaulted credit card usage rate, is higher on the phone, again, all kind of after the fact evidence that having Instant Book on the phone, as people move more and more of their transactions to the phone, is a good thing to have, we believe a requirement to have to be a credible offering in the future. So yes, we see a difference, and yes, it's kind of as expected. 
The second question is, are loyalty programs a threat? Yes. Every program that tries to drive a consumer to go straight to a booking site that's not TripAdvisor is taking a customer that we would like to service and making them loyal somewhere else. I -- we note, they've been around for a long time. Some of the biggest players don't have them and seem to be doing great. So I obviously have no inside knowledge, but I would assume those programs would continue to grow in terms of visibility, and everyone has some set of reasons why a secret deal here or there as to why one might want to go back to the site. TripAdvisor has our set of reasons why you want to come to TripAdvisor, namely the incredible content, the candid photos, the room tips, to being able to compare all the prices because nobody wants a secret deal on a particular site if, in fact, that's not better than what you can find elsewhere. And of course, through Instant Book or through meta, we can allow our clients to offer their special deals or their special offers to our audience as well should they choose. We don't think the dynamics around consumer loyalty have changed all that much over the past set of years. So while it's on the horizon, it's not something that, I think, will materially change behavior over the next several years."

And as we migrate it over the year, now we're in Q1 '16, we see the substantial portion of our revenues is recognized on stay. So that has a significant impact, particularly on the seasonality of our business. Q1 is a quarter in Vacation Rentals in which there are a lot of bookings for later in the year for Q2, but specifically for the summer in Q3. And so what you see, if you compare the year-on-year growth rates, is what you see is that the total of 14% year-on-year growth for non-hotel, which is not just Vacation Rentals, obviously, is suppressed by that impact. And as we look at outlook for the full year, we believe the growth rate for non-hotel will be significantly north of that 14% for the whole year because of that seasonal -- additional seasonality that has been built in with this change of business model."

And our perspective is, if it's a rate that's available to travelers, then we're happy to show it. So our model sort of encourages travelers to find the absolute -- well I mean, if you wind it all the way back, folks are coming to TripAdvisor because they love the site, the offers, the great user experience, the full trip. They have more content, more choice. Pricing is a key component of that. They find the things -- the places they want to stay and the things that they want to do. They make the bookings on TripAdvisor if the price is great. And brands play into that, they're giving us their best pricing. They find what they want to do. They book those pieces on TripAdvisor to have the great trip, to share the experience back on TripAdvisor to, therefore, become more engaged with our site, and again, more likely to share their experience with their friends about how TripAdvisor helped them and start their very next bit of travel planning with us. Having the price from the brands is -- or the best price from all components is one of the many things that we need to do right in order to earn that virtuous cycle."

The first quarter 2016 was pivotal for TripAdvisor as we continue to rapidly build the best end-to-end user experience in travel. First, some comments on our Hotel segment. We're excited to be mostly complete with our Instant Booking rollout. Phase 1 was getting hotelier and OTA partner adoption in 2015. Phase 2 was executing the global product launch, and we are now in Phase 3, which is perfecting the booking experience and educating users about their ability to book on TripAdvisor. And finally, Phase 4 is all about delighting more users, achieving higher conversion rates, driving direct business and repeat behavior and plugging the monetization leak. We're pleased with our continued progress, although we recognize there's still a lot of work ahead of us. 
In our non-hotel segment, these businesses are performing well. They are aimed at big market opportunities and are tailor-made for mobile devices.

Our first quarter results were in line with our internal forecast, and I want to reiterate that our growth outlook and margin commentary for the full year remains intact. 
In our Hotel segment, we saw significant revenue growth deceleration due to our global Instant Booking launch with a corresponding impact on EBITDA. Both were expected and communicated in February. 
In our non-hotel segment, revenue growth was masked this quarter as we shift towards a transactional model in vacation rentals, which results in a substantial portion of bookings made in Q1 being recognized as revenue when we -- when the stay happens later in the year. This increased seasonality of non-hotel is another driver we communicated in February. 
As we have discussed, 2016 is an important transition year. We're executing on a long-term strategy, and in the near term, we expect decelerating growth in the first half and improving growth rates in the back half. 
With that, we'll now open it up for questions."

Is there any color you can share digging into the unit economics of what say a click on Instant Book monetizes at relative to a click in metasearch in the U.S. and kind of what the growth -- the slope of that curve looks like? Obviously, growth rates mathematically improve in the second half as you come to that rollout, but can it be a growth driver beyond lapping in some easy compares? 
And then second question would just be on leakage. Obviously, it's a big objective here, and last quarter, you talked about repeat rates rising, which would be natural with a new product. But when you look at kind of the aggregate percent of hotel shoppers that are clicking on a monetization unit probably, be it meta or IB, is that percentage rising meaningfully, perhaps, in your more mature markets?"

Indeed, in the U.S., we have seen -- since the launch in the U.S. improvement that we've been able to make in the monetization of Instant Booking. And the most important lever for us has been to work on the supply, both in terms of the number of hotels available in Instant Booking as well as on the content that we provide for those hotels. So we've been working hard on that throughout the year and we saw -- and we continue to see improvements in our ability to improve that monetization in the United States. 
In the rest of the world where we have just rolled out in the first quarter, not surprisingly, we see that, that monetization is less good than it is in the U.S. today, but like -- and like it was in the U.S. early days. So we're seeing that we are -- we have a larger gap in -- outside the U.S. between meta and IB than we have in the U.S., and that's to be expected. And when you just roll out, you have a few teething problems that we're working hard on to improve and expect to improve over the year. 
In terms of some of the underlying repeat metrics, so we've seen in the U.S., because that's where the data is most relevant because we have a longer series here. We see month on month and quarter on quarter, we see improvements in repeat rates, and not just what percentage of bookings is repeated, as you said, in your opening but also the percentage of first-time bookers that come back in any period of time. That percentage is improving quarter-on-quarter, month-on-month. 
What we also see is that bookers that do come back then tend to convert better. We also see that bookers that come back tend to convert better than meta clickers that come back and click again. And so we see a couple of very important trends here that we believe are indications that the thesis is at least starting to work in the U.S. Now in -- as I said before, outside of U.S., it's very early days and we have that path to climb in the rest of the year."

So there's actually quite a few components, and it's great to finally have the product rolled out almost everywhere because that's a lot of heavy lifting that takes a bunch of resources. But it is now about making sure everyone in all of our markets understand that you can book on TripAdvisor, and we started this approach over a year ago on desktop U.S., and we found it's taken a while to get that repeat rate up, but we've seen that kind of steadily climb. And that's kind of the signs that we're looking for. And we're now on day 1 or day 30 for a bunch of our other international markets. So as that grows, and now we can kind of count on it growing globally, it's fundamentally taking the audience that's on TripAdvisor, helping them, guiding them where appropriate down the Instant Book path. We see that when they do go down the Instant Book path, they tend to come back more frequently than if they went down on meta path, but we're very cognizant that pricing is a critical factor and where the Instant Book price isn't the best, we have meta available everywhere. And as I've said before and for the avoidance of doubt, we expect our meta business to continue to be strong for -- in that kind of forever time frame, we want folks to -- travelers to be able to come to TripAdvisor, find the best price. If Instant Booking has that great price and the great experience, that's going to be where that initial booker is going to book. And as we have your credit card stored, it's going to be where the repeat booker might well prefer to transact out of ease of use, out of simplicity, out of offering a great price and a past great experience. That takes a while. In terms of the actual kind of interface of Instant Booking and what we can do on the site and how we can do more promotions to help drive awareness of the fact that you can book on TripAdvisor, I think you see a lot of change on the site on a frequent basis and you see a number of different marketing programs that we've launched on the site in many countries. We had a sweepstakes running. We have a Viator attraction coupon running right now, just lots of different ways to subtly and, frankly, not so subtly, remind people/let people know that Trip is a great place to complete your booking."

I remind folks, that was one of the reasons we launched Instant Book a while ago because we saw this coming. We want to make sure we're the best platform to be able to plan and book your trip. And so as you look at the phone, we're in the U.S., certainly fully rolled out with Instant Booking. We're building that repeat usage. We're vaulting the cards. We're getting more and more repeat booking so our revenue per hotel shopper, not only is our hotel shopper growing nicely on the phone, but the revenue per hotel shopper had that very nice lift in Q1. What really changed? Well, it wasn't IB rollout per se because we were already rolled out on the phone, it was the better -- some combination of the better experience, better pricing, better content, all the things that we work on from a supply perspective, better optimization of the user experience, so all the good work that the UI team has been doing, and the fact that folks are comfortable booking on the phone on TripAdvisor because they've experienced it in the past. So that was a nice 20%-plus lift. And as we look forward, and as we start to see that in some other markets, we're excited about closing the gap on phone to desktop. As we know, phone is a huge percentage where our business will be."

We're so well-positioned because of the number of folks currently using the TripAdvisor app in market. And then you combine that with the supply that Viator already had before we made the acquisition, and then the tremendous effort of that team. Super kudos to that team for picking up that much more supply on a regular repeatable basis. And we're by no means done, but we're -- we've now aggregated, we think, the best supply footprint around the globe, match that with the best demand footprint around the globe, and we think this is an awesome, awesome business to be in. It's a pain in the neck to aggregate all of the individual suppliers, many of whom aren't using a lot of technology, with a lot of individual pieces along the way. Again, one of the reasons why we enter the space via -- the supply piece via an acquisition, but now that we have it, now that a lot is bookable online instantly, now that we've learned how to match it with the TripAdvisor demand, not only on the phone for Instant Booking for attractions but now on the desktop for Instant Booking on attractions, and you look at a business with a margin profile that's quite similar to hotels and like, wow, all the ingredients are there. And that's not to say that we're the leader in every single market. It's not to say that it's straight sailing from here to there. We certainly have competition, but it's a natural fit for what travelers currently turn to TripAdvisor for. We have a global reach and we have global supply in a nice-margin business with some competitors, but it's not like we're coming from behind in any shape or in any sense. So that's my short thesis to the $1 billion business because it's a market that, as you know, is phenomenally sized by itself. 
To the second question on sort of Instant Book versus meta in the longer-term mix, obviously, we expect Instant Book share to grow as we continue to roll it out as we drive more repeat usage, but I really don't foresee the time when meta is an afterthought and it's just Instant Booking. I think there will be a large segment of the consumer base that has loyalty to the -- a brand direct or an OTA or another OTA, one of our other clients, and they're very comfortable keeping that booking path, if you will, and TripAdvisor hopefully will facilitate that preference, be it directly with the brand in Instant Book for the brand online or any of the OTA partners. And we would hope that a number of OTA partners around the globe would wish to participate in our Instant Book marketplace as Priceline and getaroom and others have. 
So I don't model out a specific, but I do expect IB to grow, and I would never expect meta to disappear."

So restaurants, a large component of our traffic is currently on restaurants. We've been investing over the past year and kind of building up the usefulness of the product, both expanding the number of restaurants that we have all around the globe. We have a lot of restaurant reviews and info and engagement with restaurant owners around the globe, and we really haven't paid all that much attention to it product-wise prior to -- from a monetization-wise prior to LaFourchette, to us purchasing LaFourchette. So we feel on the restaurant-reservations basis, the model that OpenTable has, we have the model enhanced with discounts in other parts of the world and geographically tends to be shaping up as OpenTable is super strong in their set of markets, and TheFork or LaFourchette is super strong in our set of markets, and it's hard for one to make an inroad into the other in any direction. But that's not the only thing that we or, I presume, OpenTable can do in the restaurant space. So we have a lot of traffic. We have a lot of eyeballs. We have a lot of app downloads. We have a lot of users engaging in learning about restaurants. We look at it as not only how can we help users find the best restaurant, how can we help users come back to TripAdvisor more and more often, leveraging the fact that they may only -- or noting the fact that they may only travel a few times a year but they're actually eating out several times a month. And how can we leverage that -- sort of restaurant use case to drive overall adoption and engagement of our app? And those plans have been in place, and that's, in part, why we continue to invest in that category, not just the reservations piece but the whole restaurants as part of the TripAdvisor solution."

Two good questions. Thanks. So on the marketing side, we do believe that we can make significant inroads in any particular market by focusing on the audience that is already in travel research and purchase mode, and we have 100-plus million of those already on our site in any given month. So that's a lot of traffic, and we really want to hone that message. So I wouldn't put -- or at least we don't think of our on-site promotions as kind of small or kind of not being able to move the needle for us in terms of awareness. U.S. is where we're sort of choosing to focus now because the product is the most mature, the pricing is the best, and we've had longer to tune the user experience. So I'd say steady as she goes from a marketing perspective on teaching folks to do -- to trial Instant Book as we improve their ability to come back and use Instant Book again. 
In terms of price, we don't -- as you know, we don't take the booking ourselves from a ""charging the credit card"" perspective. We're taking all these information and we're sending it along to our Instant Book partner, be it the independent hotel, the brand or the OTA. So we don't have the ability, or we choose not to create the ability to offer a price discount ourselves. We have no interest in having our OTA -- or we're looking to offer the best price that is out there on the web via the TripAdvisor Instant Book strategy. So no matter who the OTA is, no matter who the individual hotelier is, come put your pricing in our Instant Book environment, and therefore, we'll be able to offer it as the best. And if we don't have the best, well, our meta offering, if you're a meta partner, can also show an even better price than IB. And you do see that on the site sometimes. 
Pricing, as any OTA will tell you, is a long-tail game. There's no one magic bullet. No one site out there has the absolute best pricing anywhere, but that is in the holy grail that everyone looks for, and we're no exception to that. We think our model is extremely well-suited to being able to offer consumers the best pricing, period full stop, via meta and great pricing in almost all cases using our Instant Book initiative where we've stored the credit cards or building you the convenience to come back because you'll always find the best price. But that takes a while, and we wouldn't be trying to do that by offering sort of price discounts on our end because we're not the merchant on record."

Credit card usage -- our vaulted credit card usage rate, is higher on the phone, again, all kind of after the fact evidence that having Instant Book on the phone, as people move more and more of their transactions to the phone, is a good thing to have, we believe a requirement to have to be a credible offering in the future. So yes, we see a difference, and yes, it's kind of as expected. 
The second question is, are loyalty programs a threat? Yes. Every program that tries to drive a consumer to go straight to a booking site that's not TripAdvisor is taking a customer that we would like to service and making them loyal somewhere else. I -- we note, they've been around for a long time. Some of the biggest players don't have them and seem to be doing great. So I obviously have no inside knowledge, but I would assume those programs would continue to grow in terms of visibility, and everyone has some set of reasons why a secret deal here or there as to why one might want to go back to the site. TripAdvisor has our set of reasons why you want to come to TripAdvisor, namely the incredible content, the candid photos, the room tips, to being able to compare all the prices because nobody wants a secret deal on a particular site if, in fact, that's not better than what you can find elsewhere. And of course, through Instant Book or through meta, we can allow our clients to offer their special deals or their special offers to our audience as well should they choose. We don't think the dynamics around consumer loyalty have changed all that much over the past set of years. So while it's on the horizon, it's not something that, I think, will materially change behavior over the next several years."

So we do offer that. It's a growing part of our business. It's a nice part of our business. It doesn't really affect our reliance on other ad tech platforms one way or the other."

We made the comment in the prepared remarks about our Vacation Rental business. What we outlined is, and this is happening both Instant Booking and in Vacation Rental, is as we move our business models, and we've talked about it in Instant Booking, but if you look at Vacation Rentals, we're moving our business model in Vacation Rental. We have progressively over the last year. So if you look at Q1 2015, we had a small portion of the revenues recognized on stay and other elements of revenue but recognized on book or on subscription. And as we migrate it over the year, now we're in Q1 '16, we see the substantial portion of our revenues is recognized on stay. So that has a significant impact, particularly on the seasonality of our business. Q1 is a quarter in Vacation Rentals in which there are a lot of bookings for later in the year for Q2, but specifically for the summer in Q3. And so what you see, if you compare the year-on-year growth rates, is what you see is that the total of 14% year-on-year growth for non-hotel, which is not just Vacation Rentals, obviously, is suppressed by that impact. And as we look at outlook for the full year, we believe the growth rate for non-hotel will be significantly north of that 14% for the whole year because of that seasonal -- additional seasonality that has been built in with this change of business model."

And our perspective is, if it's a rate that's available to travelers, then we're happy to show it. So our model sort of encourages travelers to find the absolute -- well I mean, if you wind it all the way back, folks are coming to TripAdvisor because they love the site, the offers, the great user experience, the full trip. They have more content, more choice. Pricing is a key component of that. They find the things -- the places they want to stay and the things that they want to do. They make the bookings on TripAdvisor if the price is great. And brands play into that, they're giving us their best pricing. They find what they want to do. They book those pieces on TripAdvisor to have the great trip, to share the experience back on TripAdvisor to, therefore, become more engaged with our site, and again, more likely to share their experience with their friends about how TripAdvisor helped them and start their very next bit of travel planning with us. Having the price from the brands is -- or the best price from all components is one of the many things that we need to do right in order to earn that virtuous cycle."

We certainly have been trying a number of different promotions, anything from sweepstakes to an Amazon gift card to a discount on an attraction once you book the hotel. They're all just different ways that we're both driving home. TripAdvisor is a place that you can now book a hotel, not just read the reviews. So to be clear, part of that kind of promotional goal is really building the brand around this is a place you can book, and part of it certainly serves to drive that first-time booker or second-time booker into the flow because we have our evidence that says, once we get someone to book once, the more likely they come back and book again. And if we can get them to book once or book twice on the app, for instance, it becomes an even stronger habit, and that's what we're looking to build over time. If you figure out the set of users, the large set of users that already trust us for our reviews and push them into the -- trusting us for that booking experience. So we have great scores when we measure how people feel about the booking experience once they've gone through it. So the promotions are taking some of the dollars that we have spent in TV. We feel, as I've said before, that leveraging the vast amount of traffic we have globally that's already on our site is simply a more efficient way for us to get our message out there than some of the other offline activities. It doesn't really tell you much on -- I'm not really able to tell you much on the relative spend for those type of programs in the back half of the year other than to point out what I think is fairly straightforward.

On the app is where we continue to be most excited because that's the best spot to build the habit. And when we look at building a habit for someone that travels once maybe twice a year, it's just less interesting to us than the more frequent traveler who can now, with the stored credit card on the app, open up the app, make the booking go, and it's really simple. It's really easy. We have tremendous coverage in most markets, and that kind of habit enables that device and it enables that value proposition to continue to grow for us. And so we'd expect to see continued, on average, conversion improvements because, frankly, we're attracting our repeat visitors more and more often, but that does take quarters and years to build."

And TripAdvisor has over 600,000 things to do and locations. Many of those places sell tickets and would love the ability to have the booking from our end. That's the whole story around the attractions. The second part of your question, I just haven't ever heard of an attraction owner saying no, I don't like the notion of Instant Booking because it takes away from that branded experience because, as you point out, the attraction is much less likely to be a repeat visit than the hotels. So the attraction is much less interested in building that direct loyalty. They want to make sure their attraction is highly rated, highly visible on Trip, easily bookable, best inventory and most available inventory. And our biggest challenge, frankly, is just getting the pipes, all that connectivity working for as many attractions as we can and then back to the consumer side on TripAdvisor, teaching folks that not only can they figure out the things that they want to do, they can book it, they can book it on desktop. And more importantly, in our long-term view, they can book it on their phone when they are in market, and that's that whole Instant Booking attraction picture."

So the largest impact on the year-on-year decrease of revenue per shopper is the Instant Booking dilution. We have obviously now been in market outside of the U.S., U.K. where we were before in a complete 3 months in the second quarter, and that has made a significant impact. That's both, as a reminder, a booked revenue issue as well as rev rec issue in Instant Booking, and so that's a large one. The second in revenue per shopper is the shift to mobile, and we've seen a faster shift in mobile than we anticipated in the second quarter, and this continues to be a drag on the aggregated revenue per shopper number. As we said before, revenue per shopper of mobile is increasing, but it's substantially lower than on desktop and, therefore, with mix shift a reduction of the overall. We've also in the second quarter had tougher meta comps compared to a year ago. We called that out earlier. That's a front half issue that will abate, that will ease in the second part of the quarter. We've also called out that we did see some softness, particularly in June and into July, which we think might be impacted by the macro environment, by the various events that we've seen around the world, be it terror-related or economic events like Brexit, and we believe that has made an impact on us as well on the volume side, on the number of shoppers side and, perhaps, also the revenue per shopper side. Your second part of your question about 2017, in February, we made some statements painting a picture for the shape of '16 but also into '17. We have no reason to update that today, but I also don't want to put a finer point to that.

IT very much depends on the property of the type of traveler. I'll give you a very simple case in point.

It kind of makes sense. It's a simple transaction, TripAdvisor giving you plenty of information and there's not a big reason to shop around. But we stay in Cancun, where you're looking for a lot more information and sometimes information that, frankly, TripAdvisor doesn't quite have in the form that you're looking for, then Instant Booking is not converting as well as meta. So I certainly understand your question. And when we think over time, yes, we do believe Instant Booking can and should always be able to be better, if our pricing is good, than a meta click.

So the geo split that you see, the first thing to point out is the mix across our entire business. So it includes TripAdvisor, auction revenue, but it also includes, obviously, other hotel brands as well as attractions, Vacation Rentals, et cetera. But having said that, across the board and also in our TripAdvisor core, our revenue performance in the U.S. has been better than outside the U.S. for a number of reasons, most importantly, that we are parking much further along in driving improvements in our Instant Booking offering. We've seen lapping of the things that we did last year and we've seen significant improvements we made in conversion in the United States. So we're very pleased with that and we see very good performance there. If you compare that to EMEA breakout at APAC and LATAM, you seeing that the trends are different they are. That is a function of the rollout that we have just done, and you also see in addition to that particularly in a LATAM and APAC, we've seen the weakness. So if you were to ask us where in the portfolio have you seen strong performance and that's strong performance in the second quarter or on a year-on-year basis, clearly, the U.S., stronger performer; and mobile, a stronger performer; and outside the U.S., Europe, weaker and outside of Europe, LATAM and APAC weaker."

You are wise to point out that change in the IB Instant Book presentation in the website, as internally we call it sort of flexing the interface, to show Instant Book where we think it's truly the best offering for the consumer and not fully deprecating but lowering its visibility when we don't think that's going to make for a successful experience. We were, perhaps, a little too ambitious when we rolled it out originally putting IB top, front and center no matter what the price was in IB and no matter how appropriate IB was for what the user was looking for, looking back to that example of the Best Western purchase versus the week in Cancun. Now when you look at our site, again, depending on the market, you'll see Instant Book position as a terrific option if it's the right property and the right price, and you'll actually see it float in a different spot depending possibly on whether you've booked on TripAdvisor before. So the team did a terrific job helping to figure out when Instant Book is likely to be successful and when meta is actually a better offering or a better choice for that traveler at that point in time. The user and the traveler, as they go through their journey, in fact, sometimes is more interested in a meta click-off or looking at more information and sometimes more interested in just finishing the booking right there because the price is the same and the purchase path is simple. I would suggest that if you care to continue to look at the site because we expect to continue to look and optimize where and when you see Instant Booking, again, for our mission, helping that traveler plan and book the perfect trip, what are the right times when we're going to see it. The really nice thing, and then my point, is that as we have flex user interface to show meta or IB at the right time, we've increased our revenue and we have not had a meaningful drop in our Instant Bookings because, fundamentally, we're lowering its visibility in cases where we weren't converting anyone anyways. So in this case, the team, again, nice job because we're getting our revenue back, which helps our traffic acquisition and our overall top line, and we're not losing on the Instant Book trial piece, which furthers our building a habit using Instant Book strategy."

I think we've talked about having the vast majority of the chains on board and we have quite a few independent properties. One of the nice points of that independent property piece is that so many of them are hearing about us through their channel partner or aware of us because they're responding to reviews. And so they're actually going through our self-service module to sign up. And if that independent hotel uses an Internet booking engine that we support, and we support well over 100 now, it's pretty easy for that property to come on in, put in their credit card, hit a few buttons and away they go. And then they're able to take direct bookings via TripAdvisor, and again, they like it. Feedback is good. We had the desire, the strongest desire to be as broad as we can with Instant Booking. So our natural focus has been the big chains because they can bring on thousands of properties at once and, of course, the big OTAs and super partnership with the Priceline brand. And so you've seen both not only booking.com but also Priceline and Agoda appear in all auctions, not only in the U.S., but in many more markets as well. And as we expand all of that inventory to that OTA relationship, we're delivering Instant Book to more customers in more languages. So the question of the Instant Book conversion via supplier direct versus an OTA, it's a little hard for us to measure simply because it's kind of apples to oranges. The big chain supply we have tends to be the big names, the high confidence, and in general, those tend to convert quite well, oftentimes better than a good OTA partner, because there is some -- we can tell some brand preference for the supplier direct. It's a little more nuanced when it comes to the individual properties signing up, whether the consumer preference is an OTA versus the independent. I leave you with the generalized statement that if the independent or the supplier direct has excellent content in our system, so good room descriptions, good photos and absolutely have equal pricing, then the supplier is likely to get a higher share of the bookings. When we ask ourselves what matters the most, I want to be very clear, it's price. And so hoteliers who are very good at making sure their own website has the best pricing and that's what's shown on our site, then [indiscernible] of that. Where pricing is variable across different partners, then the hotel itself will lose some of the bookings because consumers prefer the cheapest price, simply put."

I think -- this is Steve. Absolutely the biggest factor is the consumer building a habit and the expectations of being able to book with us on the app. So there's the macro, and I think almost every travel company at least will talk about how the phone bookings monetize less per booking than desktop because the phone is still used, in my opinion, for the lower decision support purchases. It's the easier hotel, it's the one night, it's you know what you want, there's less research involved and the heavier more expensive purchases are happening, the less commoditized purchases are still happening more on the desktop. As users convert grow on the phone, as phone apps get even better, that will lessen in the average price of what is booked on the phone will come closer to desktop. Average price is a good proxy for average amount that any less make on those bookings. For us, the habit of booking and rebooking and rebooking on the phone, on the apps specifically, is going to be what we believe drives our future monetization model. We are in -- we kind of the have the best of the many worlds because we have this awesome meta price comparison engine on any device that allows the traveler to make sure they're getting the best deal and we've moved into the transaction business so that they don't have to go anywhere else to get that best deal. They can book on TripAdvisor. If you believe, as we do, that it's going to be an app world -- to many, it's already an app world, to Facebook, it's already an app world, but in that sort of travel purchase, it's moving in that direction, our app being able to help people find what they're looking for, make sure they're getting the best price, click-off in their meta models, they're not getting the best price, use their stored credit card to easily book when we do have the best price so that they made the travel research, they made the travel purchase, now they're taking TripAdvisor on the road with them in that single app to deliver that next experience of what I'm going to do when I get there, how am I going to -- where am I going to eat, how can I make those reservations. And that app world means by overall revenue per shopper, a, gets amortized overall the different stuff we sell, not just hotels; and b, building that habit because we've earned that spot on your phone makes that monetization because of the repeat usage that much better over time. And it's a true that on TripAdvisor desktop, we've been phenomenally blessed with so much traffic, so much trust, so much awareness around the globe. But the desktop website isn't that sticky. It's been our challenge to get people who do the price comparison on Trip, who read the reviews on Trip to not immediately pop over and book somewhere else such that we've completely lost the credit, and that's not a complaint against any of our partners that we deserve all that credit. We're trying as hard as they are to correctly attribute the credit to us. On the app with Instant Booking, we don't have the challenge anymore because we built the habit, people come back and finish their booking right on Trip."

When you look at the folks who are logged in already members on the app, huge, huge percentage of people that are clearly identifying themselves as TripAdvisor members and happy to book. Combine that with the constant increase in credit card storage, the constant repeat bookings, and it takes time but we're pretty happy with how that picture's shaping up on the app. We're going to face, to be clear, a continued headwind of the shift over to mobile because even though our mobile monetization rate is growing and the app usage is looking really strong, it's still coming from such a smaller rev per shopper base than desktop, but that's one of the reasons why we launch IB. The whole concept of Instant Book in the first place was to kind of solve this problem so that we'd be in a phenomenally strong position in the app world in a few years."

So because of the Priceline Group relationship and the fact that we have all of their inventory, I'd say the bookable properties number is huge. It covers just about everything we want because you think of how strong the Priceline Group companies are, covering basically most interesting bookable hotels. We've always looked at our meta auction by hey, as a percentage of page views, how many of the properties that we have do we have a commerce link for, and that number has been quite steady for several years. And I think the number now that we have is 0.5 million bookable properties is going to be pretty steady. Priceline generally has most, if not all, of the rooms at a property, so we don't generally go down to be kind of room level count. But if you think of our inventory as the superset of the Priceline brands plus the Expedia affiliate network brands, via Tingo, plus Get a Room, plus the other suppliers that we signed up, in total bookable properties, I can kind of say, at least in English, I can kind of say, checkmark, that all that matter. I can't say checkmark yet on do we have the best price on all those properties because Priceline is strong as they are on pricing doesn't always have the best price and that's why people generally shop around on the net. They're very, very good at it, but TripAdvisor has the opportunity to be even better because when Priceline has a great price per property, we can take it from them. When the hotel itself has a better price, we can take the person from them and they can both be Instant Book partners. So I wouldn't look at or I don't care much about at this point, the trajectory of bookable properties. I care more about how we're doing by way of content and pricing for those properties and then the expansion into as many link [indiscernible] as we can support."

We certainly have been trying a number of different promotions, anything from sweepstakes to an Amazon gift card to a discount on an attraction once you've booked a hotel. They're all just different ways that we're both driving home. TripAdvisor is a place that you can now book the hotel, not just read the reviews. So to be clear, part of those -- part of that kind of promotional goal is really building the brand around this is a place you can book, and part of it certainly serves to drive that first-time booker or second-time booker into the flow because we have our evidence that says once we get someone to book once, the more likely they come back and book again. And if we can get them to book once or book twice on the app, for instance, it becomes an even stronger habit, and that's what we're looking to build over time. Thinking out the set of users, the large set of users that already trust us for our reviews and push them into the -- trusting us for that booking experience. And we have great scores of when we measure how people feel about the booking experience once they've gone through it. So the promotions are taking some of the dollars that we have spent in TV. We feel, as I've said before, that leveraging the vast amount of traffic we have globally that's already on our site is simply a more efficient way for us to get our message out there than some of the other offline activities. It doesn't really tell you much on -- I'm not really able to tell you much on the relative spend for those type of programs in the back half of the year other than to point out what I think is fairly straightforward. Those aren't anywhere near the materiality of the TV spend, even in the lightweight ways we were doing it last year."

So we'll see the overall conversion rate for IB climb in our newer markets over time anyways because we're simply pulling back people that have already tried it, already liked it. On the app is where we continue to be most excited because that's the best spot to build the habit. And when we look at building a habit for someone that travels once, maybe twice a year, it's just less interesting to us than the more frequent traveler who can now, with the stored credit card on the app, open up the app, make a booking, go. And it's really simple. It's really easy. We have tremendous coverage in most markets. And that kind of habit enables that device and enables that value proposition to continue to grow for us.

That's the whole story around the attractions. To the second part of your question, I just haven't ever heard of an attraction owner saying, ""No, I don't like the notion of Instant Booking because it takes away from that branded experience,"" because as you point out, the attraction is much less likely to be a repeat visit than the hotel, so the attraction is much less interested in building that direct loyalty. They want to make sure their attraction is highly rated, highly visible on Trip, easily bookable, best inventory, most available inventory. And our biggest challenge, frankly, is just getting the pipes, all that connectivity working for as many attractions as we can; and then back to the consumer side on TripAdvisor, teaching folks that not only can they figure out the things that they want to do, they can book it, they can book it on desktop, and more importantly, in our long-term view, they can book it on their phone when they are in market.

So the largest impact on the year-on-year decrease of revenue per shopper is the Instant Booking dilution. We have obviously now been in market outside of the U.S., U.K., where we were before in a complete 3 months in the second quarter, and that has made a significant impact. That's both, as a reminder, a booked revenue issue as well as rev rec issue in Instant Booking. So that's the large one. The second in revenue per shopper is the shift to mobile. We've seen a faster shift to mobile than we anticipated in the second quarter, and this continues to be a drag on the aggregated revenue per shopper number. As we said before, revenue per shopper of mobile is increasing, but is substantially lower than on desktop, and therefore with mix shift, a reduction of the overall. We've also in the second quarter had tougher meta comps compared to a year ago. We called that out earlier. That's a front half issue that will abate, that will ease, in the second part of the quarter. We've also called out that we did see some softness, particularly in June and into July, which we think might be impacted by the macro environment, by the various events that we've seen around the world, be it terror-related or economic event like Brexit, and we believe that has made an impact on us as well on the volume side, on the number of shoppers side and perhaps also on the revenue per shopper side. Your second part of your question about 2017, in February, we made some statements painting a picture for the shape of '16 but also into '17.

It very much depends on the property of the type of traveler. I'll give you a very simple case in point. If a user is looking for a relatively straightforward stay, low research intent, vacation, staying 3 nights in the Best Western, the conversion rates are really quite high, and near as we can tell, higher than the downstream meta. It kind of makes sense. It's a simple transaction, TripAdvisor's giving you plenty of information, and there's not a big reason to shop around. But the week's stay in Cancun, where you're looking for a lot more information, and sometimes, information that, frankly, TripAdvisor doesn't quite have in the form that you're looking for, then Instant Booking is not converting as well as a meta. So I certainly understand your question. And when we think over time, yes, we do believe Instant Booking can and should always be able to be better, if our pricing is good, than a meta click. And when we look on average, we see in the U.S. app, we're already there. But again, the on average, already better than meta is a great statement.

So the geo split that you see, the first thing to point out is a mix across our entire business. So it includes TripAdvisor, auction revenue, but it also includes, obviously, other hotel brands, as well as attractions, Vacation Rentals, et cetera. But having said that, across the board and also in our TripAdvisor core, our revenue performance in the U.S. has been better than outside the U.S. for a number of reasons, most importantly, that we have -- we are much, much further along in driving improvements in our Instant Booking offering. We've seen lapping of the things that we did last year, and we've seen significant improvements we'd make -- we've made in conversion in the United States. So we're very pleased with that and we see very good performance there. If you compare that to EMEA in our breakout and APAC and LATAM, you'll see that the trends are different there, that is a function of the rollout that we have just done. And you also see in addition, that particularly in LATAM and APAC, we've seen weakness.

You are wise to point out that change in the IB Instant Book presentation on the website, as internally we call it, sort of flexing the user interface to show Instant Book where we think it's truly the best offering for the consumer and not fully deprecating, but lowering its visibility when we don't think that's going to make for a successful experience. We were, perhaps, a little too ambitious when we rolled it out originally, putting IB top, front and center no matter what the price was in IB and no matter how appropriate IB was for what the user was looking for, flipping back to that example of a Best Western purchase versus a week in Cancun. Now when you look at our site, again, depending on the market, you'll see Instant Book positioned as a terrific option if it's the right property and the right price. And you'll actually see it float in a different spot, depending possibly on whether you've booked on TripAdvisor before. So the team did a terrific job helping to figure out when Instant Book is likely to be successful and when meta is actually a better offering or a better choice for that traveler at that point in time. The user as the traveler, as they go through their journey, in fact, sometimes is more interested in a meta click-off or looking at more information, and sometimes, more interested in just finishing the booking right there because the price is the same and the purchase path is simple. So again, I would suggest that, if you care, to continue to look at the site because we expect to continue to look and optimize where and when you see Instant Booking, again, per our mission, helping that traveler plan and book the perfect trip, what are the right times when we're going to see it. The really nice thing -- and then that will end my point, is that as we have flexed user interface to show meta or IB at the right time, we have increased our revenue and we have not had a meaningful drop in our Instant Bookings because fundamentally, we're lowering its visibility in cases where we weren't converting anyone anyways. So in this case, the team, again, nice job because we're getting our revenue back, which helps our traffic acquisition and our overall top line. And we're not losing on the Instant Book trial piece, which furthers our building a habit using Instant Book strategy."

Our goal is to continue to sign up independent hotels, chains, online travel agencies, resellers, every possible partner who's able to take the booking for a hotel so that when you come to TripAdvisor and use the Instant Book product, you will see TripAdvisor having as good a price as any of our meta partners and, frankly, as anyone across the web has. And so we measure -- getting technically here, we measure the meet/beat/lose ratio of how our Instant Book price compares to our own meta auction to know how many times a smart traveler should be picking the Instant Book option because it is equal to the best price in the meta auction."

I think we've talked about having the vast majority of the chains on board and we have quite a few independent properties. One of the nice points of that independent property piece is that so many of them are hearing about us through their channel partner or aware of us because they're responding to reviews. And so they're actually going through our self-service module to sign up. And if that independent hotel uses an Internet booking engine that we support, and we support well over 100 now, it's pretty easy for that property to come on in, put in their credit card, hit a few buttons and away they go. And then they're able to take direct bookings via TripAdvisor. And again, they like it. Feedback is good. We've had the desire, the strongest desire, to be as broad as we can with Instant Booking, so our natural focus has been the big chains because they can bring on thousands of properties at once, and of course, the big OTAs and super partnership with the Priceline brand. And so you've seen both not only booking.com but also Priceline and Agoda appear in our auctions, not only in the U.S., but in many more markets as well. And as we expand all of that inventory through that OTA relationship, we're delivering Instant Book to more customers in more languages. So the question of the Instant Book conversion via supplier direct versus an OTA, it's a little hard for us to measure simply because it's kind of apples to oranges. The big chain supply we have tends to be the big names, the high confidence. And in general, those tend to convert quite well, oftentimes better than a good OTA partner because there is some -- near as we can tell, some brand preference for the supplier direct. It's a little more nuanced when it comes to the individual properties signing up, whether the consumer preference is an OTA versus the independent. I'd leave you with the generalized statement that if the independent or the supplier direct has excellent content in our system, so good room descriptions, good photos and absolutely have equal pricing, then the supplier is likely to get a higher share of the bookings. When we ask ourselves what matters the most, I want to be very clear, it's price. And so hoteliers who are very good at making sure their own website has the best pricing and that's what's shown on our site, reap the benefits of that. Where pricing is variable across different partners, then the hotel itself will lose some of the bookings because consumers prefer the cheapest price, simply put."

I think -- this is Steve. Absolutely, the biggest factor is the consumer building a habit and the expectations of being able to book with us on the app. So there's the macro, and I think almost every travel company at least, will talk about how the phone bookings monetize less per booking than desktop because the phone is still used, at least in my opinion, for the lower decision support purchases. It's the easier hotel, it's the one night, it's you know what you want, there's less research involved. And the heavier, more expensive purchases are happening, the less commoditized purchases, still are happening more on the desktop. As users' comfort grow on the phone, as phone apps become even better, that will lessen, and the average price of what is booked on the phone will come closer to desktop. Average price is a good proxy for average amount that any of us make on those bookings. For us, the habit of booking and rebooking and rebooking on the phone, on the apps specifically, is going to be what we believe drives our future monetization model. We are in -- we kind of the have the best of many worlds because we have this awesome meta price comparison engine on any device that allows the traveler to make sure they're getting the best deal, and we've moved into the transaction business so that they don't have to go anywhere else to get that best deal. They can book right on TripAdvisor. If you believe, as we do, that it's going to be an app world in -- to many, it's already an app world. To Facebook, it's already an app world. But in that sort of travel purchase, it's moving in that direction, our app being able to help people find what they're looking for, make sure they're getting the best price, click-off in the meta models, they're not getting the best price, use their stored credit card to easily book when we do have the best price so that they made the travel research, they made the travel purchase, now they're taking TripAdvisor on the road with them in that single app to deliver that next experience of what am I going to do when I get there? How am I going to -- where am I going to eat? How can I make all those reservations? And that app world means, by overall revenue per shopper, a, gets amortized overall the different stuff we sell, not just hotels; but b, building that habit because we've earned the spot on your phone, makes that monetization because of the repeat usage that much better over time. And it's true that on TripAdvisor desktop, we've had -- we've been phenomenally blessed with so much traffic and so much trust and so much awareness around the globe, but the desktop website isn't that sticky. It's been our challenge to get people who do the price comparison on Trip, who read the reviews on Trip, to not immediately pop over and book somewhere else such that we've completely lost the credit. And that's not a complaint against any of our partners that we deserve all that credit. We're trying as hard as they are to correctly attribute the credit to us. On the app with Instant Booking, we don't have the challenge anymore because we've built the habit, people come back and finish their booking right on Trip."

Combine that with the constant increase in credit card storage, the constant repeat bookings, and it takes time, but we're pretty happy with how that picture is shaping up on the app. We're going to face, to be clear, a continued headwind of the shift over to mobile because even though our mobile monetization rate is growing and the app usage is looking really strong, it's still coming from such a smaller rev per shopper base than desktop.

We've seen, obviously, impacts, localized impacts, in the particular markets that were impacted and we can size those, to some extent.

So because of the Priceline Group relationship and the fact that we have all of their inventory, I'd say the bookable properties number is huge, covers just about everything we want because when you think of how strong the Priceline Group companies are, covering basically most interesting bookable hotels. We've always looked at our meta auction by, hey, as a percentage of page views, how many of the properties that we have do we have a commerce link for, and that number has been quite steady for several years. And I think the number, now that we have this 0.5 million bookable properties, is going to be pretty steady. Priceline generally has most, if not all, of the rooms at a property, so we don't generally go down to be kind of room level count. But if you think of our inventory as the superset of the Priceline brands plus the Expedia affiliate network brands via Tingo, plus getaroom, plus the other suppliers that we've signed up, in total bookable properties, I can kind of say -- at least in English, I can kind of say, ""checkmark, got all that matter."" I can't say checkmark yet on do we have the best price on all those properties because Priceline, as strong as they are on pricing, doesn't always have the best price, and that's why people generally shop around on the net. They're very, very good at it, but TripAdvisor has the opportunity to be even better because when Priceline has a great price for a property, we can take it from them. When the hotel itself has a better price, we can take the price from them and they can both be Instant Book partners. So I wouldn't look at, or I don't care much about at this point, the trajectory of bookable properties. I care more about how we're doing by way of content and pricing for those properties and then the expansion into as many languages as we can support."

Having said that, especially earlier on the quarter in -- outside of the United States, in those -- all those markets where we rolled out Instant Booking, we perhaps saw a larger impact that is in part driven by the fact that we can spend less as we saw the impact of Instant Booking. But hotel shopping is not completely isolated to outside the U.S. Your second question on mobile monetization, we did see a year-on-year improvement of revenue per shopper in mobile.

They're all just different ways that we're both driving home TripAdvisor is a place that you can now book the hotel, not just read the reviews. So to be clear, part of those -- part of that kind of promotional goal is really building the brand around this is a place you can book, and part of it certainly serves to drive that first-time booker or second-time booker into the flow because we have our evidence that says once we get someone to book once, the more likely they come back and book again. And if we can get them to book once or book twice on the app, for instance, it becomes an even stronger habit, and that's what we're looking to build over time. Figure out the set of users, the large set of users that already trust us for our reviews and push them into the -- trusting us for that booking experience. And we have great scores of when we measure how people feel about the booking experience once they've gone through it. So the promotions are taking some of the dollars that we have spent in TV. We feel, as I've said before, that leveraging the vast amount of traffic we have globally that's already on our site is simply a more efficient way for us to get our message out there than some of the other offline activities. It doesn't really tell you much on -- I'm not really able to tell you much on the relative spend for those type of programs in the back half of the year other than to point out what I think is fairly straightforward.

On the app is where we continue to be most excited because that's the best spot to build the habit. And when we look at building a habit for someone that travels once, maybe twice a year, it's just less interesting to us than the more frequent traveler who can now, with the stored credit card on the app, open up the app, make a booking, go. And it's really simple. It's really easy. We have tremendous coverage in most markets. And that kind of habit enables that device and enables that value proposition to continue to grow for us.

That's the whole story around the attractions. To the second part of your question, I just haven't ever heard of an attraction owner saying, ""No, I don't like the notion of Instant Booking because it takes away from that branded experience,"" because as you point out, the attraction is much less likely to be a repeat visit than the hotel, so the attraction is much less interested in building that direct loyalty. They want to make sure their attraction is highly rated, highly visible on Trip, easily bookable, best inventory, most available inventory. And our biggest challenge, frankly, is just getting the pipes, all that connectivity working for as many attractions as we can; and then back to the consumer side on TripAdvisor, teaching folks that not only can they figure out the things that they want to do, they can book it, they can book it on desktop, and more importantly, in our long-term view, they can book it on their phone when they are in market.

So the largest impact on the year-on-year decrease of revenue per shopper is the Instant Booking dilution. We have obviously now been in market outside of the U.S., U.K., where we were before in a complete 3 months in the second quarter, and that has made a significant impact. That's both, as a reminder, a booked revenue issue as well as rev rec issue in Instant Booking. So that's the large one. The second in revenue per shopper is the shift to mobile. We've seen a faster shift to mobile than we anticipated in the second quarter, and this continues to be a drag on the aggregated revenue per shopper number. As we said before, revenue per shopper of mobile is increasing, but is substantially lower than on desktop, and therefore with mix shift, a reduction of the overall. We've also in the second quarter had tougher meta comps compared to a year ago. We called that out earlier. That's a front half issue that will abate, that will ease, in the second part of the quarter. We've also called out that we did see some softness, particularly in June and into July, which we think might be impacted by the macro environment, by the various events that we've seen around the world, be it terror-related or economic event like Brexit, and we believe that has made an impact on us as well on the volume side, on the number of shoppers side and perhaps also on the revenue per shopper side. Your second part of your question about 2017, in February, we made some statements painting a picture for the shape of '16 but also into '17. We have no reason to update that today, but I also don't want to put a finer point to that. The teams here internally will start to shift over the next months in more detailed planning for 2017.

If a user is looking for a relatively straightforward stay, low research intent, vacation, staying 3 nights in the Best Western, the conversion rates are really quite high, and near as we can tell, higher than the downstream meta. It kind of makes sense. It's a simple transaction, TripAdvisor's giving you plenty of information, and there's not a big reason to shop around. But the week's stay in Cancun, where you're looking for a lot more information, and sometimes, information that, frankly, TripAdvisor doesn't quite have in the form that you're looking for, then Instant Booking is not converting as well as a meta. So I certainly understand your question. And when we think over time, yes, we do believe Instant Booking can and should always be able to be better, if our pricing is good, than a meta click.

So if you were to ask us where in the portfolio have you seen strong performance and less strong performance in the second quarter on a year-on-year basis, clearly U.S. a stronger performer; and mobile, a strong performer; and outside of the U.S., Europe, weaker; and especially outside of Europe, LATAM and APAC, weaker."

You are wise to point out that change in the IB Instant Book presentation on the website, as internally we call it, sort of flexing the user interface to show Instant Book where we think it's truly the best offering for the consumer and not fully deprecating, but lowering its visibility when we don't think that's going to make for a successful experience. We were, perhaps, a little too ambitious when we rolled it out originally, putting IB top, front and center no matter what the price was in IB and no matter how appropriate IB was for what the user was looking for, flipping back to that example of a Best Western purchase versus a week in Cancun. Now when you look at our site, again, depending on the market, you'll see Instant Book positioned as a terrific option if it's the right property and the right price. And you'll actually see it float in a different spot, depending possibly on whether you've booked on TripAdvisor before. So the team did a terrific job helping to figure out when Instant Book is likely to be successful and when meta is actually a better offering or a better choice for that traveler at that point in time. The user as the traveler, as they go through their journey, in fact, sometimes is more interested in a meta click-off or looking at more information, and sometimes, more interested in just finishing the booking right there because the price is the same and the purchase path is simple. So again, I would suggest that, if you care, to continue to look at the site because we expect to continue to look and optimize where and when you see Instant Booking, again, per our mission, helping that traveler plan and book the perfect trip, what are the right times when we're going to see it. The really nice thing -- and then that will end my point, is that as we have flexed user interface to show meta or IB at the right time, we have increased our revenue and we have not had a meaningful drop in our Instant Bookings because fundamentally, we're lowering its visibility in cases where we weren't converting anyone anyways. So in this case, the team, again, nice job because we're getting our revenue back, which helps our traffic acquisition and our overall top line. And we're not losing on the Instant Book trial piece, which furthers our building a habit using Instant Book strategy."

The Instant Book price is, generally speaking, the best price that we get from all of our Instant Booking partners, which is frequently the hotel itself, chain or independent, and then likely one of the -- one or more of the Priceline companies and then perhaps another or different OTA. Many times, that Instant Book price is not actually the best price in our meta auction. And so since travelers the world over care most -- or care hugely about price, when our Instant Book price is not the best price, we're generally not featuring it at the top of the page because we know it's not what users are going to want the most. Our goal is to continue to sign up independent hotels, chains, online travel agencies, resellers, every possible partner who's able to take the booking for a hotel so that when you come to TripAdvisor and use the Instant Book product, you will see TripAdvisor having as good a price as any of our meta partners and, frankly, as anyone across the web has. And so we measure -- getting technically here, we measure the meet/beat/lose ratio of how our Instant Book price compares to our own meta auction to know how many times a smart traveler should be picking the Instant Book option because it is equal to the best price in the meta auction."

I think we've talked about having the vast majority of the chains on board and we have quite a few independent properties. One of the nice points of that independent property piece is that so many of them are hearing about us through their channel partner or aware of us because they're responding to reviews. And so they're actually going through our self-service module to sign up. And if that independent hotel uses an Internet booking engine that we support, and we support well over 100 now, it's pretty easy for that property to come on in, put in their credit card, hit a few buttons and away they go. And then they're able to take direct bookings via TripAdvisor. And again, they like it. Feedback is good. We've had the desire, the strongest desire, to be as broad as we can with Instant Booking, so our natural focus has been the big chains because they can bring on thousands of properties at once, and of course, the big OTAs and we have a super partnership with the Priceline brand. And so you've seen both not only booking.com but also Priceline and Agoda appear in our auctions, not only in the U.S., but in many more markets as well. And as we expand all of that inventory through that OTA relationship, we're delivering Instant Book to more customers in more languages. So the question of the Instant Book conversion via supplier direct versus an OTA, it's a little hard for us to measure simply because it's kind of apples to oranges. The big chain supply we have tends to be the big names, the high confidence. And in general, those tend to convert quite well, oftentimes better than a good OTA partner because there is some -- near as we can tell, some brand preference for the supplier direct. It's a little more nuanced when it comes to the individual properties signing up, whether the consumer preference is an OTA versus the independent. I'd leave you with the generalized statement that if the independent or the supplier direct has excellent content in our system, so good room descriptions, good photos and absolutely have equal pricing, then the supplier is likely to get a higher share of the bookings. When we ask ourselves what matters the most, I want to be very clear, it's price. And so hoteliers who are very good at making sure their own website has the best pricing and that's what's shown on our site, reap the benefits of that. Where pricing is variable across different of their partners, then the hotel itself will lose some of the bookings because consumers prefer the cheapest price, simply put."

I think -- this is Steve. Absolutely, the biggest factor is the consumer building a habit and the expectations of being able to book with us on the app. So there's the macro, and I think almost every travel company at least, will talk about how the phone bookings monetize less per booking than desktop because the phone is still used, at least in my opinion, for the lower decision support purchases. It's the easier hotel, it's the one night, it's you know what you want, there's less research involved. And the heavier, more expensive purchases are happening, the less commoditized purchases, still are happening more on the desktop. As users' comfort grow on the phone, as phone apps become even better, that will lessen, and the average price of what is booked on the phone will come closer to desktop. Average price is a good proxy for average amount that any of us make on those bookings. For us, the habit of booking and rebooking and rebooking on the phone, on the apps specifically, is going to be what we believe drives our future monetization model. We are in -- we kind of the have the best of many worlds because we have this awesome meta price comparison engine on any device that allows the traveler to make sure they're getting the best deal, and we've moved into the transaction business so that they don't have to go anywhere else to get that best deal. They can book right on TripAdvisor. If you believe, as we do, that it's going to be an app world in -- to many, it's already an app world. To Facebook, it's already an app world. But in that sort of travel purchase, it's moving in that direction, our app being able to help people find what they're looking for, make sure they're getting the best price, click-off in the meta model if they're not getting the best price, use their stored credit card to easily book when we do have the best price so that they made the travel research, they made the travel purchase, now they're taking TripAdvisor on the road with them in that single app to deliver that next experience of what am I going to do when I get there? How am I going to -- where am I going to eat? How can I make all those reservations? And that app world means, by overall revenue per shopper, a, gets amortized overall the different stuff we sell, not just hotels; but b, building that habit because we've earned the spot on your phone, makes that monetization because of the repeat usage that much better over time. And it's true that on TripAdvisor desktop, we've had -- we've been phenomenally blessed with so much traffic and so much trust and so much awareness around the globe, but the desktop website isn't that sticky. It's been our challenge to get people who do the price comparison on Trip, who read the reviews on Trip, to not immediately pop over and book somewhere else such that we've completely lost the credit. And that's not a complaint against any of our partners that we deserve all that credit. We're trying as hard as they are to correctly attribute the credit to us. On the app with Instant Booking, we don't have the challenge anymore because we've built the habit, people come back and finish their booking right on Trip."

So because of the Priceline Group relationship and the fact that we have all of their inventory, I'd say the bookable properties number is huge, covers just about everything we want because when you think of how strong the Priceline Group companies are, covering basically most interesting bookable hotels. We've always looked at our meta auction by, hey, as a percentage of page views, how many of the properties that we have do we have a commerce link for, and that number has been quite steady for several years. And I think the number, now that we have this 0.5 million bookable properties, is going to be pretty steady. Priceline generally has most, if not all, of the rooms at a property, so we don't generally go down to the kind of room level count. But if you think of our inventory as the superset of the Priceline brands plus the Expedia affiliate network brands via Tingo, plus getaroom, plus the other suppliers that we've signed up, in total bookable properties, I can kind of say -- at least in English, I can kind of say, ""checkmark, got all that matter."" I can't say checkmark yet on do we have the best price on all those properties because Priceline, as strong as they are on pricing, doesn't always have the best price, and that's why people generally shop around on the net. They're very, very good at it, but TripAdvisor has the opportunity to be even better because when Priceline has a great price for a property, we can take it from them. When the hotel itself has a better price, we can take the price from them and they can both be Instant Book partners. So I wouldn't look at, or I don't care much about at this point, the trajectory of bookable properties. I care more about how we're doing by way of content and pricing for those properties and then the expansion into as many languages as we can support."

We certainly have been trying a number of different promotions, anything from sweepstakes to an Amazon gift card to a discount on an attraction once you've booked a hotel. They're all just different ways that we're both driving home TripAdvisor is a place that you can now book the hotel, not just read the reviews. So to be clear, part of those -- part of that kind of promotional goal is really building the brand around this is a place you can book, and part of it certainly serves to drive that first-time booker or second-time booker into the flow because we have our evidence that says once we get someone to book once, the more likely they come back and book again. And if we can get them to book once or book twice on the app, for instance, it becomes an even stronger habit, and that's what we're looking to build over time. Figure out the set of users, the large set of users that already trust us for our reviews and push them into the -- trusting us for that booking experience. And we have great scores of when we measure how people feel about the booking experience once they've gone through it. So the promotions are taking some of the dollars that we have spent in TV. We feel, as I've said before, that leveraging the vast amount of traffic we have globally that's already on our site is simply a more efficient way for us to get our message out there than some of the other offline activities. It doesn't really tell you much on -- I'm not really able to tell you much on the relative spend for those type of programs in the back half of the year other than to point out what I think is fairly straightforward.

The standard sort of test and learn that we're doing we know will drive improved conversion rates over time in each of our markets. We also get the benefit of the repeat bookers coming back. And those folks, obviously, have been around the longest in the U.S. so they have a higher conversion rate and haven't been around as much in some of our newer markets. So we'll see the overall conversion rate for IB climb in our newer markets over time anyways because we're simply pulling back people that have already tried it, already liked it. On the app is where we continue to be most excited because that's the best spot to build the habit. And when we look at building a habit for someone that travels once, maybe twice a year, it's just less interesting to us than the more frequent traveler who can now, with the stored credit card on the app, open up the app, make a booking, go. And it's really simple. It's really easy. We have tremendous coverage in most markets. And that kind of habit enables that device and enables that value proposition to continue to grow for us. And so we'd expect to see continued, on average, conversion improvements because, frankly, we're attracting our repeat visitors more and more often. But that does take quarters and years to build."

And TripAdvisor has over 600,000 things to do in locations. Many of those places sell tickets and would love the ability to have the booking from our end. That's the whole story around the attractions. To the second part of your question, I just haven't ever heard of an attraction owner saying, ""No, I don't like the notion of Instant Booking because it takes away from that branded experience,"" because as you point out, the attraction is much less likely to be a repeat visit than the hotel, so the attraction is much less interested in building that direct loyalty. They want to make sure their attraction is highly rated, highly visible on Trip, easily bookable, best inventory, most available inventory. And our biggest challenge, frankly, is just getting the pipes, all that connectivity working for as many attractions as we can; and then back to the consumer side on TripAdvisor, teaching folks that not only can they figure out the things that they want to do, they can book it, they can book it on desktop, and more importantly, in our long-term view, they can book it on their phone when they are in market.

So the largest impact on the year-on-year decrease of revenue per shopper is the Instant Booking dilution. We have obviously now been in market outside of the U.S., U.K., where we were before in a complete 3 months in the second quarter, and that has made a significant impact. That's both, as a reminder, a booked revenue issue as well as rev rec issue in Instant Booking. So that's the large one. The second in revenue per shopper is the shift to mobile. We've seen a faster shift to mobile than we anticipated in the second quarter, and this continues to be a drag on the aggregated revenue per shopper number. As we said before, revenue per shopper of mobile is increasing, but is substantially lower than on desktop, and therefore with mix shift, a reduction of the overall. We've also in the second quarter had tougher meta comps compared to a year ago. We called that out earlier. That's a front half issue that will abate, that will ease, in the second part of the quarter. We've also called out that we did see some softness, particularly in June and into July, which we think might be impacted by the macro environment, by the various events that we've seen around the world, be it terror-related or economic event like Brexit, and we believe that has made an impact on us as well on the volume side, on the number of shoppers side and perhaps also on the revenue per shopper side. Your second part of your question about 2017, in February, we made some statements painting a picture for the shape of '16 but also into '17. We have no reason to update that today, but I also don't want to put a finer point to that. The teams here internally will start to shift over the next months in more detailed planning for 2017.

It very much depends on the property of the type of traveler. I'll give you a very simple case in point. If a user is looking for a relatively straightforward stay, low research intent, vacation, staying 3 nights in the Best Western, the conversion rates are really quite high, and near as we can tell, higher than the downstream meta. It kind of makes sense. It's a simple transaction, TripAdvisor's giving you plenty of information, and there's not a big reason to shop around. But the week's stay in Cancun, where you're looking for a lot more information, and sometimes, information that, frankly, TripAdvisor doesn't quite have in the form that you're looking for, then Instant Booking is not converting as well as a meta. So I certainly understand your question. And when we think over time, yes, we do believe Instant Booking can and should always be able to be better, if our pricing is good, than a meta click. And when we look on average, we see in the U.S. app, we're already there. But again, the on average, already better than meta is a great statement. I still drill it down to different segments of properties and different segments of trips because we want to make sure it's not on average great, it's great in every different situation that we come across."

So the geo split that you see, the first thing to point out is a mix across our entire business. So it includes TripAdvisor, auction revenue, but it also includes, obviously, other hotel brands, as well as attractions, Vacation Rentals, et cetera. But having said that, across the board and also in our TripAdvisor core, our revenue performance in the U.S. has been better than outside the U.S. for a number of reasons, most importantly, that we have -- we are much, much further along in driving improvements in our Instant Booking offering. We've seen lapping of the things that we did last year, and we've seen significant improvements we'd make -- we've made in conversion in the United States. So we're very pleased with that and we see very good performance there. If you compare that to EMEA in our breakout and APAC and LATAM, you'll see that the trends are different there, that is a function of the rollout that we have just done. And you also see in addition, that particularly in LATAM and APAC, we've seen weakness. So if you were to ask us where in the portfolio have you seen strong performance and less strong performance in the second quarter on a year-on-year basis, clearly U.S. a stronger performer; and mobile, a strong performer; and outside of the U.S., Europe, weaker; and especially outside of Europe, LATAM and APAC, weaker."

You are wise to point out that change in the IB Instant Book presentation on the website, as internally we call it, sort of flexing the user interface to show Instant Book where we think it's truly the best offering for the consumer and not fully deprecating, but lowering its visibility when we don't think that's going to make for a successful experience. We were, perhaps, a little too ambitious when we rolled it out originally, putting IB top, front and center no matter what the price was in IB and no matter how appropriate IB was for what the user was looking for, flipping back to that example of a Best Western purchase versus a week in Cancun. Now when you look at our site, again, depending on the market, you'll see Instant Book positioned as a terrific option if it's the right property and the right price. And you'll actually see it float in a different spot, depending possibly on whether you've booked on TripAdvisor before. So the team did a terrific job helping to figure out when Instant Book is likely to be successful and when meta is actually a better offering or a better choice for that traveler at that point in time. The user as the traveler, as they go through their journey, in fact, sometimes is more interested in a meta click-off or looking at more information, and sometimes, more interested in just finishing the booking right there because the price is the same and the purchase path is simple. So again, I would suggest that, if you care, to continue to look at the site because we expect to continue to look and optimize where and when you see Instant Booking, again, per our mission, helping that traveler plan and book the perfect trip, what are the right times when we're going to see it. The really nice thing -- and then that will end my point, is that as we have flexed user interface to show meta or IB at the right time, we have increased our revenue and we have not had a meaningful drop in our Instant Bookings because fundamentally, we're lowering its visibility in cases where we weren't converting anyone anyways. So in this case, the team, again, nice job because we're getting our revenue back, which helps our traffic acquisition and our overall top line. And we're not losing on the Instant Book trial piece, which furthers our building a habit using Instant Book strategy."

The Instant Book price is, generally speaking, the best price that we get from all of our Instant Booking partners, which is frequently the hotel itself, chain or independent, and then likely one of the -- one or more of the Priceline companies and then perhaps another or different OTA. Many times, that Instant Book price is not actually the best price in our meta auction. And so since travelers the world over care most -- or care hugely about price, when our Instant Book price is not the best price, we're generally not featuring it at the top of the page because we know it's not what users are going to want the most. Our goal is to continue to sign up independent hotels, chains, online travel agencies, resellers, every possible partner who's able to take the booking for a hotel so that when you come to TripAdvisor and use the Instant Book product, you will see TripAdvisor having as good a price as any of our meta partners and, frankly, as anyone across the web has. And so we measure -- getting technically here, we measure the meet/beat/lose ratio of how our Instant Book price compares to our own meta auction to know how many times a smart traveler should be picking the Instant Book option because it is equal to the best price in the meta auction."

I think we've talked about having the vast majority of the chains on board and we have quite a few independent properties. One of the nice points of that independent property piece is that so many of them are hearing about us through their channel partner or aware of us because they're responding to reviews. And so they're actually going through our self-service module to sign up. And if that independent hotel uses an Internet booking engine that we support, and we support well over 100 now, it's pretty easy for that property to come on in, put in their credit card, hit a few buttons and away they go. And then they're able to take direct bookings via TripAdvisor. And again, they like it. Feedback is good. We've had the desire, the strongest desire, to be as broad as we can with Instant Booking, so our natural focus has been the big chains because they can bring on thousands of properties at once, and of course, the big OTAs and we have a super partnership with the Priceline brand. And so you've seen both not only booking.com but also Priceline and Agoda appear in our auctions, not only in the U.S., but in many more markets as well. And as we expand all of that inventory through that OTA relationship, we're delivering Instant Book to more customers in more languages. So the question of the Instant Book conversion via supplier direct versus an OTA, it's a little hard for us to measure simply because it's kind of apples to oranges. The big chain supply we have tends to be the big names, the high confidence. And in general, those tend to convert quite well, oftentimes better than a good OTA partner because there is some -- near as we can tell, some brand preference for the supplier direct. It's a little more nuanced when it comes to the individual properties signing up, whether the consumer preference is an OTA versus the independent. I'd leave you with the generalized statement that if the independent or the supplier direct has excellent content in our system, so good room descriptions, good photos and absolutely have equal pricing, then the supplier is likely to get a higher share of the bookings. When we ask ourselves what matters the most, I want to be very clear, it's price. And so hoteliers who are very good at making sure their own website has the best pricing and that's what's shown on our site, reap the benefits of that. Where pricing is variable across different of their partners, then the hotel itself will lose some of the bookings because consumers prefer the cheapest price, simply put."

I think -- this is Steve. Absolutely, the biggest factor is the consumer building a habit and the expectations of being able to book with us on the app. So there's the macro, and I think almost every travel company at least, will talk about how the phone bookings monetize less per booking than desktop because the phone is still used, at least in my opinion, for the lower decision support purchases. It's the easier hotel, it's the one night, it's you know what you want, there's less research involved. And the heavier, more expensive purchases are happening, the less commoditized purchases, still are happening more on the desktop. As users' comfort grow on the phone, as phone apps become even better, that will lessen, and the average price of what is booked on the phone will come closer to desktop. Average price is a good proxy for average amount that any of us make on those bookings. For us, the habit of booking and rebooking and rebooking on the phone, on the apps specifically, is going to be what we believe drives our future monetization model. We are in -- we kind of the have the best of many worlds because we have this awesome meta price comparison engine on any device that allows the traveler to make sure they're getting the best deal, and we've moved into the transaction business so that they don't have to go anywhere else to get that best deal. They can book right on TripAdvisor. If you believe, as we do, that it's going to be an app world in -- to many, it's already an app world. To Facebook, it's already an app world. But in that sort of travel purchase, it's moving in that direction, our app being able to help people find what they're looking for, make sure they're getting the best price, click-off in the meta model if they're not getting the best price, use their stored credit card to easily book when we do have the best price so that they made the travel research, they made the travel purchase, now they're taking TripAdvisor on the road with them in that single app to deliver that next experience of what am I going to do when I get there? How am I going to -- where am I going to eat? How can I make all those reservations? And that app world means, by overall revenue per shopper, a, gets amortized overall the different stuff we sell, not just hotels; but b, building that habit because we've earned the spot on your phone, makes that monetization because of the repeat usage that much better over time. And it's true that on TripAdvisor desktop, we've had -- we've been phenomenally blessed with so much traffic and so much trust and so much awareness around the globe, but the desktop website isn't that sticky. It's been our challenge to get people who do the price comparison on Trip, who read the reviews on Trip, to not immediately pop over and book somewhere else such that we've completely lost the credit. And that's not a complaint against any of our partners that we deserve all that credit. We're trying as hard as they are to correctly attribute the credit to us. On the app with Instant Booking, we don't have the challenge anymore because we've built the habit, people come back and finish their booking right on Trip."

We did see, as we called out, a softness really into June more than in April and May in the particular quarter, and we've seen that softness continue into July. And as I said before, usually, we see a very significant spike in June and July that is seasonal. We've seen that much of a lesser extent this year. We've talked about what we believe are some of the headwinds that we're looking at. It's difficult to size the total impact of macro. We've seen, obviously, impacts, localized impacts, in the particular markets that were impacted and we can size those, to some extent. But we believe there's something larger going on in the travel environment that is harder to quantify. So we've seen that in June and July. When we say, when we look at the rest of the year, that we're more cautious, it is really because it is difficult for us to forecast how much of that June, July weakness is going to persist throughout the end of the year, and that's the reason for our cautiousness."

So because of the Priceline Group relationship and the fact that we have all of their inventory, I'd say the bookable properties number is huge, covers just about everything we want because when you think of how strong the Priceline Group companies are, covering basically most interesting bookable hotels. We've always looked at our meta auction by, hey, as a percentage of page views, how many of the properties that we have do we have a commerce link for, and that number has been quite steady for several years. And I think the number, now that we have this 0.5 million bookable properties, is going to be pretty steady. Priceline generally has most, if not all, of the rooms at a property, so we don't generally go down to the kind of room level count. But if you think of our inventory as the superset of the Priceline brands plus the Expedia affiliate network brands via Tingo, plus getaroom, plus the other suppliers that we've signed up, in total bookable properties, I can kind of say -- at least in English, I can kind of say, ""checkmark, got all that matter."" I can't say checkmark yet on do we have the best price on all those properties because Priceline, as strong as they are on pricing, doesn't always have the best price, and that's why people generally shop around on the net. They're very, very good at it, but TripAdvisor has the opportunity to be even better because when Priceline has a great price for a property, we can take it from them. When the hotel itself has a better price, we can take the price from them and they can both be Instant Book partners. So I wouldn't look at, or I don't care much about at this point, the trajectory of bookable properties. I care more about how we're doing by way of content and pricing for those properties and then the expansion into as many languages as we can support."

So we thought that was a very good sign because at the end of August, we were lapping the -- a sizable rollout in the U.S. for IB last year, and we feel it's a very good news for us that we see that positive momentum year-on-year. We saw that -- we saw it combined with conversion improvements in the U.S. We saw year-on-year conversion rate improvements on the desktop, IB, on meta. We saw very healthy meta auction dynamics. We saw very healthy IB dynamics. And this gives us a lot of hope that the U.S., now we were lapping the full rollout of IB a year ago, is in increasingly good shape.

They get the phenomenal content, information, the trust, the community. And then travelers really wanted to know that they're getting the best price, and meta delivers on that best price. And if the client has a brand loyalty to an OTA or to a supplier direct, and they wish to book on that site, we were fine with that because meta enables that. If the user wants to book on TripAdvisor through Instant Book because we have great price and great content, then that would be a straightforward mechanism and arguably easier on the phone because it's less [ph] of a click away. But that when we look at being successful in the eyes of our travelers is, did we help to find the property they wanted and did we help them book it at the best price, book it on TripAdvisor or book it on our partner sites through meta. So meta remains critical. I don't frankly ever foresee it going away, period, full stop. And then the delta is just over the course of the next several years, where do our consumers choose to go. Do they choose to go into the IB flow because pricing and content and why not and they trust TripAdvisor, well that's fine. If they choose to go into the meta flow, we want to help them book, first and foremost. We obviously recognize that if they actually book on TripAdvisor, they're more likely to come back to TripAdvisor.

Those remarketed shoppers aren't going to increase the total number of monthly hotel shoppers, but they are actually pretty important as we try to plug our leak. So for me, I look at the revenue per shopper and how well we are able to monetize the site a bit more than absolute percentage growth of hotel shoppers. It's just the way I look at it. We certainly -- when we look at the stats and you compare them against the competition, we have a lot of hotel shoppers. And several of the other travel categories are just able to monetize them a lot better than we are. To the second question, Priceline writing down OpenTable, well, we've -- OpenTable is certainly a terrific product, has tremendous market share in a number of the markets in which they operate.

So I can't quote specific numbers, I suppose, but we have way more people using the TripAdvisor app when they're on the road. As you look to an app environment, we would suspect people are using fewer sites. And if that app first world comes to be, you'll have to have Trip -- we'd like to think you'll have to have TripAdvisor on your phone because we're the app that's going to be used in the market, so long as you know of us as a place to book, then we're going to earn our fair share of your bookings. So I think as an opportunity, the app is -- over the mobile environment, phone environment, is fantastic. We've been focused to a decent degree on making sure that, that full experience is a solid one, not just the booking piece.

And right now I think every time you look at the Instant Book offering and you don't see that it's at least as good a price as where you'd find elsewhere on the web, when you look at the room descriptions and the photos, and you see that they're not quite as good as what you can find on another site, that's an opportunity for improvement that we have to do in order to win the conversion on that site. And I think if you look at the magical secrets of the other agencies selling hotels on the web, you'll find that attention to detail, making sure the consumer has the best possible price, the best selection of rooms, the content, the photos. And we are, in some part, dependent upon our partners, our OTA and our supplier direct partners for that. So having more partners on board, well implemented, will improve all of those things including rates. And to be clear, our rates have been improving over the past 12 months, and that's part of the reason why you've seen an uptick in conversion. But I think it will -- there's no one big thing we're missing, one big technology investment we're missing, but I think we would forecast out steady improvement in Instant Book because of the additional supply partners that we will continue to add for a long, long time. And I'd say for a long, long time in part because there's hundreds of thousands of them independent hotels out there that want to be on our platform that we would like to have on our platform that we haven't gotten to yet."

If the user wants to book on TripAdvisor through Instant Book because we have great price and great content, then that would be a straightforward mechanism and arguably easier on the phone because it's less of a click away. But that when we look at being successful in the eyes of our travelers, it's did we help to find the property they wanted and did we help them book it at the best price, book it on TripAdvisor or book it on our partner sites through meta. So meta remains critical. I don't frankly ever foresee it going away, period, full stop. And then the delta is just over the course of the next several years, where do our consumers choose to go. Do they choose to go into the IB flow because pricing and content and why not and they trust TripAdvisor, well that's fine. If they choose to go into the meta flow, we want to help them book, first and foremost. We obviously recognize that if they actually book on TripAdvisor, they're more likely to come back to TripAdvisor. So we have an inherent interest in that as a flow, but it will never come at the expense of meta going away, at least I wouldn't predict -- ever predict that."

I'm not sure I can add much on the hotel shopper. I do kind of reiterate a point Ernst was making in that on the paid marketing side, when you go out booking for new traffic, you can get a combination of traffic that has not been to your site before, which is an increase in monthly hotel shoppers, or you can get traffic that has been to your site before and you're buying them back in remarketing fashion. Those remarketed shoppers aren't going to increase the total number of monthly hotel shoppers, but they are actually pretty important as we try to plug our leak. So for me, I look at the revenue per shopper and how well we are able to monetize the site a bit more than absolute percentage growth of hotel shoppers. It's just the way I look at it. We certainly -- when we look at the stats and you compare them against the competition, we have a lot of hotel shoppers. And several of the other travel categories are just able to monetize them a lot better than we are. To the second question, Priceline writing down OpenTable, well, we've -- OpenTable is certainly a terrific product, has tremendous market share in a number of the markets in which they operate.

It's absolutely taken longer than we thought, but this a multi, multibillion-dollar opportunity. As we've explained before, as we can close the gap between us and what a typical online travel agency generates in terms of revenue from these travelers, it's a huge win for us. The thing that's clearly been harder than -- or it's taken longer than we thought has been the changing of the consumer perception so that they do or they would open up the app or come right back to the website when they're ready to finally book versus go to where they're familiar with. But as we say, we see the green shoots, we see it happening, and we have projected it would happen sooner. But we like -- but we still like what we see, and we're very comfortable we're on the right path."

And right now, I think every time you look at the Instant Book offering and you don't see that it's at least as good a price as where you'd find elsewhere on the web, when you look at the room descriptions and the photos and you see that they're not quite as good as what you can find on other site, that's an opportunity for improvement that we have to do in order to win the conversion on that site. And I think if you look at the magical secrets of the other agencies selling hotels on the web, you'll find that attention to detail, making sure the consumer has the best possible price, the best selection of rooms, the content, the photos. And we are, in some part, dependent upon our partners, our OTA and our supplier direct partners for that. So having more partners on board, well implemented, will improve all of those things, including our meet/beat/lose rates. And to be clear, our meet/beat/lose rates have been improving over the past 12 months, and that's part of the reason why we've -- you've seen an uptick in conversion. But I think it will -- there's no one big thing we're missing, one big technology investment we're missing, but I think we would forecast out steady improvement in Instant Book because of the additional supply partners that we will continue to add for a long, long time. And I'd say for a long, long time in part because there's hundreds of thousands of independent hotels out there that want to be on our platform, that we would like to have on our platform, that we haven't gotten to yet."

The fourth phase is really about changing user perception. We have traditionally been seen by users as a site that is great as a starting point to go to review then to plan your trip. Increasingly, we are communicating to our users that we are also a great place to book. And that is taking time. That is a repositioning of the brand perception that we have.

As we continue to make our conversion improvements, that allows us to invest more in pay traffic acquisition. But frankly, we've also built a better product now, and so a lot of the wins that we've had over the past several -- over the past year in terms of conversion flow, in terms of having better pricing in Instant Book, in flexing the interface that we've talked about before, those all come down to enabling our travelers to be able to book better, and that allows us to invest more significantly in pay traffic acquisition. We're developing a better longer-term repeat user model, and we've never been shy about investing for the long term."

The -- if you look at our core TripAdvisor auction transaction and auction revenues, the U.S. actually sequentially improved quarter-to-quarter and throughout the quarter, both on revenue and revenue per shopper. And what we thought was a particularly good sign is that now in the third quarter as we cross the point where revenue per shopper and revenue in the U.S. was actually, first, neutral year-on-year and now, in the last months, positive year-on-year. So we thought that was a very good sign because at the end of August, we were lapping the -- a sizable rollout in the U.S. for IB last year, and we feel it's very good news for us that we see that positive momentum year-on-year. We saw that -- we saw it combined with conversion improvements in the U.S. We saw year-on-year conversion rate improvements on the desktop, IB, on meta. We saw very healthy meta auction dynamics. We saw very healthy IB dynamics. And this gives us a lot of hope that the U.S. now, we were lapping the full rollout of IB a year ago, is in increasingly good shape. You contrast that with outside of the U.S. -- and you see that the growth rates outside of the U.S. are still negative for revenue and revenue per shopper year-on-year as we are not lapping that rollout of IB yet, but we wanted to highlight in our prepared remarks that the U.S. is now in positive territory."

We've always believed, I've always maintained, that meta is an integral part of our value proposition. Travelers want to come to our site. They get the phenomenal content, the information, the trust, the community. And then travelers really wanted to know that they're getting the best price, and meta delivers on that best price. And if the client has a brand loyalty to an OTA or to a supplier direct, and they wish to book on that site, we were fine with that because meta enables that. If the user wants to book on TripAdvisor through Instant Book because we have great price and great content, then that would be a straightforward mechanism and arguably easier on the phone because it's less of a click away. But that when we look at being successful in the eyes of our travelers, it's did we help to find the property they wanted and did we help them book it at the best price, book it on TripAdvisor or book it on our partner sites through meta. So meta remains critical. I don't frankly ever foresee it going away, period, full stop. And then the delta is just, over the course of the next several years, where do our consumers choose to go. Do they choose to go into the IB flow because pricing and content and why not and they trust TripAdvisor, well that's fine? If they choose to go into the meta flow, we want to help them book, first and foremost. We obviously recognize that if they actually book on TripAdvisor, they're more likely to come back to TripAdvisor. So we have an inherent interest in that as a flow, but it will never come at the expense of meta going away, or at least I wouldn't predict -- ever predict that."

I do kind of reiterate a point Ernst was making, in that on the paid marketing side, when you go out looking for new traffic, you can get a combination of traffic that has not been to your site before, which is an increase in monthly hotel shoppers, or you can get traffic that has been to your site before and you're buying them back in remarketing fashion. Those remarketed shoppers aren't going to increase the total number of monthly hotel shoppers, but they are actually pretty important as we try to plug our leak. So for me, I look at the revenue per shopper and how well we are able to monetize the site a bit more than absolute percentage growth of hotel shoppers. It's just the way I look at it. We certainly -- when we look at the stats and you compare them against the competition, we have a lot of hotel shoppers. And several of the other travel categories are just able to monetize them a lot better than we are. To the second question, Priceline writing down OpenTable, well, we've -- OpenTable is certainly a terrific product, has tremendous market share in a number of the markets in which they operate.

And we were missing all of the easy bookings or all of the opportunity to be the app that someone opens when they're ready to book something. And so with Instant Book, we've addressed that. It's absolutely taken longer than we thought, but it's a multi, multibillion-dollar opportunity. As we've explained before, as we can close the gap between us and what a typical online travel agency generates in terms of revenue from these travelers, it's a huge win for us. The thing that's clearly been harder, that or if it's taken longer than we thought has been the change in the consumer perception so that they do or they would open up the app or come right back to the website when they're ready to finally book versus go to where they're familiar with.

And right now, I think every time you look at the Instant Book offering and you don't see that it's at least as good a price as where you'd find elsewhere on the web, when you look at the room descriptions and the photos and you see that they're not quite as good as what you can find on another site, that's an opportunity for improvement that we have to do in order to win the conversion on that site. And I think if you look at the magical secrets of the other agencies selling hotels on the web, you'll find that attention to detail, making sure the consumer has the best possible price, the best selection of rooms, the content, the photos. And we are, in some part, dependent upon our partners, our OTA and our supplier-direct partners for that.

So we thought that was a very good sign because at the end of August, we were lapping the -- a sizable rollout in the U.S. for IB last year, and we feel it's very good news for us that we see that positive momentum year-on-year. We saw that -- we saw it combined with conversion improvements in the U.S. We saw year-on-year conversion rate improvements on the desktop, IB, on meta. We saw very healthy meta auction dynamics. We saw very healthy IB dynamics. And this gives us a lot of hope that the U.S. now, we were lapping the full rollout of IB a year ago, is in increasingly good shape. You contrast that with outside of the U.S. -- and you see that the growth rates outside of the U.S. are still negative for revenue and revenue per shopper year-on-year as we are not lapping that rollout of IB yet, but we wanted to highlight in our prepared remarks that the U.S. is now in positive territory."

We've always believed, I've always maintained, that meta is an integral part of our value proposition. Travelers want to come to our site. They get the phenomenal content, the information, the trust, the community. And then travelers really wanted to know that they're getting the best price, and meta delivers on that best price. And if the client has a brand loyalty to an OTA or to a supplier direct, and they wish to book on that site, we were fine with that because meta enables that. If the user wants to book on TripAdvisor through Instant Book because we have great price and great content, then that would be a straightforward mechanism and arguably easier on the phone because it's less of a click away. But that when we look at being successful in the eyes of our travelers, it's did we help to find the property they wanted and did we help them book it at the best price, book it on TripAdvisor or book it on our partner sites through meta. So meta remains critical. I don't frankly ever foresee it going away, period, full stop. And then the delta is just, over the course of the next several years, where do our consumers choose to go. Do they choose to go into the IB flow because pricing and content and why not and they trust TripAdvisor, well that's fine? If they choose to go into the meta flow, we want to help them book, first and foremost. We obviously recognize that if they actually book on TripAdvisor, they're more likely to come back to TripAdvisor. So we have an inherent interest in that as a flow, but it will never come at the expense of meta going away, or at least I wouldn't predict -- ever predict that."

I do kind of reiterate a point Ernst was making, in that on the paid marketing side, when you go out looking for new traffic, you can get a combination of traffic that has not been to your site before, which is an increase in monthly hotel shoppers, or you can get traffic that has been to your site before and you're buying them back in remarketing fashion. Those remarketed shoppers aren't going to increase the total number of monthly hotel shoppers, but they are actually pretty important as we try to plug our leak. So for me, I look at the revenue per shopper and how well we are able to monetize the site a bit more than absolute percentage growth of hotel shoppers. It's just the way I look at it. We certainly -- when we look at the stats and you compare them against the competition, we have a lot of hotel shoppers. And several of the other travel categories are just able to monetize them a lot better than we are. To the second question, Priceline writing down OpenTable, well, we've -- OpenTable is certainly a terrific product, has tremendous market share in a number of the markets in which they operate.

As we've explained before, as we can close the gap between us and what a typical online travel agency generates in terms of revenue from these travelers, it's a huge win for us. The thing that's clearly been harder, that or if it's taken longer than we thought has been the change in the consumer perception so that they do or they would open up the app or come right back to the website when they're ready to finally book versus go to where they're familiar with.

And Booking.com and Agoda and Priceline brands in general have been really great partners for us on this. And so the percentage of bookings that an independent hotel, even a popular one in the United States, can provide just pales in comparison to what that partnership delivers for us day in, day out. So we don't share specifics, but I can tell you the folks with the biggest supply footprint in the most languages are clearly the ones that -- they get the most bookings."

And then looking at the Priceline, Expedia participation, it would seem that the international side seems to be where the gap is widening the most between the 2. How much of that is a function of Instant Book versus maybe some other factor that we're not seeing there?"

It remains a headwind. It's been that way for many, many years now as Google continues to put their kind of owned and operated placements ahead of what users are looking for in terms of the regular organic search results. We've grown accustomed to it and we're running our business accordingly. To the second question on sort of Priceline, I'd have to really defer it out to them in terms of whether our Instant Book could be having a bearing on their business, point out that they have a really big international business. So impact from us, we have no visibility or little visibility. So I can't really say."

So maybe more of a top line management dynamic there versus Phase 4, which is earning trust as the booking site of choice, which I think involves more marketing e-mail campaigns, push notifications, promotions, maybe call that more OpEx management. Is that a way to think about it? Does Phase 4 involve more granular degrees of adjustments and fine-tunings on the dials versus Phase 3? Is Phase 4 more real-time levers?

The way we think about the Phase 3 versus Phase 4 is Phase 3 is really about a lot of optimization of the product. And we're very focused on that at the moment, improving the conversion flow, improving how and when we market IB versus meta to make sure we have excellent improvement in meet/beat/lose, which we, by the way, are continuing to improve. We continue to improve the percentage where we have room prices in IB that at least meet the price in meta. So that's a very operational product-oriented focus that we have. The fourth phase is really about changing user perception. We have traditionally been seen by users as a site that is great as a starting point to go to review, then to plan your trip. Increasingly, we are communicating to our users that we are also a great place to book. And that is taking time. That is a repositioning of the brand perception that we have. So that's much more oriented towards how do we communicate that improved offer to our users, which is partly done on our site, and it's partly done by communicating with users that have been on our site before, more of a communication opportunity; Phase 3, more of an optimization -- product optimization opportunity."
