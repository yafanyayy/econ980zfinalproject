Mark is also with us for his last analyst call after a very successful career. Mark has been instrumental in helping cultivate the best employees in the industry. He has also been at the forefront of promoting safety programs as a critical component of a well-run business. Mark, thank you for your devoted service.
With Mike Miller's assumption of the Chief Operation Officer role on February 1, our senior leadership transition will be complete. Since last June, when I took the reins as CEO, Mike's team and I have been single-mindedly focus on shareholder value. We have responded to a dynamic marketplace and changes in the economic landscape by driving change while building on Norfolk Southern's strengths. In conjunction with our leadership transition, we have already completed many key initiatives while simultaneously launching a new 5-year plan centered on disciplined cost control and profitability to produce sustainable returns for shareholders. I'm eager to share details regarding our teams plan. But first, I want to briefly address the fourth quarter and full year results. 
2015 was marked by weak commodity markets and a strong dollar that had an adverse impact on Norfolk Southern and the railroad industry as a whole. Norfolk Southern's earnings for the fourth quarter were $1.20 per share, which was 27% lower than last year's $1.64 per share. Earnings for the full year were $5.10 per share, which was 20% lower than last year's record of $6.39. Alan, Mike and Marta will go to more detail on this shortly. It is against this challenging macroeconomic backdrop that our team has aggressively executed on a number of key initiatives to build a strong foundation are sustainable shareholder value creation. The core of our strategy is this, maintain a high level of service to promote operational efficiency and growth while rightsizing resources to reflect the changing nature of our top line. 
Here are just a few of the things my team and I have already done to further this strategy. First, we return service to previous high levels, supporting cost control, asset utilization and growth. Second, we took action on GNA. Closing and putting up for sale our office in Roanoke, Virginia while consolidating or relocating approximately 500 back-office jobs. We also streamlined senior management, eliminating 3 senior management positions. Third, we restructured an underperforming subsidiary, Triple Crown, to sharpen our intermodal strategy and boost profit. Fourth, we completed the acquisition of the Delaware and Hudson South, given us full operational control of an important network segment in the Northeast. The transaction has been well received by our customers. Fifth, we cut capital spending by $100 million last year to adapt to the shifting economic environment, and we are committed to reducing it further if necessary. And sixth, reacting to changes in our coal business. We completed an initial round of line rationalizations in the coalfields. The closure of a major coal terminal and the consolidation of 2 operating divisions in West Virginia and Virginia. 
Now let's turn next to the elements of our strategic plan, beginning on Slide 5. This plan began on June 1, 2015, when I became CEO, and announced on December 4, is the result of a comprehensive evaluation of our business model. In particular, our cost structure and top line growth potential. The plan is built on disciplined cost control and asset utilization. It is also designed to generate overtime, revenue growth through pricing and increased volume in service-sensitive markets where we have made significant investments and had a well-established market presence. The plan is dynamic, allowing us to evolve as required, given an ever-changing world. Overall, we expect to achieve annual productivity savings of more than $650 million by 2020, rolling from an initial $130 million in 2016 by improving the consistency and reliability of our service and running a faster more efficient railroad.
Turning to our revenue plan on Slide 7. While our expectations are modest for 2016, revenue growth from pricing and volume increases is one component of our strategic plan. We have been deliberate in our analysis, developing a detailed bottom-up roadmap to growth over the next 5 years. The plan is conservative and flexible in nature and gives us the ability to adjust to changes in the economy. 
Slide 8 shows that over the 5-year period, we expect revenue per unit to grow approximately 2.5% on a compound annual basis through 2020, supported by pricing levels, exceeding CPI. Consistent with our past experience, volume will grow relatively in line with GDP as growth in intermodal and other consumer-oriented products offsets coal headwinds.
Turning to Slide 9, I will now detail our expectations for each major revenue group. We expect coal volume to decline in 2016 and then stabilize. Overall, our coal forecast is more conservative than estimates from the Department of Energy and other independent experts. We believe growth in our merchandise lines of business will attract the economy overall, increasing generally in line with GDP. And we are calling for intermodal volume to increase at a rate better than GDP, with compound annual growth of about 4.5%. This will be driven primarily by tighter truck capacity and improved domestic service levels. It will also reflect our close alignment with international steamship lines that are adding capacity in Norfolk Southern's served markets as they shift from West Coast to East Coast ports.
Now turning to our expense reduction and cost control plan. As you see on Slide 11, our strategy is to provide industry-leading service to drive the operating ratio lower. We are committed to achieving a sub 65 OR by 2020, but we won't stop there. Once we achieve this initial goal, we intend to take our operating ratio even lower by focusing relentlessly on 4 things: headcount; locomotive productivity; fuel efficiency; and our network footprint, all while supporting quality service for our customers.
Moving to Slide 12. The current backdrop of low commodity prices and a strong U.S. dollar has created significant headwinds that affected 2015 results across our industry. Our plan will help offset some of these headwinds, actively managing to market dynamics both downside and upside in a timely manner. Right now, given current market dynamics, we are aggressively bringing down overtime, headcount and our locomotive fleet size. We are also pushing on fuel efficiency, closing or scaling back operations in yards and terminals and rationalizing secondary lines. All of this is being done so that we can achieve target levels of profitability while maintaining strong service and the potential for future growth. Even given challenging future market conditions, we believe we can achieve a sub 65 operating ratio by 2020. We have the right team and the right plan to address the current headwinds and deliver superior value as we move through 2016 and beyond.
With our improved service, we achieved a faster railroad. Specifically, year-over-year, we achieved a 17% improvement in train speed and a 21% improvement in terminal dwell. These improvements across our network will lower costs while enhancing our service offering and the value of our product. A faster railroad is, simply put, a more profitable railroad.
Turning to Slide 14. Our plan is designed to optimize resources and accelerate growth through a variety of disciplined expense control initiatives in compensation and benefits, purchase services and rents, materials and fuel. We expect to achieve annual expense savings over $650 million by 2020, growing from an initial $130 million in 2016. 
Starting with compensation and benefits. Service improvements, traffic shifts, network rationalizations and cutbacks in yards and terminals will enable Norfolk Southern to reduce headcount in 2016 and beyond, building on initiatives we begin in 2015 to right size the network. We expect this to result in annual productivity savings of $420 million by 2020.
Now to purchase services and rents. We're projecting annual savings of $70 million by 2020 through reduced equipment rental and lease costs; lower payments for third-party switching; leveraging the recent expansion of Yard in Bellevue, Ohio; and lower trackage rights and haulage payments. 
As you can see on Slide 15, we expect materials to deliver approximately $80 million in annual savings by 2020 through more productive locomotive maintenance programs and replacement of older, less reliable locomotives. 
And finally, Norfolk Southern plans to cut fuel expenses by approximately $80 million per year by 2020 through rationalization of our locomotive fleet and full implementation of fuel management technology. 
In conclusion, on Slide 16, we believe we have the right strategic plan to streamline operations, accelerate pricing and growth and enhance shareholder value. The plan leverages our core competency in providing fast efficient service while improving network efficiency and consolidating operations. Importantly, through disciplined cost control, we believe we can achieve the expense reduction goals outlined in this plan and even more. To be clear, if market conditions worsen more than anticipated, our plan has flexibility built into it so that we can achieve additional cost savings. 
We are also committed to a capital allocation strategy that returns significant capital to shareholders. Over the past 10 years, Norfolk Southern distributed nearly $15 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends that  increase steadily at a 17% compound annual rate. Our plan targets a dividend payout ratio of 33% over the longer term and share repurchases using free cash flow and borrowing capacity. I'll now turn the program over to Alan, Mike and Marta, who are just as committed as I am to successfully executing our plan. They will provide more details on our 2015 results and our 2016 outlook 
And I will then return with some closing comments before taking your questions. Alan?"

I would like to begin by expressing our commitment to the growth plan Jim just reviewed. It is a multidimensional, sustainable plan, with a focus on undifferentiated service product that the market values, driving pricing and volume growth while improving shareholder return. 
Moving to Slide 2, I'll provide some perspective on a our 2015 top line performance. Annual revenue of $10.5 billion declined 10% compared to 2014, with fuel surcharges and coal accounting for the decrease. Fuel losses of $852 million were the result of decreased oil prices. This negative comps will sharply decline in the first quarter as January 2015 was the last month West Texas Intermediate exceeded the average fuel surcharge trigger point. Overall, 2015 was a challenging year, with low commodity prices and strong U.S. dollar conditions, which consistently deteriorated each quarter and largely continued unabated. Despite this environment, we did experience upside revenue growth in our merchandise and intermodal markets, excluding fuel. We also posted record revenue in our agriculture franchise and record volume in both chemicals and intermodal. 
On Slide 3, our fourth quarter results were impacted by decreased fuel surcharges, low commodity prices, unseasonably warm weather and high retail inventories. Volume declined in all 3 of our major business segments. Reduced fuel surcharges and coal revenue combined for 84% of our overall revenue decline. Despite these challenges, positive pricing offset the negative mix impact of several commodities, driving sequential growth in RPU, less fuel, for each of the last 5 quarters. 
Moving to coal. Warm weather and lower natural gas prices resulted in declines in utility coal shipments. Export coal met our 3 million ton guidance for the quarter but continued to be challenged compared to prior year due to global oversupply and a strong U.S. dollar. Our first quarter target is 2.5 million to 3 million tons without it uncertainty in the market. Excluding fuel, RPU increased furcal this positive pricing and increased longer haul utility volume in the South.
Slide 5 depicts the record-high temperatures in our service area that impacted utility coal shipments later in the quarter. 
In the second and third quarters, our utility coal volumes met guidance and have settled into the low natural gas environment. Similar volume trends existed in October and November. However, the warm weather significantly decreased December deliveries. Stockpiles are 40 days above target, which we anticipate will reduce first quarter volume to 15 million tons. The inventory overhang is projected to continue into the second quarter. Once stockpiles return to target, we project utility volumes in the range of 17 million to 19 million tons per quarter, assuming normal weather patterns. 
As we turn to intermodal, we restructured our Triple Crown franchise effective November 2015, with business winding down earlier in the quarter as customers implemented alternative plans before the effective date. This equates to 4% in volume decline and 6% in revenue decline for intermodal. While the Triple Crown restructure will have a negative impact on both volume and revenue in 2016, it will be accretive to our bottom line and improve capital utilization. Excluding Triple Crown, intermodal fell 1% for the quarter. This decline can largely be attributed to increased truck capacity and high retail inventory levels. As the quarter progressed and service was restored to previous high levels, we experienced volume gains in some key accounts. These improvements will have a positive impact on our domestic franchise moving forward. Lastly, pricing gains throughout the year increased revenue per unit by 4% when excluding Triple Crown and fuel. Consistent improvement in contract pricing creates confidence that this trend will continue and is supportive of our growth plans. 
Our merchandise markets were impacted by low commodity prices, a strong dollar and high inventory levels reducing demand for metals, export grain, crude oil and lumber. On a positive note, automotive posted a 9% increase in the quarter, exceeding North American vehicle production growth. We also experienced strong growth and natural gas products as well as ethanol. Losses in higher rated commodities created a negative mix impact on RPU. However, strong pricing led to RPU less fuel growth of 2%.
And as volumes as reported to the AAR declined by 6.7% in the fourth quarter, in line with other Class 1s. Eliminating the impact of the Triple Crown restructuring, declined 5% during this period.
Concluding with our outlook. The impact of the warm weather on our coal franchise on certain commodity prices and continued high retail inventory levels create headwinds for volumes, particularly in the first quarter. Coal volumes will be impacted as utilities were down on high stockpiles. Commodity price declines and foreign exchange pressures will affect our merchandise franchise. Volumes in our intermodal franchise will be impacted by the Triple Crown restructuring. Although improved service and reach will benefit our conventional intermodal and automotive networks, pricing increases accelerated throughout 2015 with a strongest pricing in the fourth quarter, benefiting our top line through 2016. The impact of lower fuel surcharges will subside in early 2016, and we are actively converting to programs with less variability and greater alignment to expenses. Our longer-term objectives include the continued diversification of our traffic base, a key to maintaining a strong franchise. Service-sensitive business is Norfolk Southern's fastest-growing segment as evidenced by our automotive and intermodal franchises, which grew at a 7% CAGR, excluding Triple Crown, over the last 5 years. We have a best-in-class network, and with return to service levels, we expect volume growth in these markets, mitigating some risk associated with commodity-based products. Domestic intermodal benefited from our service products and increased regulations and the trucking industry. International intermodal will grow as a result of our network reach and our alignment with shipping partners, adding capacity on the East Coast. 
In conclusion, a balanced franchise, disciplined market-based pricing and an improved service product allows our management team to aggressively respond to a changing economic environment. We are confident that our pricing and volume growth plan developed in concert with operations for our customers and their specific service needs and the unique market opportunities presented by our network. Collectively, we managed this flexible plan to adjust resources as volume levels fluctuate to drive targeted financial results. 
Next, Mike will describe our improved service levels, which increased the value of our product and generate volume growth."
292268,305738500,921433,"Norfolk Southern Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Norfolk Southern Corporation","Executives","[indiscernible] substantial improvement will result to [indiscernible] in 2015. Today, we are taking the next step in strengthening our company from an operational and financial perspective. Let me begin with one of our core principles on Slide 2, which",792,"[indiscernible] substantial improvement will result to [indiscernible] in 2015. Today, we are taking the next step in strengthening our company from an operational and financial perspective. 
Let me begin with one of our core principles on Slide 2, which is involved in all of our decisions, safety. We achieved a 14% decline in reportable injuries, and even more importantly, a 19% reduction in serious injuries over 2014. We're proud of our position as an industry leader in safety and our commitment to safety will not waiver. 
Turning to service on Slide 3, another of our core principles. As laid out here, our composite service performance continued to improve throughout the fourth quarter. Importantly, the performance of this comprehensive metric remains strong into the first quarter of 2016. 
Positive changes underway. Our goal is to maintain this level of service, which we believe provides the optimal balance between delivering a high service product to our customers while running a low-cost operation. We are confident we can continue to provide this level of service as we implement our strategic plan to run a more efficient and more profitable railroad. On a recent service note, NS achieved our most successful  peak season ever  for our premium accounts with respect to on-time performance and total volume handle.
Looking to Slide 4. We continue to deliver significant improvement in our train speed and terminal dwell metrics, which are leading to improvements in our locomotive availability and efficiency of our car utilization. Specifically, year-over-year for the quarter, we achieved a 17% improvement in train speed and a 21% improvement in terminal dwell. As we've said before, a faster railroad is a less expensive and more profitable railroad. These improvements will translate directly to cost reductions, increased revenue and improved margins. And as a result, increased value for our stakeholders including better service for our customers.
[indiscernible] increased our focus on using our existing resources [indiscernible] for near our historic high service levels, we will continue to right size our resources, implementing [indiscernible] operating expense. During the fourth quarter [indiscernible] 24% and reduced [indiscernible] by 55% versus the same period in 2014. As Jim highlighted earlier, with the plan outlined today, we are projecting a $130 million in productivity savings from our better service and efficiency initiatives in 2016. The 5-year plan was developed by my team, and we are committed to delivering results. 
On Slide 6, we have continued the process of rightsizing our manpower to match the current environment. While the majority of these reductions have also taken the form of furloughs in the Transportation department, we have also taken steps within our Engineering, Mechanical and Network and Service Management departments. On the locomotive side, aided by both our high velocity and an industry-wide reduction in volumes, we are currently storing high road locomotives; and in addition, have removed units from our yard and local fleet. We did this through rightsizing against current volumes and fine-tuning our local operating plan. We are also progressing with our DC to AC rebuilds, which will allow us to replace our aging  Dash-9 locomotive fleet at a significant discount, purchasing new locomotives. We anticipate these reductions in our fleet to lead to our lower maintenance and repair costs while reducing future capital requirements and improving the reliability and fuel efficiency of our locomotive fleet.
As Jim outlined for you earlier on the call, and as you can see on Slide 7, we are also taking a disciplined approach to reducing our operating cost. We recently announced that we are combining our Pocahontas and Virginia divisions, which will reduce the number of operating divisions by close to 10% and will result in a reduction of division-level supervision and back office functions. We are also progressing with our plans to reduce from 3 operating regions to 2. We are adapting rapidly and consistently. We are also idling our , Ohio terminal and we'll concentrate our late call volumes at our Sandusky, Ohio coal terminal. We have, however, retained all our business as part of this move. As mentioned in our last earnings call, we are continuing to rationalize investment in coal routes in Central Appalachian. We are seizing operation on portions of our West Virginia secondary between Columbus, Ohio; and Charleston, West Virginia, which will result in a 250-mile reduction in maintained right of way. In all, we will rationalize our secondary line network by 1,000 miles this year and 1,500 miles by 2020. 
In closing, I want to emphasize that we are laser-focused on ensuring Norfolk Southern has the most efficient and appropriate operating plan, which will streamline operations while driving growth and profitability. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marta to walk you through the quarter's financials."

Slide 2 summarizes our operating results compared to last year's record-setting quarter. As Alan already discussed, revenues declined by $352 million or 12% as a result of lower fuel surcharge revenues and lowe",1112,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Slide 2 summarizes our operating results compared to last year's record-setting quarter. As Alan already discussed, revenues declined by $352 million or 12% as a result of lower fuel surcharge revenues and lower volumes. Operating expenses decreased by $103 million or 5%, aided by continued low fuel prices that's partially offset by restructuring cost. The net result was a $249 million or 28% reduction in income from railway operations and a 74.5 operating ratio for the quarter. Restructuring cost added 2 points to the operating ratio. As with the case in every quarter of 2015, fuel prices had a significant impact on our operating results, and so would summarize the net change on Slide 3. 
Taking a look at the top of this slide, the line graph reflects the comparative WTI prices for 2014 and 2015. As you would expect, the quarters with the biggest gap have the largest reduction in fuel revenue. Also note that we were below most of our WTI-based trigger points throughout 2015. Looking ahead to 2016, the forward curve production for WTI is well below our common trigger point of $64 per barrel. So the remaining on-highway diesel-based charges should correlate more closely with our fuel expense this year.
Now let's take a look at operating expenses. I'd like to pause here and note that our team has been aggressively seeking to reduce operating cost while maintaining a well-run, service-oriented railroad. We've taken specific actions to reduce costs in the near-term and will continue to reduce costs in a manner consistent with the 5-year plan Jim described earlier. 
In the fourth quarter, we decreased expenses by $103 million. Most of the decline was due to price, as I've just discussed, and we also had net reductions in purchase services and in compensation and benefits. These reductions were partially offset by increases in depreciation and in materials and other. Before we look at the specific expense line items, let's turn to an update on restructuring cost. 
Slide 5 summarizes the expenses, which are related to the significant downsizing of our Triple Crown operations and to the closure of our Roanoke regional offices. The net effect of these costs reduced fourth quarter results by $0.10 a share. As shown on the following slide, our restructuring efforts had a significant impact on depreciation expense, amounting to $37 million and resulting from the disposition of over 5,000 railroad units. The remaining $10 million increase is associated with the growth in our asset base.
Slide 7 breaks out the components of our change in fuel expense. We've already covered the price-related component and the consumption decline is related to the drop in traffic volume. As Mike has already explained, we expect our fuel efficiency metrics to improve in 2016. 
Slide 8 depicts purchase services and rents which were down $12 million or 3%, reflecting the November '15 cessation of service in most Triple Crown lanes. As you know, this door-to-door service includes a significant amount of and terminal operating cost, most of which went away after November 15 and accounted for an $18 million reduction, partially offsetting this decline were the aforementioned restructuring cost and somewhat higher equipment rents associated with the increasing automotive traffic. 
Looking ahead to 2016, we expect purchase service costs to decline due to the Triple Crown restructuring. 
Turning to Slide 9. We experienced a $12 million or 2% decrease in compensation cost. Lower incentive compensation of $41 million, combined with $13 million of reduced overtime, was partially offset by increased pay rates of $13 million, a labor agreement lump sum payment of $13 million and $4 million of severance costs associated with the restructuring.
In 2016, we expect continued reductions in overtime as well as a 4% decline in average headcount year-over-year. On the other side of the equation, we expect wage and medical cost inflation of about 3.5% and a more normalized level of incentive comp. As shown on slide 10, the materials and other category increased by $27 million or 12%. Casualty claims costs were $20 million higher due to favorable personnel intro development in the prior year, combined with case-specific accruals required in 2015.
Turning to income taxes on Slide 11. The effective rate for the quarter was significantly lower at 31.1% versus 35.3% in 2014. This was largely attributable to 3 factors: The passage of the Tax Extenders Act in late December, which extended certain tax credits; the completion of an IRS audit; and the effect of a state tax law change. 
Wrapping up our quarterly overview on Slide 12. Net income was $361 million, a decline of $150 million or 29% and diluted earnings per share were $1.20, down 27% compared with the prior year. As a reminder, restructuring cost lowered these costs by $31 million or $0.10 per share.
Turning our focus to the full year on Slide 13. Revenues were 10% lower than those in 2014 and expenses declined by 5%. But resulting income from railway operations of $2.9 billion was a 19% decline, which led to an increased operating ratio of 72.6 and a decrease in earnings per share to $5.10. Restructuring costs lowered these results by $58 million or $0.19 a share and added about 1 point to the operating ratio.
Slide 14 summarizes our full year cash flows. Cash from operations for the year were $2.9 billion, covering capital spending and producing almost $500 million in free cash flow. With respect to stockholders returns, we repurchased $1.1 billion of stock and paid over $700 million in dividend. 
In 2016, we plan to resume repurchases at a rate of about $200 million per quarter.
Moving onto this year's capital budget on Slide 15, we plan to decrease total spending to $2.1 billion. Similar effort to the renewed effort on aggressively managing our operating cost while also taking more disciplined approach to capital spending. We are prioritizing capital allocation to our core network and to projects that will fuel key areas of long-term growth. We believe this approach will enable the maintenance of high service levels, as Mike described, and support the areas where Norfolk Southern will grow in the long-term, thereby, maximizing our return on invested capital. As you can see from the pie on this slide, spending on our right of way, including roadway and infrastructure, is roughly in line with recent years. Whereas equipment spending is lower. We've reduced freight cost purchases but increased locomotive acquisitions, in keeping with the strategy Mike outlined relative to a younger fleet and lower maintenance cost. And with that, I thank you for your attention, and I'll turn the program back to Jim."

So with your plan to drive about 600 million to 650 million of productivity improvements in the next 5 years and CP's plan, which I would argue is backed up by management team as demonstrated the ability to do this in a very quick fashion, I think CP's plan is close to $1.2 billion over the same timeframe.

He has also been at the forefront of promoting safety programs as a critical component of a well-run business. Mark, thank you for your devoted service.
With Mike Wheeler's assumption of the Chief Operating Officer role on February 1, our senior leadership transition will be complete.
Since last June, when I took the reins as CEO, my team and I have been singlemindedly focused on shareholder value. We have responded to a dynamic marketplace and changes in the economic landscape by driving change while building on Norfolk Southern's strengths. In conjunction with our leadership transition, we have already completed many key initiatives while simultaneously launching a new 5-year plan centered on disciplined cost control and profitability to produce sustainable returns for shareholders. I'm eager to share details regarding our team's plan, but first, I want to briefly address the fourth quarter and full year results.
2015 was marked by weak commodity markets and a strong dollar that had an adverse impact on Norfolk Southern and the railroad industry as a whole. Norfolk Southern's earnings for the fourth quarter were $1.20 per share, which was 27% lower than last year's $1.64 per share. Earnings for the full year were $5.10 per share, which was 20% lower than last year's record of $6.39. Alan, Mike and Marta will go into more detail on this shortly.
It is against this challenging macroeconomic backdrop that our team has aggressively executed on a number of key initiatives to build a strong foundation for sustainable shareholder value creation. The core of our strategy is this: maintain a high level of service to promote operational efficiency and growth while rightsizing resources to reflect the changing nature of our top line. Here are just a few of the things my team and I have already done to further this strategy.
First, we return service to previous high levels, supporting cost control, asset utilization and growth. Second, we took action on G&A closing and putting up for sale our office building in Roanoke, Virginia while consolidating or relocating approximately 500 back-office jobs. We also streamlined senior management, eliminating 3 senior management positions. Third, we restructured an underperforming subsidiary, Triple Crown, to sharpen our intermodal strategy and boost profit. Fourth, we completed the acquisition of the Delaware & Hudson South, giving us full operational control of an important network segment in the Northeast. The transaction has been well received by our customers. Fifth, we cut capital spending by $100 million last year to adapt to the shifting economic environment, and we are committed to reducing it further if necessary. And sixth, reacting to changes in our coal business, we completed an initial round of line rationalizations in the coalfields, the closure of a major coal terminal and the consolidation of 2 operating divisions in West Virginia and Virginia.
Now let's turn next to the elements of our strategic plan, beginning on Slide 5. This plan, begun on June 1, 2015, when I became CEO, and announced on December 4, is the result of a comprehensive evaluation of our business model, in particular our cost structure and top line growth potential. The plan is built on disciplined cost control and asset utilization. It is also designed to generate, over time, revenue growth through pricing and increased volume in service-sensitive markets where we have made significant investments and had a well-established market presence. The plan is dynamic, allowing us to evolve as required given an ever-changing world. Overall, we expect to achieve annual productivity savings of more than $650 million by 2020, growing from an initial $130 million in 2016, by improving the consistency and reliability of our service; and running a faster, more efficient railroad.
Turning to our revenue plan on Slide 7. While our expectations are modest for 2016, revenue growth from pricing and volume increases is one component of our strategic plan. We have been deliberate in our analysis, developing a detailed bottom-up road map to growth over the next 5 years. The plan is conservative and flexible in nature and gives us the ability to adjust to changes in the economy. Slide 8 shows that, over the 5-year period, we expect revenue per unit to grow approximately 2.5% on a compound annual basis through 2020, supported by pricing levels exceeding CPI. Consistent with our past experience, volume will grow relatively in line with GDP as growth in intermodal and other consumer-oriented products offsets coal headwinds.
Turning to Slide 9, I will now detail our expectations for each major revenue group. We expect coal volume to decline in 2016 and then stabilize. Overall, our coal forecast is more conservative than estimates from the Department of Energy and other independent experts. We believe growth in our merchandise lines of business will track the economy overall, increasing generally in line with GDP. And we are calling for intermodal volume to increase at a rate better than GDP, with compound annual growth of about 4.5%. This will be driven primarily by tighter truck capacity and improved domestic service levels. It will also reflect our close alignment with international steamship lines that are adding capacity in Norfolk Southern's served markets as they shift from West Coast to East Coast ports.
Now turning to our expense reduction and cost-control plan. As you see on Slide 11, our strategy is to provide industry-leading service to drive the operating ratio lower. We are committed to achieving a sub-65% OR by 2020, but we won't stop there. Once we achieve this initial goal, we intend to take our operating ratio even lower by focusing relentlessly on 4 things: headcount, locomotive productivity, fuel efficiency and our network footprint, all while supporting quality service for our customers.
Moving to Slide 12. The current backdrop of low commodity prices and a strong U.S. dollar has created significant headwinds that affected 2015 results across our industry. Our plan will help offset some of these headwinds, actively managing to market dynamics both downside and upside in a timely manner. Right now, given current market dynamics, we are aggressively bringing down overtime, headcount and our locomotive fleet size. We are also pushing on fuel efficiency, closing or scaling back operations in yards and terminals and rationalizing secondary lines. All of this is being done so that we can achieve target levels of profitability while maintaining strong service and the potential for future growth. Even given challenging future market conditions, we believe we can achieve a sub-65% operating ratio by 2020. We have the right team and the right plan to address the current headwinds and deliver superior value as we move through 2016 and beyond.
With our improved service, we have achieved a faster railroad. Specifically, year-over-year, we achieved a 17% improvement in train speed and a 21% improvement in terminal dwell. These improvements across our network will lower costs while enhancing our service offering and the value of our product. A faster railroad is, simply put, a more profitable railroad.
Turning to Slide 14. Our plan is designed to optimize resources and accelerate growth through a variety of disciplined expense control initiatives in compensation and benefits, purchased services and rents, materials and fuel. We expect to achieve annual expense savings over $650 million by 2020, growing from an initial $130 million in 2016.
Starting with compensation and benefits. Service improvements, traffic shifts, network rationalizations and cutbacks in yards and terminals will enable Norfolk Southern to reduce headcount in 2016 and beyond, building on initiatives we began in 2015 to rightsize the network. We expect this to result in annual productivity savings of $420 million by 2020. Now to purchased services and rents, we're projecting annual savings of $70 million by 2020 through reduced equipment rental and lease costs; lower payments for third-party switching, leveraging the recent expansion of Moorman Yard in Bellevue, Ohio; and lower trackage rights and haulage payments.
As you can see on Slide 15, we expect materials to deliver approximately $80 million in annual savings by 2020 through more productive locomotive maintenance programs; and replacement of older, less-reliable locomotives. And finally, Norfolk Southern plans to cut fuel expenses by approximately $80 million per year by 2020 through rationalization of our locomotive fleet and full implementation of fuel management technology.
In conclusion, on Slide 16, we believe we have the right strategic plan to streamline operations, accelerate pricing and growth and enhance shareholder value. The plan leverages our core competency in providing fast, efficient service while improving network efficiency and consolidating operations. Importantly, through disciplined cost control, we believe we can achieve the expense reduction goals outlined in this plan and even more. To be clear: If market conditions worsen more than anticipated, our plan has flexibility built into it so that we can achieve additional cost savings.
We are also committed to a capital allocation strategy that returns significant capital to shareholders. Over the past 10 years, Norfolk Southern distributed nearly $15 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends that  increase steadily at a 17% compound annual rate. Our plan targets a dividend payout ratio of 33% over the longer term and share repurchases using free cash flow and borrowing capacity.
I'll now turn the program over to Alan, Mike and Marta, who are just as committed as I am to successfully executing our plan. They will provide more details on our 2015 results and our 2016 outlook. And I will then return with some closing comments before taking your questions. Alan?"

I would like to begin by expressing our commitment to the growth plan Jim just reviewed. It is a multidimensional, sustainable plan with a focus on a differentiated service product that the market values, driving pricing and volume growth while improving shareholder return.
Moving to Slide 2, I'll provide some perspective on our 2015 top line performance. Annual revenue of $10.5 billion declined 10% compared to 2014, with fuel surcharges and coal accounting for the decrease. Fuel losses of $852 million were the result of decreased oil prices. This negative comp will sharply decline in the first quarter, as January 2015 was the last month West Texas Intermediate exceeded the average fuel surcharge trigger point. Overall, 2015 was a challenging year with low commodity prices and strong U.S. dollar conditions, which consistently deteriorated each quarter and largely continued unabated. Despite this environment, we did experience upside revenue growth in our merchandise and intermodal markets, excluding fuel. We also posted record revenue in our agriculture franchise and record volume in both chemicals and intermodal.
On Slide 3. Our fourth quarter results were impacted by decreased fuel surcharges, low commodity prices, unseasonably warm weather and high retail inventories. Volume declined in all 3 of our major business segments. Reduced fuel surcharges and coal revenue combined for 84% of our overall revenue decline. Despite these challenges, positive pricing offset the negative mix impact of several commodities, driving sequential growth in RPU, less fuel, for each of the last 5 quarters.
Moving to coal. Warm weather and lower natural gas prices resulted in declines in utility coal shipments. Export coal met our 3 million ton guidance for the quarter but continued to be challenged compared to prior year due to global oversupply and a strong U.S. dollar. Our first quarter target is 2.5 million to 3 million tons, with the added uncertainty in the market. Excluding fuel, RPU increased for coal due to positive pricing and increased longer-haul utility volume in the South.
Slide 5 depicts the record-high temperatures in our service area that impacted utility coal shipments later in the quarter. In the second and third quarters, our utility coal volumes met guidance and had settled into the low natural gas environment. Similar volume trends existed in October and November. However, the warm weather significantly decreased December deliveries. Stockpiles are 40 days above target, which we anticipate will reduce first quarter volume to 15 million tons. The inventory overhang is projected to continue into the second quarter. Once stockpiles return to target, we project utility volumes in the range of 17 million to 19 million tons per quarter, assuming normal weather patterns.
As we turn to intermodal. We restructured our Triple Crown franchise effective November 2015, with business winding down earlier in the quarter as customers implemented alternative plans before the effective date. This equates to 4% in volume decline and 6% in revenue decline for intermodal. While the Triple Crown restructure will have a negative impact on both volume and revenue in 2016, it will be accretive to our bottom line and improve capital utilization. Excluding Triple Crown, intermodal fell 1% for the quarter. This decline can largely be attributed to increased truck capacity and high retail inventory levels. As the quarter progressed and service was restored to previous high levels, we experienced volume gains in some key accounts. These improvements will have a positive impact on our domestic franchise moving forward. Lastly, pricing gains throughout the year increased revenue per unit by 4% when excluding Triple Crown and fuel. Consistent improvement in contract pricing creates confidence that this trend will continue and is supportive of our growth plan.
Our merchandise markets were impacted by low commodity prices, a strong dollar and high inventory levels reducing demand for metals, export grain, crude oil and lumber. On a positive note, automotive posted a 9% increase in the quarter, exceeding North American vehicle production growth. We also experienced strong growth in natural gas products as well as ethanol. Losses in higher-rated commodities created a negative mix impact on RPU. However, strong pricing led to RPU, less fuel, growth of 2% and as volumes, as reported to the AAR, declined by 6.7% in the fourth quarter, in line with other Class 1s. Eliminating the impact of the Triple Crown restructuring, E&S [ph] volume declined 5% during this period.
Concluding with our outlook. The impact of the warm weather on our coal franchise and certain commodity prices and continued high retail inventory levels create headwinds for volumes, particularly in the first quarter. Coal volumes will be impacted as utilities work down the high stockpiles. Commodity price declines and foreign exchange pressures will affect our merchandise franchise. Volumes in our intermodal franchise will be impacted by the Triple Crown restructuring, although improved service and reach will benefit our conventional intermodal and automotive networks. Pricing increases accelerated throughout 2015, with the strongest pricing in the fourth quarter, benefiting our top line through 2016. The impact of lower fuel surcharges will subside in early 2016, and we are actively converting to programs with less variability and greater alignment to expenses. Our longer-term objectives include the continued diversification of our traffic base, a key to maintaining a strong franchise. Service-sensitive business is Norfolk Southern's fastest-growing segment, as evidenced by our automotive and intermodal franchises, which grew at a 7% CAGR, excluding Triple Crown, over the last 5 years. We have a best-in-class network. And with return to service levels, we expect volume growth in these markets mitigating some risks associated with commodity-based products. Domestic intermodal will benefit from our service product and increased regulations in the trucking industry. International intermodal will grow as a result of our network reach and our alignment with shipping partners adding capacity on the East Coast.
In conclusion, a balanced franchise; disciplined, market-based pricing; and an improved service product allows our management team to aggressively respond to a changing economic environment. We are confident in our pricing and volume growth plans developed in concert with operations for our customers and their specific service needs and the unique market opportunities presented by our network. Collectively, we manage this flexible plan to adjust resources, as volume levels fluctuate, to drive targeted financial results.
Next, Mike will describe our improved service levels, which increase the value of our product and generate volume growth."

Today, we are taking the next step in strengthening our company from an operational and financial perspective.
Let me begin with one of our core principles on Slide 2, which is involved in all of our decisions, safety. We achieved a 14% decline in reportable injuries; and even more importantly, a 19% reduction in serious injuries over 2014. We're proud of our position as an industry leader in safety, and our commitment to safety will not waiver.
Turning to service on Slide 3, another of our core principles. As laid out here, our composite service performance continued to improve throughout the fourth quarter. Importantly, the performance of this comprehensive metric remained strong into the first quarter of 2016. Positive change is underway. Our goal is to maintain this level of service, which we believe provides the optimal balance between delivering a high-service product to our customers while running a low-cost operation. We are confident we can continue to provide this level of service as we implement our strategic plan to run a more efficient and more profitable railroad. On a recent service node, NS achieved our most successful peak season ever for our premium accounts with respect to on-time performance and total volume handled.
Looking to Slide 4. We continue to deliver significant improvement in our train speed and terminal dwell metrics, which are leading to improvements in our locomotive availability and efficiency of our car utilization. Specifically, year-over-year for the quarter, we achieved a 17% improvement in train speed and a 21% improvement in terminal dwell. As we've said before, a faster railroad is a less-expensive and more profitable railroad. These improvements will translate directly into cost reductions, increased revenue and improved margins; and as a result, increased value for our stakeholders, including better service for our customers.
[indiscernible] increased our focus on using our existing resources [indiscernible] near our historic high service levels, we will continue to rightsize our resources, implementing [indiscernible] expense. During the fourth quarter, we reduced overtime hours [indiscernible] 24% and reduced recrews by 55% versus the same period in 2014. As Jim highlighted earlier, with the plan outlined today, we are projecting $130 million in productivity savings from our better service and efficiency initiatives in 2016. The 5-year plan was developed by my team, and we are committed to delivering results.
On Slide 6. We have continued the process of rightsizing our manpower to match the current environment. While the majority of these reductions have also taken the form of furloughs in the transportation department, we have also taken steps within our engineering, mechanical and network and service management departments. On the locomotive side, aided by both our high velocity and an industry-wide reduction in volumes, we are currently storing [indiscernible] road locomotives; and in addition, have removed units from our yard and local fleet. We did these through rightsizing against current volumes and fine-tuning our local operating plan. We are also progressing with our DC-to-AC rebuilds, which will allow us to replace our aging  Dash 9 locomotive fleet at a significant discount, purchasing new locomotives. We anticipate these reductions in our fleet to lead to lower maintenance and repair costs while reducing future capital requirements and improving the reliability and fuel efficiency of our locomotive fleet.
As Jim outlined for you earlier on the call and as you can see on Slide 7, we are also taking a disciplined approach to reducing our operating costs. We recently announced that we are combining our Pocahontas and Virginia divisions, which will reduce the number of operating divisions by close to 10% and will result in a reduction of division-level supervision and back-office functions. We are also progressing with our plans to reduce from 3 operating regions to 2. We are adapting rapidly and consistently. We are also idling our Ashtabula, Ohio coal terminal and will concentrate our late coal volumes at our Sandusky, Ohio coal terminal. We have, however, retained all the business as part of this move.
As mentioned in our last earnings call, we are continuing to rationalize investment in coal routes in Central Appalachia. We are ceasing operation on portions of our West Virginia Secondary between Columbus, Ohio and Charleston, West Virginia, which will result in a 250-mile reduction in maintained right of way. In all, we will rationalize our secondary line network by 1,000 miles this year and 1,500 miles by 2020.
In closing, I want to emphasize that we are laser focused on ensuring Norfolk Southern has the most efficient and appropriate operating plan which will streamline operations while driving growth and profitability.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marta to walk you through the quarter's financials."

And good morning, everyone.Slide 2 summarizes our operating results compared to last year's record-setting quarter. As Alan already discussed, revenues declined by $352 million or 12% as a result of lower fuel surcharge revenues and low",1114,"Thank you, Mike. And good morning, everyone.
Slide 2 summarizes our operating results compared to last year's record-setting quarter. As Alan already discussed, revenues declined by $352 million or 12% as a result of lower fuel surcharge revenues and lower volumes. Operating expenses decreased by $103 million or 5%, aided by continued low fuel prices but partially offset by restructuring costs. The net result was a $249 million or 28% reduction in income from railway operations and a 74.5% operating ratio for the quarter. Restructuring costs added 2 points to the operating ratio.
As was the case in every quarter of 2015, fuel prices had a significant impact on our operating results, and so we'd summarized the net change on Slide 3. Taking a look at the top of this slide: The line graphs reflect the comparative WTI prices for 2014 and 2015. As you would expect, the quarters with the biggest gap had the largest reduction in fuel revenue. Also note that we were below most of our WTI-based trigger points throughout 2015. Looking ahead to 2016, the forward curve projection for WTI is well below our most common trigger point of $64 barrel, so the remaining on-highway diesel-based surcharges should correlate more closely with our fuel expense this year.
Now let's take a look at operating expenses. I'd like to pause here and note that our teams have been aggressively seeking to reduce operating costs while maintaining a well-run, service-oriented railroad. We've taken specific actions to reduce costs in the near-term and will continue to reduce costs in a manner consistent with the 5-year plan Jim described earlier. In the fourth quarter, we decreased expenses by $103 million. Most of the decline was due to price, as I just discussed, and we also had net reductions in purchased services and in compensation and benefits. These reductions were partially offset by increases in depreciation and in materials and other.
Before we look at the specific expense line items, let's turn to an update on restructuring costs. Slide 5 summarizes the expenses which are related to the significant downsizing of our Triple Crown operations and to the closure of our Roanoke regional offices. The net effect of these costs reduced fourth quarter results by $0.10 a share. As shown on the following slide, our restructuring efforts had a significant impact on depreciation expense, amounting to $37 million and resulting from the disposition of over 5,000 RoadRailer units. The remaining $10 million increase is associated with the growth in our asset base.
Slide 7 breaks out the components of our change in fuel expense. We've already covered the price-related component, and the consumption decline is related to the drop in traffic volume. As Mike has already explained, we expect our fuel efficiency metrics to improve in 2016.
Slide 8 depicts purchased services and rents, which were down $12 million or 3%, reflecting the November 15 cessation of service in most Triple Crown lanes. As you know, this door-to-door service includes a significant amount of drayage and terminal operating costs, most of which went away after November 15, and accounted for an $18 million reduction. Partially offsetting this decline were the aforementioned restructuring costs and somewhat higher equipment rents associated with the increasing automotive traffic. Looking ahead to 2016, we expect purchased service costs to decline due to the Triple Crown restructuring.
Turning to Slide 9. We experienced a $12 million or 2% decrease in compensation costs. Lower incentive compensation of $41 million, combined with $13 million of reduced overtime, was partially offset by increased pay rates of $13 million, a labor agreement lump-sum payment of $13 million and $4 million of severance costs associated with the restructuring. In 2016, we expect continued reductions in overtime as well as a 4% decline in average headcount year-over-year. On the other side of the equation, we expect wage and medical cost inflation of about 3.5% and a more normalized level of incentive comp.
As shown on Slide 10, the materials and other category increased by $27 million or 12%. Casualty claims costs were $20 million higher due to favorable personal injury development in the prior year, combined with case-specific accruals required in 2015.
Turning to income taxes on Slide 11. The effective rate for the quarter was significantly lower at 31.1% versus 35.3% in 2014. This was largely attributable to 3 factors: the passage of the tax extenders act in late December, which extended certain tax credits; the completion of an IRS audit; and the effect of a state tax law change.
Wrapping up our quarterly overview on Slide 12. Net income was $361 million, a decline of $150 million or 29%. And diluted earnings per share were $1.20, down 27% compared with the prior year. As a reminder, restructuring costs lowered these results by $31 million or $0.10 per share.
Turning our focus to the full year on Slide 13. Revenues were 10% lower than those in 2014 and expenses declined by 5%, but resulting income from railway operations of $2.9 billion was a 19% decline, which led to an increased operating ratio of 72.6% and a decrease in earnings per share to $5.10. Restructuring costs lowered these results by $58 million or $0.19 a share and added about a point to the operating ratio.
Slide 14 summarizes our full year cash flows. Cash from operations for the year was $2.9 billion, covering capital spending and producing almost $500 million in free cash flow. With respect to stockholders' returns, we repurchased $1.1 billion of stock and paid over $700 million in dividends. In 2016, we plan to resume repurchases at a rate of about $200 million per quarter.
Moving on to this year's capital budget on Slide 15. We plan to decrease total spending to $2.1 billion. Similar to the renewed effort on aggressively managing our operating costs, we're also taking a more disciplined approach to capital spending. We are prioritizing capital allocation to our core network and to projects that will fuel key areas of long-term growth. We believe this approach will enable the maintenance of high service levels, as Mike described; and support the areas where Norfolk Southern will grow in the long term, thereby maximizing our return on invested capital. As you can see from the pie on this slide, spending on our right of way, including roadway and infrastructure, is roughly in line with recent years, whereas equipment spending is lower. We've reduced freight car purchases but increased locomotive acquisitions in keeping with the strategy Mike outlined relative to a younger fleet and lower maintenance costs.
And with that, I thank you for your attention. And I'll turn the program back to Jim."

Our improved service product is going to direct more of that business back to our lines in our -- the domestic sector as we move into the second half of the year. We have a lot of strength in our international franchise, and once retail inventory levels are normalized, that'll pick up. And we have strengthened our automotive franchise. So we do have some franchises that have opportunities for growth. We had a record volume in chemicals last year, and we had record volume in intermodal, too, despite the Triple Crown restructuring. Also note that Triple Crown will have a negative impact on volume comps, particularly for the first 3 quarters of the year. But we do feel that as we progress through the year and as we take advantage of our service product and as inventory levels, whether in retail or in coal, normalize, we're going to start to see significant improvement."

So I guess, in that context, I just want to respectfully ask. We've heard from these plans from Norfolk over the years that you guys always target peer margins, but we now have Canadian National, Canadian Pacific, Union Pacific all in the low 60s even cleaned up for the currency benefits of North. And we're still struggling with the coal guidance. I think there was a question earlier about how do you get to a negative 1% CAGR when you're guiding 15% down this year. Clearly, 4Q was pretty challenging here even after you take out the restructuring charges, and I don't think that we would argue that any of those big railroads that are running at a low 60s OR right now are in some sort of unsustainable or less safe operating conditions than they were when they were running back in the 80s or even 90s OR. So with your plan to drive about $600 million to $650 million of productivity improvements in the next 5 years and CP's plan, which, I would argue, is backed up by a management team that's demonstrated the ability to do this in a very quick fashion, I think CP's plan is close to $1.2 billion over the same time frame. So what is it about your business that you feel CP does not understand that makes shareholders better off with $650 million of improvement versus a low 60s OR and a $1.2 billion improvement plan?"

He has also been at the forefront of promoting safety programs as a critical component of a well-run business. Mark, thank you for your devoted service.
With Mike Wheeler's assumption of the Chief Operating Officer role on February 1, our senior leadership transition will be complete.
Since last June, when I took the reins as CEO, my team and I have been single-mindedly focused on shareholder value. We have responded to a dynamic marketplace and changes in the economic landscape by driving change while building on Norfolk Southern's strengths. In conjunction with our leadership transition, we have already completed many key initiatives while simultaneously launching a new 5-year plan centered on disciplined cost control and profitability to produce sustainable returns for shareholders. I'm eager to share details regarding our team's plan, but first, I want to briefly address the fourth quarter and full year results.
2015 was marked by weak commodity markets and a strong dollar that had an adverse impact on Norfolk Southern and the railroad industry as a whole. Norfolk Southern's earnings for the fourth quarter were $1.20 per share, which was 27% lower than last year's $1.64 per share. Earnings for the full year were $5.10 per share, which was 20% lower than last year's record of $6.39. Alan, Mike and Marta will go into more detail on this shortly.
It is against this challenging macroeconomic backdrop that our team has aggressively executed on a number of key initiatives to build a strong foundation for sustainable shareholder value creation. The core of our strategy is this: maintain a high level of service to promote operational efficiency and growth while rightsizing resources to reflect the changing nature of our top line. Here are just a few of the things my team and I have already done to further this strategy.
First, we returned service to previous high levels, supporting cost control, asset utilization and growth. Second, we took action on G&A closing and putting up for sale our office building in Roanoke, Virginia while consolidating or relocating approximately 500 back-office jobs. We also streamlined senior management, eliminating 3 senior management positions. Third, we restructured an underperforming subsidiary, Triple Crown, to sharpen our intermodal strategy and boost profit. 
Fourth, we completed the acquisition of the Delaware & Hudson South, giving us full operational control of an important network segment in the Northeast. The transaction has been well received by our customers. Fifth, we cut capital spending by $100 million last year to adapt to the shifting economic environment, and we are committed to reducing it further if necessary. And sixth, reacting to changes in our coal business, we completed an initial round of line rationalizations in the coalfields, the closure of a major coal terminal and the consolidation of 2 operating divisions in West Virginia and Virginia.
Now let's turn next to the elements of our strategic plan, beginning on Slide 5. This plan, begun on June 1, 2015, when I became CEO, and announced on December 4, is the result of a comprehensive evaluation of our business model, in particular our cost structure and top line growth potential. The plan is built on disciplined cost control and asset utilization. It is also designed to generate, over time, revenue growth through pricing and increased volume in service-sensitive markets where we have made significant investments and had a well-established market presence. The plan is dynamic, allowing us to evolve as required given an ever-changing world. Overall, we expect to achieve annual productivity savings of more than $650 million by 2020, growing from an initial $130 million in 2016, by improving the consistency and reliability of our service; and running a faster, more efficient railroad.
Turning to our revenue plan on Slide 7. While our expectations are modest for 2016, revenue growth from pricing and volume increases is one component of our strategic plan. We have been deliberate in our analysis, developing a detailed bottom-up road map to growth over the next 5 years. The plan is conservative and flexible in nature and gives us the ability to adjust to changes in the economy. Slide 8 shows that, over the 5-year period, we expect revenue per unit to grow approximately 2.5% on a compound annual basis through 2020, supported by pricing levels exceeding CPI. Consistent with our past experience, volume will grow relatively in line with GDP as growth in intermodal and other consumer-oriented products offsets coal headwinds.
Turning to Slide 9, I will now detail our expectations for each major revenue group. We expect coal volume to decline in 2016 and then stabilize. Overall, our coal forecast is more conservative than estimates from the Department of Energy and other independent experts. We believe growth in our merchandise lines of business will track the economy overall, increasing generally in line with GDP. And we are calling for intermodal volume to increase at a rate better than GDP, with compound annual growth of about 4.5%. This will be driven primarily by tighter truck capacity and improved domestic service levels. It will also reflect our close alignment with international steamship lines that are adding capacity in Norfolk Southern's served markets as they shift from West Coast to East Coast ports.
Now turning to our expense reduction and cost-control plan. As you see on Slide 11, our strategy is to provide industry-leading service to drive the operating ratio lower. We are committed to achieving a sub-65% OR by 2020, but we won't stop there. Once we achieve this initial goal, we intend to take our operating ratio even lower by focusing relentlessly on 4 things: headcount, locomotive productivity, fuel efficiency and our network footprint, all while supporting quality service for our customers.
Moving to Slide 12. The current backdrop of low commodity prices and a strong U.S. dollar has created significant headwinds that affected 2015 results across our industry. Our plan will help offset some of these headwinds, actively managing to market dynamics both downside and upside in a timely manner. Right now, given current market dynamics, we are aggressively bringing down overtime, headcount and our locomotive fleet size. We are also pushing on fuel efficiency, closing or scaling back operations in yards and terminals and rationalizing secondary lines. All of this is being done so that we can achieve target levels of profitability while maintaining strong service and the potential for future growth. Even given challenging future market conditions, we believe we can achieve a sub-65% operating ratio by 2020. We have the right team and the right plan to address the current headwinds and deliver superior value as we move through 2016 and beyond.
With our improved service, we have achieved a faster railroad. Specifically, year-over-year, we achieved a 17% improvement in train speed and a 21% improvement in terminal dwell. These improvements across our network will lower costs while enhancing our service offering and the value of our product. A faster railroad is, simply put, a more profitable railroad.
Turning to Slide 14. Our plan is designed to optimize resources and accelerate growth through a variety of disciplined expense control initiatives in compensation and benefits, purchased services and rents, materials and fuel. We expect to achieve annual expense savings over $650 million by 2020, growing from an initial $130 million in 2016.
Starting with compensation and benefits. Service improvements, traffic shifts, network rationalizations and cutbacks in yards and terminals will enable Norfolk Southern to reduce headcount in 2016 and beyond, building on initiatives we began in 2015 to rightsize the network. We expect this to result in annual productivity savings of $420 million by 2020. Now to purchased services and rents, we're projecting annual savings of $70 million by 2020 through reduced equipment rental and lease costs; lower payments for third-party switching, leveraging the recent expansion of Moorman Yard in Bellevue, Ohio; and lower trackage rights and haulage payments.
As you can see on Slide 15, we expect materials to deliver approximately $80 million in annual savings by 2020 through more productive locomotive maintenance programs; and replacement of older, less-reliable locomotives. And finally, Norfolk Southern plans to cut fuel expenses by approximately $80 million per year by 2020 through rationalization of our locomotive fleet and full implementation of fuel management technology.
In conclusion, on Slide 16, we believe we have the right strategic plan to streamline operations, accelerate pricing and growth and enhance shareholder value. The plan leverages our core competency in providing fast, efficient service while improving network efficiency and consolidating operations. Importantly, through disciplined cost control, we believe we can achieve the expense reduction goals outlined in this plan and even more. To be clear: If market conditions worsen more than anticipated, our plan has flexibility built into it so that we can achieve additional cost savings.
We are also committed to a capital allocation strategy that returns significant capital to shareholders. Over the past 10 years, Norfolk Southern distributed nearly $15 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends that increase steadily at a 17% compound annual rate. Our plan targets a dividend payout ratio of 33% over the longer term and share repurchases using free cash flow and borrowing capacity.
I'll now turn the program over to Alan, Mike and Marta, who are just as committed as I am to successfully executing our plan. They will provide more details on our 2015 results and our 2016 outlook. And I will then return with some closing comments before taking your questions. Alan?"

I would like to begin by expressing our commitment to the growth plan Jim just reviewed. It is a multidimensional, sustainable plan with a focus on a differentiated service product that the market values, driving pricing and volume growth while improving shareholder return.
Moving to Slide 2, I'll provide some perspective on our 2015 top line performance. Annual revenue of $10.5 billion declined 10% compared to 2014, with fuel surcharges and coal accounting for the decrease. Fuel losses of $852 million were the result of decreased oil prices. This negative comp will sharply decline in the first quarter, as January 2015 was the last month West Texas Intermediate exceeded the average fuel surcharge trigger point. Overall, 2015 was a challenging year with low commodity prices and strong U.S. dollar conditions, which consistently deteriorated each quarter and largely continued unabated. Despite this environment, we did experience upside revenue growth in our merchandise and intermodal markets, excluding fuel. We also posted record revenue in our agriculture franchise and record volume in both chemicals and intermodal.
On Slide 3. Our fourth quarter results were impacted by decreased fuel surcharges, low commodity prices, unseasonably warm weather and high retail inventories. Volume declined in all 3 of our major business segments. Reduced fuel surcharges and coal revenue combined for 84% of our overall revenue decline. Despite these challenges, positive pricing offset the negative mix impact of several commodities, driving sequential growth in RPU, less fuel, for each of the last 5 quarters.
Moving to coal. Warm weather and lower natural gas prices resulted in declines in utility coal shipments. Export coal met our 3 million ton guidance for the quarter but continued to be challenged compared to prior year due to global oversupply and a strong U.S. dollar. Our first quarter target is 2.5 million to 3 million tons, with the added uncertainty in the market. Excluding fuel, RPU increased for coal due to positive pricing and increased longer-haul utility volume in the South.
Slide 5 depicts the record-high temperatures in our service area that impacted utility coal shipments later in the quarter. In the second and third quarters, our utility coal volumes met guidance and had settled into the low natural gas environment. Similar volume trends existed in October and November. However, the warm weather significantly decreased December deliveries. Stockpiles are 40 days above target, which we anticipate will reduce first quarter volume to 15 million tons. The inventory overhang is projected to continue into the second quarter. Once stockpiles return to target, we project utility volumes in the range of 17 million to 19 million tons per quarter, assuming normal weather patterns.
As we turn to intermodal. We restructured our Triple Crown franchise effective November 15 [ph], with business winding down earlier in the quarter as customers implemented alternative plans before the effective date. This equates to 4% in volume decline and 6% in revenue decline for intermodal. While the Triple Crown restructure will have a negative impact on both volume and revenue in 2016, it will be accretive to our bottom line and improve capital utilization. Excluding Triple Crown, intermodal fell 1% for the quarter. This decline can largely be attributed to increased truck capacity and high retail inventory levels. As the quarter progressed and service was restored to previous high levels, we experienced volume gains in some key accounts. These improvements will have a positive impact on our domestic franchise moving forward. Lastly, pricing gains throughout the year increased revenue per unit by 4% when excluding Triple Crown and fuel. Consistent improvement in contract pricing creates confidence that this trend will continue and is supportive of our growth plan.
Our merchandise markets were impacted by low commodity prices, a strong dollar and high inventory levels reducing demand for metals, export grain, crude oil and lumber. On a positive note, automotive posted a 9% increase in the quarter, exceeding North American vehicle production growth. We also experienced strong growth in natural gas products as well as ethanol. Losses in higher-rated commodities created a negative mix impact on RPU. However, strong pricing led to RPU, less fuel, growth of 2%. NS volumes, as reported to the AAR, declined by 6.7% in the fourth quarter, in line with other Class 1s. Eliminating the impact of the Triple Crown restructuring, NS volume declined 5% during this period.
Concluding with our outlook. The impact of the warm weather on our coal franchise, uncertain commodity prices and continued high retail inventory levels create headwinds for volumes, particularly in the first quarter. Coal volumes will be impacted as utilities work down the high stockpiles. Commodity price declines and foreign exchange pressures will affect our merchandise franchise. Volumes in our intermodal franchise will be impacted by the Triple Crown restructuring, although improved service and reach will benefit our conventional intermodal and automotive networks. Pricing increases accelerated throughout 2015, with the strongest pricing in the fourth quarter, benefiting our top line through 2016. 
The impact of lower fuel surcharges will subside in early 2016, and we are actively converting to programs with less variability and greater alignment to expenses. Our longer-term objectives include the continued diversification of our traffic base, a key to maintaining a strong franchise. Service-sensitive business is Norfolk Southern's fastest-growing segment, as evidenced by our automotive and intermodal franchises, which grew at a 7% CAGR, excluding Triple Crown, over the last 5 years. We have a best-in-class network. And with return to service levels, we expect volume growth in these markets mitigating some risks associated with commodity-based products. Domestic intermodal will benefit from our service product and increased regulations in the trucking industry. International intermodal will grow as a result of our network reach and our alignment with shipping partners adding capacity on the East Coast.
In conclusion, a balanced franchise; disciplined, market-based pricing; and an improved service product allows our management team to aggressively respond to a changing economic environment. We are confident that our pricing and volume growth plans developed in concert with operations for our customers and their specific service needs and the unique market opportunities presented by our network. Collectively, we manage this flexible plan to adjust resources, as volume levels fluctuate, to drive targeted financial results.
Next, Mike will describe our improved service levels, which increase the value of our product and generate volume growth."

Today, we are taking the next step in strengthening our company from an operational and financial perspective.
Let me begin with one of our core principles on Slide 2, which is involved in all of our decisions, safety. We achieved a 14% decline in reportable injuries; and even more importantly, a 19% reduction in serious injuries over 2014. We're proud of our position as an industry leader in safety, and our commitment to safety will not waiver.
Turning to service on Slide 3, another of our core principles. As laid out here, our composite service performance continued to improve throughout the fourth quarter. Importantly, the performance of this comprehensive metric remained strong into the first quarter of 2016. Positive change is underway. Our goal is to maintain this level of service, which we believe provides the optimal balance between delivering a high-service product to our customers while running a low-cost operation. We are confident we can continue to provide this level of service as we implement our strategic plan to run a more efficient and more profitable railroad. On a recent service note, NS achieved our most successful peak season ever for our premium accounts with respect to on-time performance and total volume handled.
Looking to Slide 4. We continue to deliver significant improvement in our train speed and terminal dwell metrics, which are leading to improvements in our locomotive availability and efficiency of our car utilization. Specifically, year-over-year for the quarter, we achieved a 17% improvement in train speed and a 21% improvement in terminal dwell. As we've said before, a faster railroad is a less-expensive and more profitable railroad. These improvements will translate directly into cost reductions, increased revenue and improved margins; and as a result, increased value for our stakeholders, including better service for our customers.
[indiscernible] increased our focus on using our existing resources [indiscernible] near our historic high service levels, we will continue to rightsize our resources, implementing [indiscernible] and operating [ph] expense. During the fourth quarter, we reduced overtime hours by 24% and reduced recrews by 55% versus the same period in 2014. As Jim highlighted earlier, with the plan outlined today, we are projecting $130 million in productivity savings from our better service and efficiency initiatives in 2016. The 5-year plan was developed by my team, and we are committed to delivering results.
On Slide 6. We have continued the process of rightsizing our manpower to match the current environment. While the majority of these reductions have also taken the form of furloughs in the transportation department, we have also taken steps within our engineering, mechanical and network and service management departments. On the locomotive side, aided by both our high velocity and an industry-wide reduction in volumes, we are currently storing high heat gen [ph] road locomotives; and in addition, have removed units from our yard and local fleet. We did this through rightsizing against current volumes and fine-tuning our local operating plan. We are also progressing with our DC-to-AC rebuilds, which will allow us to replace our aging Dash 9 locomotive fleet at a significant discount to purchasing new locomotives. We anticipate these reductions in our fleet to lead to lower maintenance and repair costs while reducing future capital requirements and improving the reliability and fuel efficiency of our locomotive fleet.
As Jim outlined for you earlier on the call and as you can see on Slide 7, we are also taking a disciplined approach to reducing our operating costs. We recently announced that we are combining our Pocahontas and Virginia divisions, which will reduce the number of operating divisions by close to 10% and will result in a reduction of division-level supervision and back-office functions. We are also progressing with our plans to reduce from 3 operating regions to 2. We are adapting rapidly and consistently. We are also idling our Ashtabula, Ohio coal terminal and will concentrate our late coal volumes at our Sandusky, Ohio coal terminal. We have, however, retained all the business as part of this move.
As mentioned in our last earnings call, we are continuing to rationalize investment in coal routes in Central Appalachia. We are ceasing operation on portions of our West Virginia Secondary between Columbus, Ohio and Charleston, West Virginia, which will result in a 250-mile reduction in maintained right of way. In all, we will rationalize our secondary line network by 1,000 miles this year and 1,500 miles by 2020.
In closing, I want to emphasize that we are laser focused on ensuring Norfolk Southern has the most efficient and appropriate operating plan which will streamline operations while driving growth and profitability.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marta to walk you through the quarter's financials."

And good morning, everyone.Slide 2 summarizes our operating results compared to last year's record-setting quarter. As Alan already discussed, revenues declined by $352 million or 12% as a result of lower fuel surcharge revenues and low",1114,"Thank you, Mike. And good morning, everyone.
Slide 2 summarizes our operating results compared to last year's record-setting quarter. As Alan already discussed, revenues declined by $352 million or 12% as a result of lower fuel surcharge revenues and lower volumes. Operating expenses decreased by $103 million or 5%, aided by continued low fuel prices but partially offset by restructuring costs. The net result was a $249 million or 28% reduction in income from railway operations and a 74.5% operating ratio for the quarter. Restructuring costs added 2 points to the operating ratio.
As was the case in every quarter of 2015, fuel prices had a significant impact on our operating results, and so we'd summarized the net change on Slide 3. Taking a look at the top of this slide: The line graphs reflect the comparative WTI prices for 2014 and 2015. As you would expect, the quarters with the biggest gap had the largest reduction in fuel revenue. Also note that we were below most of our WTI-based trigger points throughout 2015. Looking ahead to 2016, the forward curve projection for WTI is well below our most common trigger point of $64 barrel, so the remaining on-highway diesel-based surcharges should correlate more closely with our fuel expense this year.
Now let's take a look at operating expenses. I'd like to pause here and note that our teams have been aggressively seeking to reduce operating costs while maintaining a well-run, service-oriented railroad. We've taken specific actions to reduce costs in the near-term and will continue to reduce costs in a manner consistent with the 5-year plan Jim described earlier. In the fourth quarter, we decreased expenses by $103 million. Most of the decline was due to price, as I just discussed, and we also had net reductions in purchased services and in compensation and benefits. These reductions were partially offset by increases in depreciation and in materials and other.
Before we look at the specific expense line items, let's turn to an update on restructuring costs. Slide 5 summarizes the expenses which are related to the significant downsizing of our Triple Crown operations and to the closure of our Roanoke regional offices. The net effect of these costs reduced fourth quarter results by $0.10 a share. As shown on the following slide, our restructuring efforts had a significant impact on depreciation expense, amounting to $37 million and resulting from the disposition of over 5,000 RoadRailer units. The remaining $10 million increase is associated with the growth in our asset base.
Slide 7 breaks out the components of our change in fuel expense. We've already covered the price-related component, and the consumption decline is related to the drop in traffic volume. As Mike has already explained, we expect our fuel efficiency metrics to improve in 2016.
Slide 8 depicts purchased services and rents, which were down $12 million or 3%, reflecting the November 15 cessation of service in most Triple Crown lanes. As you know, this door-to-door service includes a significant amount of drayage and terminal operating costs, most of which went away after November 15, and accounted for an $18 million reduction. Partially offsetting this decline were the aforementioned restructuring costs and somewhat higher equipment rents associated with the increasing automotive traffic. Looking ahead to 2016, we expect purchased service costs to decline due to the Triple Crown restructuring.
Turning to Slide 9. We experienced a $12 million or 2% decrease in compensation costs. Lower incentive compensation of $41 million, combined with $13 million of reduced overtime, was partially offset by increased pay rates of $13 million, a labor agreement lump-sum payment of $13 million and $4 million of severance costs associated with the restructuring. In 2016, we expect continued reductions in overtime as well as a 4% decline in average headcount year-over-year. On the other side of the equation, we expect wage and medical cost inflation of about 3.5% and a more normalized level of incentive comp.
As shown on Slide 10, the materials and other category increased by $27 million or 12%. Casualty claims costs were $20 million higher due to favorable personal injury development in the prior year, combined with case-specific accruals required in 2015.
Turning to income taxes on Slide 11. The effective rate for the quarter was significantly lower at 31.1% versus 35.3% in 2014. This was largely attributable to 3 factors: the passage of the tax extenders act in late December, which extended certain tax credits; the completion of an IRS audit; and the effect of a state tax law change.
Wrapping up our quarterly overview on Slide 12. Net income was $361 million, a decline of $150 million or 29%. And diluted earnings per share were $1.20, down 27% compared with the prior year. As a reminder, restructuring costs lowered these results by $31 million or $0.10 per share.
Turning our focus to the full year on Slide 13. Revenues were 10% lower than those in 2014 and expenses declined by 5%, but resulting income from railway operations of $2.9 billion was a 19% decline, which led to an increased operating ratio of 72.6% and a decrease in earnings per share to $5.10. Restructuring costs lowered these results by $58 million or $0.19 a share and added about a point to the operating ratio.
Slide 14 summarizes our full year cash flows. Cash from operations for the year was $2.9 billion, covering capital spending and producing almost $500 million in free cash flow. With respect to stockholders' returns, we repurchased $1.1 billion of stock and paid over $700 million in dividends. In 2016, we plan to resume repurchases at a rate of about $200 million per quarter.
Moving on to this year's capital budget on Slide 15. We plan to decrease total spending to $2.1 billion. Similar to the renewed effort on aggressively managing our operating costs, we're also taking a more disciplined approach to capital spending. We are prioritizing capital allocation to our core network and to projects that will fuel key areas of long-term growth. We believe this approach will enable the maintenance of high service levels, as Mike described; and support the areas where Norfolk Southern will grow in the long term, thereby maximizing our return on invested capital. As you can see from the pie on this slide, spending on our right of way, including roadway and infrastructure, is roughly in line with recent years, whereas equipment spending is lower. We've reduced freight car purchases but increased locomotive acquisitions in keeping with the strategy Mike outlined relative to a younger fleet and lower maintenance costs.
And with that, I thank you for your attention. And I'll turn the program back to Jim."

So I guess, in that context, I just want to respectfully ask. We've heard from these plans from Norfolk over the years that you guys always target peer margins, but we now have Canadian National, Canadian Pacific, Union Pacific all in the low 60s even cleaned up for the currency benefits of North. And we're still struggling with the coal guidance. I think there was a question earlier about how do you get to a negative 1% CAGR when you're guiding 15% down this year. Clearly, 4Q was pretty challenging here even after you take out the restructuring charges, and I don't think that we would argue that any of those big railroads that are running at a low 60s OR right now are in some sort of unsustainable or less safe operating conditions than they were when they were running back in the 80s or even 90s OR. So with your plan to drive about $600 million to $650 million of productivity improvements in the next 5 years and CP's plan, which, I would argue, is backed up by a management team that's demonstrated the ability to do this in a very quick fashion, I think CP's plan is close to $1.2 billion over the same time frame. So what is it about your business that you feel CP does not understand that makes shareholders better off with $650 million of improvement versus a low 60s OR and a $1.2 billion improvement plan?"

With me today are NS's Chief Marketing Officer, Alan Shaw; our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Wheeler; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart.
We'll share the details of our strong first quarter financial results with you momentarily, but let me begin by saying how proud I am of the men and women of Norfolk Southern who are so successfully executing our strategic plan. Their flexibility and initiative are driving shareholder value, even in the midst of a challenging and ever-changing marketplace.
Turning to our results on Slide 4. Our team delivered a record-setting first quarter operating ratio of 70.1%, 630 basis points lower than last year's first quarter. This performance was in the face of weak commodities, a strong dollar and coal volumes down 23%. Norfolk Southern's earnings for the first quarter were $1.29 per share, 29% higher than last year's dollar per share. Marta will go over the details shortly.
We were able to generate these results, thanks in large part to improved network performance. Mike will follow with an update on operations, but let me highlight here that our team increased the composite service measure by 23%, increased train speeds by 15% and reduced terminal dwell by 14%.
These strong improvements helped us control costs while enhancing the value of our product. Better service is, of course, a prerequisite to growth and a foundation of our strategy. It is what allowed us to grow in the first quarter in markets like automotive and intermodal even within a challenging macro environment. Furthermore, this focus on improved service helped to counterbalance weakness in commodities like coal and crude oil. Alan will share all the details of all our top line results in a moment.
With respect to our strategic plan, and as noted on Slide 5, our focus on strengthening Norfolk Southern is yielding results. We are now on track to achieve productivity savings of about $200 million for the full year, up from our previous target of $130 million, and we still expect to achieve a full year operating ratio below 70. 
Last quarter, we showcased a number of initiatives to rightsize our asset base. As this year progresses, we continue to explore and implement additional initiatives, including, as we announced yesterday, our reduced train operations at Knoxville yards. By 2020, we expect to achieve annual productivity savings of over $650 million, request reductions in labor, materials, fuel and purchased services.
Our plan is dynamic and our longer-term expectations include growth in both pricing and volumes. As previously noted, we are targeting 2.5% compound annual growth in pricing and a similar rate of growth in volumes over the 5-year plan period. Our goal, as we have said, is a sub-65 operating ratio by 2020, accompanied by double-digit compound annual growth in EPS. Based on our strong first quarter results, we are clearly moving in the right direction.
Our plan also provides for significant return of capital to shareholders. Over the past 10 years, Norfolk Southern distributed nearly $15 billion through share repurchases and dividends. This year, we plan to distribute $800 million through share repurchases while continuing a steadfast commitment to maintaining our dividend.
We have the right team in place. They have demonstrated their ability to perform. Delivering superior shareholder value is their abiding objective and mine. I have every confidence, as shown by our strong start to 2016, that this team will go above and beyond to produce results.
I'll now turn the program over to Alan, Mike and Marta, who will provide more details on our 2016 results and outlook and then return with some closing comments before taking your questions. Alan?"
292268,329303342,961334,"Norfolk Southern Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Norfolk Southern Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon to our audience. We appreciate your joining us today.On Slide 7, you can see that our first quarter revenue declined 6% year-over-year to $2.4 billion. A majority of the decrease was attributable to lower on-highway di",811,"Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon to our audience. We appreciate your joining us today.
On Slide 7, you can see that our first quarter revenue declined 6% year-over-year to $2.4 billion. A majority of the decrease was attributable to lower on-highway diesel and WTI prices, which reduced fuel surcharge revenues compared to last year. The remaining decrease in revenue was due to a 23% decline of coal volume, driven by unseasonably warm weather and to the Triple Crown restructuring. Coal now represents less than 15% of our revenue, down from 29% in 2010.
Excluding the impact of Triple Crown, our volumes are relatively flat despite the declining commodity markets due to our diverse portfolio and improved service product. Revenue per unit less fuel increased year-over-year for the third quarter in a row as a result of our pricing focus, which more than offset the negative mix impact from increased intermodal volumes and declines in higher-rated commodities.
As you can see on Slide 8, merchandise revenue increased 2% in the first quarter of 2016 with a 3% increase in volume. Volume grew in all business groups, except chemicals, which was impacted by decreased crude oil shipments. Automotive volume was up 18% in the quarter, exceeding North American vehicle production growth of [ph] 5% with relatively easy comparisons from last year. We do not anticipate year-over-year growth to continue at this level. Comparisons will become more difficult as the year progresses. For the year, we anticipate growth to be better aligned with North American vehicle production, which is now projected at an annual growth rate of 1.4%.
Coil, steel and plastics benefited from automotive production, while housing and construction activity drove growth in aggregates, cement and lumber.
Turning to intermodal on Slide 9. Overall volume was flat, notwithstanding the impact of the Triple Crown restructure. Excluding our Triple Crown subsidiary, intermodal volume increased 6% with a 15% increase in international business, resulting from our network reach and service. Domestic growth, excluding Triple Crown, was impacted by the inventory overhang that we discussed last quarter, though volumes improved sequentially [indiscernible] as a result of service gains.
Lower volumes of higher-rated Triple Crown freight and lower fuel surcharge revenue decreased intermodal RPU by 12%. However, excluding the impact of Triple Crown and fuel surcharges, intermodal RPU increased 1% as pricing initiatives offset the negative mix associated with increased international volume and truck capacity.
Moving to the coal market on Slide 10. Utility coal met our previous guidance of 15 million tons for the quarter, a decrease from last year due to warm weather and low natural gas prices. Exports slightly exceeded our guidance of 2.5 million to 3 million tons for the quarter, although challenges continue to be -- continue in an oversupply global market. We maintain our previous export guidance through 2016.
Excluding fuel, revenue per unit increased 3%. RPU was positively impacted by $10 million in liquidated damages in the first quarter, as rate increases were offset by unfavorable changes in the mix of business.
As referenced on Slide 11, warm weather in our service [indiscernible] continued through March, resulting in stockpiles of well above-average levels. We expect this impact to extend into at least the fourth quarter and anticipate utility volumes continuing at the first quarter pace until stockpiles return to target levels, assuming normal weather patterns.
Concluding with our outlook on Slide 12. Coal volumes in 2016 will be impacted as utilities work down to stockpile buildup resulting from the warm winter. Low oil and gas prices have significantly reduced rig counts and drilling activity, which will negatively impact our volume accrued by rail as well as natural gas drilling inputs including frac sand and pipe. The Triple Crown restructure will dampen intermodal volume for the rest of the year. Longer term, our improved service product, combined with increased regulation in the trucking industry, provides stronger growth opportunities for domestic intermodal. Additionally, international Intermodal volume benefits from our alignment with shipping partners adding capacity to the East Coast.
Our pricing outlook is favorable, reflecting the value of our service product. While lower on-highway diesel and WTI prices and associated fuel surcharges continue to affect top line growth, that impact has greatly subsided.
We focus on growth by providing a service product to market values while negotiating market competitive prices. This quarter, our improved service levels especially benefited intermodal and automotive and allowed Norfolk Southern to aggressively manage through the changing economic environment.
While executing against our strategic plan, we are enhancing shareholder return by successfully operating a network that efficiently and fluidly handles a diverse portfolio of business and strategically inserting NS as a value component of our customers supply chains, which will generate greater opportunities for growth even as individual markets fluctuate.
Next. Michael describe operational improvements that have reduced our costs and enhanced the value of our products."

I'm pleased to announce we are continuing to operate at high service levels while also making significant strides in our cost-reduction initiatives. Thanks to the commitment and focus of our employees on executing these key drivers of our",923,"Thank you, Alan. I'm pleased to announce we are continuing to operate at high service levels while also making significant strides in our cost-reduction initiatives. Thanks to the commitment and focus of our employees on executing these key drivers of our strategic plan. The following results are a validation of NS employees' hard work.
Let me begin with one of our core principles on Slide 14, which is safety. While our injury ratio saw a slight uptick in the first quarter as compared to the same period last year, we have actually seen a 5% improvement in our injury count. However, this was more than offset by a reduction in hours worked. We also achieved a reduction in the number of serious injuries resulted in an improvement in our serious injury ratio.
Turning to service on Slide 15. You can see we are maintaining the high service levels we delivered in the fourth quarter. We have achieved this while aggressively and successfully pursuing cost-reduction initiatives, which is something we committed to on our last call. We remain confident we can continue to keep service at a high level while we focus on identifying and implementing further cost-reduction initiatives.
As you can see on Slide 16, our speed has continued to improve, which has aided our asset utilization. We are continuing to operate at our historic highs on this key metric.
Dwell increased from the fourth quarter due in part to seasonal impact, but we were significantly below first quarter 2015. We are encouraged that our overall velocity, as measured at the car level, is near our previous record levels.
Taking a look at our resources on Slide 17. We continued rightsizing our workforce in the first quarter to maximum the business levels. These reductions occurred in all the operating departments. We had 1,300 T&E employees furloughed at the end of the quarter, along with 415 non-T&E employees. We are in the process of recalling approximately 500 T&E employees to prepare for seasonal volume increases and to cover attrition. Although for the full year, we are ahead of our plan for headcount reductions, which Marta will update you on later.
On the locomotive side, aided by our high velocity and the execution of our strategic plan to run a more efficient and profitable railroad, we continue to rationalize our locomotive fleet. In addition to currently storied high location road locomotives, we have rightsized our yard and local fleet. A total of 150 units have been removed from this fleet, representing a 12% reduction. We accomplished this without negatively impacting customer service levels. In addition, we plan to add 50 new locomotives in the second quarter, which will allow us to remove less efficient road locomotives from the fleet.
Now on Slide 18. The cost-reduction initiatives just discussed, coupled with our efforts to keep the railroad operating at a high level, have resulted in significant productivity savings. Through the first 3 months of the year, we have been able to realize significant improvements in key areas. Our 2.8% reduction in crew starts has outpaced our drop in volume, driven in part by our improvement in train link. That percentage is even higher when considering the sharp reduction in recrews, which along with the drop in over time, is indicative of a very fluid railroad. All of these together are driving improved productivity as seen in the gross ton-miles per T&E employee. So certainly some positive results.
As Jim stated, this is indicative we are ahead of our $130 million productivity savings and now expect $200 million in productivity savings for the full year. Some of this was front-end loaded due to the benefit of not having last year's weather and service costs in the first quarter.
On Slide 19, I would like to update you on the status of our previously announced additional cost-reduction initiatives. We have ceased road operations on the West Virginia Secondary as well as completed the consolidation of the Pocahontas and Virginia divisions. We also continued to make progress with the idling of the Ashtabula coal terminal, which should be completed in the second quarter. 
As seen on Slide 20, we have also consolidated our operational alignment from 3 regions to 2. In addition to reducing regional supervision across all departments within operations, this initiative further streamlines our network and improves communication and coordination across the railroads.
Lastly, on Slide 21. We have also made significant progress with our yard rationalizations. We have been executing on this rationalization of our operation for several years, starting with the idling of Buckeye Yard in Columbus in 2009; continuing with Roanoke in 2013; and now, Knoxville, Tennessee. As recently announced, we are idling terminal operations at our hump yard in Knoxville effective May 1. 130 positions will be impacted by this reduction in operations. The annual savings on this initiative is approximately $13 million.
Our ability to realize these savings is due in large part to our expansion at our Bellevue hump yard and the capacity that has given us. In addition, we have curtailed activities at many of our smaller yards. In all, we have reduced to rationalized yard operations at 25 locations across our system.
We see a lot of positive signs from our operation, and we will continue to execute our tactical and strategic cost-control initiatives and at the same time, ensure we continue to provide a great service product to our customers.
Thank you. And I will now turn it over to Marta, who will update you on the financials."
292268,329303342,961334,"Norfolk Southern Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Norfolk Southern Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a look at our first quarter financials, starting with operations. Slide 23 summarizes our operating results compared to last year's first quarter, and as Jim already mentioned, reflects a record-",745,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a look at our first quarter financials, starting with operations. 
Slide 23 summarizes our operating results compared to last year's first quarter, and as Jim already mentioned, reflects a record-setting 70.1 operating ratio. As you know, the first quarter historically had the highest OR of the year and so this result is very supportive of our anticipated full year operating ratio below 70.
Revenues, as Alan described, were down 6% in the quarter. However, this was offset by a larger decline of 13% or $264 million in expenses. The net result was an increase of $117 million or 19% in income from railway operation.
Taking a look at Slide 24. The 13% decline in operating expenses reflects the aggressive efforts our team has taken to reduce expenses and control costs. Every cost category, except for depreciation, declined in the quarter.
Let's take a closer look at each of the components. Slide 25 depicts the significant drop in fuel costs. As you would expect, most of the decrease is price related. In addition, consumption per unit improved as gallons of fuel used declined by 4% on the 2% reduction in traffic volume.
Turning to Slide 26. Compensation costs were down by $60 million or 8%. As Mike discussed, our efforts to minimize overtime and recrews, combined with a lower overall headcount, resulted in 45 million of lower cable. Commensurate with the reduced compensation base was the lower level of payroll taxes, which were down $13 million. Additionally, we lapped the $11 million in costs related to last year's signing bonus and have $10 million in lower pension expense. These items were partially offset by health and welfare rate increases of $15 million.
As shown on the lower left of the slide, our average headcount for the quarter declined by about 1,900 positions, both for the year-over-year and the sequential comparison. As Mike described, some of this is seasonal as we now expect a full year headcount reduction of 1,500 versus the 1,200 from our previous forecast.
Slide 27 details our materials and other category, showing a decrease of $52 million or 21%. Reductions totaling $42 million were due to a decline in all areas of material usage in locomotives, freight cars and roadway. The largest drop within locomotive materials as a result of the 7% decline in locomotives in service.
In addition to the decreased number of locomotives, we greatly reduced locomotive overhauls and strategically utilized parts from the fleet of DC locomotives that are slated for AC conversion. Additionally, fewer freight cars and the mild winter weather also contributed to lower material usage.
For the remainder of the year, we expect the decline in materials to moderate to about a $10 million quarter-over-quarter favorable variance.
Moving on to Slide 28. Purchased services and rents were down $44 million or 10%, largely due to $34 million in lower Triple Crown costs associated with its much smaller operation. Additionally, expenses related to engineering and transportation services declined by $10 million and equipment rents were down $3 million, notwithstanding the strong automotive volumes as velocity-related benefits offset these volumetric effects.
Turning to income taxes on Slide 29. The effective rate for the first quarter was 35.5% versus 37.4% in 2015. A combination of small items, including a state tax law change and corporate [indiscernible] insurance proceeds, slightly lowered the rate. For the remaining quarters of this year, we continued to expect a roughly 37% effective income tax rate.
Slide 30 shows our bottom line results with net income of $387 million, reflecting an increase of $77 million or 25% and diluted earnings per share of $1.29, up 29% compared with last year. We're making solid progress and remain committed to continued improvement.
Wrapping up our financial over to you on Slide 31. Cash from operations for the first 3 months was $879 million. Capital spending through the first quarter was approximately $400 million. Due to the reduction in traffic volume, we've revisited our capital plan and had modestly reduced our full year capital budget from $2.1 billion to $2 billion even.
Turning back to cash flows. The improved operating cash and level CapEx resulted in free cash flow of almost $0.5 billion.
With respect to shareholder returns, we repurchased $200 million of stock and paid $176 million in dividends during the quarter.
And with that, I thank you for your attention, and I'll turn the program back to Jim."

With me today are NS' Chief Marketing Officer, Alan Shaw; our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Wheeler; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart.
We'll share the details of our strong first quarter financial results with you momentarily, but let me begin by saying how proud I am of the men and women of Norfolk Southern who are so successfully executing our strategic plan. Their flexibility and initiative are driving shareholder value, even in the midst of a challenging and ever-changing marketplace.
Turning to our results on Slide 4. Our team delivered a record-setting first quarter operating ratio of 70.1%, 630 basis points lower than last year's first quarter. This performance was in the face of weak commodities, a strong dollar and coal volumes down 23%. Norfolk Southern's earnings for the first quarter were $1.29 per share, 29% higher than last year's dollar per share. Marta will go over the details shortly.
We were able to generate these results, thanks in large part to improved network performance. Mike will follow with an update on operations, but let me highlight here that our team increased the composite service measure by 23%, increased train speeds by 15% and reduced terminal dwell by 14%.
These strong improvements helped us control costs while enhancing the value of our product. Better service is, of course, a prerequisite to growth and a foundation of our strategy. It is what allowed us to grow in the first quarter in markets like automotive and intermodal even within a challenging macro environment. Furthermore, this focus on improved service helped to counterbalance weakness in commodities like coal and crude oil. Alan will share all the details of all our top line results in a moment.
With respect to our strategic plan, and as noted on Slide 5, our focus on strengthening Norfolk Southern is yielding results. We are now on track to achieve productivity savings of about $200 million for the full year, up from our previous target of $130 million, and we still expect to achieve a full year operating ratio below 70%. 
Last quarter, we showcased a number of initiatives to rightsize our asset base. As this year progresses, we continue to explore and implement additional initiatives, including, as we announced yesterday, our reduced train operations at Knoxville yards. By 2020, we expect to achieve annual productivity savings of over $650 million, through cost reductions in labor, materials, fuel and purchased services.
Our plan is dynamic and our longer-term expectations include growth in both pricing and volumes. As previously noted, we are targeting 2.5% compound annual growth in pricing and a similar rate of growth in volumes over the 5-year plan period. Our goal, as we have said, is a sub-65% operating ratio by 2020, accompanied by double-digit compound annual growth in EPS. Based on our strong first quarter results, we are clearly moving in the right direction.
Our plan also provides for significant return of capital to shareholders. Over the past 10 years, Norfolk Southern distributed nearly $15 billion through share repurchases and dividends. This year, we plan to distribute $800 million through share repurchases while continuing a steadfast commitment to maintaining our dividend.
We have the right team in place. They have demonstrated their ability to perform. Delivering superior shareholder value is their abiding objective and mine. I have every confidence, as shown by our strong start to 2016, that this team will go above and beyond to produce results.
I'll now turn the program over to Alan, Mike and Marta, who will provide more details on our 2016 results and outlook and then return with some closing comments before taking your questions. Alan?"

We appreciate your joining us today.On Slide 7, you can see that our first quarter revenue declined 6% year-over-year to $2.4 billion. A majority of the decrease was attributable to lower on-highway di",811,"Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon to our audience. We appreciate your joining us today.
On Slide 7, you can see that our first quarter revenue declined 6% year-over-year to $2.4 billion. A majority of the decrease was attributable to lower on-highway diesel and WTI prices, which reduced fuel surcharge revenues compared to last year. The remaining decrease in revenue was due to a 23% decline in coal volume, driven by unseasonably warm weather and to the Triple Crown restructuring. Coal now represents less than 15% of our revenue, down from 29% in 2010.
Excluding the impact of Triple Crown, our volumes are relatively flat despite the declining commodity markets due to our diverse portfolio and improved service product. Revenue per unit less fuel increased year-over-year for the third quarter in a row as a result of our pricing focus, which more than offset the negative mix impact from increased intermodal volumes and declines in higher-rated commodities.
As you can see on Slide 8, merchandise revenue increased 2% in the first quarter of 2016 with a 3% increase in volume. Volume grew in all business groups, except chemicals, which was impacted by decreased crude oil shipments. Automotive volume was up 18% in the quarter, exceeding North American vehicle production growth of 5% with relatively easy comparisons from last year. We do not anticipate year-over-year growth to continue at this level. Comparisons will become more difficult as the year progresses. For the year, we anticipate growth to be better aligned with North American vehicle production, which is now projected at an annual growth rate of 1.4%.
Coil steel and plastics benefited from automotive production, while housing and construction activity drove growth in aggregates, cement and lumber.
Turning to intermodal on Slide 9. Overall volume was flat, notwithstanding the impact of the Triple Crown restructure. Excluding our Triple Crown subsidiary, intermodal volume increased 6% with a 15% increase in international business, resulting from our network reach and service. Domestic growth, excluding Triple Crown, was impacted by the inventory overhang that we discussed last quarter, though volumes improved sequentially each month as a result of service gains.
Lower volumes of higher-rated Triple Crown freight and lower fuel surcharge revenue decreased intermodal RPU by 12%. However, excluding the impact of Triple Crown and fuel surcharges, intermodal RPU increased 1% as pricing initiatives offset the negative mix associated with increased international volume and truck capacity.
Moving to the coal market on Slide 10. Utility coal met our previous guidance of 15 million tons for the quarter, a decrease from last year due to warm weather and low natural gas prices. Exports slightly exceeded our guidance of 2.5 million to 3 million tons for the quarter, although challenges continue to be -- continue in an oversupply global market. We maintain our previous export guidance through 2016.
Excluding fuel, revenue per unit increased 3%. RPU was positively impacted by $10 million in liquidated damages in the first quarter, as rate increases were offset by unfavorable changes in the mix of business.
As referenced on Slide 11, warm weather in our service territory continued through March, resulting in stockpiles of well above-average levels. We expect this impact to extend into at least the fourth quarter and anticipate utility volumes continuing at the first quarter pace until stockpiles return to target levels, assuming normal weather patterns.
Concluding with our outlook on Slide 12. Coal volumes in 2016 will be impacted as utilities work down the stockpile buildup resulting from the warm winter. Low oil and gas prices have significantly reduced rig counts and drilling activity, which will negatively impact our volume accrued by rail as well as natural gas drilling inputs including frac sand and pipe. The Triple Crown restructure will dampen intermodal volume for the rest of the year. Longer term, our improved service product, combined with increased regulation in the trucking industry, provides stronger growth opportunities for domestic intermodal. Additionally, international intermodal volume benefits from our alignment with shipping partners adding capacity to the East Coast.
Our pricing outlook is favorable, reflecting the value of our service product. While lower on-highway diesel and WTI prices and associated fuel surcharges continue to affect top line growth, that impact has greatly subsided.
We focus on growth by providing a service product the market values while negotiating market competitive prices. This quarter, our improved service levels especially benefited intermodal and automotive and allowed Norfolk Southern to aggressively manage through the changing economic environment.
While executing against our strategic plan, we are enhancing shareholder return by successfully operating a network that efficiently and fluidly handles a diverse portfolio of business and strategically inserting NS as a valued component of our customers supply chains, which will generate greater opportunities for growth even as individual markets fluctuate.
Next. Michael describe operational improvements that have reduced our costs and enhanced the value of our products."

I am pleased to announce we are continuing to operate at high service levels while also making significant strides in our cost-reduction initiatives. Thanks to the commitment and focus of our employees on executing these key drivers of our strategic plan. The following results are a validation of NS employees' hard work.
Let me begin with one of our core principles on Slide 14, which is safety. While our injury ratio saw a slight uptick in the first quarter as compared to the same period last year, we have actually seen a 5% improvement in our injury count. However, this was more than offset by a reduction in hours worked. We also achieved a reduction in the number of serious injuries resulted in an improvement in our serious injury ratio.
Turning to service on Slide 15. You can see we are maintaining the high service levels we delivered in the fourth quarter. We have achieved this while aggressively and successfully pursuing cost-reduction initiatives, which is something we committed to on our last call. We remain confident we can continue to keep service at a high level while we focus on identifying and implementing further cost-reduction initiatives.
As you can see on Slide 16, our speed has continued to improve, which has aided our asset utilization. We are continuing to operate at our historic highs on this key metric.
Dwell increased from the fourth quarter due in part to seasonal impact, but we were significantly below first quarter 2015. We are encouraged that our overall velocity, as measured at the car level, is near our previous record levels.
Taking a look at our resources on Slide 17. We continued rightsizing our workforce in the first quarter to match the business levels. These reductions occurred in all the operating departments. We had 1,300 T&E employees furloughed at the end of the quarter, along with 450 non-T&E employees. We are in the process of recalling approximately 500 T&E employees to prepare for seasonal volume increases and to cover attrition. Although for the full year, we are ahead of our plan for headcount reductions, which Marta will update you on later.
On the locomotive side, aided by our high velocity and the execution of our strategic plan to run a more efficient and profitable railroad, we continue to rationalize our locomotive fleet. In addition to currently storing high-adhesion location road locomotives, we have rightsized our yard and local fleet. A total of 150 units have been removed from this fleet, representing a 12% reduction. We accomplished this without negatively impacting customer service levels. In addition, we plan to add 50 new locomotives in the second quarter, which will allow us to remove less efficient road locomotives from the fleet.
Now on Slide 18. The cost-reduction initiatives just discussed, coupled with our efforts to keep the railroad operating at a high level, have resulted in significant productivity savings. Through the first 3 months of the year, we have been able to realize significant improvements in key areas. Our 2.8% reduction in crew starts has outpaced our drop in volume, driven in part by our improvement in train length. That percentage is even higher when considering the sharp reduction in recrews, which along with the drop in overtime, is indicative of a very fluid railroad. All of these together are driving improved productivity as seen in the gross ton-miles per T&E employee. So certainly some positive results.
As Jim stated, this is indicative we are ahead of our $130 million productivity savings and now expect $200 million in productivity savings for the full year. Some of this was front-end loaded due to the benefit of not having last year's weather and service costs in the first quarter.
On Slide 19, I would like to update you on the status of our previously announced additional cost-reduction initiatives. We have ceased road operations on the West Virginia Secondary as well as completed the consolidation of the Pocahontas and Virginia divisions. We also continued to make progress with the idling of the Ashtabula coal terminal, which should be completed in the second quarter. 
As seen on Slide 20, we have also consolidated our operational alignment from 3 regions to 2. In addition to reducing regional supervision across all departments within operations, this initiative further streamlines our network and improves communication and coordination across the railroads.
Lastly, on Slide 21. We have also made significant progress with our yard rationalizations. We have been executing on this rationalization of our operation for several years, starting with the idling of Buckeye Yard in Columbus in 2009; continuing with Roanoke in 2013; and now, Knoxville, Tennessee. As recently announced, we are idling terminal operations at our hump yard in Knoxville effective May 1. 130 positions will be impacted by this reduction in operations. The annual savings on this initiative is approximately $13 million.
Our ability to realize these savings is due in large part to our expansion at our Bellevue hump yard and the capacity that has given us. In addition, we have curtailed activities at many of our smaller yards. In all, we have reduced the rationalized yard operations at 25 locations across our system.
We see a lot of positive signs from our operation, and we will continue to execute our tactical and strategic cost-control initiatives and at the same time, ensure we continue to provide a great service product to our customers.
Thank you. And I will now turn it over to Marta, who will update you on the financials."

Let's take a look at our first quarter financials, starting with operations. Slide 23 summarizes our operating results compared to last year's first quarter, and as Jim already mentioned, reflects a record-",742,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a look at our first quarter financials, starting with operations. 
Slide 23 summarizes our operating results compared to last year's first quarter, and as Jim already mentioned, reflects a record-setting 70.1% operating ratio. As you know, the first quarter historically had the highest OR of the year and so this result is very supportive of our anticipated full year operating ratio below 70%.
Revenues, as Alan described, were down 6% in the quarter. However, this was offset by a larger decline of 13% or $264 million in expenses. The net result was an increase of $117 million or 19% in income from railway operation.
Taking a look at Slide 24. The 13% decline in operating expenses reflects the aggressive efforts our team has taken to reduce expenses and control costs. Every cost category, except for depreciation, declined in the quarter.
Let's take a closer look at each of the component. Slide 25 depicts the significant drop in fuel costs. As you would expect, most of the decrease is price related. In addition, consumption per unit improved as gallons of fuel used declined by 4% on the 2% reduction in traffic volume.
Turning to Slide 26. Compensation costs were down by $60 million or 8%. As Mike discussed, our efforts to minimize overtime and recrews, combined with a lower overall headcount, resulted in $45 million of lower payroll. Commensurate with the reduced compensation base was the lower level of payroll taxes, which were down $13 million. Additionally, we lapped the $11 million in costs related to last year's signing bonus and have $10 million in lower pension expense. These items were partially offset by health and welfare rate increases of $15 million.
As shown on the lower left of the slide, our average headcount for the quarter declined by about 1,900 positions, both for the year-over-year and the sequential comparison. As Mike described, some of this is seasonal and we now expect a full year headcount reduction of 1,500 versus the 1,200 from our previous forecast.
Slide 27 details our materials and other category, showing a decrease of $52 million or 21%. Reductions totaling $42 million were due to a decline in all areas of material usage in locomotives, freight cars and roadway. The largest drop within locomotive materials as a result of the 7% decline in locomotives in service.
In addition to the decreased number of locomotive, we greatly reduced locomotive overhauls and strategically utilized parts from the fleet of DC locomotives that are slated for AC conversion. Additionally, fewer freight cars and the mild winter weather also contributed to lower material usage.
For the remainder of the year, we expect the decline in materials to moderate to about a $10 million quarter-over-quarter favorable variance.
Moving on to Slide 28. Purchased services and rents were down $44 million or 10%, largely due to $34 million in lower Triple Crown costs associated with its much smaller operation. Additionally, expenses related to engineering and transportation services declined by $10 million and equipment rents were down $3 million, notwithstanding the strong automotive volumes as velocity-related benefits offset these volumetric effects.
Turning to income taxes on Slide 29. The effective rate for the first quarter was 35.5% versus 37.4% in 2015. A combination of small items, including a state tax law change and corporate-owned insurance proceeds, slightly lowered the rate. For the remaining quarters of this year, we continued to expect a roughly 37% effective income tax rate.
Slide 30 shows our bottom line results with net income of $387 million, reflecting an increase of $77 million or 25% and diluted earnings per share of $1.29, up 29% compared with last year. We're making solid progress and remain committed to continued improvement.
Wrapping up our financial overview on Slide 31. Cash from operations for the first 3 months was $879 million. Capital spending through the first quarter was approximately $400 million. Due to the reduction in traffic volume, we've revisited our capital plan and had modestly reduced our full year capital budget from $2.1 billion to $2 billion even.
Turning back to cash flows. The improved operating cash and level CapEx resulted in free cash flow of almost $0.5 billion.
With respect to shareholder returns, we repurchased $200 million of stock and paid $176 million in dividends during the quarter.
And with that, I thank you for your attention, and I'll turn the program back to Jim."

With me today are NS' Chief Marketing Officer, Alan Shaw; our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Wheeler; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart.
We'll share the details of our strong first quarter financial results with you momentarily, but let me begin by saying how proud I am of the men and women of Norfolk Southern who are so successfully executing our strategic plan. Their flexibility and initiative are driving shareholder value, even in the midst of a challenging and ever-changing marketplace.
Turning to our results on Slide 4. Our team delivered a record-setting first quarter operating ratio of 70.1%, 630 basis points lower than last year's first quarter. This performance was in the face of weak commodities, a strong dollar and coal volumes down 23%. Norfolk Southern's earnings for the first quarter were $1.29 per share, 29% higher than last year's dollar per share. Marta will go over the details shortly.
We were able to generate these results, thanks in large part to improved network performance. Mike will follow with an update on operations, but let me highlight here that our team increased the composite service measure by 23%, increased train speeds by 15% and reduced terminal dwell by 14%.
These strong improvements helped us control costs while enhancing the value of our product. Better service is, of course, a prerequisite to growth and a foundation of our strategy. It is what allowed us to grow in the first quarter in markets like automotive and intermodal even within a challenging macro environment. Furthermore, this focus on improved service helped to counterbalance weakness in commodities like coal and crude oil. Alan will share all the details of our top line results in a moment.
With respect to our strategic plan, and as noted on Slide 5, our focus on strengthening Norfolk Southern is yielding results. We are now on track to achieve productivity savings of about $200 million for the full year, up from our previous target of $130 million, and we still expect to achieve a full year operating ratio below 70%. 
Last quarter, we showcased a number of initiatives to rightsize our asset base. As this year progresses, we continue to explore and implement additional initiatives, including, as we announced yesterday, our reduced train operations at Knoxville yards. By 2020, we expect to achieve annual productivity savings of over $650 million, through cost reductions in labor, materials, fuel and purchased services.
Our plan is dynamic and our longer-term expectations include growth in both pricing and volumes. As previously noted, we are targeting 2.5% compound annual growth in pricing and a similar rate of growth in volumes over the 5-year plan period. Our goal, as we have said, is a sub-65% operating ratio by 2020, accompanied by double-digit compound annual growth in EPS. Based on our strong first quarter results, we are clearly moving in the right direction.
Our plan also provides for significant return of capital to shareholders. Over the past 10 years, Norfolk Southern distributed nearly $15 billion through share repurchases and dividends. This year, we plan to distribute $800 million through share repurchases while continuing a steadfast commitment to maintaining our dividend.
We have the right team in place. They have demonstrated their ability to perform. Delivering superior shareholder value is their abiding objective and mine. I have every confidence, as shown by our strong start to 2016, that this team will go above and beyond to produce results.
I'll now turn the program over to Alan, Mike and Marta, who will provide more details on our 2016 results and outlook and then return with some closing comments before taking your questions. Alan?"

We appreciate your joining us today.On Slide 7, you can see that our first quarter revenue declined 6% year-over-year to $2.4 billion.

On Slide 7, you can see that our first quarter revenue declined 6% year-over-year to $2.4 billion. A majority of the decrease was attributable to lower on-highway diesel and WTI prices, which reduced fuel surcharge revenues compared to last year. The remaining decrease in revenue was due to a 23% decline in coal volume, driven by unseasonably warm weather and to the Triple Crown restructuring. Coal now represents less than 15% of our revenue, down from 29% in 2010.
Excluding the impact of Triple Crown, our volumes are relatively flat despite the declining commodity markets due to our diverse portfolio and improved service product. Revenue per unit less fuel increased year-over-year for the third quarter in a row as a result of our pricing focus, which more than offset the negative mix impact from increased intermodal volumes and declines in higher-rated commodities.
As you can see on Slide 8, merchandise revenue increased 2% in the first quarter of 2016 with a 3% increase in volume. Volume grew in all business groups, except chemicals, which was impacted by decreased crude oil shipments. Automotive volume was up 18% in the quarter, exceeding North American vehicle production growth of 5% with relatively easy comparisons from last year. We do not anticipate year-over-year growth to continue at this level. Comparisons will become more difficult as the year progresses. For the year, we anticipate growth to be better aligned with North American vehicle production, which is now projected at an annual growth rate of 1.4%.
Coil steel and plastics benefited from automotive production, while housing and construction activity drove growth in aggregates, cement and lumber.
Turning to intermodal on Slide 9. Overall volume was flat, notwithstanding the impact of the Triple Crown restructure. Excluding our Triple Crown subsidiary, intermodal volume increased 6% with a 15% increase in international business, resulting from our network reach and service. Domestic growth, excluding Triple Crown, was impacted by the inventory overhang that we discussed last quarter, though volumes improved sequentially each month as a result of service gains.
Lower volumes of higher-rated Triple Crown freight and lower fuel surcharge revenue decreased intermodal RPU by 12%. However, excluding the impact of Triple Crown and fuel surcharges, intermodal RPU increased 1% as pricing initiatives offset the negative mix associated with increased international volume and truck capacity.
Moving to the coal market on Slide 10. Utility coal met our previous guidance of 15 million tons for the quarter, a decrease from last year due to warm weather and low natural gas prices. Exports slightly exceeded our guidance of 2.5 million to 3 million tons for the quarter, although challenges continue to be -- continue in an oversupply global market. We maintain our previous export guidance through 2016.
Excluding fuel, revenue per unit increased 3%. RPU was positively impacted by $10 million in liquidated damages in the first quarter, as rate increases were offset by unfavorable changes in the mix of business.
As referenced on Slide 11, warm weather in our service territory continued through March, resulting in stockpiles of well above-average levels. We expect this impact to extend into at least the fourth quarter and anticipate utility volumes continuing at the first quarter pace until stockpiles return to target levels, assuming normal weather patterns.
Concluding with our outlook on Slide 12. Coal volumes in 2016 will be impacted as utilities work down the stockpile buildup resulting from the warm winter. Low oil and gas prices have significantly reduced rig counts and drilling activity, which will negatively impact our volume accrued by rail as well as natural gas drilling inputs, including frac sand and pipe. The Triple Crown restructure will dampen intermodal volume for the rest of the year. Longer term, our improved service product, combined with increased regulation in the trucking industry, provides stronger growth opportunities for domestic intermodal. Additionally, international intermodal volume benefits from our alignment with shipping partners adding capacity to the East Coast.
Our pricing outlook is favorable, reflecting the value of our service product. While lower on-highway diesel and WTI prices and associated fuel surcharges continue to affect top line growth, that impact has greatly subsided.
We focus on growth by providing a service product the market values while negotiating market competitive prices. This quarter, our improved service levels especially benefited intermodal and automotive and allowed Norfolk Southern to aggressively manage through the changing economic environment.
While executing against our strategic plan, we are enhancing shareholder return by successfully operating a network that efficiently and fluidly handles a diverse portfolio of business and strategically inserting NS as a valued component of our customers supply chains, which will generate greater opportunities for growth even as individual markets fluctuate.
Next. Michael will describe operational improvements that have reduced our costs and enhanced the value of our products."

I am pleased to announce we are continuing to operate at high service levels while also making significant strides in our cost-reduction initiatives. Thanks to the commitment and focus of our employees on executing these key drivers of our strategic plan. The following results are a validation of NS employees' hard work.
Let me begin with one of our core principles on Slide 14, which is safety. While our injury ratio saw a slight uptick in the first quarter as compared to the same period last year, we have actually seen a 5% improvement in our injury count. However, this was more than offset by a reduction in hours worked. We also achieved a reduction in the number of serious injuries resulted in an improvement in our serious injury ratio.
Turning to service on Slide 15. You can see we are maintaining the high service levels we delivered in the fourth quarter. We have achieved this while aggressively and successfully pursuing cost-reduction initiatives, which is something we committed to on our last call. We remain confident we can continue to keep service at a high level while we focus on identifying and implementing further cost-reduction initiatives.
As you can see on Slide 16, our speed has continued to improve, which has aided our asset utilization. We are continuing to operate at our historic highs on this key metric.
Dwell increased from the fourth quarter due in part to seasonal impact, but we were significantly below first quarter 2015. We are encouraged that our overall velocity, as measured at the car level, is near our previous record levels.
Taking a look at our resources on Slide 17. We continued rightsizing our workforce in the first quarter to match the business levels. These reductions occurred in all the operating departments. We had 1,300 T&E employees furloughed at the end of the quarter, along with 450 non-T&E employees. We are in the process of recalling approximately 500 T&E employees to prepare for seasonal volume increases and to cover attrition. Although for the full year, we are ahead of our plan for headcount reductions, which Marta will update you on later.
On the locomotive side, aided by our high velocity and the execution of our strategic plan to run a more efficient and profitable railroad, we continue to rationalize our locomotive fleet. In addition to currently storing high-adhesion road locomotives, we have rightsized our yard and local fleet. A total of 150 units have been removed from this fleet, representing a 12% reduction. We accomplished this without negatively impacting customer service levels. In addition, we plan to add 50 new locomotives in the second quarter, which will allow us to remove less efficient road locomotives from the fleet.
Now on Slide 18. The cost-reduction initiatives just discussed, coupled with our efforts to keep the railroad operating at a high level, have resulted in significant productivity savings. Through the first 3 months of the year, we have been able to realize significant improvements in key areas. Our 2.8% reduction in crew starts has outpaced our drop in volume, driven in part by our improvement in train length. That percentage is even higher when considering the sharp reduction in recrews, which along with the drop in overtime, is indicative of a very fluid railroad. All of these together are driving improved productivity as seen in the gross ton-miles per T&E employee. So certainly some positive results.
As Jim stated, this is indicative we are ahead of our $130 million productivity savings and now expect $200 million in productivity savings for the full year. Some of this was front-end loaded due to the benefit of not having last year's weather and service costs in the first quarter.
On Slide 19, I would like to update you on the status of our previously announced additional cost-reduction initiatives. We have ceased road operations on the West Virginia Secondary as well as completed the consolidation of the Pocahontas and Virginia divisions. We also continued to make progress with the idling of the Ashtabula coal terminal, which should be completed in the second quarter. 
As seen on Slide 20, we have also consolidated our operational alignment from 3 regions to 2. In addition to reducing regional supervision across all departments within operations, this initiative further streamlines our network and improves communication and coordination across the railroads.
Lastly, on Slide 21. We have also made significant progress with our yard rationalizations. We have been executing on this rationalization of our operation for several years, starting with the idling of Buckeye Yard in Columbus in 2009; continuing with Roanoke in 2013; and now, Knoxville, Tennessee. As recently announced, we are idling terminal operations at our hump yard in Knoxville effective May 1. 130 positions will be impacted by this reduction in operations. The annual savings on this initiative is approximately $13 million.
Our ability to realize these savings is due in large part to our expansion at our Bellevue hump yard and the capacity that has given us. In addition, we have curtailed activities at many of our smaller yards. In all, we have reduced or rationalized yard operations at 25 locations across our system.
We see a lot of positive signs from our operation, and we will continue to execute our tactical and strategic cost-control initiatives and at the same time, ensure we continue to provide a great service product to our customers.
Thank you. And I will now turn it over to Marta, who will update you on the financials."

Let's take a look at our first quarter financials, starting with operations. Slide 23 summarizes our operating results compared to last year's first quarter, and as Jim already mentioned, reflects a record-",744,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a look at our first quarter financials, starting with operations. 
Slide 23 summarizes our operating results compared to last year's first quarter, and as Jim already mentioned, reflects a record-setting 70.1% operating ratio. As you know, the first quarter historically had the highest OR of the year and so this result is very supportive of our anticipated full year operating ratio below 70%.
Revenues, as Alan described, were down 6% in the quarter. However, this was offset by a larger decline of 13% or $264 million in expenses. The net result was an increase of $117 million or 19% in income from railway operation.
Taking a look at Slide 24. The 13% decline in operating expenses reflects the aggressive efforts our team has taken to reduce expenses and control costs. Every cost category, except for depreciation, declined in the quarter.
Let's take a closer look at each of the components. Slide 25 depicts the significant drop in fuel costs. As you would expect, most of the decrease is price related. In addition, consumption per unit improved as gallons of fuel used declined by 4% on the 2% reduction in traffic volume.
Turning to Slide 26. Compensation costs were down by $60 million or 8%. As Mike discussed, our efforts to minimize overtime and recrews, combined with a lower overall headcount, resulted in $45 million of lower payroll. Commensurate with the reduced compensation base was the lower level of payroll taxes, which were down $13 million. Additionally, we lapped the $11 million in costs related to last year's signing bonus and have $10 million in lower pension expense. These items were partially offset by health and welfare rate increases of $15 million.
As shown on the lower left of the slide, our average headcount for the quarter declined by about 1,900 positions, both for the year-over-year and the sequential comparison. As Mike described, some of this is seasonal and we now expect a full year headcount reduction of 1,500 versus the 1,200 from our previous forecast.
Slide 27 details our materials and other category, showing a decrease of $52 million or 21%. Reductions totaling $42 million were due to a decline in all areas of material usage in locomotives, freight cars and roadway. The largest drop was in locomotive materials as a result of the 7% decline in locomotives in service.
In addition to the decreased number of locomotive, we greatly reduced locomotive overhauls and strategically utilized parts from the fleet of DC locomotives that are slated for AC conversion. Additionally, fewer freight cars and the mild winter weather also contributed to lower material usage.
For the remainder of the year, we expect the decline in materials to moderate to about a $10 million quarter-over-quarter favorable variance.
Moving on to Slide 28. Purchased services and rents were down $44 million or 10%, largely due to $34 million in lower Triple Crown costs associated with its much smaller operation. Additionally, expenses related to engineering and transportation services declined by $10 million and equipment rents were down $3 million, notwithstanding the strong automotive volumes as velocity-related benefits offset these volumetric effects.
Turning to income taxes on Slide 29. The effective rate for the first quarter was 35.5% versus 37.4% in 2015. A combination of small items, including a state tax law change and corporate-owned life insurance proceeds, slightly lowered the rate. For the remaining quarters of this year, we continued to expect a roughly 37% effective income tax rate.
Slide 30 shows our bottom line results with net income of $387 million, reflecting an increase of $77 million or 25% and diluted earnings per share of $1.29, up 29% compared with last year. We're making solid progress and remain committed to continued improvement.
Wrapping up our financial overview on Slide 31. Cash from operations for the first 3 months was $879 million. Capital spending through the first quarter was approximately $400 million. Due to the reduction in traffic volume, we've revisited our capital plan and had modestly reduced our full year capital budget from $2.1 billion to $2 billion even.
Turning back to cash flows. The improved operating cash and level CapEx resulted in free cash flow of almost $0.5 billion.
With respect to shareholder returns, we repurchased $200 million of stock and paid $176 million in dividends during the quarter.
And with that, I thank you for your attention, and I'll turn the program back to Jim."

So there are some aspects of the steel market that aren't performing well within our metals and construction, of course, is frac sand. And we're going to have a pretty significant decline there due to decline drilling activity as is pipe. I would tell you that once the retail and wholesale inventory levels normalize, we see a lot of opportunity in that consumer-based market because of our improved service product. And even with pressure on corporate profits now. Shippers are looking to shift to intermodal because it still is a lower price option than truck."

Because as you'll recall last year, in the first quarter, we had been accruing at a beginning of the year bonus accrual level.

Our results this quarter, as shown on Slide 4 underscore the flexibility built into our team's planning and execution. Funds came in below expectations, so we quickly reined in costs, pushing operating expenses down 11% in the face of a 10% decline in revenue. As a result, we posted a 68.6 operating ratio, 140 basis points or 2% below last year. Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.36, just 4% lower than last year's $1.41.
For the first 6 months of 2016, our 69.4 operating ratio set a record, while EPS increased 10% year-over-year.
These results reflect an unwavering focus on cost control and steadfast commitment to customer service. Thus, even as we aggressively reduced spending, we drove significant improvements in network performance, as shown by a 13% uptick in the composite service metric in the quarter and 18% increase in the first half.
Turning to Slide 5, even in the current challenging environment, we believe we can achieve at least $200 million of productivity savings for the full year and an operating ratio below 70.
Longer term, we will continue positioning for top line growth, while targeting annual productivity savings of over $650 million by 2020 and an operating ratio below 65.
Given our strong start this year, we are well on our way. Now, Alan will cover trends in revenue. Mike will provide more detail on how we're managing the operations, and Marta will summarize our financial results. Then, we'll take your questions. But before I turn over the microphone, let me add a word of thanks to all our employees. Your intelligence and hard work are the keys to our success.

Norfolk Southern continues to face economic headwinds, especially in regard to energy prices. Declining coal shipments and fuel surcharge revenue, coupled with the Triple Crown restructuring and reduced crude oil volume lowered top line in the second quarter.
Excluding Triple Crown and fuel surcharges, intermodal revenue increased slightly year-over-year. In addition to decreased fuel surcharges, the mix associated with lower coal volume and increased intermodal reduced our second quarter revenue per unit, despite accelerated pricing growth in the quarter.
Within our merchandise market, as shown on Slide 8, increased shipments of cement and steel benefited our metals and construction volume. While second quarter and expected full-year automotive volume growth is in line with North American vehicle production, second half volumes will be influenced by competitive losses and plant specific outages associated with decreased model demand, limiting year-over-year comparisons. Chemicals market declines were driven by crude oil and by plant closures and consolidations that reduced industrial intermediates traffic. Our agricultural markets were impacted by increased competition from local corn moving via truck and weaker feed exports. Merchandise RPU, excluding fuel, increased 2% due to positive pricing despite the negative mix associated with decreased industrial intermediates and frac sand.
As reflected on Slide 9, international intermodal growth of 4% partially offset losses in both domestic and Triple Crown freight. Our alignment with the ports and shipping lines, adding capacity for growth, will benefit the international segment over the long term.
Intermodal continues to be impacted by excess capacity in the truck market, a condition we expect to change next year. Lastly, the Triple Crown restructure will affect our year-over-year volume comparisons until midway through the fourth quarter.
Excluding Triple Crown and fuel surcharges, intermodal posted an increase of 1% in revenue, volume and RPU. RPU benefited from strong pricing despite the adverse mix associated with increased international freight.
Moving on to coal on Slide 10, coal volumes declined as a result of sustained low natural gas prices, high stockpiles, and continued weak export conditions.
RPU, excluding fuel remaind flat, with positive pricing neutralized by mix, increased volumes of thermal export coal and
[Audio Gap]
 And fourth quarter volume. Our 2016 pricing remains strong overall, though we do see some softness in truck competitive sectors. We continue to focus on maintaining the service product that the market values, commanding their higher price, and attracting service-sensitive business.
Lastly, as we model to market conditions and changing volume expectations, we will control all aspects of our business impacted by these shifts. Marketing is collaborating closely with operating and finance departments to correctly align our resources with current volume trends. To further discuss our operations, I will now turn it over to Mike."

I am pleased to announce we are continuing to operate at high service levels while achieving significant results in our cost reduction initiatives, as Jim noted, thanks to the commitment and focus of our employees on executing these key drivers of our strategic plan. The results are due to NS employees' hard work. 
Let me begin with safety on slide 14. While our reportable injury ratio increased in the second quarter, as compared to the same period last year, we have seen an improvement sequentially this year, which is encouraging.
We also maintained a low serious injury ratio. Turning to service, on Slide 15, you see we further improved our already high service levels from the first quarter. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of improved service to our customers. For the second quarter, our service composite improved 13%, which was driven by a 32% improvement in train performance, and an 11% improvement in shipments making this connection. It is good to see all components of the service composite improving.
What is equally encouraging is we have maintained and achieved this while aggressively and successfully pursuing cost-reduction initiatives, as supported by our 68.6 operating ratio.
We remain confident we can continue to keep service at a high level while we focus on continuing to identify and implement further cost-reduction initiatives. As you can see on Slide 16, our train speed and terminal dwell improved 12% and 9%, respectively compared to the same period last year. Overall velocity, as measured at the car level, remains near our record levels and continues to aid our asset utilization and improved service for our customers.
This has been a driver in being able to store 450 locomotives. We are also very pleased to see our service and velocity metrics remain very high even with the idling of Knoxville, a major hub terminal, on May 1st.
Now on Slide 17, our ability to keep the railroad operating at a high level while implementing aggressive cost-cutting initiatives resulted in significant productivity savings. Our reduction in cruise starts was in line with our drop in volume, and we have continued to improve our train length, recrews and overtime. Together, this resulted in improved employee productivity.
Also, our T&E headcount was down 9%, which helped drive the reduction in our overall corporate account. I will now turn it over to Marta, who will highlight the effect of these improvements."
292268,370572866,1013231,"Norfolk Southern Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Norfolk Southern Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Let's take a look at the second quarter financials. Slide 19 summarizes the operating results and highlights the expense control focus that Jim discussed.While revenues declined by 10% on the 7% lower volume,",690,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Let's take a look at the second quarter financials. Slide 19 summarizes the operating results and highlights the expense control focus that Jim discussed.
While revenues declined by 10% on the 7% lower volume, our operating expenses were down 11%. This led to a much improved operating ratio of 68.6.
The next slide shows the expense reductions by category. As with the case in the first quarter, all categories, except for depreciation were lower. Depreciation was up 4%, reflecting continued investment in our capital assets.
Now let's take a closer look at each of the other components. Slide 21 depicts the drop in fuel expense, totaling $81 million or 32% for the quarter. Lower oil prices resulted in a 25% decrease in the price per gallon, while consumption fell by 6%.
Turning to Slide 22, compensation costs were down by $57 million or 8%. As shown on the lower left of the slide, our average headcount for the quarter declined by about 2,000 employees versus last year and was flat sequentially.
Since we did not see the normal historical rise in volumes from the first to the second quarter, we were able to hold employment levels lower than previously expected. This reduced headcount, along with lower overtime and fewer recrews resulted in $50 million of year-over-year savings. The associated payroll taxes were favorable by $11 million and we had $9 million in lower pension expense.
These items were partially offset by $14 million in health and welfare rate increases associated with our agreement workforce. For the remainder of the year, we expect headcount to remain relatively flat but we will face about a $30 million per quarter headwind for incentive comp since last year's third and fourth quarters included reversals of accruals.
Of course, both of these expectations are based on our current volume projection. Purchased services and rent is depicted on Slide 23 and was down $54 million or 12%. Lower costs associated with the curtailed Triple Crown operations accounted for $38 million of the reduction and expenses related to joint facilities and haulage declined by $8 million.
Slide 24 details our Materials and Other category, reflecting a decrease of $33 million or 14%. Reductions totaling $26 million were due to declines in materials usage for locomotives, freight cars and roadway, with the largest drop related to locomotives as a result of the fewer units in service that Mike mentioned.
For the remainder of the year, we continue to expect favorability in materials costs, but at a somewhat moderated level of about $15 million per quarter, compared with the third and fourth quarters of last year.
Next, taking a look at nonoperating income on Slide 25. We had a large relative decrease of $15 million in this category, which was primarily related to 3 items: reduced income associated with our leased coal properties, fewer gains on property sales, and costs for external advisors.
Moving on to income taxes on Slide 26, the effective rate for the second quarter was 36.3% versus 38.1% last year. The lower effective rate reflects a combination of small items, including corporate and life insurance, tax credits and a state tax law change.
For the full year, we continue to expect an effective income tax rate of roughly 37%. 
Slide 27 shows our bottom line results, with net income of $405 million, a decrease of 6% versus 2015, and diluted earnings per share of $1.36, down 4% compared with last year. Wrapping up our financial overview on Slide 28, cash from operations for the first 6 months was $1.4 billion, covering capital spending and producing $500 million in free cash flow. With respect to shareholder returns, we paid $350 million in dividends and repurchased $400 million of our shares. Going forward, and in light of the still soft volumes, we have trimmed capital spending for the full year by another $100 million and now project $1.9 billion in total CapEx for the year.
We remain on track for full year share repurchases of $800 million.

We also, as you'll recall, on our first quarter call, pointed towards the fact that comps would get a lot more difficult towards the latter end of the year because the second half of 2015 service started to improve and we started to work through the backlog of shipments in the automotive network. That in and of itself will put pressure on year-over-year comps. We still feel consistent with what we said on the first quarter call that our overall volumes for the year in automotive are going to approximate the North American vehicle growth, which right now puts at 1.1%."

On the first quarter call, we lowered our CapEx forecast for the full year from $2.1 billion to $2 billion. Today, we indicated as Jim has mentioned a couple times that we are modulating our capital moving proactive as we see the volumes softening and lowered another $100 million so we're currently at $1.9 billion. And the reductions have come in 3 general areas. The first area is in the unit costs and that's a very good news story because what Mike and the operating team has been able to do is and our maintenance of way area, they are reducing because we have more track time and other efficiencies that they have come up with that, self constructed assets that we do in our right-of-way, they've got less labor costs per unit. They have also got slightly lower pricing on some of the materials so the reductions there are in the unit costs so they're putting in the same number of units that we have planned but it costs less. The next biggest grouping is in the locomotive area. Mike mentioned that we do a lot of our locomotive works in-house. We have rebuilds that we had in the capital plan as the year went on and the volumes didn't come, we pulled out some of those rebuilds. So we have the flexibility to defer those and do them at a later year when we need the locomotives. The third area is spread around all the various parts of the capital budget and that is where we've either been able to trim the costs, in some cases in the materials cost or we've been able to defer it because the volumes have in common. An example of that would be parking at an intermodal terminal, so we might say we were going to expand parking but we will do it next year."

With me today are NS's Chief Marketing Officer, Alan Shaw; our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Wheeler; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart.
Our results this quarter, as shown on Slide 4, underscore the flexibility built into our team's planning and execution. Volumes came in below expectations, so we quickly reined in costs, pushing operating expenses down 11% in the face of a 10% decline in revenue. As a result, we posted a 68.6 operating ratio, 140 basis points or 2% below last year. Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.36, just 4% lower than last year's $1.41. For the first 6 months of 2016, our 69.4% operating ratio set a record while EPS increased 10% year-over-year.
These results reflect an unwavering focus on cost control and steadfast commitment to customer service. Thus, even as we aggressively reduced spending, we drove significant improvements in network performance, as shown by the 13% uptick in the composite service metric in the quarter and 18% increase in the first half.
Turning to Slide 5. Even in the current challenging environment, we believe we can achieve at least $200 million of productivity savings for the full year and an operating ratio below 70. Longer term, we will continue positioning for top line growth while targeting annual productivity savings of over $650 million by 2020 and an operating ratio below 65. Given our strong start this year, we are well on our way. 
Now Alan will cover trends in revenue; Mike will provide more detail on how we're managing the operation; and Marta will summarize our financial results; then we'll take your questions.

Norfolk Southern continues to face economic headwinds, especially in regard to energy prices. Declining coal shipments and fuel surcharge revenue, coupled with the Triple Crown restructuring and reduced crude oil volume, lowered top line in the second quarter. Excluding Triple Crown and fuel surcharges, intermodal revenue increased slightly year-over-year. In addition to decreased fuel surcharges, the mix associated with lower coal volume and increased intermodal reduced our second quarter revenue per unit despite accelerated pricing growth in the quarter.
Within our merchandise market, as shown on Slide 8, increased shipments of cement and steel benefited our metals and construction volume. While second quarter and expected full year automotive volume growth is in line with North American vehicle production, second half volumes will be influenced by competitive losses and plant-specific outages associated with decreased model demand, limiting year-over-year comparisons. 
Chemicals market declines were driven by crude oil and by plant closures and consolidations that reduced industrial intermediates traffic. Our agricultural markets were impacted by increased competition from local corn moving via truck and weaker feed exports. Merchandise RPU, excluding fuel, increased 2% due to positive pricing despite the negative mix associated with decreased industrial intermediates and frac sand.
As reflected on Slide 9, international intermodal growth of 4% partially offset losses in both domestic and Triple Crown freight. Our alignment with the ports and shipping lines adding capacity for growth will benefit the international segment over the long term.
Intermodal continues to be impacted by excess capacity in the truck market, a condition we expect to change next year. Lastly, the Triple Crown restructure will affect our year-over-year volume comparisons until midway through the fourth quarter.
Excluding Triple Crown and fuel surcharges, intermodal posted an increase of 1% in revenue, volume and RPU. RPU benefited from strong pricing despite the adverse mix associated with increased international freight.
Moving on to coal on Slide 10. Coal volumes declined as a result of sustained low natural gas prices, high stockpiles and continued weak export conditions. RPU, excluding fuel, remained flat, with positive pricing neutralized by mix, increased volumes of thermal export coal and
[Audio Gap]
And fourth quarter volume. Our 2016 pricing remains strong overall, though we do see some softness in truck-competitive sectors. We continue to focus on maintaining a service product that the market values, commanding a higher price and attracting service-sensitive business.
Lastly, as we monitor market conditions and changing volume expectations, we will control all aspects of our business impacted by these shifts. Marketing is collaborating closely with operating and finance departments to correctly align our resources with current volume trends. 
To further discuss our operations, I will now turn it over to Mike."

Turning to service on Slide 15, you see we further improved our already high service levels from the first quarter. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of improved service to our customers. For the second quarter, our service composite improved 13%, which was driven by a 32% improvement in train performance and an 11% improvement in shipments making [indiscernible] connection. So it is good to see all components of the service composite improving. What is equally encouraging is we have maintained and achieved this while aggressively and successfully pursuing cost-reduction initiatives as supported by our 68.6 operating ratio. We remain confident we can continue to keep service at a high level while we focus on continuing to identify and implement further cost-reduction initiatives. 
As you can see on Slide 16, our train speed and terminal dwell improved 12% and 9%, respectively, compared to the same period last year. Overall velocity, as measured at the car level, remains near our record levels and continues to aid our asset utilization and improved service for our customers. This has been a driver in being able to store 450 locomotives. We are also very pleased to see our service and velocity metrics remain very high even with the idling of Knoxville, a major hub terminal, on May 1.
Now on Slide 17. Our ability to keep the railroad operating at a high level while implementing aggressive cost-cutting initiatives resulted in significant productivity savings. Our reduction in crew starts was in line with our drop in volume, and we have continued to improve our train length, recrews and overtime. Together, this resulted in improved employee productivity. Also, our T&E headcount was down 9%, which helped drive a reduction in our overall corporate headcount. 
I will now turn it over to Marta, who will highlight the effect of these improvements."

Let's take a look at the second quarter financials. Slide 19 summarizes the operating results and highlights the expense control focus that Jim discussed. While revenues declined by 10% on the 7% lower volume,",690,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Let's take a look at the second quarter financials. Slide 19 summarizes the operating results and highlights the expense control focus that Jim discussed. While revenues declined by 10% on the 7% lower volume, our operating expenses were down 11%. This led to a much improved operating ratio of 68.6.
The next slide shows the expense reductions by category. As was the case in the first quarter, all categories, except for depreciation, were lower. Depreciation was up 4%, reflecting continued investment in our capital assets.
Now let's take a closer look at each of the other components. Slide 21 depicts the drop in fuel expense, totaling $81 million or 32% for the quarter. Lower oil prices resulted in a 25% decrease in the price per gallon while consumption fell by 6%.
Turning to Slide 22. Compensation costs were down by $57 million or 8%. As shown on the lower left of the slide, our average headcount for the quarter declined by about 2,000 employees versus last year and was flat sequentially.
Since we did not see the normal historical rise in volumes from the first to the second quarter, we were able to hold employment levels lower than previously expected. This reduced headcount, along with lower overtime and fewer recrews, resulted in $50 million of year-over-year savings. The associated payroll taxes were favorable by $11 million, and we had $9 million in lower pension expense.
These items were partially offset by $14 million in health and welfare rate increases associated with our agreement workforce. For the remainder of the year, we expect headcount to remain relatively flat, but we will face about a $30 million per quarter headwind for incentive comp since last year's third and fourth quarters included reversals of accruals. Of course, both of these expectations are based on our current volume projection. 
Purchased services and rents is depicted on Slide 23 and was down $54 million or 12%. Lower costs associated with the curtailed Triple Crown operations accounted for $38 million of the reduction and expenses related to joint facilities and haulage declined by $8 million.
Slide 24 details our Materials and other category, reflecting a decrease of $33 million or 14%. Reductions totaling $26 million were due to declines in materials usage for locomotives, freight cars and roadway, with the largest drop related to locomotives as a result of the fewer units in service that Mike mentioned.
For the remainder of the year, we continue to expect favorability in materials costs but at a somewhat moderated level of about $15 million per quarter compared with the third and fourth quarters of last year.
Next, taking a look at nonoperating income on Slide 25. We had a large relative decrease of $15 million in this category, which was primarily related to 3 items: reduced income associated with our leased coal properties; fewer gains on property sales; and costs for external advisers.
Moving on to income taxes on Slide 26. The effective rate for the second quarter was 36.3% versus 38.1% last year. The lower effective rate reflects a combination of small items, including corporate and life insurance, tax credits and a state tax law change. For the full year, we continue to expect an effective income tax rate of roughly 37%. 
Slide 27 shows our bottom line results, with net income of $405 million, a decrease of 6% versus 2015; and diluted earnings per share of $1.36, down 4% compared with last year. 
Wrapping up our financial overview on Slide 28. Cash from operations for the first 6 months was $1.4 billion, covering capital spending and producing $500 million in free cash flow. With respect to shareholder returns, we paid $350 million in dividends and repurchased $400 million of our shares. Going forward and in light of the still soft volumes, we have trimmed capital spending for the full year by another $100 million and now project $1.9 billion in total CapEx for the year. We remain on track for full year share repurchases of $800 million.
Thank you for your attention, and I'll turn the program back to Jim."

On the first quarter call, we lowered our CapEx forecast for the full year from $2.1 billion to $2 billion. Today, we've indicated, as Jim has mentioned a couple times, that we are modulating our capital. We're being proactive as we see the volume softening and lowered another $100 million. So we're currently at $1.9 billion. And the reductions have come in 3 general areas: The first area is in the unit costs. And that's a very good news story because what Mike and the operating team has been able to do is in our maintenance of way area, they are reducing because we have more track time and other efficiencies that they have come up with. The self-constructed assets that we do on our right of way, they've got less labor costs per unit. They have also got slightly lower pricing on some of the materials, so the reductions there are in the unit costs. So they're putting in the same number of units that we have planned, but it costs less. The next biggest grouping is in the locomotive area. Mike mentioned that we do a lot of our locomotive work in house. We have rebuilds that we had in the capital plan. As the year went on and the volumes didn't come, we pulled out some of those rebuilds. So we have the flexibility to defer those and do them at a later year when we need the locomotives. And the third area is spread around all the various parts of the capital budget. And that is where we've either been able to trim the costs, in some cases, in the materials cost, or we've been able to defer it because of what the volumes have in common. An example of that would be parking at an intermodal terminal. So we might say where we're going to expand parking, but we'll do it next year."

With me today are NS's Chief Marketing Officer, Alan Shaw; our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Wheeler; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart.
Our results this quarter, as shown on Slide 4, underscore the flexibility built into our team's planning and execution. Volumes came in below expectations, so we quickly reined in costs, pushing operating expenses down 11% in the face of a 10% decline in revenue. As a result, we posted a 68.6 operating ratio, 140 basis points or 2% below last year. Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.36, just 4% lower than last year's $1.41. For the first 6 months of 2016, our 69.4% operating ratio set a record while EPS increased 10% year-over-year.
These results reflect an unwavering focus on cost control and steadfast commitment to customer service. Thus, even as we aggressively reduced spending, we drove significant improvements in network performance, as shown by the 13% uptick in the composite service metric in the quarter and 18% increase in the first half.
Turning to Slide 5. Even in the current challenging environment, we believe we can achieve at least $200 million of productivity savings for the full year and an operating ratio below 70. Longer term, we will continue positioning for top line growth while targeting annual productivity savings of over $650 million by 2020 and an operating ratio below 65. Given our strong start this year, we are well on our way. 
Now Alan will cover trends in revenue; Mike will provide more detail on how we're managing the operation; and Marta will summarize our financial results; then we'll take your questions. But before I turn over the microphone, let me add a word of thanks to all our employees. Your intelligence and hard work are the keys to our success. Thank you.

Norfolk Southern continues to face economic headwinds, especially in regard to energy prices. Declining coal shipments and fuel surcharge revenue, coupled with the Triple Crown restructuring and reduced crude oil volume, lowered top line in the second quarter. Excluding Triple Crown and fuel surcharges, intermodal revenue increased slightly year-over-year. In addition to decreased fuel surcharges, the mix associated with lower coal volume and increased intermodal reduced our second quarter revenue per unit despite accelerated pricing growth in the quarter.
Within our merchandise market, as shown on Slide 8, increased shipments of cement and steel benefited our metals and construction volume. While second quarter and expected full year automotive volume growth is in line with North American vehicle production, second half volumes will be influenced by competitive losses and plant-specific outages associated with decreased model demand, limiting year-over-year comparisons. 
Chemicals market declines were driven by crude oil and by plant closures and consolidations that reduced industrial intermediates traffic. Our agricultural markets were impacted by increased competition from local corn moving via truck and weaker feed exports. Merchandise RPU, excluding fuel, increased 2% due to positive pricing despite the negative mix associated with decreased industrial intermediates and frac sand.
As reflected on Slide 9, international intermodal growth of 4% partially offset losses in both domestic and Triple Crown freight. Our alignment with the ports and shipping lines adding capacity for growth will benefit the international segment over the long term.
Intermodal continues to be impacted by excess capacity in the truck market, a condition we expect to change next year. Lastly, the Triple Crown restructure will affect our year-over-year volume comparisons until midway through the fourth quarter.
Excluding Triple Crown and fuel surcharges, intermodal posted an increase of 1% in revenue, volume and RPU. RPU benefited from strong pricing despite the adverse mix associated with increased international freight.
Moving on to coal on Slide 10. Coal volumes declined as a result of sustained low natural gas prices, high stockpiles and continued weak export conditions. RPU, excluding fuel, remained flat, with positive pricing neutralized by mix, increased volumes of thermal export coal and
[Audio Gap]
And fourth quarter volume. Our 2016 pricing remains strong overall, though we do see some softness in truck-competitive sectors. We continue to focus on maintaining a service product that the market values, commanding a higher price and attracting service-sensitive business.
Lastly, as we monitor market conditions and changing volume expectations, we will control all aspects of our business impacted by these shifts. Marketing is collaborating closely with operating and finance departments to correctly align our resources with current volume trends. 
To further discuss our operations, I will now turn it over to Mike."

I am pleased to announce we are continuing to operate at high service levels while achieving significant results in our cost-reduction initiatives, as Jim noted, thanks to the commitment and focus of our employees on executing these key drivers of our strategic plan. The following results are due to NS employees' hard work. 
Let me begin with safety on Slide 14. While our reportable injury ratio increased in the second quarter as compared to the same period last year, we have seen an improvement sequentially this year, which is encouraging. We also maintained a low serious injury ratio. 
Turning to service on Slide 15, you see we further improved our already high service levels from the first quarter. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of improved service to our customers. For the second quarter, our service composite improved 13%, which was driven by a 32% improvement in train performance and an 11% improvement in shipments making their connection. So it is good to see all components of the service composite improving. What is equally encouraging is we have maintained and achieved this while aggressively and successfully pursuing cost-reduction initiatives as supported by our 68.6 operating ratio. We remain confident we can continue to keep service at a high level while we focus on continuing to identify and implement further cost-reduction initiatives. 
As you can see on Slide 16, our train speed and terminal dwell improved 12% and 9%, respectively, compared to the same period last year. Overall velocity, as measured at the car level, remains near our record levels and continues to aid our asset utilization and improved service for our customers. This has been a driver in being able to store 450 locomotives. We are also very pleased to see our service and velocity metrics remain very high even with the idling of Knoxville, a major hump terminal, on May 1.
Now on Slide 17. Our ability to keep the railroad operating at a high level while implementing aggressive cost-cutting initiatives resulted in significant productivity savings. Our reduction in crew starts was in line with our drop in volume, and we have continued to improve our train length, recrews and overtime. Together, this resulted in improved employee productivity. Also, our T&E headcount was down 9%, which helped drive a reduction in our overall corporate headcount. 
I will now turn it over to Marta, who will highlight the effect of these improvements."

Let's take a look at the second quarter financials. Slide 19 summarizes the operating results and highlights the expense control focus that Jim discussed. While revenues declined by 10% on the 7% lower volume,",690,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Let's take a look at the second quarter financials. Slide 19 summarizes the operating results and highlights the expense control focus that Jim discussed. While revenues declined by 10% on the 7% lower volume, our operating expenses were down 11%. This led to a much improved operating ratio of 68.6.
The next slide shows the expense reductions by category. As was the case in the first quarter, all categories, except for depreciation, were lower. Depreciation was up 4%, reflecting continued investment in our capital assets.
Now let's take a closer look at each of the other components. Slide 21 depicts the drop in fuel expense, totaling $81 million or 32% for the quarter. Lower oil prices resulted in a 25% decrease in the price per gallon while consumption fell by 6%.
Turning to Slide 22. Compensation costs were down by $57 million or 8%. As shown on the lower left of the slide, our average headcount for the quarter declined by about 2,000 employees versus last year and was flat sequentially.
Since we did not see the normal historical rise in volumes from the first to the second quarter, we were able to hold employment levels lower than previously expected. This reduced headcount, along with lower overtime and fewer recrews, resulted in $50 million of year-over-year savings. The associated payroll taxes were favorable by $11 million, and we had $9 million in lower pension expense.
These items were partially offset by $14 million in health and welfare rate increases associated with our agreement workforce. For the remainder of the year, we expect headcount to remain relatively flat, but we will face about a $30 million per quarter headwind for incentive comp since last year's third and fourth quarters included reversals of accruals. Of course, both of these expectations are based on our current volume projection. 
Purchased services and rents is depicted on Slide 23 and was down $54 million or 12%. Lower costs associated with the curtailed Triple Crown operations accounted for $38 million of the reduction and expenses related to joint facilities and haulage declined by $8 million.
Slide 24 details our Materials and other category, reflecting a decrease of $33 million or 14%. Reductions totaling $26 million were due to declines in materials usage for locomotives, freight cars and roadway, with the largest drop related to locomotives as a result of the fewer units in service that Mike mentioned.
For the remainder of the year, we continue to expect favorability in materials costs but at a somewhat moderated level of about $15 million per quarter compared with the third and fourth quarters of last year.
Next, taking a look at nonoperating income on Slide 25. We had a large relative decrease of $15 million in this category, which was primarily related to 3 items: reduced income associated with our leased coal properties; fewer gains on property sales; and costs for external advisers.
Moving on to income taxes on Slide 26. The effective rate for the second quarter was 36.3% versus 38.1% last year. The lower effective rate reflects a combination of small items, including corporate and life insurance, tax credits and a state tax law change. For the full year, we continue to expect an effective income tax rate of roughly 37%. 
Slide 27 shows our bottom line results, with net income of $405 million, a decrease of 6% versus 2015; and diluted earnings per share of $1.36, down 4% compared with last year. 
Wrapping up our financial overview on Slide 28. Cash from operations for the first 6 months was $1.4 billion, covering capital spending and producing $500 million in free cash flow. With respect to shareholder returns, we paid $350 million in dividends and repurchased $400 million of our shares. Going forward and in light of the still soft volumes, we have trimmed capital spending for the full year by another $100 million and now project $1.9 billion in total CapEx for the year. We remain on track for full year share repurchases of $800 million.
Thank you for your attention, and I'll turn the program back to Jim."

On the first quarter call, we lowered our CapEx forecast for the full year from $2.1 billion to $2 billion. Today, we've indicated, as Jim has mentioned a couple times, that we are modulating our capital. We're being proactive as we see the volume softening and lowered another $100 million. So we're currently at $1.9 billion. And the reductions have come in 3 general areas: The first area is in the unit costs. And that's a very good news story because what Mike and the operating team has been able to do is in our maintenance of way area, they are reducing because we have more track time and other efficiencies that they have come up with. The self-constructed assets that we do on our right of way, they've got less labor costs per unit. They have also got slightly lower pricing on some of the materials, so the reductions there are in the unit costs. So they're putting in the same number of units that we have planned, but it costs less. The next biggest grouping is in the locomotive area. Mike mentioned that we do a lot of our locomotive work in house. We have rebuilds that we had in the capital plan. As the year went on and the volumes didn't come, we pulled out some of those rebuilds. So we have the flexibility to defer those and do them at a later year when we need the locomotives. And the third area is spread around all the various parts of the capital budget. And that is where we've either been able to trim the costs, in some cases, in the materials cost, or we've been able to defer it because of the volumes have not come. An example of that would be parking at an intermodal terminal. So we might say where we're going to expand parking, but we'll do it next year."

With me today are NS's Chief Marketing Officer, Alan Shaw; our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Wheeler; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart.
Our results this quarter, as shown on Slide 4, underscore the flexibility built into our team's planning and execution. Volumes came in below expectations, so we quickly reined in costs, pushing operating expenses down 11% in the face of a 10% decline in revenue. As a result, we posted a 68.6 operating ratio, 140 basis points or 2% below last year. Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.36, just 4% lower than last year's $1.41. For the first 6 months of 2016, our 69.4% operating ratio set a record while EPS increased 10% year-over-year.
These results reflect an unwavering focus on cost control and steadfast commitment to customer service. Thus, even as we aggressively reduced spending, we drove significant improvements in network performance, as shown by the 13% uptick in the composite service metric in the quarter and 18% increase in the first half.
Turning to Slide 5. Even in the current challenging environment, we believe we can achieve at least $200 million of productivity savings for the full year and an operating ratio below 70. Longer term, we will continue positioning for top line growth while targeting annual productivity savings of over $650 million by 2020 and an operating ratio below 65. Given our strong start this year, we are well on our way. 
Now Alan will cover trends in revenue; Mike will provide more detail on how we're managing the operation; and Marta will summarize our financial results; then we'll take your questions.

Norfolk Southern continues to face economic headwinds, especially in regard to energy prices. Declining coal shipments and fuel surcharge revenue, coupled with the Triple Crown restructuring and reduced crude oil volume, lowered top line in the second quarter. Excluding Triple Crown and fuel surcharges, intermodal revenue increased slightly year-over-year. In addition to decreased fuel surcharges, the mix associated with lower coal volume and increased intermodal reduced our second quarter revenue per unit despite accelerated pricing growth in the quarter.
Within our merchandise market, as shown on Slide 8, increased shipments of cement and steel benefited our metals and construction volume. While second quarter and expected full year automotive volume growth is in line with North American vehicle production, second half volumes will be influenced by competitive losses and plant-specific outages associated with decreased model demand, limiting year-over-year comparisons. 
Chemicals market declines were driven by crude oil and by plant closures and consolidations that reduced industrial intermediates traffic. Our agricultural markets were impacted by increased competition from local corn moving via truck and weaker feed exports. Merchandise RPU, excluding fuel, increased 2% due to positive pricing despite the negative mix associated with decreased industrial intermediates and frac sand.
As reflected on Slide 9, international intermodal growth of 4% partially offset losses in both domestic and Triple Crown freight. Our alignment with the ports and shipping lines adding capacity for growth will benefit the international segment over the long term.
Intermodal continues to be impacted by excess capacity in the truck market, a condition we expect to change next year. Lastly, the Triple Crown restructure will affect our year-over-year volume comparisons until midway through the fourth quarter.
Excluding Triple Crown and fuel surcharges, intermodal posted an increase of 1% in revenue, volume and RPU. RPU benefited from strong pricing despite the adverse mix associated with increased international freight.
Moving on to coal on Slide 10. Coal volumes declined as a result of sustained low natural gas prices, high stockpiles and continued weak export conditions. RPU, excluding fuel, remained flat, with positive pricing neutralized by mix, increased volumes of thermal export coal and
[Audio Gap]
And fourth quarter volume. Our 2016 pricing remains strong overall, though we do see some softness in truck-competitive sectors. We continue to focus on maintaining a service product that the market values, commanding a higher price and attracting service-sensitive business.
Lastly, as we monitor market conditions and changing volume expectations, we will control all aspects of our business impacted by these shifts. Marketing is collaborating closely with operating and finance departments to correctly align our resources with current volume trends. 
To further discuss our operations, I will now turn it over to Mike."

I am pleased to announce we are continuing to operate at high service levels while achieving significant results in our cost-reduction initiatives, as Jim noted, thanks to the commitment and focus of our employees on executing these key drivers of our strategic plan. The following results are due to NS employees' hard work. 
Let me begin with safety on Slide 14. While our reportable injury ratio increased in the second quarter as compared to the same period last year, we have seen an improvement sequentially this year, which is encouraging. We also maintained a low serious injury ratio. 
Turning to service on Slide 15, you see we further improved our already high service levels from the first quarter. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of improved service to our customers. For the second quarter, our service composite improved 13%, which was driven by a 32% improvement in train performance and an 11% improvement in shipments making their connection. So it is good to see all components of the service composite improving. What is equally encouraging is we have maintained and achieved this while aggressively and successfully pursuing cost-reduction initiatives as supported by our 68.6 operating ratio. We remain confident we can continue to keep service at a high level while we focus on continuing to identify and implement further cost-reduction initiatives. 
As you can see on Slide 16, our train speed and terminal dwell improved 12% and 9%, respectively, compared to the same period last year. Overall velocity, as measured at the car level, remains near our record levels and continues to aid our asset utilization and improved service for our customers. This has been a driver in being able to store 450 locomotives. We are also very pleased to see our service and velocity metrics remain very high even with the idling of Knoxville, a major hump terminal, on May 1.
Now on Slide 17. Our ability to keep the railroad operating at a high level while implementing aggressive cost-cutting initiatives resulted in significant productivity savings. Our reduction in crew starts was in line with our drop in volume, and we have continued to improve our train length, recrews and overtime. Together, this resulted in improved employee productivity. Also, our T&E headcount was down 9%, which helped drive a reduction in our overall corporate headcount. 
I will now turn it over to Marta, who will highlight the effect of these improvements."
292268,370572866,1014693,"Norfolk Southern Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Norfolk Southern Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Let's take a look at the second quarter financials. Slide 19 summarizes the operating results and highlights the expense control focus that Jim discussed. While revenues declined by 10% on the 7% lower volume,",690,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Let's take a look at the second quarter financials. Slide 19 summarizes the operating results and highlights the expense control focus that Jim discussed. While revenues declined by 10% on the 7% lower volume, our operating expenses were down 11%. This led to a much improved operating ratio of 68.6.
The next slide shows the expense reductions by category. As was the case in the first quarter, all categories, except for depreciation, were lower. Depreciation was up 4%, reflecting continued investment in our capital assets.
Now let's take a closer look at each of the other components. Slide 21 depicts the drop in fuel expense, totaling $81 million or 32% for the quarter. Lower oil prices resulted in a 25% decrease in the price per gallon while consumption fell by 6%.
Turning to Slide 22. Compensation costs were down by $57 million or 8%. As shown on the lower left of the slide, our average headcount for the quarter declined by about 2,000 employees versus last year and was flat sequentially.
Since we did not see the normal historical rise in volumes from the first to the second quarter, we were able to hold employment levels lower than previously expected. This reduced headcount, along with lower overtime and fewer recrews, resulted in $50 million of year-over-year savings. The associated payroll taxes were favorable by $11 million, and we had $9 million in lower pension expense.
These items were partially offset by $14 million in health and welfare rate increases associated with our agreement workforce. For the remainder of the year, we expect headcount to remain relatively flat, but we will face about a $30 million per quarter headwind for incentive comp since last year's third and fourth quarters included reversals of accruals. Of course, both of these expectations are based on our current volume projection. 
Purchased services and rents is depicted on Slide 23 and was down $54 million or 12%. Lower costs associated with the curtailed Triple Crown operations accounted for $38 million of the reduction and expenses related to joint facilities and haulage declined by $8 million.
Slide 24 details our Materials and other category, reflecting a decrease of $33 million or 14%. Reductions totaling $26 million were due to declines in materials usage for locomotives, freight cars and roadway, with the largest drop related to locomotives as a result of the fewer units in service that Mike mentioned.
For the remainder of the year, we continue to expect favorability in materials costs but at a somewhat moderated level of about $15 million per quarter compared with the third and fourth quarters of last year.
Next, taking a look at nonoperating income on Slide 25. We had a large relative decrease of $15 million in this category, which was primarily related to 3 items: reduced income associated with our leased coal properties; fewer gains on property sales; and costs for external advisers.
Moving on to income taxes on Slide 26. The effective rate for the second quarter was 36.3% versus 38.1% last year. The lower effective rate reflects a combination of small items, including corporate and life insurance, tax credits and a state tax law change. For the full year, we continue to expect an effective income tax rate of roughly 37%. 
Slide 27 shows our bottom line results, with net income of $405 million, a decrease of 6% versus 2015; and diluted earnings per share of $1.36, down 4% compared with last year. 
Wrapping up our financial overview on Slide 28. Cash from operations for the first 6 months was $1.4 billion, covering capital spending and producing $500 million in free cash flow. With respect to shareholder returns, we paid $350 million in dividends and repurchased $400 million of our shares. Going forward and in light of the still soft volumes, we have trimmed capital spending for the full year by another $100 million and now project $1.9 billion in total CapEx for the year. We remain on track for full year share repurchases of $800 million.

I mentioned the fact that we're seeing additional competition within our ag markets. That also has to do with the strength of the crop in the Southeast.

So it certainly has had an impact, as we know, on our domestic intermodal volumes and also on our carload business.

On the first quarter call, we lowered our CapEx forecast for the full year from $2.1 billion to $2 billion. Today, we've indicated, as Jim has mentioned a couple times, that we are modulating our capital. We're being proactive as we see the volume softening and lowered another $100 million. So we're currently at $1.9 billion. And the reductions have come in 3 general areas: The first area is in the unit costs. And that's a very good news story because what Mike and the operating team has been able to do is in our maintenance of way area, they are reducing because we have more track time and other efficiencies that they have come up with. The self-constructed assets that we do on our right of way, they've got less labor costs per unit. They have also got slightly lower pricing on some of the materials, so the reductions there are in the unit costs. So they're putting in the same number of units that we have planned, but it costs less. The next biggest grouping is in the locomotive area. Mike mentioned that we do a lot of our locomotive work in house. We have rebuilds that we had in the capital plan. As the year went on and the volumes didn't come, we pulled out some of those rebuilds. So we have the flexibility to defer those and do them at a later year when we need the locomotives. And the third area is spread around all the various parts of the capital budget. And that is where we've either been able to trim the costs, in some cases, in the materials cost, or we've been able to defer it because of the volumes have not come. An example of that would be parking at an intermodal terminal. So we might say where we're going to expand parking, but we'll do it next year."

This marked an improvement of 220 basis points or 3% compared to last year as operating expenses came in 10% lower relative to a 7% decline in revenue.
We extended the high performance levels we have reliably delivered throughout this year into the third quarter, resulting in a record 68.7% operating ratio for the 9-month period. As a result of our efforts, earnings per share for the quarter increased to $1.55, up 4% compared to last year's $1.49. For the 9-month period, earnings per share increased 8% year-over-year. Importantly, we have significantly improved network performance as shown by our composite service metric, which was up 8% for the quarter and 14% for the year. These results, in addition to the feedback I am receiving first-hand from our customers, confirm what we are already know. Our commitment to customer service in tandem with our disciplined cost measures continues to move our company in the right direction. With respect to network initiatives, Mike will go over our progress in greater detail. But let me highlight there our team has already exceeded the 2016 rationalization goal of 1000 miles. And we'll continue to pursue these kinds of opportunities in the future.
Turning to Slide 5. As we enter this year, we had committed to lowering our operating ratio below 70% for the year, which I am pleased to say we are well positioned to achieve even with economic headwinds. Our cost savings initiatives will generate productivity savings of at least $200 million for the year, upwards of $250 million in fact, and we will contain capital spending to $1.9 billion, which is lower than our original $2.1 billion plan as we continually reassess the optimal deployment of capital in this changing economic environment. Our employees have consistently demonstrated their commitment to reliably delivering superior results in what has been a dynamic and challenging economic environment. We have worked hard to build a flexible strategy, one that stages us well for top line growth coupled with annual productivity savings, which are targeted for over $650 million by 2020. This team's strong start in 2016 reinforces my confidence in our ability to achieve a sub-65% operating ratio by 2020 and deliver substantial shareholder value.
Now Alan will cover trends in revenue. Mike will provide more detail on how we're managing the operation, including the progress I mentioned on our line rationalization initiatives, and Marta will summarize our financial results, then we'll take your questions. Thank you. And now I'll turn the call over to Alan."

We appreciate you joining us today. So easing economic headwinds contributed to a 3% sequential improvement in revenue as compared to the second quarter of 2016.

So easing economic headwinds contributed to a 3% sequential improvement in revenue as compared to the second quarter of 2016. Our $2.5 billion of third quarter revenue represented a 7% year-over-year decline primarily driven by decreases in energy-related markets and the Triple Crown restructuring. The hot summer sequentially higher natural gas prices soften declines in utility -- so stockpile levels continue to dampen year-over-year comparisons. The Triple Crown restructuring enhanced our overall efficiency and profitability while yielding year-over-year volume and revenue declines since the fourth quarter of 2015. While energy prices improved in the third quarter, they remain below last year's levels and negatively influenced fuel surcharge revenue and several merchandise commodities, including crude oil and natural gas products.
Amid the challenging economic conditions, intermodal remain the bright spot with improved service driving growth and domestic business. Despite pricing gains, revenue per unit declined 3% due to negative mix associated with increased intermodal freight and decreased coal volume as well as lower fuel surcharge revenue.
Merchandise revenue and volume, as shown on Slide 8, fell 4% in the third quarter. Our chemicals franchise impacted by continued reductions in crude oil shipments as well as plant closures and consolidations in our industrial intermediates markets further declined from the second quarter and was a primary driver of the year-over-year merchandise decrease.
Agriculture was impacted by reduced feed, wheat and corn volume compared to 2015. Automotive shipments were down as a result of a competitive loss, as mentioned in our second quarter call, and production declines in several NS serve plants. A weak pulp board market combined with increased our competition negatively impacted paper and forest products points. These decreases were partially offset by metals and construction volume, which increased year-over-year and sequentially due to stronger shipments of steel and aggregates. As compared to last year, merchandise RPU increased 1% reflecting positive pricing gains partially offset by negative mix associated with increased aggregates and coil steel as well as reduced industrial intermediates and machinery volume.
Turning to intermodal on Slide 9, volume declined 1% as year-over-year growth in domestic and international volume nearly offset the declines related to the Triple Crown restructure. Excluding Triple Crown, volume was up 6% while revenue increased 5%. Despite excess truck capacity, our improved service product drove an 8% year-over-year increase in domestic intermodal business. International volume increased 1% compared to a strong third quarter last year.
Lower volumes of high rated Triple Crown freight and lower fuel surcharge revenue negatively impacted RPU, down 7% as compared to last year. Excluding Triple Crown and fuel surcharges, RPU was up 2% and is highly competitive truck price environment while revenue improved 8%. 
On Slide 10, coal revenue was down 18% for the quarter with a 15% volume decline as compared to last year. Year-over-year utility volume continued to be negatively impacted by low natural gas prices and above-normal stockpile levels. Warmer summer weather and sequentially higher natural gas prices improved coal dispatch and utility deliveries as the third quarter progress, generating 18.4 million guilty tons, a 28% improvement from the second quarter. [indiscernible] utility volumes will be dependent upon weather conditions, natural gas prices and stockpile levels. Between May and September, stockpiles declined by approximately 20 days of burn though they remained 25 days above targeted levels and are expected to impact utility volumes into next year.
Assuming normal weather conditions and natural gas pricing consistent with the current forward curve, we expect to handle between 15 million and 18 million utility tons in the fourth quarter.
While there has been recent strength in spot pricing in the seaborne markets, U.S. export supply has been constrained by the impact of bankruptcies and production rationalizations. Third quarter thermal exports through Baltimore declined significantly as tonnage shipped to the domestic utility market. For the fourth quarter, we expect to handle 3 million to 4 million export tons with sequential increases in thermal coal through Baltimore.
Coal RPU excluding fuel was down 2% in the third quarter with positive pricing offset by the mix of reduced export volume. 
Turning to our outlook on Slide 11, we expect fourth quarter volumes to be flat or increase modestly year-over-year due in part to somewhat easier comparisons. In mid-November, we will cycle the impact of Triple Crown. The fourth quarter kind of being also mark the start of the unseasonably warm winter that generated access to all stockpiles, the effect of global steel oversupply as well as the beginning of the impact of increased manufacturing and retail inventories.
Lastly, we expect a lower year-over-year fuel surcharge revenue decline with WTI and on highway diesel prices was the fourth quarter 2015 levels. Though some stockpile correction occurred in the third quarter, we expect the ongoing inventory overhang to impact fourth quarter utility coal volumes.
Sustained low oil prices and narrow spread between Brent and WTI will continue to limit crude oil -- volume. Though automotive volume for the full year is expected to exceed North American vehicle production growth of 1%, fourth quarter shipments will decline as compared to last year. We anticipate year-over-year service driven growth within intermodal. We will maintain our focus on improved pricing, reflecting the value of our service product. Overall, revenue per unit will be impacted by the ongoing mixed headwinds associated with increased intermodal and decreased coal freight. Our long-term view on both markets and pricing enables us to navigate the current economic headwinds while positioning us for future growth. Marketing continues to work closely with operations and finance, executing on our financial plan amid dynamic market conditions, controlling what we can control, assuring that resources are in place to support expected volumes and allowing us to take advantage of opportunities for long-term growth. I will now turn it over to Mike to discuss our operational performance."

I am pleased to announce we are continuing to operate at high service levels while making outstanding progress on our cost-reduction initiatives. As Jim noted, the progress we have made is a testament to our employees and their commitment and focus in exiting the key drivers of our strategic plan.
Let me begin with safety on Slide 13. While our reportable injury ratio increased in the third quarter as compared to the same period last year, we had an 18% improvement in our serious injury ratio. 
Turning to service on Slide 14. You see we continued to execute at a very high level as evidenced by our service composite, train speed and terminal dwell metrics. This is the second quarter in a row with the service composite above 80%. For the third quarter, our service composite and train speed both improved 8% and dwell improved 3% versus the same period last year. Overall, our velocity, as measured at the core level. Remains the record levels in continues to aid asset utilization and strong customer service. What is most encouraging is that we have been able to do this while aggressively pursuing cost-reduction initiatives as evidenced by our 67.5% operating ratio. The improvements in our service metrics demonstrates our continued commitment to driving productivity improvements and increasing customer service.
Now on Slide 15, these cost-cutting initiatives, coupled with our ability to keep the railroad operating at a high level, continued to result in significant productivity savings. The reduction in crew starts for the third quarter significant we are based the decline in volume, and we have continued to improve our recrews, over time and train length. Through the third quarter, we have achieved our highest average train length on record. Even with a significant improvement in train length, our velocity has been roughly the same as our record levels of 2012 and 2013. Together, this resulted in an improved employee productivity. 
Turning to Slide 16. In our previous call, we said we would give an update on our network rationalization efforts. We have been going at this in a very deliberate way with 3 separate strategies tailored to the specific circumstances with the goal of maintaining or improving service to our customers while reducing our cost and investment needs. To that end, the most visible way we are changing network is getting a short line carrier to operate lower volume segments. We have completed 1 large transaction with the West Virginia Secondary and another transaction is in process. This benefits NS by enabling us to improve capital allocation, continue to serve the customers and maintain our network reach.
As illustrated on Slide 17, we are also concentrating flows on fewer routes. For example, we idled 1 of our steepest and most difficult-to-operate lines in the coal fields by rerouting coal trains on to our mainline, which had excess capacity. To retain flexibility, the old route was left in place for now in case there is a business rebound. We have done this at several locations even outside the coal network and are continuing to identify opportunities across the system. 
Lastly, on Slide 18, even if we decide to continue using a route, we have found it is possible to reduce speeds without affecting customer service. These are our secondary mainlines. By reducing speeds, we can extend the life of track without affecting safety and delay reinvestment needs. We also realized some modest expense savings as well.
This is a new strategy for NS and reflects a willingness to re-examine our business model in the face of economic realities. Using our full toolkit, we have already exceeded our 1000-mile goal for 2016 while velocity and service have remained near our historic highs.
I will not turn it over to Marta, who will cover the financials."

The third quarter results showed continued strong cost control in the face of modest overall volume decline. Let's take a look at the financial details starting with operating results on Slide 20. While revenue",729,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter results showed continued strong cost control in the face of modest overall volume decline. Let's take a look at the financial details starting with operating results on Slide 20. While revenues were down 7% on 4% lower volume, operating expenses declined by 10%. The 67.5% operating ratio for the quarter was a 3% improvement over last year's third quarter, and the operating ratio of 68.7% for the first 9 months was an all-time record.
Slide 21 shows the expense reductions by income statement line item. Every category of cost was lower in 2015, a result of targeted expense reduction initiatives and the lower volume.
Additionally, the comparison was affected by last year's restructuring cost particularly in depreciation. 
Now let's take a closer look at the composite. Slide 22 highlights the major drivers of the variance in compensation and benefit. While the overall net change was relatively small at $11 million, it contains some offsetting items.
First, with regard to employee count and employee hours, the efficiency improvement in the first half of the year continued as overall headcount was down over 2,400 employees versus last year and was down slightly sequentially. This reduced headcount along with lower overtime and fewer recrews resulted in $47 million of year-over-year savings and the associated payroll taxes were favorable by $5 million. We also have $9 million in lower pension expense. These items help offset increases in incentive compensation of $39 million, wage inflation of $14 million and health and wealth increases of $12 million. For the remainder of the year, we expect headcount to remain relatively flat sequentially. With regard to incentive comp, wage rates and health and welfare cost, we expect to have similar year-over-year increases in the fourth quarter as we had in the third quarter.
Slide 23 depicts purchased services and rents, which was down $65 million or 14% year-over-year. The largest reduction was attributable to $37 million in decreased Triple Crown cost. Recall that the curtailment of Triple Crown operations was affected on November 15 of last year, so our fourth quarter variance for this item will be about half this amount.
Also contributing to the reduction in this line item was $7 million of lower equipment rent. This was due primarily to the improved velocity Mike described, and we expect this benefit to continue into the fourth quarter.
Next is fuel expense as shown on Slide 24. The $40 million or 18% decline in fuel costs for the quarter was largely a result of lower oil prices, which decreased the price per gallon by 12%.
We also have lower consumption due to the lower traffic volume. Slide 25 details our materials and other category, which decreased $54 million or 22% year-over-year. This improvement reflects $28 million of gains on the sale of 2 operating -- 
Next, reductions in the material cost totaling $15 million were primarily for locomotive and freight car material. And the last variance on this slide is principally due to move-in costs associated with last year's office closure.
Turning to nonoperating items on Slide 26. This, too, was affected by the prior year comparison as we had a large gain on the sale of the nonoperating property in the third quarter of 2015. Somewhat offsetting this decrease were higher returns from corporate and life insurance.
Moving on to income taxes on Slide 27. The effective rate for the third quarter was 34.8% versus 37.6%. The lower effective rate was related to the increased life insurance return as well as to the effects of stock-based compensation and several other small items.
For the full year, we now expect to have an effective income tax rate of roughly 36%. Summarizing our third quarter earnings on Slide 28. Net income was $460 million, up 2% versus 2015; and diluted earnings per share were $1.55, 4% higher than last year.
Wrapping up with year-to-date cash flows on Slide 29. Cash from operations was $2.3 billion, and free cash flow was a little over $1 billion. With respect to capital return to shareholders, we have paid $523 million in dividends and repurchased 603 million of our shares.
We remain on track for full year capital spending of $1.9 billion and a share repurchases of $800 million. Thank you for your attention, and I'll turn the program back to Jim."

With me today are NSC's Chief Marketing Officer, Alan Shaw; our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Wheeler; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart.
Our results this quarter summarized on Slide 4 reflect the successful proactive measures and strategies that Norfolk Southern continues to employ as we relentlessly focus on delivering results through efficiencies and asset utilization. We continue our focus on deploying resources to improve service and network performance while streamlining our corporate assets.
Targeted cost initiatives and the disposition of surplus operating property combined with the lapping of prior year restructuring costs drove a 67.5% operating ratio. This marked an improvement of 220 basis points or 3% compared to last year as operating expenses came in 10% lower, relative to a 7% decline in revenue.
We extended the high performance levels we have reliably delivered throughout this year into the third quarter, resulting in a record 68.7% operating ratio for the 9-month period. As a result of our efforts, earnings per share for the quarter increased to $1.55, up 4% compared to last year's $1.49. For the 9-month period, earnings per share increased 8% year-over-year. Importantly, we have significantly improved network performance as shown by our composite service metric, which was up 8% for the quarter and 14% for the year. These results, in addition to feedback I am receiving first-hand from our customers, confirm what we already know. Our commitment to customer service in tandem with our disciplined cost measures continues to move our company in the right direction. With respect to network initiatives, Mike will go over our progress in greater detail. But let me highlight that our team has already exceeded the 2016 rationalization goal of 1000 miles. And we'll continue to pursue these kinds of opportunities in the future.
Turning to Slide 5. As we entered this year, we had committed to lowering our operating ratio below 70% for the year, which I am pleased to say we are well positioned to achieve even with economic headwinds. Our cost savings initiatives will generate productivity savings of at least $200 million for the year, upwards of $250 million in fact, and we will contain capital spending to $1.9 billion, which is lower than our original $2.1 billion plan as we continually reassess the optimal deployment of capital in this changing economic environment. Our employees have consistently demonstrated their commitment to reliably delivering superior results in what has been a dynamic and challenging economic environment. We have worked hard to build a flexible strategy, one that stages us well for top line growth coupled with annual productivity savings, which are targeted for over $650 million by 2020. This team's strong start in 2016 reinforces my confidence in our ability to achieve a sub-65% operating ratio by 2020 and deliver substantial shareholder value.
Now Alan will cover trends in revenue. Mike will provide more detail on how we're managing the operation, including the progress I mentioned on our line rationalization initiatives, and Marta will summarize our financial results. Then we'll take your questions. Thank you. And now I'll turn the call over to Alan."
292268,403851870,1062066,"Norfolk Southern Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Norfolk Southern Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning to our audience. We appreciate your joining us today. So easing economic headwinds contributed to a 3% sequential improvement in revenue as compared to the second quarter of 2016. Our $2.5 billion in third quarter revenue",981,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning to our audience. We appreciate your joining us today. So easing economic headwinds contributed to a 3% sequential improvement in revenue as compared to the second quarter of 2016. Our $2.5 billion in third quarter revenue represented a 7% year-over-year decline, primarily driven by decreases in energy-related markets and the Triple Crown restructure. The hot summer and sequentially higher natural gas prices softened declines in utility coal. So high stockpile levels continued to dampen year-over-year comparisons. The Triple Crown restructure enhanced our overall efficiency and profitability while yielding year-over-year volume and revenue declines since the fourth quarter of 2015. While energy prices improved in the third quarter, they remain below last year's levels and negatively influenced fuel surcharge revenue and several merchandise commodities, including crude oil and natural gas products.
Amid the challenging economic conditions, intermodal remained a bright spot with improved service driving growth in domestic business. Despite pricing gains, revenue per unit declined 3% due to negative mix associated with increased intermodal freight and decreased coal volume as well as lower fuel surcharge revenue.
Merchandise revenue and volume, as shown on Slide 8, fell 4% in the third quarter. Our chemicals franchise, impacted by continued reductions in crude oil shipments as well as plant closures and consolidations in our industrial intermediates markets, further declined from the second quarter and was the primary driver of the year-over-year merchandise decrease.
Agriculture was impacted by reduced feed, wheat and corn volume compared to 2015. Automotive shipments were down as a result of a competitive loss, as mentioned on our second quarter call, and production declines at several NS-served plants. A weak pulp board market combined with increased truck competition negatively impacted paper and forest products volume. These decreases were partially offset by metals and construction volume, which increased year-over-year and sequentially due to stronger shipments of steel and aggregates. As compared to last year, merchandise RPU increased 1% reflecting positive pricing gains partially offset by negative mix associated with increased aggregates and coil steel as well as reduced industrial intermediates and machinery volume.
Turning to intermodal on Slide 9. Volume declined 1% as year-over-year growth in domestic and international volume nearly offset the declines related to the Triple Crown restructure. Excluding Triple Crown, volume was up 6% while revenue increased 5%. Despite excess truck capacity, our improved service product drove an 8% year-over-year increase in domestic intermodal business. International volume increased 1% compared to a strong third quarter last year.
Lower volumes of high-rated Triple Crown freight and lower fuel surcharge revenue negatively impacted RPU, down 7% as compared to last year. Excluding Triple Crown and fuel surcharges, RPU was up 2% in this highly competitive truck price environment while revenue improved 8%. 
On Slide 10, coal revenue was down 18% for the quarter with a 15% volume decline as compared to last year. Year-over-year utility volume continued to be negatively impacted by low natural gas prices and above-normal stockpile levels. Warmer summer weather and sequentially higher natural gas prices improved coal dispatch and utility deliveries as the third quarter progressed, generating 18.4 million utility tons, a 28% improvement from the second quarter. Future utility volumes will be dependent upon weather conditions, natural gas prices and stockpile levels. Between May and September, stockpiles declined by approximately 20 days of burn though they remained 25 days above targeted levels and are expected to impact utility volumes into next year.
Assuming normal weather conditions and natural gas pricing consistent with the current forward curve, we expect to handle between 15 million and 18 million utility tons in the fourth quarter.
While there has been recent strength in spot pricing in the seaborne markets, U.S. export supply has been constrained by the impact of bankruptcies and production rationalizations. Third quarter thermal exports through Baltimore declined significantly as tonnage shifted to the domestic utility market. For the fourth quarter, we expect to handle 3 million to 4 million export tons with sequential increases in thermal coal through Baltimore.
Coal RPU excluding fuel was down 2% in the third quarter with positive pricing offset by the mix of reduced export volume. 
Turning to our outlook on Slide 11, we expect fourth quarter volumes to be flat or increase modestly year-over-year due in part to somewhat easier comparisons. In mid-November, we will cycle the impact of Triple Crown. The fourth quarter of 2015 also marked the start of the unseasonably warm winter that generated access coal stockpiles, the effect of global steel oversupply as well as the beginning of the impact of increased manufacturing and retail inventories.
Lastly, we expect a lower year-over-year fuel surcharge revenue decline with WTI and on-highway diesel prices close to fourth quarter 2015 levels. Though some coal stockpile correction occurred in the third quarter, we expect the ongoing inventory overhang to impact fourth quarter utility coal volumes.
Sustained low oil prices and a narrow spread between Brent and WTI will continue to limit crude oil rail volume. Though automotive volume for the full year is expected to exceed North American vehicle production growth of 1%, fourth quarter shipments will decline as compared to last year. We anticipate year-over-year service driven growth within intermodal. We will maintain our focus on improved pricing, reflecting the value of our service product. Overall, revenue per unit will be impacted by the ongoing mixed headwinds associated with increased intermodal and decreased coal freight. Our long-term view on both markets and pricing enables us to navigate the current economic headwinds while positioning us for future growth. Marketing continues to work closely with operations and finance, executing on our financial plan amid dynamic market conditions, controlling what we can control, assuring that resources are in place to support expected volumes and allowing us to take advantage of opportunities for long-term growth. I will now turn it over to Mike to discuss our operational performance."

I am pleased to announce we are continuing to operate at high service levels while making outstanding progress on our cost-reduction initiatives. As Jim noted, the progress we have made is a testament to our employees and their commitment",633,"Thank you, Alan. I am pleased to announce we are continuing to operate at high service levels while making outstanding progress on our cost-reduction initiatives. As Jim noted, the progress we have made is a testament to our employees and their commitment and focus in executing the key drivers of our strategic plan.
Let me begin with safety on Slide 13. While our reportable injury ratio increased in the third quarter as compared to the same period last year, we had an 18% improvement in our serious injury ratio. 
Turning to service on Slide 14. You see we continued to execute at a very high level as evidenced by our service composite, train speed and terminal dwell metrics. This is the second quarter in a row with the service composite above 80%. For the third quarter, our service composite and train speed both improved 8% and dwell improved 3% versus the same period last year. Overall, our velocity as measured at the car level remains near record levels and continues to aid asset utilization and strong customer service. What is most encouraging is that we have been able to do this while aggressively pursuing cost-reduction initiatives as evidenced by our 67.5% operating ratio. The improvements in our service metrics demonstrates our continued commitment to driving productivity improvements and increasing customer service.
Now on Slide 15, these cost-cutting initiatives, coupled with our ability to keep the railroad operating at a high level, continued to result in significant productivity savings. The reduction in crew starts for the third quarter significantly outpaced the decline in volume, and we have continued to improve our recrews, overtime and train length. Through the third quarter, we have achieved our highest average train length on record. Even with this significant improvement in train length, our velocity has been roughly the same as our record levels of 2012 and 2013. Together, this resulted in improved employee productivity. 
Turning to Slide 16. In our previous call, we said we would give an update on our network rationalization efforts. We have been going at this in a very deliberate way with 3 separate strategies tailored to the specific circumstances with the goal of maintaining or improving service to our customers while reducing our cost and investment needs. To that end, the most visible way we are changing the network is getting a short line carrier to operate lower volume segments. We have completed one large transaction with the West Virginia Secondary and another transaction is in process. This benefits NS by enabling us to improve capital allocation, continue to serve the customers and maintain our network reach.
As illustrated on Slide 17, we are also concentrating flows on fewer routes. For example, we idled one of our steepest and most difficult-to-operate lines in the coal fields by rerouting coal trains on to our mainline, which had excess capacity. To retain flexibility, the old route was left in place for now in case there is a business rebound. We have done this at several locations even outside the coal network and are continuing to identify opportunities across the system. 
Lastly, on Slide 18, even if we decide to continue using a route, we have found it is possible to reduce speeds without affecting customer service. These are our secondary mainlines. By reducing speeds, we can extend the life of track without affecting safety and delay reinvestment needs. We also realized some modest expense savings as well.
This is a new strategy for NS and reflects a willingness to reexamine our business model in the face of economic realities. Using our full toolkit, we have already exceeded our 1000-mile goal for 2016 while velocity and service have remained near our historic highs.
I will now turn it over to Marta, who will cover the financials."

The third quarter results showed continued strong cost control in the face of modest overall volume decline. Let's take a look at the financial details starting with operating results on Slide 20. While revenue",729,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter results showed continued strong cost control in the face of modest overall volume decline. Let's take a look at the financial details starting with operating results on Slide 20. While revenues were down 7% on 4% lower volume, operating expenses declined by 10%. The 67.5% operating ratio for the quarter was a 3% improvement over last year's third quarter, and the operating ratio of 68.7% for the first 9 months was an all-time record.
Slide 21 shows the expense reductions by income statement line item. Every category of cost was lower in 2015, a result of targeted expense reduction initiatives and a lower volume.
Additionally, the comparison was affected by last year's restructuring costs, particularly in depreciation. 
Now let's take a closer look at the components. Slide 22 highlights the major drivers of the variance in compensation and benefit. While the overall net change was relatively small at $11 million, it contains some offsetting items.
First, with regard to employee count and employee hours, the efficiency improvements in the first half of the year continued as overall headcount was down over 2,400 employees versus last year and was down slightly sequentially. This reduced headcount along with lower overtime and fewer recrews resulted in $47 million of year-over-year savings and the associated payroll taxes were favorable by $5 million. We also have $9 million in lower pension expense. These items helped offset increases in incentive compensation of $39 million, wage inflation of $14 million and health and welfare rate increases of $12 million. For the remainder of the year, we expect headcount to remain relatively flat sequentially. With regard to incentive comp, wage rates and health and welfare costs, we expect to have similar year-over-year increases in the fourth quarter as we had in the third quarter.
Slide 23 depicts purchased services and rents, which was down $65 million or 14% year-over-year. The largest reduction was attributable to $37 million in decreased Triple Crown cost. Recall that the curtailment of Triple Crown operations was affected on November 15 of last year. So our fourth quarter variance for this item will be about half this amount.
Also contributing to the reduction in this line item was $7 million of lower equipment rent. This was due primarily to the improved velocity Mike described, and we expect this benefit to continue into the fourth quarter.
Next is fuel expense as shown on Slide 24. The $40 million or 18% decline in fuel costs for the quarter was largely a result of lower oil prices, which decreased the price per gallon by 12%.
We also have lower consumption due to the lower traffic volume. Slide 25 details our materials and other category, which decreased $54 million or 22% year-over-year. This improvement reflects $28 million of gains on the sale of 2 operating properties. 
Next, reductions in material costs totaling $15 million were primarily for locomotive and freight car material. And the last variance on this slide is principally due to moving costs associated with last year's Roanoke office closure.
Turning to nonoperating items on Slide 26. This too was affected by the prior year comparison as we had a large gain on the sale of a nonoperating property in the third quarter of 2015. Somewhat offsetting this decrease were higher returns from corporate-owned life insurance.
Moving on to income taxes on Slide 27. The effective rate for the third quarter was 34.8% versus 37.6%. The lower effective rate was related to the increased life insurance returns as well as to the effects of stock-based compensation and several other smaller items.
For the full year, we now expect to have an effective income tax rate of roughly 36%. Summarizing our third quarter earnings on Slide 28. Net income was $460 million, up 2% versus 2015; and diluted earnings per share were $1.55, 4% higher than last year.
Wrapping up with year-to-date cash flows on Slide 29. Cash from operations was $2.3 billion, and free cash flow was a little over $1 billion. With respect to capital return to shareholders, we have paid $523 million in dividends and repurchased $603 million of our shares.
We remain on track for full year capital spending of $1.9 billion and a share repurchases of $800 million. Thank you for your attention, and I'll turn the program back to Jim."

With me today are NSC's Chief Marketing Officer, Alan Shaw; our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Wheeler; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart.Our results",529,"Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Norfolk Southern's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. With me today are NSC's Chief Marketing Officer, Alan Shaw; our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Wheeler; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart.
Our results this quarter summarized on Slide 4 reflect the successful proactive measures and strategies that Norfolk Southern continues to employ as we relentlessly focus on delivering results through efficiencies and asset utilization. We continue our focus on deploying resources to improve service and network performance while streamlining our corporate assets.
Targeted cost initiatives and the disposition of surplus operating property combined with the lapping of prior year restructuring costs drove a 67.5% operating ratio. This marked an improvement of 220 basis points or 3% compared to last year as operating expenses came in 10% lower, relative to a 7% decline in revenue.
We extended the high performance levels we have reliably delivered throughout this year into the third quarter, resulting in a record 68.7% operating ratio for the 9-month period. As a result of our efforts, earnings per share for the quarter increased to $1.55, up 4% compared to last year's $1.49. For the 9-month period, earnings per share increased 8% year-over-year. Importantly, we have significantly improved network performance as shown by our composite service metric, which was up 8% for the quarter and 14% for the year. These results, in addition to feedback I am receiving first-hand from our customers, confirm what we already know: Our commitment to customer service in tandem with our disciplined cost measures continues to move our company in the right direction. 
With respect to network initiatives, Mike will go over our progress in greater detail. But let me highlight that our team has already exceeded the 2016 rationalization goal of 1000 miles. And we'll continue to pursue these kinds of opportunities in the future.
Turning to Slide 5. As we entered this year, we had committed to lowering our operating ratio below 70% for the year, which I am pleased to say we are well positioned to achieve, even with economic headwinds. Our cost savings initiatives will generate productivity savings of at least $200 million for the year, upwards of $250 million, in fact. And we will contain capital spending to $1.9 billion, which is lower than our original $2.1 billion plan as we continually reassess the optimal deployment of capital in this changing economic environment. Our employees have consistently demonstrated their commitment to reliably delivering superior results in what has been a dynamic and challenging economic environment. We have worked hard to build a flexible strategy, one that stages us well for top line growth coupled with annual productivity savings, which are targeted for over $650 million by 2020. This team's strong start in 2016 reinforces my confidence in our ability to achieve a sub-65% operating ratio by 2020 and deliver substantial shareholder value.
Now Alan will cover trends in revenue. Mike will provide more detail on how we're managing the operation, including the progress I mentioned on our line rationalization initiatives, and Marta will summarize our financial results. Then we'll take your questions. Thank you. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Alan."

We appreciate your joining us today. So easing economic headwinds contributed to a 3% sequential improvement in revenue as compared to the second quarter of 2016. Our $2.5 billion in third quarter revenue",979,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning to our audience. We appreciate your joining us today. So easing economic headwinds contributed to a 3% sequential improvement in revenue as compared to the second quarter of 2016. Our $2.5 billion in third quarter revenue represented a 7% year-over-year decline, primarily driven by decreases in energy-related markets and the Triple Crown restructure. The hot summer and sequentially higher natural gas prices softened declines in utility coal. So high stockpile levels continued to dampen year-over-year comparisons. The Triple Crown restructure enhanced our overall efficiency and profitability while yielding year-over-year volume and revenue declines since the fourth quarter of 2015. While energy prices improved in the third quarter, they remain below last year's levels and negatively influenced fuel surcharge revenue and several merchandise commodities, including crude oil and natural gas products.
Amid the challenging economic conditions, intermodal remained a bright spot with improved service driving growth in domestic business. Despite pricing gains, revenue per unit declined 3% due to negative mix associated with increased intermodal freight and decreased coal volume as well as lower fuel surcharge revenue.
Merchandise revenue and volume, as shown on Slide 8, fell 4% in the third quarter. Our chemicals franchise, impacted by continued reductions in crude oil shipments as well as plant closures and consolidations in our industrial intermediates markets, further declined from the second quarter and was the primary driver of the year-over-year merchandise decrease.
Agriculture was impacted by reduced feed, wheat and corn volume compared to 2015. Automotive shipments were down as a result of a competitive loss, as mentioned on our second quarter call, and production declines at several NS-served plants. A weak pulpboard market combined with increased truck competition negatively impacted paper and forest products volume. These decreases were partially offset by metals and construction volume, which increased year-over-year and sequentially due to stronger shipments of steel and aggregates. As compared to last year, merchandise RPU increased 1%, reflecting positive pricing gains partially offset by negative mix associated with increased aggregates and coil steel as well as reduced industrial intermediates and machinery volume.
Turning to intermodal on Slide 9. Volume declined 1% as year-over-year growth in domestic and international volume nearly offset the declines related to the Triple Crown restructure. Excluding Triple Crown, volume was up 6% while revenue increased 5%. Despite excess truck capacity, our improved service product drove an 8% year-over-year increase in domestic intermodal business. International volume increased 1% compared to a strong third quarter last year.
Lower volumes of high-rated Triple Crown freight and lower fuel surcharge revenue negatively impacted RPU, down 7% as compared to last year. Excluding Triple Crown and fuel surcharges, RPU was up 2% in this highly competitive truck price environment while revenue improved 8%. 
On Slide 10, coal revenue was down 18% for the quarter with a 15% volume decline as compared to last year. Year-over-year utility volume continued to be negatively impacted by low natural gas prices and above-normal stockpile levels. Warmer summer weather and sequentially higher natural gas prices improved coal dispatch and utility deliveries as the third quarter progressed, generating 18.4 million utility tons, a 28% improvement from the second quarter. Future utility volumes will be dependent upon weather conditions, natural gas prices and stockpile levels. Between May and September, stockpiles declined by approximately 20 days of burn, though they remained 25 days above targeted levels and are expected to impact utility volumes into next year.
Assuming normal weather conditions and natural gas pricing consistent with the current forward curve, we expect to handle between 15 million and 18 million utility tons in the fourth quarter.
While there has been recent strength in spot pricing in the seaborne markets, U.S. export supply has been constrained by the impact of bankruptcies and production rationalizations. Third quarter thermal exports through Baltimore declined significantly as tonnage shifted to the domestic utility market. For the fourth quarter, we expect to handle 3 million to 4 million export tons with sequential increases in thermal coal through Baltimore.
Coal RPU excluding fuel was down 2% in the third quarter with positive pricing offset by the mix of reduced export volume. 
Turning to our outlook on Slide 11, we expect fourth quarter volumes to be flat or increase modestly year-over-year due, in part, to somewhat easier comparisons. In mid-November, we will cycle the impact of Triple Crown. The fourth quarter of 2015 also marked the start of the unseasonably warm winter that generated excess coal stockpiles, the effect of global steel oversupply as well as the beginning of the impact of increased manufacturing and retail inventories.
Lastly, we expect a lower year-over-year fuel surcharge revenue decline with WTI and on-highway diesel prices close to fourth quarter 2015 levels. Though some coal stockpile correction occurred in the third quarter, we expect the ongoing inventory overhang to impact fourth quarter utility coal volumes.
Sustained low oil prices and a narrow spread between Brent and WTI will continue to limit crude oil rail volume. Though automotive volume for the full year is expected to exceed North American vehicle production growth of 1%, fourth quarter shipments will decline as compared to last year. We anticipate year-over-year service-driven growth within intermodal. We will maintain our focus on improved pricing, reflecting the value of our service product. Overall, revenue per unit will be impacted by the ongoing mixed headwinds associated with increased intermodal and decreased coal freight. Our long-term view on both markets and pricing enables us to navigate the current economic headwinds while positioning us for future growth. Marketing continues to work closely with operations and finance, executing on our financial plan amid dynamic market conditions, controlling what we can control, ensuring that resources are in place to support expected volumes and allowing us to take advantage of opportunities for long-term growth. 
I will now turn it over to Mike to discuss our operational performance."

I am pleased to announce we are continuing to operate at high service levels while making outstanding progress on our cost-reduction initiatives. As Jim noted, the progress we have made is a testament to our employees and their commitment",634,"Thank you, Alan. I am pleased to announce we are continuing to operate at high service levels while making outstanding progress on our cost-reduction initiatives. As Jim noted, the progress we have made is a testament to our employees and their commitment and focus in executing the key drivers of our strategic plan.
Let me begin with safety on Slide 13. While our reportable injury ratio increased in the third quarter as compared to the same period last year, we had an 18% improvement in our serious injury ratio. 
Turning to service on Slide 14. You see we continued to execute at a very high level as evidenced by our service composite, train speed and terminal dwell metrics. This is the second quarter in a row with the service composite above 80%. For the third quarter, our service composite and train speed both improved 8% and dwell improved 3% versus the same period last year. Overall, our velocity as measured at the car level remains near record levels and continues to aid asset utilization and strong customer service. What is most encouraging is that we have been able to do this while aggressively pursuing cost-reduction initiatives as evidenced by our 67.5% operating ratio. The improvements in our service metrics demonstrates our continued commitment to driving productivity improvements and increasing customer service.
Now on Slide 15, these cost-cutting initiatives, coupled with our ability to keep the railroad operating at a high level, continued to result in significant productivity savings. The reduction in crew starts for the third quarter significantly outpaced the decline in volume, and we have continued to improve our recrews, overtime and train length. Through the third quarter, we have achieved our highest average train length on record. Even with this significant improvement in train length, our velocity has been roughly the same as our record levels of 2012 and 2013. Together, this resulted in improved employee productivity. 
Turning to Slide 16. In our previous call, we said we would give an update on our network rationalization efforts. We have been going at this in a very deliberate way with 3 separate strategies tailored to the specific circumstances with the goal of maintaining or improving service to our customers while reducing our cost and investment needs. To that end, the most visible way we are changing the network is getting a short line carrier to operate lower volume segments. We have completed one large transaction with the West Virginia Secondary and another transaction is in process. This benefits NS by enabling us to improve capital allocation, continue to serve the customers and maintain our network reach.
As illustrated on Slide 17, we are also concentrating flows on fewer routes. For example, we idled one of our steepest and most difficult-to-operate lines in the coal fields by rerouting coal trains on to our mainline, which had excess capacity. To retain flexibility, the old route was left in place for now in case there is a business rebound. We have done this at several locations even outside the coal network and are continuing to identify opportunities across the system. 
Lastly, on Slide 18, even if we decide to continue using a route, we have found it is possible to reduce speeds without affecting customer service. These are our secondary main lines. By reducing speeds, we can extend the life of track without affecting safety and delay reinvestment needs. We also realized some modest expense savings as well.
This is a new strategy for NS and reflects a willingness to reexamine our business model in the face of economic realities. Using our full toolkit, we have already exceeded our 1000-mile goal for 2016 while velocity and service have remained near our historic highs.
I will now turn it over to Marta, who will cover the financials."
292268,403851870,1062331,"Norfolk Southern Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Norfolk Southern Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter results showed continued strong cost control in the face of modest overall volume decline. Let's take a look at the financial details starting with operating results on Slide 20. While revenue",729,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter results showed continued strong cost control in the face of modest overall volume decline. Let's take a look at the financial details starting with operating results on Slide 20. While revenues were down 7% on 4% lower volume, operating expenses declined by 10%. The 67.5% operating ratio for the quarter was a 3% improvement over last year's third quarter, and the operating ratio of 68.7% for the first 9 months was an all-time record.
Slide 21 shows the expense reductions by income statement line item. Every category of cost was lower in 2015, a result of targeted expense reduction initiatives and a lower volume.
Additionally, the comparison was affected by last year's restructuring costs, particularly in depreciation. 
Now let's take a closer look at the components. Slide 22 highlights the major drivers of the variance in compensation and benefit. While the overall net change was relatively small at $11 million, it contains some offsetting items.
First, with regard to employee count and employee hours, the efficiency improvements in the first half of the year continued as overall headcount was down over 2,400 employees versus last year and was down slightly sequentially. This reduced headcount along with lower overtime and fewer recrews resulted in $47 million of year-over-year savings and the associated payroll taxes were favorable by $5 million. We also have $9 million in lower pension expense. These items helped offset increases in incentive compensation of $39 million, wage inflation of $14 million and health and welfare rate increases of $12 million. For the remainder of the year, we expect headcount to remain relatively flat sequentially. With regard to incentive comp, wage rates and health and welfare costs, we expect to have similar year-over-year increases in the fourth quarter as we had in the third quarter.
Slide 23 depicts purchased services and rents, which was down $65 million or 14% year-over-year. The largest reduction was attributable to $37 million in decreased Triple Crown cost. Recall that the curtailment of Triple Crown operations was affected on November 15 of last year. So our fourth quarter variance for this item will be about half this amount.
Also contributing to the reduction in this line item was $7 million of lower equipment rent. This was due primarily to the improved velocity Mike described, and we expect this benefit to continue into the fourth quarter.
Next is fuel expense as shown on Slide 24. The $40 million or 18% decline in fuel costs for the quarter was largely a result of lower oil prices, which decreased the price per gallon by 12%.
We also have lower consumptions due to the lower traffic volume. Slide 25 details our materials and other category, which decreased $54 million or 22% year-over-year. This improvement reflects $28 million of gains on the sale of 2 operating properties. 
Next, reductions in material costs totaling $15 million were primarily for locomotive and freight car material. And the last variance on this slide is principally due to moving costs associated with last year's Roanoke office closure.
Turning to nonoperating items on Slide 26. This, too, was affected by the prior year comparison as we had a large gain on the sale of a nonoperating property in the third quarter of 2015. Somewhat offsetting this decrease were higher returns from corporate-owned life insurance.
Moving on to income taxes on Slide 27. The effective rate for the third quarter was 34.8% versus 37.6%. The lower effective rate was related to the increased life insurance returns as well as to the effects of stock-based compensation and several other smaller items.
For the full year, we now expect to have an effective income tax rate of roughly 36%. Summarizing our third quarter earnings on Slide 28. Net income was $460 million, up 2% versus 2015; and diluted earnings per share were $1.55, 4% higher than last year.
Wrapping up with year-to-date cash flows on Slide 29. Cash from operations was $2.3 billion, and free cash flow was a little over $1 billion. With respect to capital return to shareholders, we have paid $523 million in dividends and repurchased $603 million of our shares.
We remain on track for full year capital spending of $1.9 billion and a share repurchases of $800 million.

With me today are NSC's Chief Marketing Officer, Alan Shaw; our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Wheeler; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta Stewart.
Our results this quarter summarized on Slide 4 reflect the successful proactive measures and strategies that Norfolk Southern continues to employ as we relentlessly focus on delivering results through efficiencies and asset utilization. We continue our focus on deploying resources to improve service and network performance while streamlining our corporate assets.
Targeted cost initiatives and the disposition of surplus operating property combined with the lapping of prior year restructuring costs drove a 67.5% operating ratio. This marked an improvement of 220 basis points or 3% compared to last year as operating expenses came in 10% lower, relative to a 7% decline in revenue.
We extended the high performance levels we have reliably delivered throughout this year into the third quarter, resulting in a record 68.7% operating ratio for the 9-month period. As a result of our efforts, earnings per share for the quarter increased to $1.55, up 4% compared to last year's $1.49. For the 9-month period, earnings per share increased 8% year-over-year. Importantly, we have significantly improved network performance as shown by our composite service metric, which was up 8% for the quarter and 14% for the year. These results, in addition to feedback I am receiving first-hand from our customers, confirm what we already know: Our commitment to customer service in tandem with our disciplined cost measures continues to move our company in the right direction. 
With respect to network initiatives, Mike will go over our progress in greater detail. But let me highlight that our team has already exceeded the 2016 rationalization goal of 1000 miles. And we'll continue to pursue these kinds of opportunities in the future.
Turning to Slide 5. As we entered this year, we had committed to lowering our operating ratio below 70% for the year, which I am pleased to say we are well positioned to achieve, even with economic headwinds. Our cost savings initiatives will generate productivity savings of at least $200 million for the year, upwards of $250 million, in fact. And we will contain capital spending to $1.9 billion, which is lower than our original $2.1 billion plan as we continually reassess the optimal deployment of capital in this changing economic environment. Our employees have consistently demonstrated their commitment to reliably delivering superior results in what has been a dynamic and challenging economic environment. We have worked hard to build a flexible strategy, one that stages us well for top line growth coupled with annual productivity savings, which are targeted for over $650 million by 2020. This team's strong start in 2016 reinforces my confidence in our ability to achieve a sub-65% operating ratio by 2020 and deliver substantial shareholder value.
Now Alan will cover trends in revenue. Mike will provide more detail on how we're managing the operation, including the progress I mentioned on our line rationalization initiatives, and Marta will summarize our financial results. Then we'll take your questions. Thank you. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Alan."
292268,403851870,1063128,"Norfolk Southern Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Norfolk Southern Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning to our audience. We appreciate your joining us today. So easing economic headwinds contributed to a 3% sequential improvement in revenue as compared to the second quarter of 2016. Our $2.5 billion in third quarter revenue",979,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning to our audience. We appreciate your joining us today. So easing economic headwinds contributed to a 3% sequential improvement in revenue as compared to the second quarter of 2016. Our $2.5 billion in third quarter revenue represented a 7% year-over-year decline, primarily driven by decreases in energy-related markets and the Triple Crown restructure. The hot summer and sequentially higher natural gas prices softened declines in utility coal. So high stockpile levels continued to dampen year-over-year comparisons. The Triple Crown restructure enhanced our overall efficiency and profitability while yielding year-over-year volume and revenue declines since the fourth quarter of 2015. While energy prices improved in the third quarter, they remain below last year's levels and negatively influenced fuel surcharge revenue and several merchandise commodities, including crude oil and natural gas products.
Amid the challenging economic conditions, intermodal remained a bright spot with improved service driving growth in domestic business. Despite pricing gains, revenue per unit declined 3% due to negative mix associated with increased intermodal freight and decreased coal volume as well as lower fuel surcharge revenue.
Merchandise revenue and volume, as shown on Slide 8, fell 4% in the third quarter. Our chemicals franchise, impacted by continued reductions in crude oil shipments as well as plant closures and consolidations in our industrial intermediates markets, further declined from the second quarter and was the primary driver of the year-over-year merchandise decrease.
Agriculture was impacted by reduced feed, wheat and corn volume compared to 2015. Automotive shipments were down as a result of a competitive loss, as mentioned on our second quarter call, and production declines at several NS-served plants. A weak pulpboard market combined with increased truck competition negatively impacted paper and forest products volume. These decreases were partially offset by metals and construction volume, which increased year-over-year and sequentially due to stronger shipments of steel and aggregates. As compared to last year, merchandise RPU increased 1%, reflecting positive pricing gains partially offset by negative mix associated with increased aggregates and coil steel as well as reduced industrial intermediates and machinery volume.
Turning to intermodal on Slide 9. Volume declined 1% as year-over-year growth in domestic and international volume nearly offset the declines related to the Triple Crown restructure. Excluding Triple Crown, volume was up 6% while revenue increased 5%. Despite excess truck capacity, our improved service product drove an 8% year-over-year increase in domestic intermodal business. International volume increased 1% compared to a strong third quarter last year.
Lower volumes of high-rated Triple Crown freight and lower fuel surcharge revenue negatively impacted RPU, down 7% as compared to last year. Excluding Triple Crown and fuel surcharges, RPU was up 2% in this highly competitive truck price environment while revenue improved 8%. 
On Slide 10, coal revenue was down 18% for the quarter with a 15% volume decline as compared to last year. Year-over-year utility volume continued to be negatively impacted by low natural gas prices and above-normal stockpile levels. Warmer summer weather and sequentially higher natural gas prices improved coal dispatch and utility deliveries as the third quarter progressed, generating 18.4 million utility tons, a 28% improvement from the second quarter. Future utility volumes will be dependent upon weather conditions, natural gas prices and stockpile levels. Between May and September, stockpiles declined by approximately 20 days of burn, though they remained 25 days above targeted levels and are expected to impact utility volumes into next year.
Assuming normal weather conditions and natural gas pricing consistent with the current forward curve, we expect to handle between 15 million and 18 million utility tons in the fourth quarter.
While there has been recent strength in spot pricing in the seaborne markets, U.S. export supply has been constrained by the impact of bankruptcies and production rationalizations. Third quarter thermal exports through Baltimore declined significantly as tonnage shifted to the domestic utility market. For the fourth quarter, we expect to handle 3 million to 4 million export tons with sequential increases in thermal coal through Baltimore.
Coal RPU excluding fuel was down 2% in the third quarter with positive pricing offset by the mix of reduced export volume. 
Turning to our outlook on Slide 11, we expect fourth quarter volumes to be flat or increase modestly year-over-year due, in part, to somewhat easier comparisons. In mid-November, we will cycle the impact of Triple Crown. The fourth quarter of 2015 also marked the start of the unseasonably warm winter that generated excess coal stockpiles, the effect of global steel oversupply as well as the beginning of the impact of increased manufacturing and retail inventories.
Lastly, we expect a lower year-over-year fuel surcharge revenue decline with WTI and on-highway diesel prices close to fourth quarter 2015 levels. Though some coal stockpile correction occurred in the third quarter, we expect the ongoing inventory overhang to impact fourth quarter utility coal volumes.
Sustained low oil prices and a narrow spread between Brent and WTI will continue to limit crude oil rail volume. Though automotive volume for the full year is expected to exceed North American vehicle production growth of 1%, fourth quarter shipments will decline as compared to last year. We anticipate year-over-year service-driven growth within intermodal. We will maintain our focus on improved pricing, reflecting the value of our service product. Overall, revenue per unit will be impacted by the ongoing mixed headwinds associated with increased intermodal and decreased coal freight. Our long-term view on both markets and pricing enables us to navigate the current economic headwinds while positioning us for future growth. Marketing continues to work closely with operations and finance, executing on our financial plan amid dynamic market conditions, controlling what we can control, ensuring that resources are in place to support expected volumes and allowing us to take advantage of opportunities for long-term growth. 
I will now turn it over to Mike to discuss our operational performance."

I am pleased to announce we are continuing to operate at high service levels while making outstanding progress on our cost-reduction initiatives. As Jim noted, the progress we have made is a testament to our employees and their commitment",634,"Thank you, Alan. I am pleased to announce we are continuing to operate at high service levels while making outstanding progress on our cost-reduction initiatives. As Jim noted, the progress we have made is a testament to our employees and their commitment and focus in executing the key drivers of our strategic plan.
Let me begin with safety on Slide 13. While our reportable injury ratio increased in the third quarter as compared to the same period last year, we had an 18% improvement in our serious injury ratio. 
Turning to service on Slide 14. You see we continued to execute at a very high level as evidenced by our service composite, train speed and terminal dwell metrics. This is the second quarter in a row with the service composite above 80%. For the third quarter, our service composite and train speed both improved 8% and dwell improved 3% versus the same period last year. Overall, our velocity as measured at the car level remains near record levels and continues to aid asset utilization and strong customer service. What is most encouraging is that we have been able to do this while aggressively pursuing cost-reduction initiatives as evidenced by our 67.5% operating ratio. The improvements in our service metrics demonstrates our continued commitment to driving productivity improvements and increasing customer service.
Now on Slide 15, these cost-cutting initiatives, coupled with our ability to keep the railroad operating at a high level, continued to result in significant productivity savings. The reduction in crew starts for the third quarter significantly outpaced the decline in volume, and we have continued to improve our recrews, overtime and train length. Through the third quarter, we have achieved our highest average train length on record. Even with this significant improvement in train length, our velocity has been roughly the same as our record levels of 2012 and 2013. Together, this resulted in improved employee productivity. 
Turning to Slide 16. In our previous call, we said we would give an update on our network rationalization efforts. We have been going at this in a very deliberate way with 3 separate strategies tailored to the specific circumstances with the goal of maintaining or improving service to our customers while reducing our cost and investment needs. To that end, the most visible way we are changing the network is getting a short line carrier to operate lower volume segments. We have completed one large transaction with the West Virginia Secondary and another transaction is in process. This benefits NS by enabling us to improve capital allocation, continue to serve the customers and maintain our network reach.
As illustrated on Slide 17, we are also concentrating flows on fewer routes. For example, we idled one of our steepest and most difficult-to-operate lines in the coal fields by rerouting coal trains on to our mainline, which had excess capacity. To retain flexibility, the old route was left in place for now in case there is a business rebound. We have done this at several locations even outside the coal network and are continuing to identify opportunities across the system. 
Lastly, on Slide 18, even if we decide to continue using a route, we have found it is possible to reduce speeds without affecting customer service. These are our secondary main lines. By reducing speeds, we can extend the life of track without affecting safety and delay reinvestment needs. We also realized some modest expense savings as well.
This is a new strategy for NS and reflects a willingness to reexamine our business model in the face of economic realities. Using our full toolkit, we have already exceeded our 1000-mile goal for 2016 while velocity and service have remained near our historic highs.
I will now turn it over to Marta, who will cover the financials."

The third quarter results showed continued strong cost control in the face of modest overall volume decline. Let's take a look at the financial details starting with operating results on Slide 20. While revenue",729,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter results showed continued strong cost control in the face of modest overall volume decline. Let's take a look at the financial details starting with operating results on Slide 20. While revenues were down 7% on 4% lower volume, operating expenses declined by 10%. The 67.5% operating ratio for the quarter was a 3% improvement over last year's third quarter, and the operating ratio of 68.7% for the first 9 months was an all-time record.
Slide 21 shows the expense reductions by income statement line item. Every category of cost was lower in 2015, a result of targeted expense reduction initiatives and a lower volume.
Additionally, the comparison was affected by last year's restructuring costs, particularly in depreciation. 
Now let's take a closer look at the components. Slide 22 highlights the major drivers of the variance in compensation and benefit. While the overall net change was relatively small at $11 million, it contains some offsetting items.
First, with regard to employee count and employee hours, the efficiency improvements in the first half of the year continued as overall headcount was down over 2,400 employees versus last year and was down slightly sequentially. This reduced headcount along with lower overtime and fewer recrews resulted in $47 million of year-over-year savings and the associated payroll taxes were favorable by $5 million. We also have $9 million in lower pension expense. These items helped offset increases in incentive compensation of $39 million, wage inflation of $14 million and health and welfare rate increases of $12 million. For the remainder of the year, we expect headcount to remain relatively flat sequentially. With regard to incentive comp, wage rates and health and welfare costs, we expect to have similar year-over-year increases in the fourth quarter as we had in the third quarter.
Slide 23 depicts purchased services and rents, which was down $65 million or 14% year-over-year. The largest reduction was attributable to $37 million in decreased Triple Crown cost. Recall that the curtailment of Triple Crown operations was affected on November 15 of last year. So our fourth quarter variance for this item will be about half this amount.
Also contributing to the reduction in this line item was $7 million of lower equipment rent. This was due primarily to the improved velocity Mike described, and we expect this benefit to continue into the fourth quarter.
Next is fuel expense as shown on Slide 24. The $40 million or 18% decline in fuel costs for the quarter was largely a result of lower oil prices, which decreased the price per gallon by 12%.
We also have lower consumptions due to the lower traffic volume. Slide 25 details our materials and other category, which decreased $54 million or 22% year-over-year. This improvement reflects $28 million of gains on the sale of 2 operating properties. 
Next, reductions in material costs totaling $15 million were primarily for locomotive and freight car material. And the last variance on this slide is principally due to moving costs associated with last year's Roanoke office closure.
Turning to nonoperating items on Slide 26. This, too, was affected by the prior year comparison as we had a large gain on the sale of a nonoperating property in the third quarter of 2015. Somewhat offsetting this decrease were higher returns from corporate-owned life insurance.
Moving on to income taxes on Slide 27. The effective rate for the third quarter was 34.8% versus 37.6%. The lower effective rate was related to the increased life insurance returns as well as to the effects of stock-based compensation and several other smaller items.
For the full year, we now expect to have an effective income tax rate of roughly 36%. Summarizing our third quarter earnings on Slide 28. Net income was $460 million, up 2% versus 2015; and diluted earnings per share were $1.55, 4% higher than last year.
Wrapping up with year-to-date cash flows on Slide 29. Cash from operations was $2.3 billion, and free cash flow was a little over $1 billion. With respect to capital return to shareholders, we have paid $523 million in dividends and repurchased $603 million of our shares.
We remain on track for full year capital spending of $1.9 billion and a share repurchases of $800 million.

With respect to the trucking market, we do anticipate that, that tightens next year, potentially towards the latter half of the year with the implementation of ELDs and a normalization of inventory levels. That's one of the reasons I've referenced that earlier. It'll probably be at a higher -- the new norm is probably higher than it has been in the past.
