Good morning, everyone. In the interest of time, we've provided some balance sheet items and other select financial information on our website, www.sherwin.com, under Investor Relations, January 28th Press Release. Our consolidated sales",1168,"Thanks, Jesse. Good morning, everyone. In the interest of time, we've provided some balance sheet items and other select financial information on our website, www.sherwin.com, under Investor Relations, January 28th Press Release. 
Our consolidated sales in the fourth quarter increased 1.4% to $2.6 billion, due entirely to higher paint sales volume to our Paint Stores and Consumer Group. 
For the full sales increased 1.9% to $11.34 billion. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales 3.6% in the quarter and 3.3% for the full year. Consolidated gross profit in the fourth quarter increased $104.3 million to $1.3 billion and gross margin expanded to 50.8% of sales from 47.4% of sales in the fourth quarter 2014. 
For the year, gross margin increased to 49% of sales from 46.4% of sales last year. The increase in gross margin in the quarter and full year was due primarily to volume-driven supply chain productivity and lower year-over-year raw material cost. 
Selling, general and administrative expense increased $6.1 million to $991.5 million in the fourth quarter, but decreased as a percent of sales to 38.1% from 38.3% in the same quarter last year. 
For the full year 2015, SG&A expense increased $90.6 million to $3.91 billion, an increase as a percent of sales to 34.5% from 34.3% in 2014. The incremental SG&A to support the new HGTV HOME program at Lowe's and new store openings and sales territory addition, accounted for a majority of the SG&A increase in the year. 
Other general expense decreased $12.6 million in the fourth quarter and $7.2 million for the year, due primarily to lower environmental expenses in both periods. 
Interest expense for the quarter increased $4.1 million to $19.5 million. For the year, interest expense was $61.8 million compared to $64.2 million in 2014. 
Profit before tax in the fourth quarter increased 57.4% to $297.2 million; and for the full year, increased 23.1% to $1.55 billion. 
Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter 2015 increased to 33.4% from 29.7% in the fourth quarter last year. 
For the year, our effective tax rate was 32% compared to 31.2% in 2014. 
Consolidated net income for the quarter increased $65.3 million to $198 million. For the year, net income increased $188 million to $1.05 billion. 
Net income as a percent of sales in the quarter increased to 7.6% from 5.2% last year. For the year, net income as a percent of sales increased to 9.3% from 7.8% in 2014. 
Diluted net income per common share in the fourth quarter 2015 increased to $2.12 from $1.37 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, diluted net income per common share increased 27.1% to $11.16 per share from $8.78 per share in 2014. 
Let me take a few minutes to break down our performance by segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the fourth quarter 2015 increased 5.9% to $1.68 billion. Thanks to higher architectural paint sales volume across all customer segments. 
For the year, net sales increased 5.2% to $7.21 billion. This full year sales increase was also driven by higher architectural paint sales volume across all segments. 
Comparable store sales increased 5.1% in the quarter and 4.2% in the year. Regionally, in the fourth quarter, our Midwest division led all division, followed by Eastern division, Southeastern division and Southwestern division. 
Fourth quarter segment profit for Paint Stores Group increased 27.8% to $316.1 million, due primarily to higher year-over-year paint sales volumes. 
For the full year, Paint Stores Group profit increased 19.3% to $1.43 billion from $1.2 billion in 2014. The increase in segment profit for the year resulted from higher paint sales volume that were partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. Segment profit margin for the fourth quarter increased to 18.9% from 15.6% last year. 
Profit margin for the full year 2015 increased to 19.9% from 17.5% in 2014. 
Turning now to consumer group. Fourth quarter external net sales increased 13.6% to $314.6 million. 
For the year, consumer group sales increased 11.1% to $1.58 billion. Most of the increase in sales for the fourth quarter and full year was from the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams Paint Program at Lowe's. 
Segment profit for the fourth quarter increased 67.9% to $50.9 million from $30.3 million in the fourth quarter 2014. For the year, segment profit increased 22.1% to $308.8 million from $252.9 million in 2014. 
Consumer groups segment profit as a percent of net sales in the fourth quarter increased to 16.2% from 11% last year. 
For the year, segment profit margin increased to 19.6% from 17.8% last year. Most of the improvement in both the fourth quarter and full year segment profit margin was from volume-driven operating efficiency. 
For our Global Finishes Group, fourth quarter net sales in U.S. dollars decreased 9.5% to $454.8 million. And full year sales decreased 7.9% to $1.92 billion, due primarily to unfavorable currency translation. 
Currency translation decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 7.1% in the quarter and 7.5% in the year. 
Stated in U.S. dollars, global finishes group profit in the fourth quarter, increased to $50.6 million from $39 million last year. The increase in segment profit in the quarter resulted from good expense control and lower year-over-year raw material costs that were partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, which reduced segment profit $4.8 million. 
For the year, segment profit increased 0.4% to $201.9 million from $201.1 million last year. This full year profit improvement resulted from good expense control and lower raw material costs that were mostly offset by unfavorable currency translation of $26.5 million. 
As a percent of net sales, Global Finishes Group's operating profit was 11.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 7.8% last year and 10.5% for the year compared to 9.7% in 2014. 
For our Latin America Coatings Group. Net sales decreased 23.5% to $158.7 million in the fourth quarter and decreased 18.2% to $631 million for the full year, due primarily to unfavorable currency translation and lower volume sales, partially offset by higher year-over-year selling prices. Currency translation decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 21.4% in the quarter and 19.3% in the year. 
Stated in U.S. dollars, Latin America Coatings Group's segment profit in the quarter decreased to $2.8 million from $13 million last year. For the year, segment profits decreased to $18.5 million from $40.5 million in 2014. The decline in segment profit in both quarter and year was primarily due to unfavorable currency translation and lower volume sales, partially offset by selling price increases. 
Unfavorable currency translation decreased segment profit $5.3 million in the quarter and $16 million in the full year. 
As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 1.8% in the fourth quarter, compared to 6.3% last year and 2.9% for the year compared to  5.2% in 2014. 
That concludes the review of our operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. So let me turn the call over to John Morikis who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for 2016. John?"

Back in 1971, British rock band, The Who, recorded the now famous lyrics, meet the new",1278,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. 
As we announced last October, in January 1 of this year, I assumed the duties of Chief Executive Officer. Back in 1971, British rock band, The Who, recorded the now famous lyrics, meet the new boss, same as the old boss. In our case, the same may not hold true literally in every respect, but it is certainly true when it comes to our mutual confidence in the company's strategy, our focus on growing market share through superior products and execution, our adherence to key performance metrics like return on net assets employed and net operating cash through sales and our shareholder-friendly capital allocation. These are the things that will define the value of Sherwin-Williams in the years ahead. And I believe, they are all moving in the right direction. 2015 was a year of ups and downs. 
Our full year revenue of $11.3 billion set a new record for the company. But fell a little short of our original expectations. One reason for this was stronger currency headwinds than originally anticipated. Another was the weaker-than-expected demand for industrial coatings in certain categories. Particularly, that was used to maintain oil and gas production in storage assets. And in the middle 2 quarters of 2015, we grew our long-standing practice of not giving weather reports on earnings calls as heavy rainfall across much of the country clearly affected paint demand. This lower-than-expected revenue performance, however, did not translate to lower-than-expected profit or cash flow. 
Our full year profit before tax net income, earnings per share and net operating cash all met or exceeded the expectations we set back in January 2015. Net income eclipsed to $1 billion in 2015 for the first time in our company's history. This strong profitability  and cash generation was largely due to the successful and accelerated integration of the Comex stores and the consolidation of Comex manufacturing assets, coupled with volume-driven sales -- supply chain productivity in North America, good SG&A control and raw material cost tailwinds. 
Looking ahead, we expect the year-over-year incremental margin benefit from the Comex integration to diminish as we go through 2016. Architectural paint sales through our paint stores picked up momentum in the fourth quarter, but was again, offset to some degree by negative volumes in protected and marine coatings. 
Sales to residential contractors continue to grow at double-digit paces. Sales volume to the new construction markets and DIY customers also increased compared to last year, but at a full pace than residential repaint. 
In total, Paint Stores Group grew fourth quarter revenues by just under 6%, with architectural paint volume growth outpacing revenues. 
For the fourth quarter, we opened 38 net new stores, bringing our full year store opening total to 83 new location. And our total store count at year-end to 4,086 stores in the U.S, Canada and the Caribbean. We remain confident that our next milestone of 5,000 locations in North America is realistic, and we intend to get closer to that goal by 90 to 100 stores this year. 
Consumer Group also turned into a solid performance for the year. The launch of the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams Paint Program at Lowe's was one reason. But we also saw strong sales growth from another valued home center partner, Menards. As a result, Consumer Group's business grew by low single-digit percentage phase in the quarter. 
Market and economic conditions outside North America continue to be very challenging. Sales volumes in most Latin American countries fluctuated modestly compared to fourth quarter 2014. And with the exception of Brazil, our volumes and revenues declined significantly. The impact of currency devaluation, once again, was worse-than-anticipated in the quarter. 
Global Finishes Group also thought softening environment coatings demand and deteriorating currencies in both Europe and Latin America, but made progress in offsetting these effects through tight SG&A controls. 
In 2015, we generated record net operating cash of $1.45 billion. Thanks in part to the terrific working capital management by all of our operating segments. Despite of the incremental working capital required to support the HGTV HOME Program at Lowe's, our working capital ratio at year-end dropped to 8.6% of sales from 10.1% last year. 
Free cash flow, which is net operating cash, less CapEx and dividends, was $953.5 million compared to $655.7 million last year. We used this cash from operations to fund capital expenditures, increase our dividend and buyback shares for treasury. 
Our capital expenditures in 2015 totaled $234 million. Depreciation for the year was $170 million, and amortization was $28 million. 
In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $185 million to $200 million and amortization of about $30 million. 
The capital spending will run higher-than-normal in 2016 as we complete some facility renovation process. 
Through 2015, we returned more than $1.28 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
In the fourth quarter, we acquired 1 million shares of the company's stock for treasury, bringing our full year to 3.575 million shares at an average cost of $278.57 per share and a total investment of just over $1 billion. 
At year-end, we have remaining authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares. 
We paid $249.6 million in cash to shareholders through quarterly dividend. 2015 marked our 37th consecutive year of increased dividends per share, and we intend to continue. This year, at our February meeting of the Board of Directors, we will recommend approval of an annual dividend of $3.36 per share, an increase of more than 25% over 2015. 
Looking ahead to 2016. The demand for paint and coatings in most domestic markets looks encouraging. Both residential starts and existing home turnover was solid throughout 2015. And the Outlook for 2016 is equally encouraging. Although contrast for new nonresidential projects dips slightly in 2015, there was still a strong year in absolute terms, which bodes well for paint demand in this segment. 
Outside the U.S., it appears likely that sluggish market conditions and the currency devaluation, particularly in Europe and many Latin American countries will remain a challenge. 
Our raw material basket has many moving parts but in total, we believe we're likely to see lower year-over-year input costs in 2016. The continuing fall in the price of crude oil will no doubt have a positive impact on this petrochemical side on the raw materials basket. But these commodities will not necessarily move in many of our relationship with crude. The price of high-grade chloride TiO2 continues to slide over the back half of 2015 due to weak global demand and over capacity, but it's likely nearing the bottom. Based on these factors, we would expect average year-over-year raw material costs for the paint and coatings industry to be down in the mid-single-digit range in 2016. 
Our outlook for first quarter 2016 is for consolidated net sales to increase in the low single digits percentage range compared to last year's first quarter. With sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the first quarter will be in the range of $1.50 to $1.55 per share compared to the $1.38 per share earned in the first quarter of 2015. 
For the full year 2016, we expect net sales will increase in the low single-digit percentage range compared to full year 2015. With annual sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income for common share for 2015 will be in the range of $12.20 to $12.40 compared to $11.16 in 2015. 
Again, I would like to thank you for sharing -- for being with us this morning, and now we'd be happy to open it up for questions."

That also includes the integration of that Comex business. That has been a nice piece of that. Don't forget to remember the mix because of the foreign currency exchange. As U.S. becomes bigger and bigger piece of that -- of our total sales, the Paint Stores Group does have the highest gross margin. So that helped on the other piece. Now having said that, LIFO is always trying to catch what you think is  going to happen with the raws and the way the raws came in, there was a slight help from the LIFO. LIFO did help us, especially in the Consumer Group but also a little bit in the Stores Group. If you take a look about the long-term, in the long term, I think we try to give you guidance what we think is a long-term. We think that probably our long-term, when you look at the make-up of the company and where we are going, it's in the mid-47s to the mid-49s. I think -- again, when that foreigners currency changes around, instead of being at 80% U.S. in North American sales, you're going to see start seeing that come down and back pedaling to the 70%. That will have the reverse impact in the gross margins. So when we feel like we're running at a normal area, we think we're going to end up 47.5% to 49.5% gross margins."

It sounded like in Latin America, you saw a little bit faster volume declines. I mean you complained about volume declines being down an offset by higher pricing for a few quarters.

We spent a lot of time talking about TiO2 and the latex and the resin side of the basket, which granted, is the lion's share of our raw material basket by value. But there are also categories of packaging and specialty chemicals that may be moving the opposite direction and offset the deflation in TiO2 and resins and latex to some degree. The other thing I'd caution you on is assuming that resin and latex pricing is tracking in line with propylene over crude oil, a lot of times, it's because specialty formulas, they're oftentimes owned and controlled by our supplier. That gives them some measure of pricing power in the short-term. The resin that you use in a particular paint formula has a very significant impact on the performance of the end product, and they're not interchangeable parts. So if the supplier wants to hold onto some of the benefit of lower cost propylene for a period of time, in the long run, we believe we'll get the benefit, but the benefit tends to come to the markets slower than in the commodity category like TiO2."

Our consolidated sales in the fourth quarter increased 1.4% to $2.6 billion, due entirely to higher paint sales volume through our Paint Stores and Consumer Group.
For the full year, sales increased 1.9% to $11.34 billion. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales 3.6% in the quarter and 3.3% for the full year. Consolidated gross profit in the fourth quarter increased $104.3 million to $1.3 billion and gross margin expanded to 50.8% of sales from 47.4% of sales in the fourth quarter 2014. 
For the year, gross margin increased to 49% of sales from 46.4% of sales last year. The increase in gross margin in the quarter and full year was due primarily to volume-driven supply chain productivity and lower year-over-year raw material cost. 
Selling, general and administrative expense increased $6.1 million to $991.5 million in the fourth quarter, but decreased as a percent of sales to 38.1% from 38.3% in the same quarter last year. 
For the full year 2015, SG&A expense increased $90.6 million to $3.91 billion, an increase as a percent of sales to 34.5% from 34.3% in 2014. Incremental SG&A to support the new HGTV HOME program at Lowe's and new store openings and sales territory addition accounted for the majority of the SG&A increase in the year. 
Other general expense decreased $12.6 million in the fourth quarter and $7.2 million for the year, due primarily to lower environmental expenses in both periods. 
Interest expense for the quarter increased $4.1 million to $19.5 million. For the year, interest expense was $61.8 million compared to $64.2 million in 2014. 
Profit before tax in the fourth quarter increased 57.4% to $297.2 million; and for the full year, increased 23.1% to $1.55 billion. 
Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter 2015 increased to 33.4% from 29.7% in the fourth quarter last year. For the year, our effective tax rate was 32% compared to 31.2% in 2014. 
Consolidated net income for the quarter increased $65.3 million to $198 million. For the year, net income increased $188 million to $1.05 billion. 
Net income as a percent of sales in the quarter increased to 7.6% from 5.2% last year. For the year, net income as a percent of sales increased to 9.3% from 7.8% in 2014. 
Diluted net income per common share in the fourth quarter 2015 increased to $2.12 from $1.37 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, diluted net income per common share increased 27.1% to $11.16 per share from $8.78 per share in 2014. 
Let me take a few minutes to break down our performance by segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the fourth quarter 2015 increased 5.9% to $1.68 billion, thanks to higher architectural paint sales volume across all customer segments. 
For the year, net sales increased 5.2% to $7.21 billion. This full year sales increase was also driven by higher architectural paint sales volume across all customer segments. 
Comparable store sales increased 5.1% in the quarter and 4.2% in the year. Regionally, in the fourth quarter, our Midwest division led all divisions, followed by Eastern division, Southeastern division and Southwestern division. 
Fourth quarter segment profit for Paint Stores Group increased 27.8% to $316.1 million, due primarily to higher year-over-year paint sales volumes. 
For the full year, Paint Stores Group profit increased 19.3% to $1.43 billion from $1.2 billion in 2014. The increase in segment profit for the year resulted from higher paint sales volume that were partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. Segment profit margin for the fourth quarter increased to 18.9% from 15.6% last year. Profit margin for the full year 2015 increased to 19.9% from 17.5% in 2014. 
Turning now to Consumer Group. Fourth quarter external net sales increased 13.6% to $314.6 million. For the year, Consumer Group sales increased 11.1% to $1.58 billion. Most of the increase in sales for the fourth quarter and full year was from the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams Paint Program at Lowe's. 
Segment profit for the fourth quarter increased 67.9% to $50.9 million from $30.3 million in the fourth quarter 2014. For the year, segment profit increased 22.1% to $308.8 million from $252.9 million in 2014. 
Consumer Group's segment profit as a percent of net sales in the fourth quarter increased to 16.2% from 11% last year. For the year, segment profit margin increased to 19.6% from 17.8% last year. Most of the improvement in both fourth quarter and full year segment profit margin was from volume-driven operating efficiency. 
For our Global Finishes Group, fourth quarter net sales in U.S. dollars decreased 9.5% to $454.8 million. And full year sales decreased 7.9% to $1.92 billion, due primarily to unfavorable currency translation. Currency translation decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 7.1% in the quarter and 7.5% in the year. 
Stated in U.S. dollars, Global Finishes Group segment profit in the fourth quarter increased to $50.6 million from $39 million last year. The increase in segment profit in the quarter resulted from good expense control and lower year-over-year raw material costs that were partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, which reduced segment profit $4.8 million. 
For the year, segment profit increased 0.4% to $201.9 million from $201.1 million last year. This full year profit improvement resulted from good expense control and lower raw material costs that were mostly offset by unfavorable currency translation of $26.5 million. 
As a percent of net sales, Global Finishes Group's operating profit was 11.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 7.8% last year and 10.5% for the year compared to 9.7% in 2014. 
For our Latin America Coatings Group. Net sales decreased 23.5% to $158.7 million in the fourth quarter and decreased 18.2% to $631 million for the full year, due primarily to unfavorable currency translation and lower volume sales, partially offset by higher year-over-year selling prices. Currency translation decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 21.4% in the quarter and 19.3% in the year. 
Stated in U.S. dollars, Latin America Coatings Group's segment profit in the quarter decreased to $2.8 million from $13 million last year. For the year, segment profit decreased to $18.5 million from $40.5 million in 2014. The decline in segment profit in both quarter and year was primarily due to unfavorable currency translation and lower volume sales, partially offset by selling price increases. 
Unfavorable currency translation decreased segment profit $5.3 million in the quarter and $16 million in the full year. 
As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 1.8% in the fourth quarter, compared to 6.3% last year and 2.9% for the year compared to  5.2% in 2014. 
That concludes review of our operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. So let me turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for 2016. John?"

Back in 1971, British rock band, The Who, recorded the now famous lyric, meet the new b",1280,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. 
As we announced last October, on January 1 of this year, I assumed the duties of Chief Executive Officer. Back in 1971, British rock band, The Who, recorded the now famous lyric, meet the new boss, same as the old boss. In our case, the same may not hold true literally in every respect, but it is certainly true when it comes to our mutual confidence in the company's strategy, our focus on growing market share through superior products and execution, our adherence to key performance metrics like return on net assets employed and net operating cash to sales and our shareholder-friendly capital allocation. These are the things that will define the value of Sherwin-Williams in the years ahead. And I believe, they are all moving in the right direction. 
2015 was a year of ups and downs. Our full year revenue of $11.3 billion set a new record for the company, but fell well short of our original expectations. One reason for this was stronger currency headwinds than originally anticipated. Another was the weaker-than-expected demand for industrial coatings in certain categories, particularly those used to maintain oil and gas production and storage assets. And in the middle 2 quarters of 2015, we broke our long-standing practice of not giving weather reports on earnings calls as heavy rainfall across much of the country clearly affected paint demand. This lower-than-expected revenue performance, however, did not translate to lower-than-expected profit or cash flow. 
Our full year profit before tax, net income, earnings per share and net operating cash all met or exceeded the expectations we set back in January 2015. Net income eclipsed $1 billion in 2015 for the first time in our company's history. This strong profitability  and cash generation was largely due to the successful and accelerated integration of the Comex stores and consolidation of Comex manufacturing assets, coupled with volume-driven sales -- supply chain productivity in North America, good SG&A expense control and raw material cost tailwinds. 
Looking ahead, we expect the year-over-year incremental margin benefit from the Comex integration to diminish as we go through 2016. Architectural paint sales through our paint stores picked up momentum in the fourth quarter, but was again offset to some degree by negative volumes in protective and marine coatings. 
Sales to residential repaint contractors continue to grow at double-digit pace. Sales volumes to the new construction markets and DIY customers also increased compared to last year, but at a slower pace than residential repaint. 
In total, Paint Stores Group grew fourth quarter revenues by just under 6%, with architectural paint volume growth outpacing revenues. 
In the fourth quarter, we opened 38 net new stores, bringing our full year store opening total to 83 new location. And our total store count at year-end to 4,086 stores in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean. We remain confident that our next milestone of 5,000 locations in North America is realistic, and we intend to get closer to that goal by 90 to 100 stores this year. 
Consumer Group also turned in a solid performance for the year. The launch of the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams Paint Program at Lowe's was one reason. But we also saw strong sales growth from another valued home center partner, Menards. As a result, Consumer Group's business grew by low single-digit percentage phase in the fourth quarter. 
Market and economic conditions outside North America continue to be very challenging. Sales volumes in most Latin American countries fluctuated modestly compared to fourth quarter 2014. And with the exception of Brazil where volumes and revenues declined significantly. The impact of currency devaluation, once again, was worse-than-anticipated in the quarter. 
Global Finishes Group also felt a brunt of softening environment coatings demand and deteriorating currencies in both Europe and Latin America, but made progress in offsetting these effects through tight SG&A control.
In 2015, we generated record net operating cash of $1.45 billion, thanks in part to the terrific working capital management by all of our operating segments. Inspite of the incremental working capital required to support the HGTV HOME Program at Lowe's, our working capital ratio at year-end dropped to 8.6% of sales from 10.1% last year. 
Free cash flow, which is net operating cash less CapEx and dividends, was $963.5 million compared to $665.7 million last year. We used this cash from operations to fund capital expenditures, increase our dividend and buyback shares for treasury. 
Our capital expenditures in 2015 totaled $234 million. Depreciation for the year was $170 million, and amortization was $28 million. 
In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $185 million to $200 million and amortization of about $30 million. 
Capital spending will run higher-than-normal in 2016, as we complete some facility renovation projects. 
In 2015, we returned more than $1.28 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
In the fourth quarter, we acquired 1 million shares of the company's stock for treasury, bringing our full year to 3.575 million shares at an average cost of $278.57 per share and a total investment of just over $1 billion. At year-end, we have remaining authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares. 
We paid $249.6 million in cash to shareholders through quarterly dividend. 2015 marked our 37th consecutive year of increased dividends per share, a string we intend to continue. This year, at our February meeting of the Board of Directors, we'll recommend approval of an annual dividend of $3.36 per share, an increase of more than 25% over 2015. 
Looking ahead to 2016. The demand for paint and coatings in most domestic markets looks encouraging. Growth in residential starts and existing home turnover was solid throughout 2015. And the Outlook for 2016 is equally encouraging. Although contracts for new nonresidential projects dipped slightly in 2015, it was still a strong year in absolute terms, which bodes well for paint demand in this segment. 
Outside the U.S., it appears likely that sluggish market conditions and currency devaluation, particularly in Europe and many Latin American countries, will remain a challenge. 
Our raw material basket has many moving parts but in total, we believe, we're likely to see lower year-over-year input cost in 2016. The continuing fall in the price of crude oil will no doubt have a positive impact on the petrochemical side on the raw materials basket. But these commodities will not necessarily move in linear relationship with crude. The price of high-grade chloride TiO2 continued to slide over the back half of 2015 due to weak global demand and overcapacity, but is likely nearing a bottom. Based on these factors, we would expect average year-over-year raw material costs for the paint and coatings industry to be down in the mid-single-digit range in 2016. 
Our outlook for first quarter 2016 is for consolidated net sales to increase in the low-single-digit percentage range compared to last year's first quarter. With sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the first quarter will be in the range of $1.50 to $1.65 per share compared to the $1.38 per share earned in the first quarter of 2015. 
For the full year 2016, we expect net sales will increase in the low-single-digit percentage range compared to full year 2015. With annual sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income for our common share for 2015 (sic) [ 2016 ] will be in the range of $12.20 to $12.40 compared to $11.16 in 2015. 
Again, I would like to thank you for sharing -- for being with us this morning, and now we'd like to -- be happy to open up for questions."

That's really the #1 thing that drove it. That also includes the integration of that Comex business. That has been a nice piece of that. And also got to remember the mix because of the foreign currency exchange. As U.S. becomes bigger and bigger piece of that -- of our total sales, Paint Stores Group does have the highest gross margin. So that helped on the other piece. Now having said that, LIFO is always trying to catch what you think is  going to happen with the raws and the way the raws came in, there was a slight help from the LIFO. LIFO did help us, especially in the Consumer Group but also a little bit in the Stores Group. If you take a look about the long term, in the long term, I think we try to give you guidance what we think of the long term. We think that probably our long term, when you look at the make-up of the company and where we are going, it's in the mid-47s to the mid-49s. I think that -- again, when that foreign currency changes around, and instead of being at 80% U.S. and North American sales, you're going to start seeing that come down and back down into the 70%, that will have the reverse impact on the gross margins. So when we feel like we're running at a normal area, we think we're going to be in the 47.5% to 49.5% gross margins."

Because when you look at the Global Finishes Group in the fourth quarter, it was up 29%. It was -- the operating profit was really driven by SG&A expense control and favorable raw material costs, which more than offset the negative currency because they had to go against currency also. And I would tell you, we feel pretty good about this -- the SG&A savings that we have. And I'll tell you, years ago, when this Global Finishes Group was operating at 3%, 3.5%, after we bought the Becker, Sayerlack and the Inchem acquisitions, we said that eventually that we felt we could run it at 12%. And so we think we're at a pretty good spot. We think in the future, a lot of that improvement has come from those efficiencies that we were going to get. And I think that the future is going to be driven by market share gains and sales gains."

Richard, actually, a mid-single-digit decline is a pretty significant decline across the entire basket. We spent a lot of time talking about TiO2 and the latex and the resin side of the basket, which granted is the lion's share of our raw material basket by value, but there are also categories of packaging in specialty chemicals that may be moving the opposite direction and offset the deflation in TiO2 and resins and latex to some degree. The other thing I'd caution you on is, assuming that resin and latex pricing is tracking in line with propylene over crude oil, a lot of times, because these are specialty formulas, they're oftentimes owned and controlled by our supplier, that gives them some measure of pricing power in the short term. The resin that you use in a particular paint formula has a very significant impact on the performance of the end product, and they're not interchangeable parts. So if the supplier wants to hold on to some of the benefit of lower-cost propylene for a period of time, in the long run, we believe we'll get the benefit, but the benefit tends to come to the market slower than in a commodity category like TiO2."

Our consolidated sales in the fourth quarter increased 1.4% to $2.6 billion, due entirely to higher paint sales volume through our Paint Stores and Consumer Groups.
For the full year, sales increased 1.9% to $11.34 billion. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales 3.6% in the quarter and 3.3% for the full year. Consolidated gross profit in the fourth quarter increased $104.3 million to $1.3 billion and gross margin expanded to 50.8% of sales from 47.4% of sales in the fourth quarter 2014. 
For the year, gross margin increased to 49% of sales from 46.4% of sales last year. The increase in gross margin in the quarter and full year was due primarily to volume-driven supply chain productivity and lower year-over-year raw material costs. 
Selling, general and administrative expense increased $6.1 million to $991.5 million in the fourth quarter, but decreased as a percent of sales to 38.1% from 38.3% in the same quarter last year. 
For the full year 2015, SG&A expense increased $90.6 million to $3.91 billion, an increase as a percent of sales to 34.5% from 34.3% in 2014. Incremental SG&A to support the new HGTV HOME program at Lowe's and new store openings and sales territory additions accounted for the majority of the SG&A increase in the year. 
Other general expense decreased $12.6 million in the fourth quarter and $7.2 million for the year, due primarily to lower environmental expenses in both periods. 
Interest expense for the quarter increased $4.1 million to $19.5 million. For the year, interest expense was $61.8 million compared to $64.2 million in 2014. 
Profit before tax in the fourth quarter increased 57.4% to $297.2 million; and for the full year, increased 23.1% to $1.55 billion. 
Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter 2015 increased to 33.4% from 29.7% in the fourth quarter last year. For the year, our effective tax rate was 32% compared to 31.2% in 2014. 
Consolidated net income for the quarter increased $65.3 million to $198 million. For the year, net income increased $188 million to $1.05 billion. 
Net income as a percent of sales in the quarter increased to 7.6% from 5.2% last year. For the year, net income as a percent of sales increased to 9.3% from 7.8% in 2014. 
Diluted net income per common share in the fourth quarter 2015 increased to $2.12 from $1.37 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, diluted net income per common share increased 27.1% to $11.16 per share from $8.78 per share in 2014. 
Let me take a few minutes to break down our performance by segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the fourth quarter 2015 increased 5.9% to $1.68 billion, thanks to higher architectural paint sales volumes across all customer segments. 
For the year, net sales increased 5.2% to $7.21 billion. This full year sales increase was also driven by higher architectural paint sales volumes across all customer segments. 
Comparable store sales increased 5.1% in the quarter and 4.2% in the year. Regionally, in the fourth quarter, our Midwest division led all divisions, followed by Eastern division, Southeastern division and Southwestern division. 
Fourth quarter segment profit for Paint Stores Group increased 27.8% to $316.1 million, due primarily to higher year-over-year paint sales volumes. 
For the full year, Paint Stores Group profit increased 19.3% to $1.43 billion from $1.2 billion in 2014. The increase in segment profit for the year resulted from higher paint sales volumes that were partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. Segment profit margin for the fourth quarter increased to 18.9% from 15.6% last year. Profit margin for the full year 2015 increased to 19.9% from 17.5% in 2014. 
Turning now to Consumer Group. Fourth quarter external net sales increased 13.6% to $314.6 million. For the year, Consumer Group sales increased 11.1% to $1.58 billion. Most of the increase in sales for the fourth quarter and full year was from the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams paint program at Lowe's. 
Segment profit for the fourth quarter increased 67.9% to $50.9 million from $30.3 million in the fourth quarter 2014. For the year, segment profit increased 22.1% to $308.8 million from $252.9 million in 2014. 
Consumer Group's segment profit as a percent of net sales in the fourth quarter increased to 16.2% from 11% last year. For the year, segment profit margin increased to 19.6% from 17.8% last year. Most of the improvement in both fourth quarter and full year segment profit margin was from volume-driven operating efficiencies. 
For our Global Finishes Group, fourth quarter net sales in U.S. dollars decreased 9.5% to $454.8 million. And full year sales decreased 7.9% to $1.92 billion, due primarily to unfavorable currency translation. Currency translation decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 7.1% in the quarter and 7.5% in the year. 
Stated in U.S. dollars, Global Finishes Group segment profit in the fourth quarter increased to $50.6 million from $39 million last year. The increase in segment profit in the quarter resulted from good expense control and lower year-over-year raw material costs that were partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, which reduced segment profit $4.8 million. 
For the year, segment profit increased 0.4% to $201.9 million from $201.1 million last year. This full year profit improvement resulted from good expense control and lower raw material costs that were mostly offset by unfavorable currency translation of $26.5 million. 
As a percent of net sales, Global Finishes Group's operating profit was 11.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 7.8% last year and 10.5% for the year compared to 9.7% in 2014. 
For our Latin America Coatings Group. Net sales decreased 23.5% to $158.7 million in the fourth quarter and decreased 18.2% to $631 million for the full year, due primarily to unfavorable currency translation and lower volume sales, partially offset by higher year-over-year selling prices. Currency translation decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 21.4% in the quarter and 19.3% in the year. 
Stated in U.S. dollars, Latin America Coatings Group's segment profit in the quarter decreased to $2.8 million from $13 million last year. For the year, segment profit decreased to $18.5 million from $40.5 million in 2014. The decline in segment profit in both quarter and year was primarily due to unfavorable currency translation and lower volume sales, partially offset by selling price increases. 
Unfavorable currency translation decreased segment profit $5.3 million in the quarter and $16 million in the full year. 
As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 1.8% in the fourth quarter compared to 6.3% last year, and 2.9% for the year compared to 5.2% in 2014. 
That concludes review of our operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. So let me turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for 2016. John?"
303104,321220525,923236,"The Sherwin-Williams Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","The Sherwin-Williams Company","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As we announced last October, on January 1 of this year, I assumed the duties of Chief Executive Officer. Back in 1971, British rock band, The Who, recorded the now famous lyric, ""Meet the new",1285,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. 
As we announced last October, on January 1 of this year, I assumed the duties of Chief Executive Officer. Back in 1971, British rock band, The Who, recorded the now famous lyric, ""Meet the new boss, same as the old boss."" In our case, the saying may not hold true literally in every respect, but it is certainly true when it comes to our mutual confidence in the company's strategy, our focus on growing market share through superior products and execution, our adherence to key performance metrics like return on net assets employed and net operating cash to sales and our shareholder-friendly capital allocation. These are the things that will define the value of Sherwin-Williams in the years ahead. And I believe, they are all moving in the right direction. 
2015 was a year of ups and downs. Our full year revenue of $11.3 billion set a new record for the company, but fell well short of our original expectations. One reason for this was stronger currency headwinds than originally anticipated. Another was the weaker-than-expected demand for industrial coatings in certain categories, particularly those used to maintain oil and gas production and storage assets. And in the middle 2 quarters of 2015, we broke our long-standing practice of not giving weather reports on earnings calls as heavy rainfall across much of the country clearly affected paint demand. This lower-than-expected revenue performance, however, did not translate to lower-than-expected profit or cash flow. 
Our full year profit before tax, net income, earnings per share and net operating cash all met or exceeded the expectations we set back in January 2015. Net income eclipsed $1 billion in 2015 for the first time in our company's history. This strong profitability and cash generation was largely due to the successful and accelerated integration of the Comex stores and consolidation of Comex manufacturing assets, coupled with volume-driven sales -- supply chain productivity in North America, good SG&A expense control and raw material cost tailwinds. 
Looking ahead, we expect the year-over-year incremental margin benefit from the Comex integration to diminish as we go through 2016. Architectural paint sales through our paint stores picked up momentum in the fourth quarter, but was again offset to some degree by negative volumes in protective and marine coatings. 
Sales to residential repaint contractors continue to grow at double-digit paces. Sales volumes to the new construction markets and DIY customers also increased compared to last year, but at a slower pace than residential repaint. 
In total, Paint Stores Group grew fourth quarter revenues by just under 6%, with architectural paint volume growth outpacing revenues. 
In the fourth quarter, we opened 38 net new stores, bringing our full year store opening total to 83 new locations and our total store count at year-end to 4,086 stores in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean. We remain confident that our next milestone of 5,000 locations in North America is realistic, and we intend to get closer to that goal by 90 to 100 stores this year. 
Consumer Group also turned in a solid performance for the year. The launch of the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams paint program at Lowe's was one reason. But we also saw strong sales growth from another valued home center partner, Menards. As a result, Consumer Group's business grew by a low single-digit percentage pace in the fourth quarter. 
Market and economic conditions outside North America continue to be very challenging. Sales volumes in most Latin American countries fluctuated modestly compared to fourth quarter 2014 and with the exception of Brazil, where volumes and revenues declined significantly. The impact of currency devaluation, once again, was worse-than-anticipated in the quarter. 
Global Finishes Group also felt the brunt of softening environment coatings demand and deteriorating currencies in both Europe and Latin America, but made progress in offsetting these effects through tight SG&A control.
In 2015, we generated record net operating cash of $1.45 billion, thanks in part to the terrific working capital management by all of our operating segments. In spite of the incremental working capital required to support the HGTV HOME Program at Lowe's, our working capital ratio at year-end dropped to 8.6% of sales from 10.1% last year. 
Free cash flow, which is net operating cash less CapEx and dividends, was $963.5 million compared to $665.7 million last year. We used this cash from operations to fund capital expenditures, increase our dividend and buy back shares for treasury. 
Our capital expenditures in 2015 totaled $234 million. Depreciation for the year was $170 million, and amortization was $28 million. 
In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $185 million to $200 million and amortization of about $30 million. 
Capital spending will run higher than normal in 2016, as we complete some facility renovation projects. 
In 2015, we returned more than $1.28 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
In the fourth quarter, we acquired 1 million shares of the company's stock for treasury, bringing our full year to 3.575 million shares at an average cost of $278.57 per share and a total investment of just over $1 billion. At year-end, we have remaining authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares. 
We paid $249.6 million in cash to shareholders through quarterly dividends. 2015 marked our 37th consecutive year of increased dividends per share, a string we intend to continue. This year, at our February meeting of the Board of Directors, we'll recommend approval of an annual dividend of $3.36 per share, an increase of more than 25% over 2015. 
Looking ahead to 2016. The demand for paint and coatings in most domestic markets looks encouraging. Growth in residential starts and existing home turnover was solid throughout 2015. And the outlook for 2016 is equally encouraging. Although contracts for new nonresidential projects dipped slightly in 2015, it was still a strong year in absolute terms, which bodes well for paint demand in the segment. 
Outside the U.S., it appears likely that sluggish market conditions and currency devaluation, particularly in Europe and many Latin American countries, will remain a challenge. 
Our raw material basket has many moving parts but, in total, we believe we're likely to see lower year-over-year input cost in 2016. The continuing fall in the price of crude oil will no doubt have a positive impact on the petrochemical side of the raw materials basket. But these commodities will not necessarily move in linear relationship with crude. The price of high-grade chloride TiO2 continued to slide over the back half of 2015 due to weak global demand and overcapacity, but is likely nearing a bottom. Based on these factors, we would expect average year-over-year raw material costs for the paint and coatings industry to be down in the mid-single-digit range in 2016. 
Our outlook for first quarter 2016 is for consolidated net sales to increase in the low-single-digit percentage range compared to last year's first quarter. With sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the first quarter will be in the range of $1.50 to $1.65 per share compared to the $1.38 per share earned in the first quarter of 2015. 
For the full year 2016, we expect net sales will increase in the low-single-digit percentage range compared to full year 2015. With annual sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income for our common share for 2015 (sic) [ 2016 ] will be in the range of $12.20 to $12.40 compared to $11.16 in 2015. 
Again, I would like to thank you for sharing -- for being with us this morning, and now we'd like to -- be happy to open up for questions."

That's really the #1 thing that drove it. That also includes the integration of that Comex business. That has been a nice piece of that. And also got to remember the mix because of the foreign currency exchange. As U.S. becomes bigger and bigger piece of that -- of our total sales, Paint Stores Group does have the highest gross margin. So that helped on the other piece. Now having said that, LIFO is always trying to catch what you think is  going to happen with the raws and the way the raws came in. There was a slight help from the LIFO. LIFO did help us, especially in the Consumer Group, but also a little bit in the Stores Group. If you take a look about the long term, in the long term, I think we try to give you guidance what we think of the long term. We think that probably our long term, when you look at the make-up of the company and where we are going, it's in the mid-47s to the mid-49s. I think that -- again, when that foreign currency changes around, and instead of being at 80% U.S. and North American sales, you're going to start seeing that come down and back down into the 70s, that will have the reverse impact on the gross margins. So when we feel like we're running at a normal area, we think we're going to be in the 47.5% to 49.5% gross margins."

Richard, actually, a mid-single-digit decline is a pretty significant decline across the entire basket. We spend a lot of time talking about TiO2 and the latex and the resin side of the basket, which granted is the lion's share of our raw material basket by value, but there are also categories of packaging in specialty chemicals that may be moving the opposite direction and offset the deflation in TiO2 and resins and latex to some degree. The other thing I'd caution you on is, assuming that resin and latex pricing is tracking in line with propylene over crude oil, a lot of times, because these are specialty formulas, they're oftentimes owned and controlled by our supplier, that gives them some measure of pricing power in the short term. The resin that you use in a particular paint formula has a very significant impact on the performance of the end product, and they're not interchangeable parts. So if the supplier wants to hold on to some of the benefit of lower-cost propylene for a period of time, in the long run, we believe we'll get the benefit, but the benefit tends to come to the market slower than in a commodity category like TiO2."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. In the interest of time, we provided some balance sheet items and other select financial information on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations, April 21 press release.
I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the first quarter 2016 compared to the first quarter '15 then comment on each reportable segment.
Consolidated net sales increased 5.1% to a record $2.57 billion, driven primarily by higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores Group and Consumer Group. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales 2.8% in the quarter.
Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $129.3 million in the quarter to $1.26 billion. Our consolidated gross margin increased 280 basis points in the quarter to 49% of sales from 46.2% in the first quarter last year. Most of the gross margin improvement in the quarter resulted from the positive mix effect of Paint Stores Group, our highest gross margin segment, outpacing the growth of the other segments, coupled with increased operating leverage from higher production and distribution volume.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $73.2 million over the first quarter last year to $1 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 38.9% in the first quarter this year from 37.9% last year. Roughly half of this increase was from acquisition-related costs.
Interest expense increased $13.3 million compared to the first quarter last year to $25.7 million. This increase resulted from the shift to long-term debt from short term that occurred mid-year 2015 and acquisition-related interest expense.
Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $23.1 million to $216.4 million, due primarily to improved operating results from our Paint Stores Group.
Unfavorable currency translation reduced profit before tax in the quarter by $9.4 million or 4.9% compared to the first quarter last year.
Our effective tax rate was flat at 32% compared to the first quarter of 2015. For the full year 2016, we expect our effective tax rate will remain in the low 30% range.
Consolidated net income increased $15.7 million to $147.1 million. Net income as a percent of sales was 5.7% compared to 5.4% in the first quarter last year.
Finally, diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 13.8% to $1.57 per share from $1.38 per share in 2015. 
Looking at our results by operating segments. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the first quarter 2016 increased 10.5% to $1.62 billion from $1.46 billion last year. Comparable store sales, that is sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, increased 9.4%.
All of the Paint Stores Group sales increase was due to higher organic paint and equipment sales across all end markets. Price/mix had a negligible impact on sales in the quarter.
Regionally, in the first quarter, our Eastern division led all divisions, followed by Southeastern division, Midwestern division, Southwestern division and Canada. Sales and volumes were positive in every division. 
Segment profit for the group increased $77 million or 43.6% to $253.5 million in the quarter, as higher paint and equipment sales volumes were partially offset by higher SG&A spending. Segment operating margin increased to 15.7% of sales from 12.1% in the first quarter last year. 
For our Latin America Coatings Group, first quarter net sales, stated in U.S. dollars, decreased 24.7% to $125.2 million due to unfavorable currency translation and negative volumes that were partially offset by selling price increases.
Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 22.2% in the quarter. Segment profit in U.S. dollars decreased to a loss of $900,000 in the quarter from a profit of $9.5 million last year.
Segment profit was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation, partially offset by selling price increases.
Currency translation decreased Latin America segment profit $6.2 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was a loss of 70 basis points in the quarter compared to a profit of 5.7% in the first quarter 2015.
Turning to the Consumer Group. First quarter sales increased 7.5% to $378.1 million. As a reminder, in March, we annualized the start of the initial shipments of the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams paint program to Lowe's stores, which was completed by May 1 of last year.
Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased $8.6 million to $64 million in the quarter from $55.4 million in the first quarter last year. The profit improvement in the quarter was due primarily to improved operating efficiencies and higher sales volumes. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 16.9% from 15.8% in the same period last year.
For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars decreased 3.3% to $454.2 million in the quarter, as unfavorable currency translation was partially offset by positive price/mix. Unfavorable currently translation decreased net sales for this segment 4.7% in the quarter. 
First quarter segment profit, stated in U.S. dollars, increased $9.7 million or 24.9% to $48.6 million, due primarily to decreasing raw material costs and good cost control, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, which decreased segment profit $3 million in the quarter. As a percent of sales, segment profit increased to 10.7% from 8.3% in the same period last year.
That concludes my recap of our results for the quarter. So I will now turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for second quarter and full year. John?"
303104,329684334,960785,"The Sherwin-Williams Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","The Sherwin-Williams Company","Executives","Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. First quarter 2016 was a good quarter for Sherwin-Williams from both a revenue and profit perspective. Architectural paint volume growth in North America was the strongest we've seen",944,"Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. 
First quarter 2016 was a good quarter for Sherwin-Williams from both a revenue and profit perspective. Architectural paint volume growth in North America was the strongest we've seen in the past 10 years or longer. 
Industrial coatings demand also picked up some momentum in North America and Europe. Even with a 2.8% drag from unfavorable currency translation in the quarter and continued soft market conditions in Latin America, our consolidated sales growth exceeded 5% for the first time since third quarter 2014.
To get a clear picture of our profitability, you need to back out the acquisition-related costs we recorded in the quarter. Ex acquisition costs, diluted net income per common share increased 31% on sales growth of just over 5%. As a percent of sales, gross profit expanded 280 basis points year-over-year, operating profit improved 300 basis points and profit before tax improved 190 basis points. Our incremental margin on consolidated profit before tax was 48.6%. SG&A was the only line on the P&L that went the wrong way as a percent of sales, the result of higher SG&A spending by our Paint Stores Group and the acquisition-related expenses.
Both our domestic operating segments delivered strong results in the quarter. Paint Stores Group recorded double-digit revenue growth in 4 of the 5 customer segments we tracked, led by residential repaint, new residential and DIY.
Comparable store sales growth of 9.4% was the strongest comp performance we've seen in a few years. Our optimism is fueled further by our professional contractor customers reporting very healthy orderbook trends that extend well into the year. 
During the quarter, Paint Stores Group opened 20 new stores and closed 7 redundant stores. Our plan still calls for full year store openings in the range of 90 to 100 net new locations. Today, our total store count in the U.S., Canada and Caribbean stand at 4,099 compared to 4,010 a year ago.
Consumer Group's 7.5% sales increase and 110 basis point improvement in segment profit margin in the quarter primarily reflected strong results from our national account customers.
Sales to commercial, industrial and MRO customers also showed good progress in the quarter. Strong sales growth and volume-driven productivity gains by our global supply chain organization resulted in a very healthy 32% profit margin on incremental sales from our Consumer Group in the quarter.
Unfavorable currency translation continued to weigh on sales and profit performance in our Global Finishes Group and our Latin America Coatings Group. Global Finishes Group did report positive volumes and positive sales in local currencies, driven primarily by improving marketing conditions in North America and Europe. They also managed expenses very well, resulting in an impressive 240 basis point expansion in segment operating margin.
Sales volumes in most Latin American countries continued to decline, with Mexico standing out as the notable exception. The impact of currency devaluation once again was worse than anticipated in the quarter.
Our net working capital increased in the quarter due to the strong upward inflection of our business in the first quarter evaluated over the trailing 12-month of sales. This increase in working capital resulted in a net operating cash use of approximately $80 million in the quarter compared to a use of about $55 million in the first quarter last year.
Our capital expenditure in the quarter totaled $52 million, depreciation was $42.9 million and amortization was $5.8 million. In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $170 million to $180 million and amortization of about $30 million. Capital spending will run higher than normal in 2016 as we complete some facility renovation projects. 
During the quarter, we made no open-market purchases of our common stock for Treasury. On March 31, we had remaining board authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares.
As we indicated on our call announcing the Valspar acquisition, we intend to build cash on our balance sheet over the course of the year to reduce total borrowings required to close the deal. This, along with the cash required to service the debt after the close, will significantly curtail our share repurchases for the foreseeable future. Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.84 per share, up 25% from $0.67 last year.
As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, North American architectural paint demand is strong, driven by a steadily increasing level of residential construction and remodeling activity. As we move into the prime painting season, we are also encouraged by growing signs of a more robust nonresidential recovery and improving demand for many industrial products. This growth will continue to be offset, to some degree, by challenging conditions in Latin America and currency headwinds, particularly in the first half of the year.
Our outlook for second quarter 2016 is for consolidated net sales to increase low to mid-single-digits percent compared to last year's second quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $3.95 to $4.15 per share, a 9.5% increase at the mid-point compared to last year's record $3.70 per share.
For the full year 2016, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2015 by a low single-digit percentage. With annual sales at that level, we are raising our expectation for full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $12.50 to $12.70 per share compared to $11.16 [ph] per share earned in 2015. 
Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And now we'll be happy to take your questions."

I know, last year, we had subpar growth, about 2%, 2.5%. So as you look at when your customers are telling you, what kind of gallon niche growth do you see for the industry in the U.S. this year? And given that outlook, I'm wondering why you only have mid -- low to mid-single-digit sales growth expectations for Q2. I know you're running some tougher Consumer Group comps, but it would seem that, especially with the weather snapback in Q2, that the PSG should have a very strong performance."

But Latin America buys majority of its raw materials in U.S. currency demand dollar-denominated. And when you look at it, the currency's devaluation has same effect on the raw materials inflation. So the raw materials really are negatively affected by that currency. When you ask about in total, what are you thinking about on the conditions down there, we don't expect to see improved economic conditions in the region in 2016. I think -- we think it's consistent with this for a long time. I mean, we think that's -- applies to currency and volume demand. We're starting to see currencies change a little positively. The Brazilian real went from about 4 10 [ph]. We thought it could close -- get close to 4 25 [ph]. Now it's down to the 3 50 [ph], 3 60 [ph]. But U.S. dollars are very close to the breakeven levels.

In the interest of time, we provided some balance sheet items and other select financial information on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations, April 21 press release. I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the first quarter 2016 compared to the first quarter '15 then comment on each reportable segment.
Consolidated net sales increased 5.1% to a record $2.57 billion, driven primarily by higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores Group and Consumer Group. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales 2.8% in the quarter.
Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $129.3 million in the quarter to $1.26 billion. Our consolidated gross margin increased 280 basis points in the quarter to 49% of sales from 46.2% in the first quarter last year. Most of the gross margin improvement in the quarter resulted from the positive mix effect of Paint Stores Group, our highest gross margin segment, outpacing the growth of the other segments, coupled with increased operating leverage from higher production and distribution volume.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $73.2 million over the first quarter last year to $1 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 38.9% in the first quarter this year from 37.9% last year. Roughly half of this increase was from acquisition-related costs.
Interest expense increased $13.3 million compared to the first quarter last year to $25.7 million. This increase resulted from the shift to long-term debt from short term that occurred mid-year 2015 and acquisition-related interest expense. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $23.1 million to $216.4 million, due primarily to improved operating results from our Paint Stores Group. Unfavorable currency translation reduced profit before tax in the quarter by $9.4 million or 4.9% compared to the first quarter last year.
Our effective tax rate was flat at 32% compared to the first quarter of 2015. For the full year 2016, we expect our effective tax rate will remain in the low 30% range. Consolidated net income increased $15.7 million to $147.1 million. Net income, as a percent of sales, was 5.7% compared to 5.4% in the first quarter last year. Finally, diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 13.8% to $1.57 per share from $1.38 per share in 2015. 
Looking at our results by operating segments. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the first quarter 2016 increased 10.5% to $1.62 billion from $1.46 billion last year. Comparable store sales, that is sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, increased 9.4%.
All of the Paint Stores Group sales increase was due to higher organic paint and equipment sales across all end markets. Price/mix had a negligible impact on sales in the quarter.
Regionally, in the first quarter, our Eastern division led all divisions, followed by Southeastern division, Midwestern division, Southwestern division and Canada. Sales and volumes were positive in every division. 
Segment profit for the group increased $77 million or 43.6% to $253.5 million in the quarter, as higher paint and equipment sales volumes were partially offset by higher SG&A spending. Segment operating margin increased to 15.7% of sales from 12.1% in the first quarter last year. 
For our Latin America Coatings Group, first quarter net sales, stated in U.S. dollars, decreased 24.7% to $125.2 million due to unfavorable currency translation and negative volumes that were partially offset by selling price increases.
Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 22.2% in the quarter. Segment profit in U.S. dollars decreased to a loss of $900,000 in the quarter from a profit of $9.5 million last year.  Segment profit was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation, partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation decreased Latin America segment profit $6.2 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was a loss of 70 basis points in the quarter compared to a profit of 5.7% in the first quarter of 2015.
Turning to the Consumer Group. First quarter sales increased 7.5% to $378.1 million. As a reminder, in March, we annualized the start of the initial shipments of the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams paint program to Lowe's stores, which was completed by May 1 of last year.
Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased $8.6 million to $64 million in the quarter from $55.4 million in the first quarter last year. The profit improvement in the quarter was due primarily to improved operating efficiencies and higher sales volumes. Segment profit, as a percent of external sales, increased to 16.9% from 15.8% in the same period last year.
For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars decreased 3.3% to $454.2 million in the quarter, as unfavorable currency translation was partially offset by positive price/mix. Unfavorable currently translation decreased net sales for this segment 4.7% in the quarter. 
First quarter segment profit, stated in U.S. dollars, increased $9.7 million or 24.9% to $48.6 million, due primarily to decreasing raw material costs and good cost control, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, which decreased segment profit $3 million in the quarter. As a percent of sales, segment profit increased to 10.7% from 8.3% in the same period last year.
That concludes my recap of our results for the quarter. So I will now turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for second quarter and full year. John?"
303104,329684334,961029,"The Sherwin-Williams Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","The Sherwin-Williams Company","Executives","Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. First quarter 2016 was a good quarter for Sherwin-Williams from both a revenue and profit perspective. Architectural paint volume growth in North America was the strongest we've seen",945,"Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. 
First quarter 2016 was a good quarter for Sherwin-Williams from both a revenue and profit perspective. Architectural paint volume growth in North America was the strongest we've seen in the past 10 years or longer. Industrial coatings demand also picked up some momentum in North America and Europe. Even with a 2.8% drag from unfavorable currency translation in the quarter and continued soft market conditions in Latin America, our consolidated sales growth exceeded 5% for the first time since third quarter 2014.
To get a clear picture of our profitability, you need to back out the acquisition-related costs we recorded in the quarter. Ex acquisition costs, diluted net income per common share increased 31% on sales growth of just over 5%. As a percent of sales, gross profit expanded 280 basis points year-over-year, operating profit improved 300 basis points and profit before tax improved 190 basis points. Our incremental margin on consolidated profit before tax was 48.6%. SG&A was the only line on the P&L that went the wrong way as a percent of sales, the result of higher SG&A spending by our Paint Stores Group and the acquisition-related expenses.
Both our domestic operating segments delivered strong results in the quarter. Paint Stores Group recorded double-digit revenue growth in 4 of the 5 customer segments we tracked, led by residential repaint, new residential and DIY.
Comparable store sales growth of 9.4% was the strongest comp performance we've seen in a few years. Our optimism is fueled further by our professional contractor customers reporting very healthy order book trends that extend well into the year. 
During the quarter, Paint Stores Group opened 20 new stores and closed 7 redundant stores. Our plan still calls for full year store openings in the range of 90 to 100 net new locations. Today, our total store count in the U.S., Canada and Caribbean stand at 4,099 compared to 4,010 a year ago.
Consumer Group's 7.5% sales increase and 110 basis point improvement in segment profit margin in the quarter primarily reflected strong results from our national account customers. Sales to commercial, industrial and MRO customers also showed good progress in the quarter. Strong sales growth and volume-driven productivity gains by our global supply chain organization resulted in a very healthy 32% profit margin on incremental sales from our Consumer Group in the quarter.
Unfavorable currency translation continued to weigh on sales and profit performance in our Global Finishes Group and our Latin America Coatings Group. Global Finishes Group did report positive volumes and positive sales in local currencies, driven primarily by improving marketing conditions in North America and Europe. They also managed expenses very well, resulting in an impressive 240 basis point expansion in segment operating margin.
Sales volumes in most Latin American countries continued to decline, with Mexico standing out as the notable exception. The impact of currency devaluation once again was worse than anticipated in the quarter.
Our net working capital increased in the quarter due to the strong upward inflection of our business in the first quarter evaluated over the trailing 12 months of sales. This increase in working capital resulted in a net operating cash use of approximately $80 million in the quarter compared to a use of about $55 million in the first quarter last year.
Our capital expenditure in the quarter totaled $52 million. Depreciation was $42.9 million, and amortization was $5.8 million. In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $170 million to $180 million and amortization of about $30 million. Capital spending will run higher than normal in 2016 as we complete some facility renovation projects. 
During the quarter, we made no open-market purchases of our common stock for Treasury. On March 31, we had remaining board authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares.
As we indicated on our call announcing the Valspar acquisition, we intend to build cash on our balance sheet over the course of the year to reduce total borrowings required to close the deal. This, along with the cash required to service the debt after the close, will significantly curtail our share repurchases for the foreseeable future. Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.84 per share, up 25% from $0.67 last year.
As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, North American architectural paint demand is strong, driven by a steadily increasing level of residential construction and remodeling activity. As we move into the prime painting season, we are also encouraged by growing signs of a more robust nonresidential recovery and improving demand for many industrial products. This growth will continue to be offset to some degree by challenging conditions in Latin America and currency headwinds, particularly in the first half of the year.
Our outlook for second quarter 2016 is for consolidated net sales to increase low to mid-single-digits percent compared to last year's second quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $3.95 to $4.15 per share, a 9.5% increase at the mid-point compared to last year's record $3.70 per share.
For the full year 2016, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2015 by a low single-digit percentage. With annual sales at that level, we are raising our expectation for full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $12.50 to $12.70 per share compared to $11.16 per share earned in 2015. 
Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And now, we'll be happy to take your questions."

And when you take a look at how our gross margin was last year and if you take a look at the second, third and fourth quarter, how strong it was, if you think about the way the raw materials were moving last year, we felt that at the beginning of the year is really where we're going to have to make most of our improvement in the gross profit as a percent of sales in the improvement. We were -- last year, we were at 46% in the first quarter. We jumped all the way to 48.8% and then we go to 49% and then over 50% in the last 3 quarters. So we feel good about where our gross margin is. We think that the raws [ph] will continue to -- the raw [ph] of goodness will continue to shrink. And we're going to hit a line somewhere later in this year when we expect that it will be negligible. So we felt that we had to have this kind of an improvement in the first quarter to have improvement throughout the year. And we feel good about where we are with the gross profit."

And I'll tell you why. The Global Finishes Group is doing a great job looking for efficiencies, and we're doing fine there on the conversion costs. But Latin America buys a majority of its raw materials in U.S. currency and dollar-denominated. And when you look at it, the currency's devaluation has the same effect on the raw materials inflation. So the raw materials really are negatively affected by that currency. When you ask about in total, what are you thinking about on the conditions down there? We don't expect to see improved economic conditions in the region in 2016. I think -- we think it's consistent with this for a long time. I mean we think that's -- applies to currency and volume demand. We're starting to see currencies change a little positively. The Brazilian real went from about 4 10. We thought it could close -- get close to 4 25. Now it's down in the 3 50, 3 60. But in U.S. dollars are very close to the breakeven levels. So our plan for 2016 calls for this segment to report a profit.

In the interest of time, we provided some balance sheet items and other select financial information on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations, April 21 press release. I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the first quarter 2016 compared to the first quarter '15 then comment on each reportable segment.
Consolidated net sales increased 5.1% to a record $2.57 billion, driven primarily by higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores Group and Consumer Group. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales 2.8% in the quarter. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $129.3 million in the quarter to $1.26 billion. Our consolidated gross margin increased 280 basis points in the quarter to 49% of sales from 46.2% in the first quarter last year. Most of the gross margin improvement in the quarter resulted from the positive mix effect of Paint Stores Group, our highest gross margin segment, outpacing the growth of the other segments, coupled with increased operating leverage from higher production and distribution volume.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $73.2 million over the first quarter last year to $1 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 38.9% in the first quarter this year from 37.9% last year. Roughly half of this increase was from acquisition-related costs. Interest expense increased $13.3 million compared to the first quarter last year to $25.7 million. This increase resulted from the shift to long-term debt from short term that occurred mid-year 2015 and acquisition-related interest expense. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $23.1 million to $216.4 million, due primarily to improved operating results from our Paint Stores Group. Unfavorable currency translation reduced profit before tax in the quarter by $9.4 million or 4.9% compared to the first quarter last year.
Our effective tax rate was flat at 32% compared to the first quarter of 2015. For the full year 2016, we expect our effective tax rate will remain in the low 30% range. Consolidated net income increased $15.7 million to $147.1 million. Net income, as a percent of sales, was 5.7% compared to 5.4% in the first quarter last year. Finally, diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 13.8% to $1.57 per share from $1.38 per share in 2015. 
Looking at our results by operating segments. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the first quarter 2016 increased 10.5% to $1.62 billion from $1.46 billion last year. Comparable store sales, that is sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months, increased 9.4%. All of the Paint Stores Group sales increase was due to higher organic paint and equipment sales across all end markets. Price/mix had a negligible impact on sales in the quarter. Regionally, in the first quarter, our Eastern division led all divisions, followed by Southeastern division, Midwestern division, Southwestern division and Canada. Sales and volumes were positive in every division. 
Segment profit for the group increased $77 million or 43.6% to $253.5 million in the quarter, as higher paint and equipment sales volumes were partially offset by higher SG&A spending. Segment operating margin increased to 15.7% of sales from 12.1% in the first quarter last year.  For our Latin America Coatings Group, first quarter net sales, stated in U.S. dollars, decreased 24.7% to $125.2 million due to unfavorable currency translation and negative volumes that were partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 22.2% in the quarter. Segment profit in U.S. dollars decreased to a loss of $900,000 in the quarter from a profit of $9.5 million last year.  Segment profit was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation, partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation decreased Latin America segment profit $6.2 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was a loss of 70 basis points in the quarter compared to a profit of 5.7% in the first quarter of 2015.
Turning to the Consumer Group. First quarter sales increased 7.5% to $378.1 million. As a reminder, in March, we annualized the start of the initial shipments of the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams paint program to Lowe's stores, which was completed by May 1 of last year. Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased $8.6 million to $64 million in the quarter from $55.4 million in the first quarter last year. The profit improvement in the quarter was due primarily to improved operating efficiencies and higher sales volumes. Segment profit, as a percent of external sales, increased to 16.9% from 15.8% in the same period last year. 
For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars decreased 3.3% to $454.2 million in the quarter, as unfavorable currency translation was partially offset by positive price/mix. Unfavorable currently translation decreased net sales for this segment 4.7% in the quarter. First quarter segment profit, stated in U.S. dollars, increased $9.7 million or 24.9% to $48.6 million, due primarily to decreasing raw material costs and good cost control, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, which decreased segment profit $3 million in the quarter. As a percent of sales, segment profit increased to 10.7% from 8.3% in the same period last year.
That concludes my recap of our results for the quarter. So I will now turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for second quarter and full year. John?"

Even with a 2.8% drag from unfavorable currency translation in the quarter and continued soft market conditions in Latin America, our consolidated sales growth exceeded 5% for the first time since third quarter 2014.
To get a clear picture of our profitability, you need to back out the acquisition-related costs we recorded in the quarter. Ex acquisition costs, diluted net income per common share increased 31% on sales growth of just over 5%. As a percent of sales, gross profit expanded 280 basis points year-over-year, operating profit improved 300 basis points and profit before tax improved 190 basis points. Our incremental margin on consolidated profit before tax was 48.6%. SG&A was the only line on the P&L that went the wrong way as a percent of sales, the result of higher SG&A spending by our Paint Stores Group and the acquisition-related expenses.
Both our domestic operating segments delivered strong results in the quarter. Paint Stores Group recorded double-digit revenue growth in 4 of the 5 customer segments we track, led by residential repaint, new residential and DIY. Comparable store sales growth of 9.4% was the strongest comp performance we've seen in a few years. Our optimism is fueled further by our professional contractor customers reporting very healthy order book trends that extend well into the year. During the quarter, Paint Stores Group opened 20 new stores and closed 7 redundant stores. Our plan still calls for full year store openings in the range of 90 to 100 net new locations. Today, our total store count in the U.S., Canada and Caribbean stand at 4,099 compared to 4,010 a year ago. 
Consumer Group's 7.5% sales increase and 110 basis point improvement in segment profit margin in the quarter primarily reflected strong results from our national account customers. Sales to commercial, industrial and MRO customers also showed good progress in the quarter. Strong sales growth and volume-driven productivity gains by our global supply chain organization resulted in a very healthy 32% profit margin on incremental sales from our Consumer Group in the quarter.
Unfavorable currency translation continued to weigh on sales and profit performance in our Global Finishes Group and our Latin America Coatings Group. Global Finishes Group did report positive volumes and positive sales in local currencies, driven primarily by improving marketing conditions in North America and Europe. They also managed expenses very well, resulting in an impressive 240 basis point expansion in segment operating margin. Sales volumes in most Latin American countries continued to decline, with Mexico standing out as the notable exception. The impact of currency devaluation once again was worse than anticipated in the quarter.
Our net working capital increased in the quarter due to the strong upward inflection of our business in the first quarter evaluated over the trailing 12 months of sales. This increase in working capital resulted in a net operating cash use of approximately $80 million in the quarter compared to a use of about $55 million in the first quarter last year. Our capital expenditure in the quarter totaled $52 million. Depreciation was $42.9 million, and amortization was $5.8 million. In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $170 million to $180 million and amortization of about $30 million. Capital spending will run higher than normal in 2016 as we complete some facility renovation projects. During the quarter, we made no open-market purchases of our common stock for Treasury. On March 31, we had remaining board authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares.
As we indicated on our call announcing the Valspar acquisition, we intend to build cash on our balance sheet over the course of the year to reduce total borrowings required to close the deal. This, along with the cash required to service the debt after the close, will significantly curtail our share repurchases for the foreseeable future. Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.84 per share, up 25% from $0.67 last year.
As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, North American architectural paint demand is strong, driven by a steadily increasing level of residential construction and remodeling activity. As we move into the prime painting season, we are also encouraged by growing signs of a more robust nonresidential recovery and improving demand for many industrial products. This growth will continue to be offset to some degree by challenging conditions in Latin America and currency headwinds, particularly in the first half of the year.
Our outlook for second quarter 2016 is for consolidated net sales to increase low to mid-single-digits percent compared to last year's second quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $3.95 to $4.15 per share, a 9.5% increase at the mid-point compared to last year's record $3.70 per share. For the full year 2016, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2015 by a low single-digit percentage. With annual sales at that level, we are raising our expectation for full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $12.50 to $12.70 per share compared to $11.16 per share earned in 2015. 
Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And now, we'll be happy to take your questions."

And I'll tell you why. The Global Finishes Group is doing a great job looking for efficiencies, and we're doing fine there on the conversion costs. But Latin America buys a majority of its raw materials in U.S. currency and dollar-denominated. And when you look at it, the currency's devaluation has the same effect on the raw materials as inflation. So the raw materials really are negatively affected by that currency. When you ask about in total, what are you thinking about on the conditions down there? We don't expect to see improved economic conditions in the region in 2016. I think we've been consistent with this for a long time. I mean we think that's -- applies to currency and volume demand. We're starting to see currencies change a little positively. The Brazilian reais went from about 4.10, we thought it could close -- get close to 4.25. Now it's down in the 3.50, 3.60. But -- and U.S. dollars are very close to the breakeven levels.

In the interest of time, we've provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations, July 21 press release. 
I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the second quarter 2016 compared to the second quarter 2015 then comment on each reportable segment. 
Consolidated net sales increased 2.8% to a record $3.22 billion, driven by higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores Group. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales 1.5% in the quarter. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $105.8 million in the quarter to $1.64 billion. 
Our consolidated gross margin increased 200 basis points in the quarter to 50.8% of sales from 48.8% in the second quarter last year. More than half of the gross margin improvement in the quarter resulted from the positive mix effect of Paint Stores Group, our highest gross margin segment, outpacing the growth of the other segments, coupled with increased operating leverage from higher production and distribution volume.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $54.7 million over second quarter last year to $1.1 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 32.7% in the second quarter this year from 31.9% last year. A relatively small portion of this increase was acquisition-related expenses.
Interest expense increased $28 million compared to second quarter last year to $40.9 million. This increase includes $20.7 million in acquisition-related interest expense with the balance resulting from a shift to long-term debt from short term that occurred midyear 2015. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $31.4 million to $539.2 million due primarily to improved operating results from our Paint Stores Group.
Unfavorable currency translation reduced profit before tax in the quarter by $3.3 million compared to second quarter last year. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 32.1%, excluding the impact of the change in accounting standard. For the full year 2016, we expect our effective tax rate will remain in the low 30s excluding the impact of the change in accounting standard. Consolidated net income increased $28.1 million to $378.1 million. Net income, as a percent of sales, was 11.7% compared to 11.2% in the second quarter last year. 
Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 7.8% to $3.99 per share from $3.70 per share in 2015. The $3.99 includes $0.09 accretion from the accounting change and $0.16 dilution from acquisition-related expenses. Looking at our results by operating segment.
Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the second quarter '16 increased 6.2% to $2.11 billion from $1.98 billion last year. Comparable store sales, that is sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, increased 5.2%. All of the Paint Stores Group sales increase was due to higher organic architectural paint and equipment sales volumes across all end markets. Price mix had a negligible impact on sales in the quarter, and protective and Marine coating sales were a modest drag on revenue growth.
Regionally in the second quarter, our Southeastern division led all divisions, followed by Midwestern division, Southwestern division, Canada and Eastern division. Sales and volumes were positive in every geographic division. 
Segment profit for the group increased $75.6 million or 17.4% to $509 million in the quarter, as higher architectural paint and equipment sales volumes were partially offset by higher SG&A spending. Segment operating margin increased to 24.1% of sales from 21.8% in the second quarter last year. For our Latin America Coatings Group. Second quarter net sales, stated in U.S. dollars, decreased 11.2% to $133.3 million, due to unfavorable currency translation and negative volumes that were partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 16.4% in the quarter.
Segment profit in U.S. dollars decreased to a loss of $9.6 million in the quarter from a profit of $4 million last year. Segment profit was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation that were partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation decreased Latin America segment profit $1.3 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was negative 7.2% in the quarter compared to a profit of 2.7% in the second quarter 2015.
Turning to the Consumer Group. Second quarter sales decreased 2.6% to $477.5 million. As a reminder, in April, we annualized the completion of the load in of the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams paint program in Lowe's stores, which was completed by May 1 last year. Segment profit for the Consumer Group decreased $6 million to $108.3 million in the quarter from $114.2 million in the second quarter last year, due primarily to lower sales and increased SG&A spending, partially offset by improved operating efficiencies.
Segment profit, as a percent of external sales, decreased to 22.7% from 23.3% in the same period last year. For our Global Finishes Group. Sales in U.S. dollars decreased 1.3% to $499.2 million in the quarter as unfavorable currency translation was partially offset by positive price mix. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment 2.6% in the quarter.
Second quarter segment profits stated in U.S. dollars increased $8 million or 13.9% to $65.2 million, due primarily to decreasing raw material cost and good cost control, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, which decreased segment profit $1.5 million in the quarter. As a percent of sales, segment profit increased to 13.1% from 11.3% in the same period last year. 
That concludes my recap of our results for the quarter. So I will now turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for third quarter and full year. John?"
303104,369548581,1009461,"The Sherwin-Williams Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","The Sherwin-Williams Company","Executives","Thank you, Bob.

I think it's fair to say our results for the second quarter were mixed. Architectural paint volumes through our Paint Stores Group held up well in the quarter, resulting in solid revenue growth and continued strong earnings leverage and flow through. Our Global Finishes Group also did a commendable job of managing both gross margins and SG&A, resulting in a respectable 180 basis points operating margin improvement on modest volume growth.
We continue to see positive demand momentum in some of our industrial coatings businesses, primarily in Europe and the U.S. and currency headwinds in Latin America are starting to ease. Those were the positives in the quarter. 
On the other hand, while we expect a difficult comparisons in the HGTV HOME paint program due to heavy stocking orders in the second quarter last year, some of the retail programs we thought would generate growth in the quarter fell short. We are supporting many of these programs with incremental SG&A investment, and we have high return expectations on these investments. 
Finally, while currency comparisons have improved in many Latin American countries, demand trends remained difficult and our outlook for this segment for the full year continues to deteriorate. Our earnings per share results in the quarter include expenses related to the Valspar acquisition, as well as a tax benefit related to the adoption of a new accounting standard. 
If you back out these items, diluted net income per common share increased 9.7% on sales growth of less than 3%. As a percent of sales, gross profit increased 200 basis points year-over-year and operating profit and profit before tax both expanded a little more than 50 basis points. Excluding the acquisition expense, our incremental margin on consolidated profit before tax was 36%. SG&A was the only line on the P&L that went the wrong way as a percent of sales, the result of higher SG&A spending by a Paint Stores Group, channel investment by Consumer Group and expenses related to the Valspar acquisition.
Paint Stores Group delivered another strong sales performance in the residential segments, which include residential repaint contractors, new residential construction and DIY. Combined, sales to these 3 segments grew by more than 10%. Sales to commercial, health care and property management customers also generated solid year-over-year growth. The outlook for continued growth in these segments over the balance of the year remains positive, supported by very healthy order book trends reported by most of our contractor segments extending into 2017.
During the first half of the year, Paint Stores Group opened 45 new stores and closed 14 redundant locations. This completes our consolidation of redundant store locations acquired from Comex. Our plan for the full year still calls for store openings in the range of 90 to 100 net new locations. Today, our total store count in the U.S, Canada and the Caribbeans; stands at 4,117 compared to 4,025 a year ago.
We anticipated a modest sale decline from Consumer Group coming into the second quarter. This, combined with the elevated SG&A investment, tempered our second quarter outlook, which is reflected in our guidance. We remain confident that the great work our Consumer Group teams are doing in strengthening our brand positioning across all retail channels and the investment we are making in many of these channels will pay handsome returns in the years ahead. 
Consumer Group's commercial, industrial and MRO business continued to show good progress on both sales and margin in the quarter. Unfavorable currency translation continues to weigh on sales and profit performance in our Global Finishes Group and Latin America Coatings Group. Both segments reported positive sales in local currency in the quarter and Global Finishes Group volumes were positive, thanks in large part to improving market conditions in North America and Europe.
Volumes sales in most Latin American countries continued to decline with Brazil standing out as the most notable exception. Although Brazil's volume momentum improved in the quarter, margin pressure from raw materials continued to challenge profitability in Brazil and throughout the region. In the first 6 months of 2016, we generated $510 million in net operating cash, an increase of $161 million compared to the first half of 2015, driven by higher 6-month net income and good working capital discipline.
Working capital was a use of cash in the quarter, increasing by about $3.8 million year-over-year. Working capital, as a percent of sales, decreased to 11.6% from 11.8% at the end of the second quarter last year. Our capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $62.1 million. Depreciation was $43.8 million and amortization was $6.2 million. In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $170 million to $180 million and amortization of about $30 million. 
Capital spending will run higher than normal in 2016 as we complete some facility renovation projects. During the quarter, we made no open market purchases of our common stock for treasury. On June 30, we had remaining Board authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares. As indicated when we announced the Valspar acquisition, we intend to build cash in our balance sheet over the course of the year to reduce total borrowings required to close the deal, which will eliminate our share repurchase activity in 2016. At the close of the second quarter 2016, our cash balance was $402.7 million compared to $75.1 million on June 30, 2015.
Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.84 per share, up 25% from $0.67 last year. The outlook for Paint Stores Group over the next 6 months remains very positive, and we should see steady improvement from Consumer Group and Global Finishes Group. These positives will be offset to some degree by continued weakness in Latin America. As we've commented over the past few quarters, the gross margin tailwind we have enjoyed in recent years from raw material cost deflation will diminish as we go through the back half of 2016. 
Our outlook for third quarter 2016 is for consolidated net sales to increase low- to mid single-digits percent compared to last year's third quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $4.10 to $4.30 per share compared to last year's record $3.97 per share. 
The full year 2016 earnings per share guidance we provided at the end of the first quarter did not include expenses related to the acquisition of Valspar or the tax benefit from the adoption of the new accounting standard. 
Today, we are revising our guidance for full year consolidated net income per common share to reflect these 2 impacts. For the full year, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2015 by a low single-digit percentage. With annual sales at that level, we are revising our expectation for full year diluted net income per common share to be in a range of $11.65 to $11.85 per share compared to $11.16 per share earned in 2015.
Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And now we'll be happy to take your questions."

On the raw material outlook, we still see low mid-single-digit deflation from the full year '16. Although you ask specifically about TiO2, the majors in TiO2 we think are probably gaining some traction on the second quarter price increase that they announced that is off the December 2015 lows. The implementation at this point, as near as we can tell from an industry standpoint, is probably in the mid single-digit cents per pound. So not a significant increase in percentage terms. They -- as expected, they've been out with a third quarter announcement. We think that it's likely they may get some traction. But how much they get really depends on customer size, on location geographically. So we're likely to see some year-over-year inflation in TiO2 as far as the rest of the basket. The feedstocks for the latex and a click monomer market is -- have been very stable. Propylene, chemical grade propylene, has been steady at around $0.31 a pound. So we don't necessarily see inflation in that side of the basket."

In the commercial market, starts are down, but completions are up pretty significantly year-over-year. So we are seeing solid demand growth in the new construction markets. In their repaint markets, while in the pro residential repaint business has been really solid, we -- what's hard to determine at this stage because we just don't have the data is how the DIY channel held up in the second quarter. So I hesitate to say that this just not enough data to coal market growth in the second quarter yet. But I think that's the truth. The contractor market seems to have grow nicely but it's hard to tell on the other piece."

So this change is a coming change for us has nothing to do and it won't change our cash performance. But instead of having that differential that for us, as you said in the second quarter, $8 million go to retained earnings and now goes directly through the P&L. So that's why it was $0.09 in the second quarter. Year-to-date, it was $0.28. And the reason why I was $0.19 in the first quarter is because of the, in the first quarter, it's when the vesting occurs of our long-term RSOs so that many people are on that. So that's why it hit the first quarter. Second quarter was really driven by stock options that were exercised. So that's what it is. It doesn't have at -- differential. That's why we pointed out.

But to the extent that the recycling new rest Marcus hasn't changed much, is it that we just expect the cycle to have a much bigger rally in the near term before normalizing the midcycle? Or I guess, what's driving the main difference?"

And I think you answered the question. It's growing because the base is growing. And if you look at the overall U.S. architectural paint market, more than 80% of average annual volume go stored repaint. It's supplied to structures that already exist. If you look at that 7 40 to 7 60 normalized range, that dates all the way back to the late 1990s. And we've had 3 building cycles since the late 1990s that have put a lot more square footage in place, our population has grown significantly since then. So we think it's reasonable to adjust normalized expectation up based on primarily repaint up volume. The other thing you see is, as the housing market continues to improve and get healthier and that health is often times in reflected in home values, you'll see the frequency of repaint activity increase. So at the peak of this cycle, people are painting more just like they're remodeling more."

We did have a meeting prior to the announcement of the Valspar acquisition, which is some of the -- and I think that we're going to go see all 3 of the rating agencies during this quarter. And we're optimistic that we keep the investment grade. Investment grade is very important to us because in the first quarter of every year, our cash flow is negative because we're building inventory for the season. So we're in the commercial paper. We want to be in the A1 P1. We don't want to have one of them not being investment grade. We take a look at the metrics. And we feel pretty good about the metrics long-term, and so the investment grade is pretty important to us."

In the interest of time, we've provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations, July 21 press release. 
I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the second quarter 2016 compared to the second quarter 2015, then comment on each reportable segment. 
Consolidated net sales increased 2.8% to a record $3.22 billion, driven by higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores Group. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales 1.5% in the quarter. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $105.8 million in the quarter to $1.64 billion. 
Our consolidated gross margin increased 200 basis points in the quarter to 50.8% of sales from 48.8% in the second quarter last year. More than half of the gross margin improvement in the quarter resulted from the positive mix effect of Paint Stores Group, our highest gross margin segment, outpacing the growth of the other segments, coupled with increased operating leverage from higher production and distribution volume.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $54.7 million over second quarter last year to $1.1 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 32.7% in the second quarter this year from 31.9% last year. A relatively small portion of this increase was acquisition-related expenses.
Interest expense increased $28 million compared to second quarter last year to $40.9 million. This increase includes $20.7 million in acquisition-related interest expense, with the balance resulting from a shift to long-term debt from short term that occurred midyear 2015. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $31.4 million to $539.2 million due primarily to improved operating results from our Paint Stores Group.
Unfavorable currency translation reduced profit before tax in the quarter by $3.3 million compared to second quarter last year. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 32.1%, excluding the impact of the change in accounting standard. For the full year 2016, we expect our effective tax rate will remain in the low 30s excluding the impact of the change in accounting standard. Consolidated net income increased $28.1 million to $378.1 million. Net income, as a percent of sales, was 11.7% compared to 11.2% in the second quarter last year. 
Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 7.8% to $3.99 per share from $3.70 per share in 2015. The $3.99 includes $0.09 accretion from the accounting change and $0.16 dilution from acquisition-related expenses.
Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the second quarter '16 increased 6.2% to $2.11 billion from $1.98 billion last year. Comparable store sales, that is sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, increased 5.2%. All of the Paint Stores Group sales increase was due to higher organic architectural paint and equipment sales volumes across all end markets. Price mix had a negligible impact on sales in the quarter, and Protective & Marine coating sales were a modest drag on revenue growth.
Regionally in the second quarter, our Southeastern division led all divisions, followed by Midwestern division, Southwestern division, Canada and Eastern division. Sales and volumes were positive in every geographic division. 
Segment profit for the group increased $75.6 million or 17.4% to $509 million in the quarter, as higher architectural paint and equipment sales volumes were partially offset by higher SG&A spending. Segment operating margin increased to 24.1% of sales from 21.8% in the second quarter last year. For our Latin America Coatings Group, second quarter net sales, stated in U.S. dollars, decreased 11.2% to $133.3 million due to unfavorable currency translation and negative volumes that were partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 16.4% in the quarter.
Segment profit in U.S. dollars decreased to a loss of $9.6 million in the quarter from a profit of $4 million last year. Segment profit was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation that were partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation decreased Latin America segment profit $1.3 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was negative 7.2% in the quarter compared to a profit of 2.7% in the second quarter 2015.
Turning to the Consumer Group. Second quarter sales decreased 2.6% to $477.5 million. As a reminder, in April, we annualized the completion of the load-in of the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams paint program in Lowe's stores, which was completed by May 1 last year. Segment profit for the Consumer Group decreased $6 million to $108.3 million in the quarter from $114.2 million in the second quarter last year due primarily to lower sales and increased SG&A spending, partially offset by improved operating efficiencies.
Segment profit, as a percent of external sales, decreased to 22.7% from 23.3% in the same period last year. For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars decreased 1.3% to $499.2 million in the quarter as unfavorable currency translation was partially offset by positive price mix. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment 2.6% in the quarter.
Second quarter segment profits stated in U.S. dollars increased $8 million or 13.9% to $65.2 million, due primarily to decreasing raw material cost and good cost control, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, which decreased segment profit $1.5 million in the quarter. As a percent of sales, segment profit increased to 13.1% from 11.3% in the same period last year. 
That concludes my recap of our results for the quarter. So I will now turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for third quarter and full year. John?"
303104,369548581,1009722,"The Sherwin-Williams Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","The Sherwin-Williams Company","Executives","Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I think it's fair to say our results for the second quarter were mixed. Architectural paint volumes through our Paint Stores Group held up well in the quarter, resulting in solid revenu",1193,"Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I think it's fair to say our results for the second quarter were mixed. Architectural paint volumes through our Paint Stores Group held up well in the quarter, resulting in solid revenue growth and continued strong earnings leverage and flow through. Our Global Finishes Group also did a commendable job of managing both gross margins and SG&A, resulting in a respectable 180 basis point operating margin improvement on modest volume growth.
We continue to see positive demand momentum in some of our industrial coatings businesses, primarily in Europe and the U.S. and currency headwinds in Latin America are starting to ease. Those were the positives in the quarter. 
On the other hand, while we expected difficult comparisons in the HGTV HOME paint program due to heavy stocking orders in the second quarter last year, some of the retail programs we thought would generate growth in the quarter fell short. We are supporting many of these programs with incremental SG&A investment, and we have high return expectations on these investments. 
Finally, while currency comparisons have improved in many Latin American countries, demand trends remain difficult and our outlook for this segment for the full year continues to deteriorate. Our earnings per share results in the quarter include expenses related to the Valspar acquisition as well as a tax benefit related to the adoption of a new accounting standard. 
If you back out these items, diluted net income per common share increased 9.7% on sales growth of less than 3%. As a percent of sales, gross profit increased 200 basis points year-over-year and operating profit and profit before tax both expanded a little more than 50 basis points. Excluding the acquisition expense, our incremental margin on consolidated profit before tax was 36%. SG&A was the only line on the P&L that went the wrong way as a percent of sales, the result of higher SG&A spending by Paint Stores Group, channel investment by Consumer Group and expenses related to the Valspar acquisition.
Paint Stores Group delivered another strong sales performance in the residential segments, which include residential repaint contractors, new residential construction and DIY. Combined, sales to these 3 segments grew by more than 10%. Sales to commercial, health care and property management customers also generated solid year-over-year growth. The outlook for continued growth in these segments over the balance of the year remains positive, supported by very healthy order book trends reported by most of our contractor segments extending into 2017.
During the first half of the year, Paint Stores Group opened 45 new stores and closed 14 redundant locations. This completes our consolidation of redundant store locations acquired from Comex. Our plan for the full year still calls for store openings in the range of 90 to 100 net new locations. Today, our total store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbeans stands at 4,117 compared to 4,025 a year ago.
We anticipated a modest sales decline from Consumer Group coming into the second quarter. This, combined with the elevated SG&A investment, tempered our second quarter outlook, which was reflected in our guidance. We remain confident that the great work our Consumer Group teams are doing in strengthening our brand positioning across all retail channels and the investment we are making in many of these channels will pay handsome returns in the years ahead. 
Consumer Group's commercial, industrial and MRO business continued to show good progress on both sales and margin in the quarter. Unfavorable currency translation continues to weigh on sales and profit performance in our Global Finishes Group and Latin America Coatings Group. Both segments reported positive sales in local currency in the quarter and Global Finishes Group volumes were positive, thanks in large part to improving market conditions in North America and Europe.
Volumes sales in most Latin American countries continued to decline with Brazil standing out as the most notable exception. Although Brazil's volume momentum improved in the quarter, margin pressure from raw materials continued to challenge profitability in Brazil and throughout the region. In the first 6 months of 2016, we generated $510 million in net operating cash, an increase of $161 million compared to the first half of 2015, driven by higher 6-month net income and good working capital discipline.
Working capital was a use of cash in the quarter, increasing by about $3.8 million year-over-year. Working capital, as a percent of sales, decreased to 11.6% from 11.8% at the end of the second quarter last year. The capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $62.1 million. Depreciation was $43.8 million and amortization was $6.2 million. In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $170 million to $180 million and amortization of about $30 million. 
Capital spending will run higher than normal in 2016 as we complete some facility renovation projects. During the quarter, we made no open market purchases of our common stock for treasury. On June 30, we had remaining board authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares. As indicated when we announced the Valspar acquisition, we intend to build cash on our balance sheet over the course of the year to reduce total borrowings required to close the deal, which will eliminate our share repurchase activity in 2016. At the close of the second quarter 2016, our cash balance was $402.7 million compared to $75.1 million on June 30, 2015.
Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.84 per share, up 25% from $0.67 last year. The outlook for Paint Stores Group over the next 6 months remains very positive, and we should see steady improvement from Consumer Group and Global Finishes Group. These positives will be offset to some degree by continued weakness in Latin America. As we've commented over the past few quarters, the gross margin tailwind we have enjoyed in recent years from raw material cost deflation will diminish as we go through the back half of 2016. 
Our outlook for third quarter 2016 is for consolidated net sales to increase low- to mid-single-digits percent compared to last year's third quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $4.10 to $4.30 per share compared to last year's record $3.97 per share. 
The full year 2016 earnings per share guidance we provided at the end of the first quarter did not include expenses related to the acquisition of Valspar or the tax benefit from the adoption of the new accounting standard. 
Today, we are revising our guidance for full year consolidated net income per common share to reflect these 2 impacts. For the full year, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2015 by a low single-digit percentage. With annual sales at that level, we are revising our expectation for full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $11.65 to $11.85 per share compared to $11.16 per share earned in 2015.
Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And now we'll be happy to take your questions."

They -- as expected, they've been out with a third quarter announcement. We think that it's likely they may get some traction.

I think that the gross margin, we've had great expansion. We've had basically because of 3 things. I mean, really nice gallon growth, especially in the stores group. And integration that is complete now from the Comex North America and raw materials have been a tailwind. But those things have occurred. I think that in all cases, we're always looking at long term. I like your term, really looking in the long term. And again, this year, we're taking a balanced approach to where we're going. We're investing. There's times when the gross margin lead our ROS improvements. And there's times that SG&A -- and back to that gallon growth that we've had in that stores group is because of innovation. I think that we continue to do a lot of innovation, and innovation has helped us in all the different segments. So when you look at where we are going, this year, our midpoint of our range is $12.60. Last year, it was $11.13, a 13% increase. And during -- if you take a look at a challenging global environment and no share buybacks. Our original guidance had approximately $0.25 for the buybacks in there. So we're generating net operating cash at record levels, and we'll continue to make prudent investments in the business. So you're going to see SG&A. Probably this year isn't going to be in the improvement in the ROS. It has to be in gross margin. And we had the tailwind. We clearly said there was going to the tailwind. We had the innovation, and we had stores group going away. But we're pretty confident that those investments will earn solid returns in the future. And that's how we do this balanced approach for the long term that you asked."

So that's why it was $0.09 in the second quarter. Year-to-date, it was $0.28. And the reason why it was $0.19 in the first quarter is because of the -- in the first quarter, when the vesting occurs of our long-term RSOs so that many people are on that. So that's why it hit in the first quarter. Second quarter was really driven by stock options that were exercised. So that's what it is. It doesn't have a cash differential. That's why we pointed it out. We adapted it this quarter. So we can do it, the accounting this way. I think as time goes on, I think January, everyone has to go on.

And today, so far year-to-date, we're running down about 9% in square footage of starts. So we will see the nonresidential market trend downward in terms of completions over the next couple of years. As a reminder, the nonres market, you're talking about, 1/3 of the new construction piece of the market, which new construction in total is less than 20%. So it will be a headwind in out-year is just not a real significant one."

I think what we discussed maybe a few years ago of normalized volumes around $760 million. I think that's probably close to what we're at today. And it looks like a large portion of the difference between your previous expectation and your new one is higher mid-cycle levels for res repaint and DIY. I know you guys discussed having a larger base of home is that would need repainting. But to the extent that the mid-cycle new res forecast hasn't changed much. Is it that we just expect the cycle to have a much bigger rally in the near term before normalizing the mid-cycle? Or I guess, what's driving the main difference?"

And it's -- I think you answered the question. It's growing because the base is growing. And if you look at the overall U.S. architectural paint market, more than 80% of average annual volume go store repaint. It's applied to structures that already exist. If you look at that $740 million to $760 million normalized range, that dates all the way back to the late 1990s. And we've had 3 building cycles since the late 1990s that have put a lot more square footage in place. Our population has grown significantly since then. So we think it's reasonable to adjust normalized expectation up based on primarily repaint up volume. The other thing you see is, as the housing market continues to improve and get healthier and that health is often times reflected in home values, you'll see the frequency of repaint activity increase. So at the peak of this cycle, people are painting more, just like they're remodeling more."

But I think what we try to show there is, is that the day they're close our leverage is going to go over 6. If we close -- and based on closing in first quarter 2017, our debt to EBITDA will be over 4, approximately 4.25. And so by '19, we'll be at 3. And by 2020 at 1.9, which is under 2. And I think that's the big goal by 2022 to be under 1.9. What we said is, and I'll answer this way because immediately after that Financial Community Presentation, we were asked, does this mean that you're not going to be by any stock through 2020? And I said, no, we're going to buy stock when our debt to EBITDA starts to approach 2.5 to 1. So that will give you a little picture of what we're thinking. And then, on the Moody's front, I think that we read the same thing from Moody's. Every summer, after the second quarter, we've always had a individual meeting with Moody's and Fitch and S&P. We did have a meeting prior to the announcement of the Valspar acquisition, which is some of the -- and I think that we're going to go see all 3 of the rating agencies during this quarter. And we're optimistic that we keep the investment grade. Investment grade is very important to us because in the first quarter of every year, our cash flow is negative because we're building inventory for the season. So we're in the commercial paper. We want to be in the A1 P1. We don't want to have one of them not being investment grade. We take a look at the metrics, and we feel pretty good about the metrics long-term.

In the interest of time, we've provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations, July 21 press release. 
I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the second quarter 2016 compared to the second quarter 2015, then comment on each reportable segment. 
Consolidated net sales increased 2.8% to a record $3.22 billion, driven by higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores Group. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales 1.5% in the quarter. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $105.8 million in the quarter to $1.64 billion. 
Our consolidated gross margin increased 200 basis points in the quarter to 50.8% of sales from 48.8% in the second quarter last year. More than half of the gross margin improvement in the quarter resulted from the positive mix effect of Paint Stores Group, our highest gross margin segment, outpacing the growth of the other segments, coupled with increased operating leverage from higher production and distribution volume.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $54.7 million over second quarter last year to $1.1 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 32.7% in the second quarter this year from 31.9% last year. A relatively small portion of this increase was acquisition-related expenses.
Interest expense increased $28 million compared to second quarter last year to $40.9 million. This increase includes $20.7 million in acquisition-related interest expense, with the balance resulting from a shift to long-term debt from short term that occurred midyear 2015. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $31.4 million to $539.2 million due primarily to improved operating results from our Paint Stores Group.
Unfavorable currency translation reduced profit before tax in the quarter by $3.3 million compared to second quarter last year. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 32.1%, excluding the impact of the change in accounting standard. For the full year 2016, we expect our effective tax rate will remain in the low 30s excluding the impact of the change in accounting standard. Consolidated net income increased $28.1 million to $378.1 million. Net income, as a percent of sales, was 11.7% compared to 11.2% in the second quarter last year. 
Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 7.8% to $3.99 per share from $3.70 per share in 2015. The $3.99 includes $0.09 accretion from the accounting change and $0.16 dilution from acquisition-related expenses.
Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the second quarter '16 increased 6.2% to $2.11 billion from $1.98 billion last year. Comparable store sales, that is sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, increased 5.2%. All of the Paint Stores Group sales increase was due to higher organic architectural paint and equipment sales volumes across all end markets. Price mix had a negligible impact on sales in the quarter, and Protective & Marine coating sales were a modest drag on revenue growth.
Regionally in the second quarter, our Southeastern division led all divisions, followed by Midwestern division, Southwestern division, Canada and Eastern division. Sales and volumes were positive in every geographic division. 
Segment profit for the group increased $75.6 million or 17.4% to $509 million in the quarter, as higher architectural paint and equipment sales volumes were partially offset by higher SG&A spending. Segment operating margin increased to 24.1% of sales from 21.8% in the second quarter last year. For our Latin America Coatings Group, second quarter net sales, stated in U.S. dollars, decreased 11.2% to $133.3 million due to unfavorable currency translation and negative volumes that were partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 16.4% in the quarter.
Segment profit in U.S. dollars decreased to a loss of $9.6 million in the quarter from a profit of $4 million last year. Segment profit was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation that were partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation decreased Latin America segment profit $1.3 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was negative 7.2% in the quarter compared to a profit of 2.7% in the second quarter 2015.
Turning to the Consumer Group. Second quarter sales decreased 2.6% to $477.5 million. As a reminder, in April, we annualized the completion of the load-in of the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams paint program in Lowe's stores, which was completed by May 1 last year. Segment profit for the Consumer Group decreased $6 million to $108.3 million in the quarter from $114.2 million in the second quarter last year due primarily to lower sales and increased SG&A spending, partially offset by improved operating efficiencies.
Segment profit, as a percent of external sales, decreased to 22.7% from 23.3% in the same period last year. For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars decreased 1.3% to $499.2 million in the quarter as unfavorable currency translation was partially offset by positive price mix. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment 2.6% in the quarter.
Second quarter segment profits stated in U.S. dollars increased $8 million or 13.9% to $65.2 million, due primarily to decreasing raw material cost and good cost control, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, which decreased segment profit $1.5 million in the quarter. As a percent of sales, segment profit increased to 13.1% from 11.3% in the same period last year. 
That concludes my recap of our results for the quarter. So I will now turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for third quarter and full year. John?"
303104,369548581,1010181,"The Sherwin-Williams Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","The Sherwin-Williams Company","Executives","Thank you, Bob.

I think it's fair to say our results for the second quarter were mixed. Architectural paint volumes through our Paint Stores Group held up well in the quarter, resulting in solid revenue growth and continued strong earnings leverage and flow through. Our Global Finishes Group also did a commendable job of managing both gross margins and SG&A, resulting in a respectable 180 basis point operating margin improvement on modest volume growth.
We continue to see positive demand momentum in some of our industrial coatings businesses, primarily in Europe and the U.S. and currency headwinds in Latin America are starting to ease. Those were the positives in the quarter. 
On the other hand, while we expected difficult comparisons in the HGTV HOME paint program due to heavy stocking orders in the second quarter last year, some of the retail programs we thought would generate growth in the quarter fell short. We are supporting many of these programs with incremental SG&A investment, and we have high return expectations on these investments. 
Finally, while currency comparisons have improved in many Latin American countries, demand trends remain difficult and our outlook for this segment for the full year continues to deteriorate. Our earnings per share results in the quarter include expenses related to the Valspar acquisition as well as a tax benefit related to the adoption of a new accounting standard. 
If you back out these items, diluted net income per common share increased 9.7% on sales growth of less than 3%. As a percent of sales, gross profit increased 200 basis points year-over-year and operating profit and profit before tax both expanded a little more than 50 basis points. Excluding the acquisition expense, our incremental margin on consolidated profit before tax was 36%. SG&A was the only line on the P&L that went the wrong way as a percent of sales, the result of higher SG&A spending by Paint Stores Group, channel investment by Consumer Group and expenses related to the Valspar acquisition.
Paint Stores Group delivered another strong sales performance in the residential segments, which include residential repaint contractors, new residential construction and DIY. Combined, sales to these 3 segments grew by more than 10%. Sales to commercial, health care and property management customers also generated solid year-over-year growth. The outlook for continued growth in these segments over the balance of the year remains positive, supported by very healthy order book trends reported by most of our contractor segments extending into 2017.
During the first half of the year, Paint Stores Group opened 45 new stores and closed 14 redundant locations. This completes our consolidation of redundant store locations acquired from Comex. Our plan for the full year still calls for store openings in the range of 90 to 100 net new locations. Today, our total store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean stands at 4,117 compared to 4,025 a year ago.
We anticipated a modest sales decline from Consumer Group coming into the second quarter. This, combined with the elevated SG&A investment, tempered our second quarter outlook, which was reflected in our guidance. We remain confident that the great work our Consumer Group teams are doing in strengthening our brand positioning across all retail channels and the investment we are making in many of these channels will pay handsome returns in the years ahead. 
Consumer Group's commercial, industrial and MRO business continued to show good progress on both sales and margin in the quarter. Unfavorable currency translation continues to weigh on sales and profit performance in our Global Finishes Group and Latin America Coatings Group. Both segments reported positive sales in local currency in the quarter and Global Finishes Group volumes were positive, thanks in large part to improving market conditions in North America and Europe.
Volumes sales in most Latin American countries continued to decline with Brazil standing out as the most notable exception. Although Brazil's volume momentum improved in the quarter, margin pressure from raw materials continued to challenge profitability in Brazil and throughout the region. In the first 6 months of 2016, we generated $510 million in net operating cash, an increase of $161 million compared to the first half of 2015, driven by higher 6-month net income and good working capital discipline.
Working capital was a use of cash in the quarter, increasing by about $3.8 million year-over-year. Working capital, as a percent of sales, decreased to 11.6% from 11.8% at the end of the second quarter last year. The capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $62.1 million. Depreciation was $43.8 million and amortization was $6.2 million. In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $170 million to $180 million and amortization of about $30 million. 
Capital spending will run higher than normal in 2016 as we complete some facility renovation projects. During the quarter, we made no open market purchases of our common stock for treasury. On June 30, we had remaining board authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares. As indicated when we announced the Valspar acquisition, we intend to build cash on our balance sheet over the course of the year to reduce total borrowings required to close the deal, which will eliminate our share repurchase activity in 2016. At the close of the second quarter 2016, our cash balance was $402.7 million compared to $75.1 million on June 30, 2015.
Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.84 per share, up 25% from $0.67 last year. The outlook for Paint Stores Group over the next 6 months remains very positive, and we should see steady improvement from Consumer Group and Global Finishes Group. These positives will be offset to some degree by continued weakness in Latin America. As we've commented over the past few quarters, the gross margin tailwind we have enjoyed in recent years from raw material cost deflation will diminish as we go through the back half of 2016. 
Our outlook for third quarter 2016 is for consolidated net sales to increase low- to mid-single-digits percent compared to last year's third quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $4.10 to $4.30 per share compared to last year's record $3.97 per share. 
The full year 2016 earnings per share guidance we provided at the end of the first quarter did not include expenses related to the acquisition of Valspar or the tax benefit from the adoption of the new accounting standard. 
Today, we are revising our guidance for full year consolidated net income per common share to reflect these 2 impacts. For the full year, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2015 by a low single-digit percentage. With annual sales at that level, we are revising our expectation for full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $11.65 to $11.85 per share compared to $11.16 per share earned in 2015.
Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And now we'll be happy to take your questions."

The implementation at this point, as near as we can tell from an industry standpoint, is probably in the mid-single-digit cents per pound. So not a significant increase in percentage terms. They -- as expected, they've been out with a third quarter announcement. We think that it's likely they may get some traction. But how much they get really depends on customer size, on location geographically. So we're likely to see some year-over-year inflation in TiO2 as far as the rest of the basket. The feedstocks for the latex and acrylic monomer market is -- have been very stable. Propylene -- chemical grade propylene has been steady at around $0.31 a pound.

So once we get build rates back there and once the maintenance cycles are -- have returned to kind of normalized repaint activity, we think we're going to see normalized volume in the 780 million to 810 million gallons.

There's times when the gross margin lead our ROS improvements. And there's times that SG&A -- and back to that gallon growth that we've had in that stores group is because of innovation. I think that we continue to do a lot of innovation, and innovation has helped us in all the different segments. So when you look at where we are going, this year, our midpoint of our range is $12.60. Last year, it was $11.13, a 13% increase. And during -- if you take a look at a challenging global environment and no share buybacks. Our original guidance had approximately $0.25 worth of buybacks in there. So we're generating net operating cash at record levels, and we'll continue to make prudent investments in the business. So you're going to see SG&A probably this year isn't going to be in the improvement in the ROS. It has to be in gross margin. And we had the tailwind. We clearly said there was going to the tailwind. We had the innovation, and we had stores group going away. But we're pretty confident that those investments will earn solid returns in the future.

And what that is, is when we've expensed -- when starting the new rules many, many years ago expensing stock option, RSO grants and so forth, you charge the P&L for the Black-Scholes amount. So whatever the Black-Scholes value as on the day of issuance, basically, you straight line it as if it was a 3-year or a 5-year option vesting period. When the -- then what would occur is if the stock, the differential between when the day of vesting a differential in -- differential between Black-Scholes value and the actual value, was actually a -- that difference would -- used to go to retained earnings. We always took it on our tax return, and that was one of the differentials between book and cash taxes. So this change -- this accounting change for us has nothing to do with, and it won't change our cash performance. But instead of having that differential that for us, as you've said in the second quarter $8 million, go to retained earnings, it now goes directly through the P&L. So that's why it was $0.09 in the second quarter. Year-to-date, it was $0.28. And the reason why it was $0.19 in the first quarter is because of the -- in the first quarter, it's when the vesting occurs of our long-term RSOs so that many people are on that. So that's why it hit in the first quarter. Second quarter was really driven by stock options that were exercised. So that's what it is. It doesn't have a cash differential. That's why we pointed it out. We adapted it this quarter. So we can do it, the accounting this way. I think as time goes on, I think January, everyone has to go on it. So I think -- but we took the opportunity to do it now just to get this noise out of our P&L next year."

And it's -- I think you answered the question. It's growing because the base is growing.

And we've had 3 building cycles since the late 1990s that have put a lot more square footage in place. Our population has grown significantly since then. So we think it's reasonable to adjust normalized expectation up based on primarily repaint up volume. The other thing you see is, as the housing market continues to improve and get healthier and that health is oftentimes reflected in home values, you'll see the frequency of repaint activity increase.

If we close -- and based on closing in first quarter 2017, our debt to EBITDA will be over 4, approximately 4.25. And so by '19, we'll be at 3. And by 2020 at 1.9, which is under 2. And I think that's the big goal by 2022 to be under 1.9. What we said is, and I'll answer this way because immediately after that Financial Community Presentation, we were asked, does this mean that you're not going to be by any stock through 2020? And I said, no, we're going to buy stock when our debt to EBITDA starts to approach 2.5 to 1. So that will give you a little picture of what we're thinking. And then, on the Moody's front, I think that we read the same thing from Moody's. Every summer, after the second quarter, we've always had an individual meeting with Moody's and Fitch and S&P. We did have a meeting prior to the announcement of the Valspar acquisition, which is some of the -- and I think that we're going to go see all 3 of the rating agencies during this quarter. And we're optimistic that we keep the investment grade. Investment grade is very important to us because in the first quarter of every year, our cash flow is negative because we're building inventory for the season. So we're in the commercial paper. We want to be in the A1 P1. We don't want to have one of them not being investment grade. We take a look at the metrics, and we feel pretty good about the metrics long-term. And so the investment grade is pretty important to us."

In the interest of time, we've provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations, July 21 press release. 
I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the second quarter 2016 compared to the second quarter 2015, then comment on each reportable segment. 
Consolidated net sales increased 2.8% to a record $3.22 billion, driven by higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores Group. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales 1.5% in the quarter. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $105.8 million in the quarter to $1.64 billion. 
Our consolidated gross margin increased 200 basis points in the quarter to 50.8% of sales from 48.8% in the second quarter last year. More than half of the gross margin improvement in the quarter resulted from the positive mix effect of Paint Stores Group, our highest gross margin segment, outpacing the growth of the other segments, coupled with increased operating leverage from higher production and distribution volume.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $54.7 million over second quarter last year to $1.1 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 32.7% in the second quarter this year from 31.9% last year. A relatively small portion of this increase was acquisition-related expenses.
Interest expense increased $28 million compared to second quarter last year to $40.9 million. This increase includes $20.7 million in acquisition-related interest expense, with the balance resulting from a shift to long-term debt from short term that occurred midyear 2015. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $31.4 million to $539.2 million due primarily to improved operating results from our Paint Stores Group.
Unfavorable currency translation reduced profit before tax in the quarter by $3.3 million compared to second quarter last year. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 32.1%, excluding the impact of the change in accounting standard. For the full year 2016, we expect our effective tax rate will remain in the low 30s excluding the impact of the change in accounting standard. Consolidated net income increased $28.1 million to $378.1 million. Net income, as a percent of sales, was 11.7% compared to 11.2% in the second quarter last year. 
Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 7.8% to $3.99 per share from $3.70 per share in 2015. The $3.99 includes $0.09 accretion from the accounting change and $0.16 dilution from acquisition-related expenses.
Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the second quarter '16 increased 6.2% to $2.11 billion from $1.98 billion last year. Comparable store sales, that is sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, increased 5.2%. All of the Paint Stores Group sales increase was due to higher organic architectural paint and equipment sales volumes across all end markets. Price mix had a negligible impact on sales in the quarter, and Protective & Marine coating sales were a modest drag on revenue growth.
Regionally in the second quarter, our Southeastern division led all divisions, followed by Midwestern division, Southwestern division, Canada and Eastern division. Sales and volumes were positive in every geographic division. 
Segment profit for the group increased $75.6 million or 17.4% to $509 million in the quarter, as higher architectural paint and equipment sales volumes were partially offset by higher SG&A spending. Segment operating margin increased to 24.1% of sales from 21.8% in the second quarter last year. For our Latin America Coatings Group, second quarter net sales, stated in U.S. dollars, decreased 11.2% to $133.3 million due to unfavorable currency translation and negative volumes that were partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 16.4% in the quarter.
Segment profit in U.S. dollars decreased to a loss of $9.6 million in the quarter from a profit of $4 million last year. Segment profit was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation that were partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation decreased Latin America segment profit $1.3 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was negative 7.2% in the quarter compared to a profit of 2.7% in the second quarter 2015.
Turning to the Consumer Group. Second quarter sales decreased 2.6% to $477.5 million. As a reminder, in April, we annualized the completion of the load-in of the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams paint program in Lowe's stores, which was completed by May 1 last year. Segment profit for the Consumer Group decreased $6 million to $108.3 million in the quarter from $114.2 million in the second quarter last year due primarily to lower sales and increased SG&A spending, partially offset by improved operating efficiencies.
Segment profit, as a percent of external sales, decreased to 22.7% from 23.3% in the same period last year. For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars decreased 1.3% to $499.2 million in the quarter as unfavorable currency translation was partially offset by positive price mix. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment 2.6% in the quarter.
Second quarter segment profits stated in U.S. dollars increased $8 million or 13.9% to $65.2 million, due primarily to decreasing raw material cost and good cost control, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, which decreased segment profit $1.5 million in the quarter. As a percent of sales, segment profit increased to 13.1% from 11.3% in the same period last year. 
That concludes my recap of our results for the quarter. So I will now turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for third quarter and full year. John?"
303104,369548581,1010210,"The Sherwin-Williams Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","The Sherwin-Williams Company","Executives","Thank you, Bob.

I think it's fair to say our results for the second quarter were mixed. Architectural paint volumes through our Paint Stores Group held up well in the quarter, resulting in solid revenue growth and continued strong earnings leverage and flow through. Our Global Finishes Group also did a commendable job of managing both gross margins and SG&A, resulting in a respectable 180 basis point operating margin improvement on modest volume growth.
We continue to see positive demand momentum in some of our industrial coatings businesses, primarily in Europe and the U.S. and currency headwinds in Latin America are starting to ease. Those were the positives in the quarter. 
On the other hand, while we expected difficult comparisons in the HGTV HOME paint program due to heavy stocking orders in the second quarter last year, some of the retail programs we thought would generate growth in the quarter fell short. We are supporting many of these programs with incremental SG&A investment, and we have high return expectations on these investments. 
Finally, while currency comparisons have improved in many Latin American countries, demand trends remain difficult and our outlook for this segment for the full year continues to deteriorate. Our earnings per share results in the quarter include expenses related to the Valspar acquisition as well as a tax benefit related to the adoption of a new accounting standard. 
If you back out these items, diluted net income per common share increased 9.7% on sales growth of less than 3%. As a percent of sales, gross profit increased 200 basis points year-over-year and operating profit and profit before tax both expanded a little more than 50 basis points. Excluding the acquisition expense, our incremental margin on consolidated profit before tax was 36%. SG&A was the only line on the P&L that went the wrong way as a percent of sales, the result of higher SG&A spending by Paint Stores Group, channel investment by Consumer Group and expenses related to the Valspar acquisition.
Paint Stores Group delivered another strong sales performance in the residential segments, which include residential repaint contractors, new residential construction and DIY. Combined, sales to these 3 segments grew by more than 10%. Sales to commercial, health care and property management customers also generated solid year-over-year growth. The outlook for continued growth in these segments over the balance of the year remains positive, supported by very healthy order book trends reported by most of our contractor segments extending into 2017.
During the first half of the year, Paint Stores Group opened 45 new stores and closed 14 redundant locations. This completes our consolidation of redundant store locations acquired from Comex. Our plan for the full year still calls for store openings in the range of 90 to 100 net new locations. Today, our total store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean stands at 4,117 compared to 4,025 a year ago.
We anticipated a modest sales decline from Consumer Group coming into the second quarter. This, combined with the elevated SG&A investment, tempered our second quarter outlook, which was reflected in our guidance. We remain confident that the great work our Consumer Group teams are doing in strengthening our brand positioning across all retail channels and the investment we are making in many of these channels will pay handsome returns in the years ahead. 
Consumer Group's commercial, industrial and MRO business continued to show good progress on both sales and margin in the quarter. Unfavorable currency translation continues to weigh on sales and profit performance in our Global Finishes Group and Latin America Coatings Group. Both segments reported positive sales in local currency in the quarter and Global Finishes Group volumes were positive, thanks in large part to improving market conditions in North America and Europe.
Volumes sales in most Latin American countries continued to decline with Brazil standing out as the most notable exception. Although Brazil's volume momentum improved in the quarter, margin pressure from raw materials continued to challenge profitability in Brazil and throughout the region. In the first 6 months of 2016, we generated $510 million in net operating cash, an increase of $161 million compared to the first half of 2015, driven by higher 6-month net income and good working capital discipline.
Working capital was a use of cash in the quarter, increasing by about $3.8 million year-over-year. Working capital, as a percent of sales, decreased to 11.6% from 11.8% at the end of the second quarter last year. The capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $62.1 million. Depreciation was $43.8 million and amortization was $6.2 million. In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $170 million to $180 million and amortization of about $30 million. 
Capital spending will run higher than normal in 2016 as we complete some facility renovation projects. During the quarter, we made no open market purchases of our common stock for treasury. On June 30, we had remaining board authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares. As indicated when we announced the Valspar acquisition, we intend to build cash on our balance sheet over the course of the year to reduce total borrowings required to close the deal, which will eliminate our share repurchase activity in 2016. At the close of the second quarter 2016, our cash balance was $402.7 million compared to $75.1 million on June 30, 2015.
Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.84 per share, up 25% from $0.67 last year. The outlook for Paint Stores Group over the next 6 months remains very positive, and we should see steady improvement from Consumer Group and Global Finishes Group. These positives will be offset to some degree by continued weakness in Latin America. As we've commented over the past few quarters, the gross margin tailwind we have enjoyed in recent years from raw material cost deflation will diminish as we go through the back half of 2016. 
Our outlook for third quarter 2016 is for consolidated net sales to increase low- to mid-single-digits percent compared to last year's third quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $4.10 to $4.30 per share compared to last year's record $3.97 per share. 
The full year 2016 earnings per share guidance we provided at the end of the first quarter did not include expenses related to the acquisition of Valspar or the tax benefit from the adoption of the new accounting standard. 
Today, we are revising our guidance for full year consolidated net income per common share to reflect these 2 impacts. For the full year, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2015 by a low single-digit percentage. With annual sales at that level, we are revising our expectation for full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $11.65 to $11.85 per share compared to $11.16 per share earned in 2015.
Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And now we'll be happy to take your questions."

They -- as expected, they've been out with a third quarter announcement. We think that it's likely they may get some traction. But how much they get really depends on customer size, on location geographically. So we're likely to see some year-over-year inflation in TiO2 as far as the rest of the basket. The feedstocks for the latex and acrylic monomer market is -- have been very stable. Propylene -- chemical grade propylene has been steady at around $0.31 a pound.

I think that we continue to do a lot of innovation, and innovation has helped us in all the different segments. So when you look at where we are going, this year, our midpoint of our range is $12.60. Last year, it was $11.13, a 13% increase. And during -- if you take a look at a challenging global environment and no share buybacks. Our original guidance had approximately $0.25 worth of buybacks in there. So we're generating net operating cash at record levels, and we'll continue to make prudent investments in the business. So you're going to see SG&A probably this year isn't going to be in the improvement in the ROS. It has to be in gross margin. And we had the tailwind. We clearly said there was going to the tailwind. We had the innovation, and we had stores group going away. But we're pretty confident that those investments will earn solid returns in the future.

But we've held on to a couple of the assets they have, and when we look at the Valspar, we think that they have some great assets to give us for capacity. We think that gives us another leg in the stool that give us the ability to have that capacity utilization go down in the short term. But that gives us the ability to grow without great deal of CapEx."

But instead of having that differential that for us, as you've said in the second quarter $8 million, go to retained earnings, it now goes directly through the P&L. So that's why it was $0.09 in the second quarter. Year-to-date, it was $0.28. And the reason why it was $0.19 in the first quarter is because of the -- in the first quarter, it's when the vesting occurs of our long-term RSOs so that many people are on that. So that's why it hit in the first quarter. Second quarter was really driven by stock options that were exercised. So that's what it is. It doesn't have a cash differential. That's why we pointed it out. We adapted it this quarter. So we can do it, the accounting this way. I think as time goes on, I think January, everyone has to go on it.

But the big hit will be Valspar's adviser and legal fees, which will occur at the close. So when we look at that $0.72 that we show in the fourth quarter to finalize to $1.32 [ph], the majority of that is going to be a cash hit.

And it looks like a large portion of the difference between your previous expectation and your new one is higher mid-cycle levels for res repaint and DIY. I know you guys discussed having a larger base of homes that would need repainting. But to the extent that the mid-cycle new res forecast hasn't changed much. Is it that we just expect the cycle to have a much bigger rally in the near term before normalizing the mid-cycle? Or I guess, what's driving the main difference?"

And it's -- I think you answered the question. It's growing because the base is growing. And if you look at the overall U.S. architectural paint market, more than 80% of average annual volume go store repaint. It's applied to structures that already exist. If you look at that 740 million to 760 million normalized range, that dates all the way back to the late 1990s. And we've had 3 building cycles since the late 1990s that have put a lot more square footage in place. Our population has grown significantly since then. So we think it's reasonable to adjust normalized expectation up based on primarily repaint up volume. The other thing you see is, as the housing market continues to improve and get healthier and that health is oftentimes reflected in home values, you'll see the frequency of repaint activity increase. So at the peak of this cycle, people are painting more, just like they're remodeling more."

So we have a schedule, and that actually show you what we think our debt to EBITDA would be all the way out to, I believe, 2020. So I'd ask you to do that. But I think what we try to show there is, is that the day of close our leverage is going to go over 6. If we close -- and based on closing in first quarter 2017, our debt to EBITDA will be over 4, approximately 4.25. And so by '19, we'll be at 3. And by 2020 at 1.9, which is under 2. And I think that's the big goal by 2022 to be under 1.9. What we said is, and I'll answer this way because immediately after that Financial Community Presentation, we were asked, does this mean that you're not going to be by any stock through 2020? And I said, no, we're going to buy stock when our debt to EBITDA starts to approach 2.5 to 1. So that will give you a little picture of what we're thinking. And then, on the Moody's front, I think that we read the same thing from Moody's. Every summer, after the second quarter, we've always had an individual meeting with Moody's and Fitch and S&P. We did have a meeting prior to the announcement of the Valspar acquisition, which is some of the -- and I think that we're going to go see all 3 of the rating agencies during this quarter. And we're optimistic that we keep the investment grade. Investment grade is very important to us because in the first quarter of every year, our cash flow is negative because we're building inventory for the season. So we're in the commercial paper. We want to be in the A1 P1. We don't want to have one of them not being investment grade. We take a look at the metrics, and we feel pretty good about the metrics long-term. And so the investment grade is pretty important to us."

In the interest of time, we've provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations, July 21 press release. 
I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the second quarter 2016 compared to the second quarter 2015, then comment on each reportable segment. 
Consolidated net sales increased 2.8% to a record $3.22 billion, driven by higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores Group. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales 1.5% in the quarter. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $105.8 million in the quarter to $1.64 billion. 
Our consolidated gross margin increased 200 basis points in the quarter to 50.8% of sales from 48.8% in the second quarter last year. More than half of the gross margin improvement in the quarter resulted from the positive mix effect of Paint Stores Group, our highest gross margin segment, outpacing the growth of the other segments, coupled with increased operating leverage from higher production and distribution volume.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $54.7 million over second quarter last year to $1.1 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 32.7% in the second quarter this year from 31.9% last year. A relatively small portion of this increase was acquisition-related expenses.
Interest expense increased $28 million compared to second quarter last year to $40.9 million. This increase includes $20.7 million in acquisition-related interest expense, with the balance resulting from a shift to long-term debt from short term that occurred midyear 2015. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $31.4 million to $539.2 million due primarily to improved operating results from our Paint Stores Group.
Unfavorable currency translation reduced profit before tax in the quarter by $3.3 million compared to second quarter last year. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 32.1%, excluding the impact of the change in accounting standard. For the full year 2016, we expect our effective tax rate will remain in the low 30s excluding the impact of the change in accounting standard. Consolidated net income increased $28.1 million to $378.1 million. Net income, as a percent of sales, was 11.7% compared to 11.2% in the second quarter last year. 
Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 7.8% to $3.99 per share from $3.70 per share in 2015. The $3.99 includes $0.09 accretion from the accounting change and $0.16 dilution from acquisition-related expenses.
Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the second quarter '16 increased 6.2% to $2.11 billion from $1.98 billion last year. Comparable store sales, that is sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, increased 5.2%. All of the Paint Stores Group sales increase was due to higher organic architectural paint and equipment sales volumes across all end markets. Price mix had a negligible impact on sales in the quarter, and Protective & Marine coating sales were a modest drag on revenue growth.
Regionally in the second quarter, our Southeastern division led all divisions, followed by Midwestern division, Southwestern division, Canada and Eastern division. Sales and volumes were positive in every geographic division. 
Segment profit for the group increased $75.6 million or 17.4% to $509 million in the quarter, as higher architectural paint and equipment sales volumes were partially offset by higher SG&A spending. Segment operating margin increased to 24.1% of sales from 21.8% in the second quarter last year. For our Latin America Coatings Group, second quarter net sales, stated in U.S. dollars, decreased 11.2% to $133.3 million due to unfavorable currency translation and negative volumes that were partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 16.4% in the quarter.
Segment profit in U.S. dollars decreased to a loss of $9.6 million in the quarter from a profit of $4 million last year. Segment profit was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation that were partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation decreased Latin America segment profit $1.3 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was negative 7.2% in the quarter compared to a profit of 2.7% in the second quarter 2015.
Turning to the Consumer Group. Second quarter sales decreased 2.6% to $477.5 million. As a reminder, in April, we annualized the completion of the load-in of the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams paint program in Lowe's stores, which was completed by May 1 last year. Segment profit for the Consumer Group decreased $6 million to $108.3 million in the quarter from $114.2 million in the second quarter last year due primarily to lower sales and increased SG&A spending, partially offset by improved operating efficiencies.
Segment profit, as a percent of external sales, decreased to 22.7% from 23.3% in the same period last year. For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars decreased 1.3% to $499.2 million in the quarter as unfavorable currency translation was partially offset by positive price mix. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment 2.6% in the quarter.
Second quarter segment profits stated in U.S. dollars increased $8 million or 13.9% to $65.2 million, due primarily to decreasing raw material cost and good cost control, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, which decreased segment profit $1.5 million in the quarter. As a percent of sales, segment profit increased to 13.1% from 11.3% in the same period last year. 
That concludes my recap of our results for the quarter. So I will now turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for third quarter and full year. John?"
303104,369548581,1010392,"The Sherwin-Williams Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2016",2016-07-21,"Earnings Calls","The Sherwin-Williams Company","Executives","Thank you, Bob.

I think it's fair to say our results for the second quarter were mixed. Architectural paint volumes through our Paint Stores Group held up well in the quarter, resulting in solid revenue growth and continued strong earnings leverage and flow through. Our Global Finishes Group also did a commendable job of managing both gross margins and SG&A, resulting in a respectable 180 basis point operating margin improvement on modest volume growth.
We continue to see positive demand momentum in some of our industrial coatings businesses, primarily in Europe and the U.S. and currency headwinds in Latin America are starting to ease. Those were the positives in the quarter. 
On the other hand, while we expected difficult comparisons in the HGTV HOME paint program due to heavy stocking orders in the second quarter last year, some of the retail programs we thought would generate growth in the quarter fell short. We are supporting many of these programs with incremental SG&A investment, and we have high return expectations on these investments. 
Finally, while currency comparisons have improved in many Latin American countries, demand trends remain difficult and our outlook for this segment for the full year continues to deteriorate. Our earnings per share results in the quarter include expenses related to the Valspar acquisition as well as a tax benefit related to the adoption of a new accounting standard. 
If you back out these items, diluted net income per common share increased 9.7% on sales growth of less than 3%. As a percent of sales, gross profit increased 200 basis points year-over-year and operating profit and profit before tax both expanded a little more than 50 basis points. Excluding the acquisition expense, our incremental margin on consolidated profit before tax was 36%. SG&A was the only line on the P&L that went the wrong way as a percent of sales, the result of higher SG&A spending by Paint Stores Group, channel investment by Consumer Group and expenses related to the Valspar acquisition.
Paint Stores Group delivered another strong sales performance in the residential segments, which include residential repaint contractors, new residential construction and DIY. Combined, sales to these 3 segments grew by more than 10%. Sales to commercial, health care and property management customers also generated solid year-over-year growth. The outlook for continued growth in these segments over the balance of the year remains positive, supported by very healthy order book trends reported by most of our contractor segments extending into 2017.
During the first half of the year, Paint Stores Group opened 45 new stores and closed 14 redundant locations. This completes our consolidation of redundant store locations acquired from Comex. Our plan for the full year still calls for store openings in the range of 90 to 100 net new locations. Today, our total store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean stands at 4,117 compared to 4,025 a year ago.
We anticipated a modest sales decline from Consumer Group coming into the second quarter. This, combined with the elevated SG&A investment, tempered our second quarter outlook, which was reflected in our guidance. We remain confident that the great work our Consumer Group teams are doing in strengthening our brand positioning across all retail channels and the investment we are making in many of these channels will pay handsome returns in the years ahead. 
Consumer Group's commercial, industrial and MRO business continued to show good progress on both sales and margin in the quarter. Unfavorable currency translation continues to weigh on sales and profit performance in our Global Finishes Group and Latin America Coatings Group. Both segments reported positive sales in local currency in the quarter and Global Finishes Group volumes were positive, thanks in large part to improving market conditions in North America and Europe.
Volumes sales in most Latin American countries continued to decline with Brazil standing out as the most notable exception. Although Brazil's volume momentum improved in the quarter, margin pressure from raw materials continued to challenge profitability in Brazil and throughout the region. In the first 6 months of 2016, we generated $510 million in net operating cash, an increase of $161 million compared to the first half of 2015, driven by higher 6-month net income and good working capital discipline.
Working capital was a use of cash in the quarter, increasing by about $3.8 million year-over-year. Working capital, as a percent of sales, decreased to 11.6% from 11.8% at the end of the second quarter last year. The capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $62.1 million. Depreciation was $43.8 million and amortization was $6.2 million. In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $170 million to $180 million and amortization of about $30 million. 
Capital spending will run higher than normal in 2016 as we complete some facility renovation projects. During the quarter, we made no open market purchases of our common stock for treasury. On June 30, we had remaining board authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares. As indicated when we announced the Valspar acquisition, we intend to build cash on our balance sheet over the course of the year to reduce total borrowings required to close the deal, which will eliminate our share repurchase activity in 2016. At the close of the second quarter 2016, our cash balance was $402.7 million compared to $75.1 million on June 30, 2015.
Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.84 per share, up 25% from $0.67 last year. The outlook for Paint Stores Group over the next 6 months remains very positive, and we should see steady improvement from Consumer Group and Global Finishes Group. These positives will be offset to some degree by continued weakness in Latin America. As we've commented over the past few quarters, the gross margin tailwind we have enjoyed in recent years from raw material cost deflation will diminish as we go through the back half of 2016. 
Our outlook for third quarter 2016 is for consolidated net sales to increase low- to mid-single-digits percent compared to last year's third quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $4.10 to $4.30 per share compared to last year's record $3.97 per share. 
The full year 2016 earnings per share guidance we provided at the end of the first quarter did not include expenses related to the acquisition of Valspar or the tax benefit from the adoption of the new accounting standard. 
Today, we are revising our guidance for full year consolidated net income per common share to reflect these 2 impacts. For the full year, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2015 by a low single-digit percentage. With annual sales at that level, we are revising our expectation for full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $11.65 to $11.85 per share compared to $11.16 per share earned in 2015.
Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And now we'll be happy to take your questions."

The implementation at this point, as near as we can tell from an industry standpoint, is probably in the mid-single-digit cents per pound. So not a significant increase in percentage terms. They -- as expected, they've been out with a third quarter announcement. We think that it's likely they may get some traction. But how much they get really depends on customer size, on location geographically. So we're likely to see some year-over-year inflation in TiO2 as far as the rest of the basket. The feedstocks for the latex and acrylic monomer market is -- have been very stable. Propylene -- chemical grade propylene has been steady at around $0.31 a pound.

So once we get build rates back there and once the maintenance cycles are -- have returned to kind of normalized repaint activity, we think we're going to see normalized volume in the 780 million to 810 million gallons.

I think that we continue to do a lot of innovation, and innovation has helped us in all the different segments. So when you look at where we are going, this year, our midpoint of our range is $12.60. Last year, it was $11.13, a 13% increase. And during -- if you take a look at a challenging global environment and no share buybacks. Our original guidance had approximately $0.25 worth of buybacks in there. So we're generating net operating cash at record levels, and we'll continue to make prudent investments in the business. So you're going to see SG&A probably this year isn't going to be in the improvement in the ROS. It has to be in gross margin. And we had the tailwind. We clearly said there was going to the tailwind.

So that's why it was $0.09 in the second quarter. Year-to-date, it was $0.28.

So that's why it hit in the first quarter. Second quarter was really driven by stock options that were exercised. So that's what it is. It doesn't have a cash differential.

And it's -- I think you answered the question. It's growing because the base is growing.

If you look at that 740 million to 760 million normalized range, that dates all the way back to the late 1990s. And we've had 3 building cycles since the late 1990s that have put a lot more square footage in place. Our population has grown significantly since then. So we think it's reasonable to adjust normalized expectation up based on primarily repaint up volume. The other thing you see is, as the housing market continues to improve and get healthier and that health is oftentimes reflected in home values, you'll see the frequency of repaint activity increase.

We did have a meeting prior to the announcement of the Valspar acquisition, which is some of the -- and I think that we're going to go see all 3 of the rating agencies during this quarter. And we're optimistic that we keep the investment grade. Investment grade is very important to us because in the first quarter of every year, our cash flow is negative because we're building inventory for the season. So we're in the commercial paper. We want to be in the A1 P1. We don't want to have one of them not being investment grade. We take a look at the metrics, and we feel pretty good about the metrics long-term.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us.

I",963,"Thanks, Jesse. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. In the interest of time, we have provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations October 25 press release. I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the third quarter 2016 compared to third quarter 2015 then comment on each reportable segment.
Consolidated net sales increased $127.2 million or 4% to $3.28 billion, driven by higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores Group and the impact of a change in revenue classification related to third-party service revenue and related costs. The change in revenue classification increased sales 2.3% in the quarter. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales by 0.8% in the quarter.
Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $61.7 million or 3.9% in the quarter to $1.64 billion compared to $1.57 billion last year. Consolidated gross margin was 49.9% of sales, flat compared to the third quarter last year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $64.5 million or 6.5% to $1.06 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 32.3% in the third quarter this year, up 80 basis points from last year. A portion of this increase was acquisition-related expenses.
Interest expense increased $27.1 million compared to third quarter last year to $44.1 million. The vast majority of this increase was acquisition-related interest expense. 
Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter decreased $15.1 million or down 2.7% to $535.6 million, due primarily to acquisition-related expenses. Unfavorable currency translation reduced profit before tax in the quarter by $4.6 million compared to third quarter last year.
Consolidated net income increased $12.2 million or 3.3% to $386.7 million. Net [indiscernible] 11.8% compared to 11.9% in the third quarter last year. 
Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 27.8%. A comparable effective tax rate to 2015 would be 30.5%. For full year 2016, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the low 30s, excluding the impact of the accounting change. 
Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 2.8% to $4.08 per share from $3.97 per share in 2015. The $4.08 includes $0.09 accretion from the change in accounting standard and $0.24 dilution from acquisition-related expenses. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased earnings per share by $0.03 in the quarter.
Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the third quarter 2016 increased $140.6 million or 6.7% to $2.23 billion from $2.09 billion last year. Comparable store sales, that is, [ph] sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months excluding the change in revenue classification, increased 2.1%. Paint Stores Group's sales increase was due to higher architectural paint sales volume across most end market segments and the impact of the change in revenue classification. Price mix had a negligible impact on sales in the quarter, and protective and marine coatings sales were a significant drag on revenue growth.
Regionally, in the third quarter, our Canadian division led all divisions, followed by Southeastern division, Southwestern division, Midwest and Eastern division. Sales and volumes were positive in every division. 
Segment profit for the group increased $10.9 million or 2.1% to $518.3 million in the quarter as higher architectural paint and equipment sales volumes were partially offset by higher SG&A spending. Segment operating margin decreased 100 basis points to 23.3% of sales from 24.3% in the third quarter last year.
For our Latin America Coatings Group, third quarter net sales stated in U.S. dollars was $156.6 million, up $618,000, due primarily to higher year-over-year selling prices that were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and volume declines.
Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by $12.8 million or 8.2% in the quarter. Segment profit in the third quarter, stated in U.S. dollars, decreased $1.2 million or 54.6% to $1 million from $2.1 million in the same period last year. The negative impact from higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation was only partially offset by increased selling prices. Currency translation decreased segment profit $3.6 million in the quarter compared to the same period last year. As a percent of net sales, segment profit decreased to 60 basis points in the quarter compared to 1.4% in the third quarter 2015.
For our Consumer Group, sales decreased $8.7 million or 2.1% to $412.9 million from $421.6 million last year, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency translation and declining sales to certain retail accounts, commercial customers and in our European business. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment by $5 million or 1.2%. Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased $3.8 million or 4.3% to $92 million from $88.3 million last year, due to improved operating efficiencies and good SG&A expense control. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 22.3% from 20.9% in the same period last year. 
For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars decreased $5.4 million or 1.1% to $480.7 million in the quarter as unfavorable currency translation was partially offset by positive price mix. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for this segment by $7.1 million or 1.5% in the quarter. Segment profit in U.S. dollars increased $8 million or 14.6% in the quarter to $63.2 million from $55.1 million last year, due primarily to good SG&A expense control. Unfavorable currency translation decreased segment profit $500,000 [ph] in the quarter. As a percent to net external sales, Global Finishes Group segment profit increased to 13.1% from 11.3% in the quarter compared to last year. 
That concludes my recap of our results for the quarter. So I will turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for fourth quarter and full year. John?"
303104,402642851,1060272,"The Sherwin-Williams Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","The Sherwin-Williams Company","Executives","Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our results for the third quarter include a number of unusual items that affect our revenues, expenses and tax rate. If you back out the impact of these items, our results on a comparable year",1732,"Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our results for the third quarter include a number of unusual items that affect our revenues, expenses and tax rate. If you back out the impact of these items, our results on a comparable year-over-year basis showed modest improvement.
Consolidated sales increased 1.7% to $3.2 billion. Consolidated gross margin was 50.9%, an increase of 100 basis points compared to the third quarter last year. Operating profit improved 1.9% to $591.8 million. Profit before tax grew 3.9% to $572.4 million, a 30 basis point increase as a percent of sales. Net income increased 6.2% to $397.9 million, and earnings per share increased 6.5% to $4.23 per share.
These results are consistent with the GAAP guidance ranges we provided for both revenue and earnings, but they fell short of what we envisioned at the start of the quarter. Revenue growth at the lower end of our low to mid-single-digit range was disappointing. And the ongoing investments we are making in new stores, sales territories, retail merchandising, advertising, training and store service weighed heavily on earnings, particularly in light of the slow revenue growth.
Our sales trend by quarter so far this year is similar to last year with growth decelerating each quarter as we go through the year. At this point, it is unclear whether the midyear slowdown in sales over the past 2 years is a result of labor constraints in the construction trades or an indication that the housing cycle is slowing, which is contrary to what most of the data would suggest, or something else entirely. Whatever the reason for the slowdown, our response is the same: We will continue to make prudent investments in the things that drive our long-term growth and profitability.
Architectural paint sales to our Paint Stores Group, once again significantly outpaced revenue growth for the segment as a whole. High single-digit growth in the new residential and residential repaint contractor business was partially offset by a modest but unexpected year-over-year decline in DIY sales. Sales to commercial and health care customers also generated solid year-over-year growth while the property management segment showed modest gains.
The outlook for continued growth in residential markets over the balance of the year and into 2017 remains positive, supported by very healthy order book trends reported by most of our contractor customers.
On the other hand, the revenue headwind from our protective and marine business in Paint Stores worsened sequentially in the third quarter. During the first 9 months of the year, Paint Stores Group opened 69 new stores and closed 14 redundant locations, completing our consolidation of redundant store locations acquired from Comex. Our plan for the year still calls [ph] for the store openings in a range of 90 to 100 net new locations. Today, our store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean stands at 4,141 compared to 4,048 a year ago. 
Finally, the upward inflection in input costs and operating expenses that we have seen in the recent months, including raw materials, wages and benefits, rent expense and more, warrant a price increase by our Paint Stores Group. Effective December 1, 2016, our Paint Stores Group will be implementing a price increase in the 4% to 5% range across most product lines. 
We also anticipated a stronger sales performance from our Consumer Group coming into the third quarter. We saw widespread weakness across our commercial, industrial and MRO customers. Our Ronseal brand business in Europe also had a soft quarter. Despite the weaker-than-expected sales results, the Consumer Group continued to show good progress on margins in the quarter.
Our Global Finishes Group did a commendable job of managing both gross margin and SG&A in the quarter, resulting in a 180 basis point operating margin improvement on modest sale declines. We continue to see positive demand momentum in some of our industrial coatings businesses, primarily in Europe and in Asia.
Finally, our Latin America Coatings Group reported positive revenue growth in the quarter for the first time in 12 quarters. Despite this improvement in revenue and volume momentum, margin pressure from raw materials and higher SG&A spending continued to challenge our profitability throughout the region.
Third quarter was a strong quarter for cash generation. Net operating cash in the first 9 months was $966.5 million, up about $64 million over last year, with third quarter accounting for about $456 million of the total. We're on pace again this year to generate net operating cash at a rate above 10% of net sales. We are at 10.7% year-to-date despite higher working capital.
9-month working capital ticked up slightly to 11.5% of sales from 11.1% last year. Free cash flow, which is net operating cash less CapEx and dividends, was $560 million compared to $557 million last year. Our capital expenditures year-to-date totaled $173.1 million. Depreciation was $128.3 million, and amortization was $20.2 million.
In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $170 million to $180 million and amortization of about $30 million. Capital spending will run higher than normal in 2016 as we complete some facility renovation projects.
During the quarter, we made no open market purchases of our common stock for treasury. On September 30, we had remaining board authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares. As indicated when we announced the Valspar acquisition, we intend to build cash on our balance sheet over the course of the year to reduce total borrowings required to close the deal, which will eliminate our share repurchase activity in 2016. As a result, our cash balance at the close of the third quarter 2016 was $702.6 million compared to $91 million on September 30, 2015.
Last week, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.84 per share, up 25% from $0.67 last year. The outlook for Paint Stores Group over the balance of the year remains positive, and we expect to see steady improvements from Consumer Group and Global Finishes Group. These positives will be offset, to some degree, by continued weakness in Latin America.
Over the balance of the year, the input cost tailwinds are likely to turn to headwinds, and the slower pace of sales growth is unlikely to fully offset our investment in new stores, territories and retail programs already in place. For the quarter, we anticipate our core consolidated net sales will increase a low single-digit percentage compared to last year's fourth quarter.
At this anticipated sales level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share. Fourth quarter 2016 earnings per share include costs related to the anticipated acquisition of Valspar totaling $0.71 per share and an increase in EPS of approximately $0.03 per share related to the decrease in the income tax provision. Excluding these items, fourth quarter EPS will be in the range of $2.13 to $2.23 per share compared to $2.12 per share earned in the fourth quarter 2015.
For the full year 2016, we expect core consolidated net sales to increase by a low single-digit percentage compared to full year 2015. With annual sales at that level, we are updating our guidance for full year 2016 diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $11.30 to $11.40 per share.
Full year 2016 earnings per share includes costs related to the anticipated acquisition of Valspar totaling approximately $1.35 per share and an increase in EPS of approximately $0.40 per share related to the decrease in the income tax provision. Excluding these items, full year EPS will be in the range of $12.25 to $12.35 per share, a 10% increase at the midpoint of the range over the $11.16 per share earned in 2015.
Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to comment briefly on the other press release we issued this morning. Last week, our Board of Directors elected Al Mistysyn to serve as our next Chief Financial Officer, a position held for the past 15 years by Sean Hennessy. This change will take effect January 1, 2017.
I'd like to close my comments with a few words about my great friend, Sean Hennessy. My relationship with Sean spans our 30 years together at Sherwin-Williams. He's always been an excellent adviser, contributor, and importantly, friend. We traveled around the world together on many occasions, and Sean has regularly impressed me in so many ways. So it's no surprise that Sean has once again impressed me with his selfless decision to do what he believes to be right for his family. Sean's decision to step down from the day-to-day responsibilities of CFO in order to provide more time and flexibility to address family priorities is yet another example of the quality individual we've all grown to respect. We appreciate his willingness to stay on as Head of M&A Activities [ph] to provide support for the Valspar integration planning process and to ensure a smooth transition of CFO responsibilities.
This past year, I've spent more time with Sean than any other executive on my team, traveling with many of you to immerse myself in this important aspect of my job and to gain as much information as I could from Sean knowing this time was coming. While it's never a good time for a high-performing executive like Sean to leave such an important role, the timing of his decision sets us up well for the year ahead. 
Al Mistysyn's promotion to CFO is the natural conclusion of a long, careful and thoughtful development plan to prepare him for this position. Al has been Sean's right-hand man and the architect of many of our financial programs and successes. Al is my choice for this important position. He is a proven, seasoned executive. And I'm truly excited to have him on my side as we move forward. We've assembled a full Valspar integration team that has been hard at it [ph] for several months now, with Al actively involved on a daily basis. We're also in the process of building our operating plans and budgets for next year with each of our segment teams. And having Al at my side for these important meetings is crucial to his fast start.
With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And now we'll be happy to take your questions."

What we've observed in past cycles is that when we see a period of rapid home value appreciation, in many cases, it will accelerate the move back to the pro. People are more inclined to hire a professional live there are feeling more positive about the equity that they have in their home. So the last 3 years pretty rapid home value appreciation that we've seen, may have accelerated this migration away from DIY and toward the pro. That's the best we've got. There's no empirical data as to why that's happening."

In the interest of time, we have provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations October 25 press release. I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the third quarter 2016 compared to third quarter 2015 then comment on each reportable segment.
Consolidated net sales increased $127.2 million or 4% to $3.28 billion, driven by higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores Group and the impact of a change in revenue classification related to third-party service revenue and related costs. The change in revenue classification increased sales 2.3% in the quarter. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales by 0.8% in the quarter.
Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $61.7 million or 3.9% in the quarter to $1.64 billion compared to $1.57 billion last year. Consolidated gross margin was 49.9% of sales, flat compared to the third quarter last year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $64.5 million or 6.5% to $1.06 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 32.3% in the third quarter this year, up 80 basis points from last year. A portion of this increase was acquisition-related expenses.
Interest expense increased $27.1 million compared to third quarter last year to $44.1 million. The vast majority of this increase was acquisition-related interest expense. 
Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter decreased $15.1 million or down 2.7% to $535.6 million, due primarily to acquisition-related expenses. Unfavorable currency translation reduced profit before tax in the quarter by $4.6 million compared to third quarter last year.
Consolidated net income increased $12.2 million or 3.3% to $386.7 million. Net 
[Audio Gap] 
11.8% compared to 11.9% in the third quarter last year. 
Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 27.8%. A comparable effective tax rate to 2015 would be 30.5%. For full year 2016, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the low 30s, excluding the impact of the accounting change. 
Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 2.8% to $4.08 per share from $3.97 per share in 2015. The $4.08 includes $0.09 accretion from the change in accounting standard and $0.24 dilution from acquisition-related expenses. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased earnings per share by $0.03 in the quarter.
Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the third quarter 2016 increased $140.6 million or 6.7% to $2.23 billion from $2.09 billion last year. Comparable store sales, that is, sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months excluding the change in revenue classification, increased 2.1%. Paint Stores Group's sales increase was due to higher architectural paint sales volume across most end market segments and the impact of the change in revenue classification. Price mix had a negligible impact on sales in the quarter, and protective and marine coatings sales were a significant drag on revenue growth.
Regionally, in the third quarter, our Canadian division led all divisions, followed by Southeastern division, Southwestern division, Midwest and Eastern division. Sales and volumes were positive in every division. 
Segment profit for the group increased $10.9 million or 2.1% to $518.3 million in the quarter as higher architectural paint and equipment sales volumes were partially offset by higher SG&A spending. Segment operating margin decreased 100 basis points to 23.3% of sales from 24.3% in the third quarter last year.
For our Latin America Coatings Group, third quarter net sales stated in U.S. dollars was $156.6 million, up $618,000, due primarily to higher year-over-year selling prices that were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and volume declines.
Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by $12.8 million or 8.2% in the quarter. Segment profit in the third quarter, stated in U.S. dollars, decreased $1.2 million or 54.6% to $1 million from $2.1 million in the same period last year. The negative impact from higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation was only partially offset by increased selling prices. Currency translation decreased segment profit $3.6 million in the quarter compared to the same period last year. As a percent of net sales, segment profit decreased to 60 basis points in the quarter compared to 1.4% in the third quarter 2015.
For our Consumer Group, sales decreased $8.7 million or 2.1% to $412.9 million from $421.6 million last year, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency translation and declining sales to certain retail accounts, commercial customers and in our European business. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment by $5 million or 1.2%. Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased $3.8 million or 4.3% to $92 million from $88.3 million last year, due to improved operating efficiencies and good SG&A expense control. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 22.3% from 20.9% in the same period last year. 
For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars decreased $5.4 million or 1.1% to $480.7 million in the quarter as unfavorable currency translation was partially offset by positive price mix. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for this segment by $7.1 million or 1.5% in the quarter. Segment profit in U.S. dollars increased $8 million or 14.6% in the quarter to $63.2 million from $55.1 million last year, due primarily to good SG&A expense control. Unfavorable currency translation decreased segment profit $0.5 million in the quarter. As a percent to net external sales, Global Finishes Group segment profit increased to 13.1% from 11.3% in the quarter compared to last year. 
That concludes my recap of our results for the quarter. So I will turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for fourth quarter and full year. John?"
303104,402642851,1060459,"The Sherwin-Williams Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","The Sherwin-Williams Company","Executives","Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our results for the third quarter include a number of unusual items that affect our revenues, expenses and tax rate. If you back out the impact of these items, our results on a comparable year",1729,"Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our results for the third quarter include a number of unusual items that affect our revenues, expenses and tax rate. If you back out the impact of these items, our results on a comparable year-over-year basis showed modest improvement.
Consolidated sales increased 1.7% to $3.2 billion. Consolidated gross margin was 50.9%, an increase of 100 basis points compared to the third quarter last year. Operating profit improved 1.9% to $591.8 million. Profit before tax grew 3.9% to $572.4 million, a 30 basis point increase as a percent of sales. Net income increased 6.2% to $397.9 million, and earnings per share increased 6.5% to $4.23 per share.
These results are consistent with the GAAP guidance ranges we provided for both revenue and earnings, but they fell short of what we envisioned at the start of the quarter. Revenue growth at the lower end of our low to mid-single-digit range was disappointing. And the ongoing investments we are making in new stores, sales territories, retail merchandising, advertising, training and store service weighed heavily on earnings, particularly in light of the slow revenue growth.
Our sales trend by quarter so far this year is similar to last year with growth decelerating each quarter as we go through the year. At this point, it is unclear whether the midyear slowdown in sales over the past 2 years is a result of labor constraints in the construction trades or an indication that the housing cycle is slowing, which is contrary to what most of the data would suggest, or something else entirely. Whatever the reason for the slowdown, our response is the same: We will continue to make prudent investments in the things that drive our long-term growth and profitability.
Architectural paint sales to our Paint Stores Group, once again significantly outpaced revenue growth for the segment as a whole. High single-digit growth in the new residential and residential repaint contractor business was partially offset by a modest but unexpected year-over-year decline in DIY sales. Sales to commercial and health care customers also generated solid year-over-year growth while the property management segment showed modest gains.
The outlook for continued growth in residential markets over the balance of the year and into 2017 remains positive, supported by very healthy order book trends reported by most of our contractor customers.
On the other hand, the revenue headwind from our protective and marine business in Paint Stores worsened sequentially in the third quarter. During the first 9 months of the year, Paint Stores Group opened 69 new stores and closed 14 redundant locations, completing our consolidation of redundant store locations acquired from Comex. Our plan for the year still calls for the store openings in a range of 90 to 100 net new locations. Today, our store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean stands at 4,141 compared to 4,048 a year ago. 
Finally, the upward inflection in input costs and operating expenses that we have seen in the recent months, including raw materials, wages and benefits, rent expense and more, warrant a price increase by our Paint Stores Group. Effective December 1, 2016, our Paint Stores Group will be implementing a price increase in the 4% to 5% range across most product lines. 
We also anticipated a stronger sales performance from our Consumer Group coming into the third quarter. We saw widespread weakness across our commercial, industrial and MRO customers. Our Ronseal brand business in Europe also had a soft quarter. Despite the weaker-than-expected sales results, the Consumer Group continued to show good progress on margins in the quarter.
Our Global Finishes Group did a commendable job of managing both gross margin and SG&A in the quarter, resulting in a 180 basis point operating margin improvement on modest sale declines. We continue to see positive demand momentum in some of our industrial coatings businesses, primarily in Europe and in Asia.
Finally, our Latin America Coatings Group reported positive revenue growth in the quarter for the first time in 12 quarters. Despite this improvement in revenue and volume momentum, margin pressure from raw materials and higher SG&A spending continued to challenge our profitability throughout the region.
Third quarter was a strong quarter for cash generation. Net operating cash in the first 9 months was $966.5 million, up about $64 million over last year, with third quarter accounting for about $456 million of the total. We're on pace again this year to generate net operating cash at a rate above 10% of net sales. We are at 10.7% year-to-date despite higher working capital.
9-month working capital ticked up slightly to 11.5% of sales from 11.1% last year. Free cash flow, which is net operating cash less CapEx and dividends, was $560 million compared to $557 million last year. Our capital expenditures year-to-date totaled $173.1 million. Depreciation was $128.3 million, and amortization was $20.2 million.
In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $170 million to $180 million and amortization of about $30 million. Capital spending will run higher than normal in 2016 as we complete some facility renovation projects.
During the quarter, we made no open market purchases of our common stock for treasury. On September 30, we had remaining board authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares. As indicated when we announced the Valspar acquisition, we intend to build cash on our balance sheet over the course of the year to reduce total borrowings required to close the deal, which will eliminate our share repurchase activity in 2016. As a result, our cash balance at the close of the third quarter 2016 was $702.6 million compared to $91 million on September 30, 2015.
Last week, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.84 per share, up 25% from $0.67 last year. The outlook for Paint Stores Group over the balance of the year remains positive, and we expect to see steady improvements from Consumer Group and Global Finishes Group. These positives will be offset, to some degree, by continued weakness in Latin America.
Over the balance of the year, the input cost tailwinds are likely to turn to headwinds, and the slower pace of sales growth is unlikely to fully offset our investment in new stores, territories and retail programs already in place. For the quarter, we anticipate our core consolidated net sales will increase a low single-digit percentage compared to last year's fourth quarter.
At this anticipated sales level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share. Fourth quarter 2016 earnings per share include costs related to the anticipated acquisition of Valspar totaling $0.71 per share and an increase in EPS of approximately $0.03 per share related to the decrease in the income tax provision. Excluding these items, fourth quarter EPS will be in the range of $2.13 to $2.23 per share compared to $2.12 per share earned in the fourth quarter 2015.
For the full year 2016, we expect core consolidated net sales to increase by a low single-digit percentage compared to full year 2015. With annual sales at that level, we are updating our guidance for full year 2016 diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $11.30 to $11.40 per share.
Full year 2016 earnings per share includes costs related to the anticipated acquisition of Valspar totaling approximately $1.35 per share and an increase in EPS of approximately $0.40 per share related to the decrease in the income tax provision. Excluding these items, full year EPS will be in the range of $12.25 to $12.35 per share, a 10% increase at the midpoint of the range over the $11.16 per share earned in 2015.
Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to comment briefly on the other press release we issued this morning. Last week, our Board of Directors elected Al Mistysyn to serve as our next Chief Financial Officer, a position held for the past 15 years by Sean Hennessy. This change will take effect January 1, 2017.
I'd like to close my comments with a few words about my great friend, Sean Hennessy. My relationship with Sean spans our 30 years together at Sherwin-Williams. He's always been an excellent adviser, contributor, and importantly, friend. We traveled around the world together on many occasions, and Sean has regularly impressed me in so many ways. So it's no surprise that Sean has once again impressed me with his selfless decision to do what he believes to be right for his family. Sean's decision to step down from the day-to-day responsibilities of CFO in order to provide more time and flexibility to address family priorities is yet another example of the quality individual we've all grown to respect. We appreciate his willingness to stay on as Head of M&A Activities to provide support for the Valspar integration planning process and to ensure a smooth transition of CFO responsibilities.
This past year, I've spent more time with Sean than any other executive on my team, traveling with many of you to immerse myself in this important aspect of my job and to gain as much information as I could from Sean knowing this time was coming. While it's never a good time for a high-performing executive like Sean to leave such an important role, the timing of his decision sets us up well for the year ahead. 
Al Mistysyn's promotion to CFO is the natural conclusion of a long, careful and thoughtful development plan to prepare him for this position. Al has been Sean's right-hand man and the architect of many of our financial programs and successes. Al is my choice for this important position. He is a proven, seasoned executive. And I'm truly excited to have him on my side as we move forward. We've assembled a full Valspar integration team that has been hard at it for several months now, with Al actively involved on a daily basis. We're also in the process of building our operating plans and budgets for next year with each of our segment teams. And having Al at my side for these important meetings is crucial to his fast start.
With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And now we'll be happy to take your questions."

In the interest of time, we have provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations October 25 press release. I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the third quarter 2016 compared to third quarter 2015 then comment on each reportable segment.
Consolidated net sales increased $127.2 million or 4% to $3.28 billion, driven by higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores Group and the impact of a change in revenue classification related to third-party service revenue and related costs. The change in revenue classification increased sales 2.3% in the quarter. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales by 0.8% in the quarter.
Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $61.7 million or 3.9% in the quarter to $1.64 billion compared to $1.57 billion last year. Consolidated gross margin was 49.9% of sales, flat compared to the third quarter last year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $64.5 million or 6.5% to $1.06 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 32.3% in the third quarter this year, up 80 basis points from last year. A portion of this increase was acquisition-related expenses.
Interest expense increased $27.1 million compared to third quarter last year to $44.1 million. The vast majority of this increase was acquisition-related interest expense. 
Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter decreased $15.1 million or down 2.7% to $535.6 million, due primarily to acquisition-related expenses. Unfavorable currency translation reduced profit before tax in the quarter by $4.6 million compared to third quarter last year.
Consolidated net income increased $12.2 million or 3.3% to $386.7 million. Net 
[Audio Gap] 
11.8% compared to 11.9% in the third quarter last year. 
Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 27.8%. A comparable effective tax rate to 2015 would be 30.5%. For full year 2016, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the low 30s, excluding the impact of the accounting change. 
Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 2.8% to $4.08 per share from $3.97 per share in 2015. The $4.08 includes $0.09 accretion from the change in accounting standard and $0.24 dilution from acquisition-related expenses. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased earnings per share by $0.03 in the quarter.
Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the third quarter 2016 increased $140.6 million or 6.7% to $2.23 billion from $2.09 billion last year. Comparable store sales, that is, sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, excluding the change in revenue classification, increased 2.1%. Paint Stores Group's sales increase was due to higher architectural paint sales volume across most end market segments and the impact of the change in revenue classification. Price mix had a negligible impact on sales in the quarter, and protective and marine coatings sales were a significant drag on revenue growth.
Regionally, in the third quarter, our Canadian division led all divisions, followed by Southeastern division, Southwestern division, Midwest and Eastern division. Sales and volumes were positive in every division. 
Segment profit for the group increased $10.9 million or 2.1% to $518.3 million in the quarter as higher architectural paint and equipment sales volumes were partially offset by higher SG&A spending. Segment operating margin decreased 100 basis points to 23.3% of sales from 24.3% in the third quarter last year.
For our Latin America Coatings Group, third quarter net sales stated in U.S. dollars was $156.6 million, up $618,000, due primarily to higher year-over-year selling prices that were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and volume declines.
Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by $12.8 million or 8.2% in the quarter. Segment profit in the third quarter, stated in U.S. dollars, decreased $1.2 million or 54.6% to $1 million from $2.1 million in the same period last year. The negative impact from higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation was only partially offset by increased selling prices. Currency translation decreased segment profit $3.6 million in the quarter compared to the same period last year. As a percent of net sales, segment profit decreased to 60 basis points in the quarter compared to 1.4% in the third quarter 2015.
For our Consumer Group, sales decreased $8.7 million or 2.1% to $412.9 million from $421.6 million last year, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency translation and declining sales to certain retail accounts, commercial customers and in our European business. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment by $5 million or 1.2%. Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased $3.8 million or 4.3% to $92 million from $88.3 million last year, due to improved operating efficiencies and good SG&A expense control. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 22.3% from 20.9% in the same period last year. 
For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars decreased $5.4 million or 1.1% to $480.7 million in the quarter as unfavorable currency translation was partially offset by positive price mix. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for this segment by $7.1 million or 1.5% in the quarter. Segment profit in U.S. dollars increased $8 million or 14.6% in the quarter to $63.2 million from $55.1 million last year, due primarily to good SG&A expense control. Unfavorable currency translation decreased segment profit $0.5 million in the quarter. As a percent to net external sales, Global Finishes Group's segment profit increased to 13.1% from 11.3% in the quarter compared to last year. 
That concludes my recap of our results for the quarter. So I will turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for fourth quarter and full year. John?"
303104,402642851,1060628,"The Sherwin-Williams Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","The Sherwin-Williams Company","Executives","Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our results for the third quarter include a number of unusual items that affect our revenues, expenses and tax rate. If you back out the impact of these items, our results on a comparable year",1730,"Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our results for the third quarter include a number of unusual items that affect our revenues, expenses and tax rate. If you back out the impact of these items, our results on a comparable year-over-year basis showed modest improvement.
Consolidated sales increased 1.7% to $3.2 billion. Consolidated gross margin was 50.9%, an increase of 100 basis points compared to the third quarter last year. Operating profit improved 1.9% to $591.8 million. Profit before tax grew 3.9% to $572.4 million, a 30 basis point increase as a percent of sales. Net income increased 6.2% to $397.9 million, and earnings per share increased 6.5% to $4.23 per share.
These results are consistent with the GAAP guidance ranges we provided for both revenue and earnings, but they fell short of what we envisioned at the start of the quarter. Revenue growth at the lower end of our low to mid-single-digit range was disappointing. And the ongoing investments we are making in new stores, sales territories, retail merchandising, advertising, training and store service weighed heavily on earnings, particularly in light of the slow revenue growth.
Our sales trend by quarter so far this year is similar to last year, with growth decelerating each quarter as we go through the year. At this point, it is unclear whether the midyear slowdown in sales over the past 2 years is a result of labor constraints in the construction trades or an indication that the housing cycle is slowing, which is contrary to what most of the data would suggest, or something else entirely. Whatever the reason for the slowdown, our response is the same: We will continue to make prudent investments in the things that drive our long-term growth and profitability.
Architectural paint sales to our Paint Stores Group, once again significantly outpaced revenue growth for the segment as a whole. High single-digit growth in the new residential and residential repaint contractor business was partially offset by a modest but unexpected year-over-year decline in DIY sales. Sales to commercial and health care customers also generated solid year-over-year growth, while the property management segment showed modest gains.
The outlook for continued growth in residential markets over the balance of the year and into 2017 remains positive, supported by very healthy order book trends reported by most of our contractor customers.
On the other hand, the revenue headwind from our protective and marine business in Paint Stores worsened sequentially in the third quarter. During the first 9 months of the year, Paint Stores Group opened 69 new stores and closed 14 redundant locations, completing our consolidation of redundant store locations acquired from Comex. Our plan for the year still calls for the store openings in a range of 90 to 100 net new locations. Today, our store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean stands at 4,141 compared to 4,048 a year ago. 
Finally, the upward inflection in input costs and operating expenses that we have seen in the recent months, including raw materials, wages and benefits, rent expense and more, warrant a price increase by our Paint Stores Group. Effective December 1, 2016, our Paint Stores Group will be implementing a price increase in the 4% to 5% range across most product lines. 
We also anticipated a stronger sales performance from our Consumer Group coming into the third quarter. We saw widespread weakness across our commercial, industrial and MRO customers. Our Ronseal brand business in Europe also had a soft quarter. Despite the weaker-than-expected sales results, the Consumer Group continued to show good progress on margins in the quarter.
Our Global Finishes Group did a commendable job of managing both gross margin and SG&A in the quarter, resulting in a 180 basis point operating margin improvement on modest sales declines. We continue to see positive demand momentum in some of our industrial coatings businesses, primarily in Europe and in Asia.
Finally, our Latin America Coatings Group reported positive revenue growth in the quarter for the first time in 12 quarters. Despite this improvement in revenue and volume momentum, margin pressure from raw materials and higher SG&A spending continued to challenge our profitability throughout the region.
Third quarter was a strong quarter for cash generation. Net operating cash in the first 9 months was $966.5 million, up about $64 million over last year, with third quarter accounting for about $456 million of the total. We're on pace again this year to generate net operating cash at a rate above 10% of net sales. We are at 10.7% year-to-date despite higher working capital.
9-month working capital ticked up slightly to 11.5% of sales from 11.1% last year. Free cash flow, which is net operating cash less CapEx and dividends, was $560 million compared to $557 million last year. Our capital expenditures year-to-date totaled $173.1 million. Depreciation was $128.3 million, and amortization was $20.2 million.
In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $170 million to $180 million and amortization of about $30 million. Capital spending will run higher than normal in 2016 as we complete some facility renovation projects.
During the quarter, we made no open market purchases of our common stock for treasury. On September 30, we had remaining board authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares. As indicated when we announced the Valspar acquisition, we intend to build cash on our balance sheet over the course of the year to reduce total borrowings required to close the deal, which will eliminate our share repurchase activity in 2016. As a result, our cash balance at the close of the third quarter 2016 was $702.6 million compared to $91 million on September 30, 2015.
Last week, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.84 per share, up 25% from $0.67 last year. The outlook for Paint Stores Group over the balance of the year remains positive, and we expect to see steady improvements from Consumer Group and Global Finishes Group. These positives will be offset, to some degree, by continued weakness in Latin America.
Over the balance of the year, the input cost tailwinds are likely to turn to headwinds, and the slower pace of sales growth is unlikely to fully offset our investment in new stores, territories and retail programs already in place. For the quarter, we anticipate our core consolidated net sales will increase a low single-digit percentage compared to last year's fourth quarter.
At this anticipated sales level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share. Fourth quarter 2016 earnings per share include costs related to the anticipated acquisition of Valspar totaling $0.71 per share and an increase in EPS of approximately $0.03 per share related to the decrease in the income tax provision. Excluding these items, fourth quarter EPS will be in the range of $2.13 to $2.23 per share compared to $2.12 per share earned in the fourth quarter of 2015.
For the full year 2016, we expect core consolidated net sales to increase by a low single-digit percentage compared to full year 2015. With annual sales at that level, we are updating our guidance for full year 2016 diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $11.30 to $11.40 per share.
Full year 2016 earnings per share includes costs related to the anticipated acquisition of Valspar totaling approximately $1.35 per share and an increase in EPS of approximately $0.40 per share related to the decrease in the income tax provision. Excluding these items, full year EPS will be in the range of $12.25 to $12.35 per share, a 10% increase at the midpoint of the range over the $11.16 per share earned in 2015.
Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to comment briefly on the other press release we issued this morning. Last week, our Board of Directors elected Al Mistysyn to serve as our next Chief Financial Officer, a position held for the past 15 years by Sean Hennessy. This change will take effect January 1, 2017.
I'd like to close my comments with a few words about my great friend, Sean Hennessy. My relationship with Sean spans our 30 years together at Sherwin-Williams. He's always been an excellent adviser, contributor and, importantly, friend. We traveled around the world together on many occasions, and Sean has regularly impressed me in so many ways. So it's no surprise that Sean has once again impressed me with his selfless decision to do what he believes to be right for his family. Sean's decision to step down from the day-to-day responsibilities of CFO in order to provide more time and flexibility to address family priorities is yet another example of the quality individual we've all grown to respect. We appreciate his willingness to stay on as Head of M&A Activities to provide support for the Valspar integration planning process and to ensure a smooth transition of CFO responsibilities.
This past year, I've spent more time with Sean than any other executive on my team, traveling with many of you to immerse myself in this important aspect of my job and to gain as much information as I could from Sean knowing this time was coming. While it's never a good time for a high-performing executive like Sean to leave such an important role, the timing of his decision sets us up well for the year ahead. 
Al Mistysyn's promotion to CFO is the natural conclusion of a long, careful and thoughtful development plan to prepare him for this position. Al has been Sean's right-hand man and the architect of many of our financial programs and successes. Al is my choice for this important position. He is a proven, seasoned executive. And I'm truly excited to have him on my side as we move forward. We've assembled a full Valspar integration team that has been hard at it for several months now, with Al actively involved on a daily basis. We're also in the process of building our operating plans and budgets for next year with each of our segment teams. And having Al at my side for these important meetings is crucial to his fast start.
With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And now we'll be happy to take your questions."

We did see high single-digit growth in our new residential and our residential repaint business. We saw solid year-over-year increases in our commercial and our health care businesses and modest gains in our property management. As I mentioned just a moment ago, we did see a modest decline in DIY, and our P&M worsened sequentially. So our outlook obviously remains very positive. We see the fundamentals of the business very solid and have great confidence in the investments that we're making, that we're going to continue to be able to grow market share. We talked -- actually, Bob just covered geographically about the growth, with Canada leading the market, and talked about the different geographies.

What we've observed in past cycles is that when we see a period of rapid home value appreciation, in many cases, it will accelerate the move back to the pro. People are more inclined to hire a professional when they're feeling more positive about the equity that they have in their home. So the last 3 years, pretty rapid home value appreciation that we've seen, may have accelerated this migration away from DIY and toward the pro. That's the best we've got.

In the interest of time, we have provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations October 25 press release. I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the third quarter 2016 compared to third quarter 2015 then comment on each reportable segment.
Consolidated net sales increased $127.2 million or 4% to $3.28 billion, driven by higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores Group and the impact of a change in revenue classification related to third-party service revenue and related costs. The change in revenue classification increased sales 2.3% in the quarter. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales by 0.8% in the quarter.
Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $61.7 million or 3.9% in the quarter to $1.64 billion compared to $1.57 billion last year. Consolidated gross margin was 49.9% of sales, flat compared to the third quarter last year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $64.5 million or 6.5% to $1.06 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 32.3% in the third quarter this year, up 80 basis points from last year. A portion of this increase was acquisition-related expenses.
Interest expense increased $27.1 million compared to third quarter last year to $44.1 million. The vast majority of this increase was acquisition-related interest expense. 
Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter decreased $15.1 million or down 2.7% to $535.6 million, due primarily to acquisition-related expenses. Unfavorable currency translation reduced profit before tax in the quarter by $4.6 million compared to third quarter last year.
Consolidated net income increased $12.2 million or 3.3% to $386.7 million. Net 
[Audio Gap] 
11.8% compared to 11.9% in the third quarter last year. 
Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 27.8%. A comparable effective tax rate to 2015 would be 30.5%. For full year 2016, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the low 30s, excluding the impact of the accounting change. 
Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 2.8% to $4.08 per share from $3.97 per share in 2015. The $4.08 includes $0.09 accretion from the change in accounting standard and $0.24 dilution from acquisition-related expenses. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased earnings per share by $0.03 in the quarter.
Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the third quarter 2016 increased $140.6 million or 6.7% to $2.23 billion from $2.09 billion last year. Comparable store sales, that is, sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, excluding the change in revenue classification, increased 2.1%. Paint Stores Group's sales increase was due to higher architectural paint sales volume across most end market segments and the impact of the change in revenue classification. Price mix had a negligible impact on sales in the quarter, and protective and marine coatings sales were a significant drag on revenue growth.
Regionally, in the third quarter, our Canadian division led all divisions, followed by Southeastern division, Southwestern division, Midwest and Eastern division. Sales and volumes were positive in every division. 
Segment profit for the group increased $10.9 million or 2.1% to $518.3 million in the quarter as higher architectural paint and equipment sales volumes were partially offset by higher SG&A spending. Segment operating margin decreased 100 basis points to 23.3% of sales from 24.3% in the third quarter last year.
For our Latin America Coatings Group, third quarter net sales stated in U.S. dollars was $156.6 million, up $618,000, due primarily to higher year-over-year selling prices that were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and volume declines.
Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by $12.8 million or 8.2% in the quarter. Segment profit in the third quarter, stated in U.S. dollars, decreased $1.2 million or 54.6% to $1 million from $2.1 million in the same period last year. The negative impact from higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation was only partially offset by increased selling prices. Currency translation decreased segment profit $3.6 million in the quarter compared to the same period last year. As a percent of net sales, segment profit decreased to 60 basis points in the quarter compared to 1.4% in the third quarter 2015.
For our Consumer Group, sales decreased $8.7 million or 2.1% to $412.9 million from $421.6 million last year, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency translation and declining sales to certain retail accounts, commercial customers and in our European business. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment by $5 million or 1.2%. Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased $3.8 million or 4.3% to $92 million from $88.3 million last year, due to improved operating efficiencies and good SG&A expense control. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 22.3% from 20.9% in the same period last year. 
For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars decreased $5.4 million or 1.1% to $480.7 million in the quarter as unfavorable currency translation was partially offset by positive price mix. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for this segment by $7.1 million or 1.5% in the quarter. Segment profit in U.S. dollars increased $8 million or 14.6% in the quarter to $63.2 million from $55.1 million last year, due primarily to good SG&A expense control. Unfavorable currency translation decreased segment profit $0.5 million in the quarter. As a percent to net external sales, Global Finishes Group's segment profit increased to 13.1% from 11.3% in the quarter compared to last year. 
That concludes my recap of our results for the quarter. So I will turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for fourth quarter and full year. John?"
303104,402642851,1060817,"The Sherwin-Williams Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","The Sherwin-Williams Company","Executives","Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our results for the third quarter include a number of unusual items that affect our revenues, expenses and tax rate. If you back out the impact of these items, our results on a comparable year",1730,"Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our results for the third quarter include a number of unusual items that affect our revenues, expenses and tax rate. If you back out the impact of these items, our results on a comparable year-over-year basis showed modest improvement.
Consolidated sales increased 1.7% to $3.2 billion. Consolidated gross margin was 50.9%, an increase of 100 basis points compared to the third quarter last year. Operating profit improved 1.9% to $591.8 million. Profit before tax grew 3.9% to $572.4 million, a 30 basis point increase as a percent of sales. Net income increased 6.2% to $397.9 million, and earnings per share increased 6.5% to $4.23 per share.
These results are consistent with the GAAP guidance ranges we provided for both revenue and earnings, but they fell short of what we envisioned at the start of the quarter. Revenue growth at the lower end of our low to mid-single-digit range was disappointing. And the ongoing investments we are making in new stores, sales territories, retail merchandising, advertising, training and store service weighed heavily on earnings, particularly in light of the slow revenue growth.
Our sales trend by quarter so far this year is similar to last year, with growth decelerating each quarter as we go through the year. At this point, it is unclear whether the midyear slowdown in sales over the past 2 years is a result of labor constraints in the construction trades or an indication that the housing cycle is slowing, which is contrary to what most of the data would suggest, or something else entirely. Whatever the reason for the slowdown, our response is the same: We will continue to make prudent investments in the things that drive our long-term growth and profitability.
Architectural paint sales to our Paint Stores Group, once again significantly outpaced revenue growth for the segment as a whole. High single-digit growth in the new residential and residential repaint contractor business was partially offset by a modest but unexpected year-over-year decline in DIY sales. Sales to commercial and health care customers also generated solid year-over-year growth, while the property management segment showed modest gains.
The outlook for continued growth in residential markets over the balance of the year and into 2017 remains positive, supported by very healthy order book trends reported by most of our contractor customers.
On the other hand, the revenue headwind from our protective and marine business in Paint Stores worsened sequentially in the third quarter. During the first 9 months of the year, Paint Stores Group opened 69 new stores and closed 14 redundant locations, completing our consolidation of redundant store locations acquired from Comex. Our plan for the year still calls for the store openings in a range of 90 to 100 net new locations. Today, our store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean stands at 4,141 compared to 4,048 a year ago. 
Finally, the upward inflection in input costs and operating expenses that we have seen in the recent months, including raw materials, wages and benefits, rent expense and more, warrant a price increase by our Paint Stores Group. Effective December 1, 2016, our Paint Stores Group will be implementing a price increase in the 4% to 5% range across most product lines. 
We also anticipated a stronger sales performance from our Consumer Group coming into the third quarter. We saw widespread weakness across our commercial, industrial and MRO customers. Our Ronseal brand business in Europe also had a soft quarter. Despite the weaker-than-expected sales results, the Consumer Group continued to show good progress on margins in the quarter.
Our Global Finishes Group did a commendable job of managing both gross margin and SG&A in the quarter, resulting in a 180 basis point operating margin improvement on modest sales declines. We continue to see positive demand momentum in some of our industrial coatings businesses, primarily in Europe and in Asia.
Finally, our Latin America Coatings Group reported positive revenue growth in the quarter for the first time in 12 quarters. Despite this improvement in revenue and volume momentum, margin pressure from raw materials and higher SG&A spending continued to challenge our profitability throughout the region.
Third quarter was a strong quarter for cash generation. Net operating cash in the first 9 months was $966.5 million, up about $64 million over last year, with third quarter accounting for about $456 million of the total. We're on pace again this year to generate net operating cash at a rate above 10% of net sales. We are at 10.7% year-to-date despite higher working capital.
9-month working capital ticked up slightly to 11.5% of sales from 11.1% last year. Free cash flow, which is net operating cash less CapEx and dividends, was $560 million compared to $557 million last year. Our capital expenditures year-to-date totaled $173.1 million. Depreciation was $128.3 million, and amortization was $20.2 million.
In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $170 million to $180 million and amortization of about $30 million. Capital spending will run higher than normal in 2016 as we complete some facility renovation projects.
During the quarter, we made no open market purchases of our common stock for treasury. On September 30, we had remaining board authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares. As indicated when we announced the Valspar acquisition, we intend to build cash on our balance sheet over the course of the year to reduce total borrowings required to close the deal, which will eliminate our share repurchase activity in 2016. As a result, our cash balance at the close of the third quarter 2016 was $702.6 million compared to $91 million on September 30, 2015.
Last week, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.84 per share, up 25% from $0.67 last year. The outlook for Paint Stores Group over the balance of the year remains positive, and we expect to see steady improvements from Consumer Group and Global Finishes Group. These positives will be offset, to some degree, by continued weakness in Latin America.
Over the balance of the year, the input cost tailwinds are likely to turn to headwinds, and the slower pace of sales growth is unlikely to fully offset our investment in new stores, territories and retail programs already in place. For the quarter, we anticipate our core consolidated net sales will increase a low single-digit percentage compared to last year's fourth quarter.
At this anticipated sales level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share. Fourth quarter 2016 earnings per share include costs related to the anticipated acquisition of Valspar totaling $0.71 per share and an increase in EPS of approximately $0.03 per share related to the decrease in the income tax provision. Excluding these items, fourth quarter EPS will be in the range of $2.13 to $2.23 per share compared to $2.12 per share earned in the fourth quarter of 2015.
For the full year 2016, we expect core consolidated net sales to increase by a low single-digit percentage compared to full year 2015. With annual sales at that level, we are updating our guidance for full year 2016 diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $11.30 to $11.40 per share.
Full year 2016 earnings per share includes costs related to the anticipated acquisition of Valspar totaling approximately $1.35 per share and an increase in EPS of approximately $0.40 per share related to the decrease in the income tax provision. Excluding these items, full year EPS will be in the range of $12.25 to $12.35 per share, a 10% increase at the midpoint of the range over the $11.16 per share earned in 2015.
Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to comment briefly on the other press release we issued this morning. Last week, our Board of Directors elected Al Mistysyn to serve as our next Chief Financial Officer, a position held for the past 15 years by Sean Hennessy. This change will take effect January 1, 2017.
I'd like to close my comments with a few words about my great friend, Sean Hennessy. My relationship with Sean spans our 30 years together at Sherwin-Williams. He's always been an excellent adviser, contributor and, importantly, friend. We traveled around the world together on many occasions, and Sean has regularly impressed me in so many ways. So it's no surprise that Sean has once again impressed me with his selfless decision to do what he believes to be right for his family. Sean's decision to step down from the day-to-day responsibilities of CFO in order to provide more time and flexibility to address family priorities is yet another example of the quality individual we've all grown to respect. We appreciate his willingness to stay on as Head of M&A Activities to provide support for the Valspar integration planning process and to ensure a smooth transition of CFO responsibilities.
This past year, I've spent more time with Sean than any other executive on my team, traveling with many of you to immerse myself in this important aspect of my job and to gain as much information as I could from Sean knowing this time was coming. While it's never a good time for a high-performing executive like Sean to leave such an important role, the timing of his decision sets us up well for the year ahead. 
Al Mistysyn's promotion to CFO is the natural conclusion of a long, careful and thoughtful development plan to prepare him for this position. Al has been Sean's right-hand man and the architect of many of our financial programs and successes. Al is my choice for this important position. He is a proven, seasoned executive. And I'm truly excited to have him on my side as we move forward. We've assembled a full Valspar integration team that has been hard at it for several months now, with Al actively involved on a daily basis. We're also in the process of building our operating plans and budgets for next year with each of our segment teams. And having Al at my side for these important meetings is crucial to his fast start.
With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And now we'll be happy to take your questions."

John indicated the residential businesses are up in the high single digits. It's not that strong, but it's really solid year-over-year growth. The dark lining around that silver cloud is that starts this year are actually down year-over-year. So we're seeing some weakness in new projects started and that, if that persists, it was going to impact our commercial business a couple of years out. But for the time being, it's good."

And our team down there is working very hard to upgrade our position in the marketplace and by doing what we believe to be the heavy lifting now while the market is maybe choppy, it may be an understatement, but while taking those steps now that we'll be better able to participate at a greater rate once the market does improve. We do feel as though that it's hit a trough. It's too early to tell if it's -- improvement in the market is sustainable there. The choppiness in sales and profit is likely to continue over the next few quarters. But we really do believe that the steps that we're taking right now are going to better position us by a better employee base that we have down there, better product line, more consistent products and a much more efficient path to the customer than what we've had in the past. So our expectations of what we're doing down there are clearly to outperform the market as we move forward."

We just talked with the previous question about the long-term model and why it fits and why we believe in it. So you're going to continue to see us invest in new stores territories, new products, the things that allow us to differentiate ourselves from our competition. And you should expect us to continue to be animals on expenses. We had a discussion last week about our budgeting process. And I mentioned, Al coming on board, and so the same discipline that we've with Sean in the past. We're going into our operating plan process. We're starting at ground zero, and we're ripping every expense out that we can that doesn't affect sales. And so we're -- we want to be that disciplined about what it is we're doing. We don't want to point to past success and justify future expense. We want to be invested in those things are going to drive our business. And we're committed to doing that in the models that will drive the operating margin that we've talked about."

You mentioned the chemical area where there are assets coming online. We're fighting for every one of those projects. We know that the infrastructure is an area that eventually is going to have to be an area of focus for our country and countries around the world. And we're furthering our penetration in those areas. So what I don't want to give is the impression that we're just sitting here, waiting for the oil and gas market to fix itself. We're out there fighting in existing markets, in adjacent markets and in new markets. And we believe that there is considerable amount of opportunity for us there, and we're determined to capture it."

In the interest of time, we have provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations October 25 press release. I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the third quarter 2016 compared to third quarter 2015 then comment on each reportable segment.
Consolidated net sales increased $127.2 million or 4% to $3.28 billion, driven by higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores Group and the impact of a change in revenue classification related to third-party service revenue and related costs. The change in revenue classification increased sales 2.3% in the quarter. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales by 0.8% in the quarter.
Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $61.7 million or 3.9% in the quarter to $1.64 billion compared to $1.57 billion last year. Consolidated gross margin was 49.9% of sales, flat compared to the third quarter last year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $64.5 million or 6.5% to $1.06 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 32.3% in the third quarter this year, up 80 basis points from last year. A portion of this increase was acquisition-related expenses.
Interest expense increased $27.1 million compared to third quarter last year to $44.1 million. The vast majority of this increase was acquisition-related interest expense. 
Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter decreased $15.1 million or down 2.7% to $535.6 million, due primarily to acquisition-related expenses. Unfavorable currency translation reduced profit before tax in the quarter by $4.6 million compared to third quarter last year.
Consolidated net income increased $12.2 million or 3.3% to $386.7 million. Net 
[Audio Gap] 
11.8% compared to 11.9% in the third quarter last year. 
Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 27.8%. A comparable effective tax rate to 2015 would be 30.5%. For full year 2016, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the low 30s, excluding the impact of the accounting change. 
Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 2.8% to $4.08 per share from $3.97 per share in 2015. The $4.08 includes $0.09 accretion from the change in accounting standard and $0.24 dilution from acquisition-related expenses. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased earnings per share by $0.03 in the quarter.
Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the third quarter 2016 increased $140.6 million or 6.7% to $2.23 billion from $2.09 billion last year. Comparable store sales, that is, sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, excluding the change in revenue classification, increased 2.1%. Paint Stores Group's sales increase was due to higher architectural paint sales volume across most end market segments and the impact of the change in revenue classification. Price mix had a negligible impact on sales in the quarter, and protective and marine coatings sales were a significant drag on revenue growth.
Regionally, in the third quarter, our Canadian division led all divisions, followed by Southeastern division, Southwestern division, Midwest and Eastern division. Sales and volumes were positive in every division. 
Segment profit for the group increased $10.9 million or 2.1% to $518.3 million in the quarter as higher architectural paint and equipment sales volumes were partially offset by higher SG&A spending. Segment operating margin decreased 100 basis points to 23.3% of sales from 24.3% in the third quarter last year.
For our Latin America Coatings Group, third quarter net sales stated in U.S. dollars was $156.6 million, up $618,000, due primarily to higher year-over-year selling prices that were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and volume declines.
Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by $12.8 million or 8.2% in the quarter. Segment profit in the third quarter, stated in U.S. dollars, decreased $1.2 million or 54.6% to $1 million from $2.1 million in the same period last year. The negative impact from higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation was only partially offset by increased selling prices. Currency translation decreased segment profit $3.6 million in the quarter compared to the same period last year. As a percent of net sales, segment profit decreased to 60 basis points in the quarter compared to 1.4% in the third quarter 2015.
For our Consumer Group, sales decreased $8.7 million or 2.1% to $412.9 million from $421.6 million last year, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency translation and declining sales to certain retail accounts, commercial customers and in our European business. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment by $5 million or 1.2%. Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased $3.8 million or 4.3% to $92 million from $88.3 million last year, due to improved operating efficiencies and good SG&A expense control. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 22.3% from 20.9% in the same period last year. 
For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars decreased $5.4 million or 1.1% to $480.7 million in the quarter as unfavorable currency translation was partially offset by positive price mix. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for this segment by $7.1 million or 1.5% in the quarter. Segment profit in U.S. dollars increased $8 million or 14.6% in the quarter to $63.2 million from $55.1 million last year, due primarily to good SG&A expense control. Unfavorable currency translation decreased segment profit $0.5 million in the quarter. As a percent to net external sales, Global Finishes Group's segment profit increased to 13.1% from 11.3% in the quarter compared to last year. 
That concludes my recap of our results for the quarter. So I will turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for fourth quarter and full year. John?"

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our results for the third quarter include a number of unusual items that affect our revenues, expenses and tax rate. If you back out the impact of these items, our results on a comparable year",1730,"Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our results for the third quarter include a number of unusual items that affect our revenues, expenses and tax rate. If you back out the impact of these items, our results on a comparable year-over-year basis showed modest improvement.
Consolidated sales increased 1.7% to $3.2 billion. Consolidated gross margin was 50.9%, an increase of 100 basis points compared to the third quarter last year. Operating profit improved 1.9% to $591.8 million. Profit before tax grew 3.9% to $572.4 million, a 30 basis point increase as a percent of sales. Net income increased 6.2% to $397.9 million, and earnings per share increased 6.5% to $4.23 per share.
These results are consistent with the GAAP guidance ranges we provided for both revenue and earnings, but they fell short of what we envisioned at the start of the quarter. Revenue growth at the lower end of our low to mid-single-digit range was disappointing. And the ongoing investments we are making in new stores, sales territories, retail merchandising, advertising, training and store service weighed heavily on earnings, particularly in light of the slow revenue growth.
Our sales trend by quarter so far this year is similar to last year, with growth decelerating each quarter as we go through the year. At this point, it is unclear whether the midyear slowdown in sales over the past 2 years is a result of labor constraints in the construction trades or an indication that the housing cycle is slowing, which is contrary to what most of the data would suggest, or something else entirely. Whatever the reason for the slowdown, our response is the same: We will continue to make prudent investments in the things that drive our long-term growth and profitability.
Architectural paint sales to our Paint Stores Group, once again significantly outpaced revenue growth for the segment as a whole. High single-digit growth in the new residential and residential repaint contractor business was partially offset by a modest but unexpected year-over-year decline in DIY sales. Sales to commercial and health care customers also generated solid year-over-year growth, while the property management segment showed modest gains.
The outlook for continued growth in residential markets over the balance of the year and into 2017 remains positive, supported by very healthy order book trends reported by most of our contractor customers.
On the other hand, the revenue headwind from our protective and marine business in Paint Stores worsened sequentially in the third quarter. During the first 9 months of the year, Paint Stores Group opened 69 new stores and closed 14 redundant locations, completing our consolidation of redundant store locations acquired from Comex. Our plan for the year still calls for the store openings in a range of 90 to 100 net new locations. Today, our store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean stands at 4,141 compared to 4,048 a year ago. 
Finally, the upward inflection in input costs and operating expenses that we have seen in the recent months, including raw materials, wages and benefits, rent expense and more, warrant a price increase by our Paint Stores Group. Effective December 1, 2016, our Paint Stores Group will be implementing a price increase in the 4% to 5% range across most product lines. 
We also anticipated a stronger sales performance from our Consumer Group coming into the third quarter. We saw widespread weakness across our commercial, industrial and MRO customers. Our Ronseal brand business in Europe also had a soft quarter. Despite the weaker-than-expected sales results, the Consumer Group continued to show good progress on margins in the quarter.
Our Global Finishes Group did a commendable job of managing both gross margin and SG&A in the quarter, resulting in a 180 basis point operating margin improvement on modest sales declines. We continue to see positive demand momentum in some of our industrial coatings businesses, primarily in Europe and in Asia.
Finally, our Latin America Coatings Group reported positive revenue growth in the quarter for the first time in 12 quarters. Despite this improvement in revenue and volume momentum, margin pressure from raw materials and higher SG&A spending continued to challenge our profitability throughout the region.
Third quarter was a strong quarter for cash generation. Net operating cash in the first 9 months was $966.5 million, up about $64 million over last year, with third quarter accounting for about $456 million of the total. We're on pace again this year to generate net operating cash at a rate above 10% of net sales. We are at 10.7% year-to-date despite higher working capital.
9-month working capital ticked up slightly to 11.5% of sales from 11.1% last year. Free cash flow, which is net operating cash less CapEx and dividends, was $560 million compared to $557 million last year. Our capital expenditures year-to-date totaled $173.1 million. Depreciation was $128.3 million, and amortization was $20.2 million.
In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $170 million to $180 million and amortization of about $30 million. Capital spending will run higher than normal in 2016 as we complete some facility renovation projects.
During the quarter, we made no open market purchases of our common stock for treasury. On September 30, we had remaining board authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares. As indicated when we announced the Valspar acquisition, we intend to build cash on our balance sheet over the course of the year to reduce total borrowings required to close the deal, which will eliminate our share repurchase activity in 2016. As a result, our cash balance at the close of the third quarter 2016 was $702.6 million compared to $91 million on September 30, 2015.
Last week, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.84 per share, up 25% from $0.67 last year. The outlook for Paint Stores Group over the balance of the year remains positive, and we expect to see steady improvements from Consumer Group and Global Finishes Group. These positives will be offset, to some degree, by continued weakness in Latin America.
Over the balance of the year, the input cost tailwinds are likely to turn to headwinds, and the slower pace of sales growth is unlikely to fully offset our investment in new stores, territories and retail programs already in place. For the quarter, we anticipate our core consolidated net sales will increase a low single-digit percentage compared to last year's fourth quarter.
At this anticipated sales level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share. Fourth quarter 2016 earnings per share include costs related to the anticipated acquisition of Valspar totaling $0.71 per share and an increase in EPS of approximately $0.03 per share related to the decrease in the income tax provision. Excluding these items, fourth quarter EPS will be in the range of $2.13 to $2.23 per share compared to $2.12 per share earned in the fourth quarter of 2015.
For the full year 2016, we expect core consolidated net sales to increase by a low single-digit percentage compared to full year 2015. With annual sales at that level, we are updating our guidance for full year 2016 diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $11.30 to $11.40 per share.
Full year 2016 earnings per share includes costs related to the anticipated acquisition of Valspar totaling approximately $1.35 per share and an increase in EPS of approximately $0.40 per share related to the decrease in the income tax provision. Excluding these items, full year EPS will be in the range of $12.25 to $12.35 per share, a 10% increase at the midpoint of the range over the $11.16 per share earned in 2015.
Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to comment briefly on the other press release we issued this morning. Last week, our Board of Directors elected Al Mistysyn to serve as our next Chief Financial Officer, a position held for the past 15 years by Sean Hennessy. This change will take effect January 1, 2017.
I'd like to close my comments with a few words about my great friend, Sean Hennessy. My relationship with Sean spans our 30 years together at Sherwin-Williams. He's always been an excellent adviser, contributor and, importantly, friend. We traveled around the world together on many occasions, and Sean has regularly impressed me in so many ways. So it's no surprise that Sean has once again impressed me with his selfless decision to do what he believes to be right for his family. Sean's decision to step down from the day-to-day responsibilities of CFO in order to provide more time and flexibility to address family priorities is yet another example of the quality individual we've all grown to respect. We appreciate his willingness to stay on as Head of M&A Activities to provide support for the Valspar integration planning process and to ensure a smooth transition of CFO responsibilities.
This past year, I've spent more time with Sean than any other executive on my team, traveling with many of you to immerse myself in this important aspect of my job and to gain as much information as I could from Sean knowing this time was coming. While it's never a good time for a high-performing executive like Sean to leave such an important role, the timing of his decision sets us up well for the year ahead. 
Al Mistysyn's promotion to CFO is the natural conclusion of a long, careful and thoughtful development plan to prepare him for this position. Al has been Sean's right-hand man and the architect of many of our financial programs and successes. Al is my choice for this important position. He is a proven, seasoned executive. And I'm truly excited to have him on my side as we move forward. We've assembled a full Valspar integration team that has been hard at it for several months now, with Al actively involved on a daily basis. We're also in the process of building our operating plans and budgets for next year with each of our segment teams. And having Al at my side for these important meetings is crucial to his fast start.
With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And now we'll be happy to take your questions."

The more time I spend with our trainee class, the more I'm impressed with our ability to recruit such high-caliber people. So we've got confidence there. We've been able to negotiate good rents and leases with our track record. And we're becoming more and more a choice in these markets because of our ability to ensure the financial strength of the company and what we bring to the market. So we're actually in a very good place right now, and our focus continues to be on accelerating the performance of those new stores."

These previously immaterial amounts, we used to net them in SG&A. We determine that the billings for the customer should have been grossed up in sales with the payments to the contractors included in cost of goods sold. And for net immaterial impact on gross profit, it does reduce our gross margin and it does decrease our operating margin. And what we talked about is we did it prospectively in the third quarter. So we only booked it for the third quarter. Will do that in the fourth quarter. That will have a similar small impact and then in the first and second quarters of '17. So 2017 full year won't have any impact."
