I know it's been a busy day for all of you and it was a pretty straightforward quarter and year for us, actually. So I'm just going to have a few brief observations to share and then I'll turn it over to Rob. 
As you seen today, reported full year 2015 results with net income of $4.1 billion or $7.39 per diluted common shares and the return on average assets for the full year was 1.17%. On a pretty difficult revenue environment, PNC performed well by executing on our strategic priorities and as we said before, controlling the things that are in our power to control. I'd tell you, I even argued that the degree of difficulty in '15 was probably tougher than the year before, but again, we delivered a solid consistent results that you guys have good come to expect. 
In 2015, we grew loans, we had average deposits up 8%, we had fee income up 3% and noninterest income represented a higher percentage of our total revenue mix in '15 than in '14, which is an important priority for us. You will see we also maintained strong capital and liquidity positions even as we return more capital to shareholder through nrepurchases and higher dividends. And at the same time and importantly, we continue to control expenses well.
2015 was the third year in a row that we brough down expenses despite major ongoing investments in our businesses and infrastructure. In retail, we now have more than 375 branches using our universal banking model and we plan to convert another 100 or even more in 2016. 
In technology, we're in the late innings on our work to strengthen our core systems, fortify our cyber security and modernize applications. And once this is completed, this infrastructure is going to allow us to shift more of our spend to offense, focusing on consumer facing products and services. Additionally, we continue to make progress on our other strategic priorities, building a leading banking franchise in our underpenetrated markets and capturing more investable assets. 
 Now we've got a few highlights there on the slide and I'll be happy to take or talk more about these priorities during Q&A if you have specific questions. But as we look ahead into 2016, we do expect our strategic priorities are going to continue to drive growth in fee income. We have the right model, capabilities, culture and people to continue to manage what is on our power to control and to deliver for the customers, shareholders and communities that we serve. And I believe that we're well positioned particularly if the Fed continues to raise rates to generate positive operating leverage this year. 
Having said that, we're obviously concerned about the global volatility in markets that we've seen over the last few weeks and even today and the potential for that to directly impact the U.S. economy and the result in Fed actions. But I'm going to turn it over to Rob for to just take a closer look of our fourth quarter and full year results and give you a few additional thoughts on '16 before we take your questions. Rob?"
294585,315512671,918969,"The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 15, 2016",2016-01-15,"Earnings Calls","The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Overall, our full year and fourth quarter results played out largely consistent with our expectations. For the full year, we grew loans, deposits and fee income and reduce expenses even as we continue to invest in",2215,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Overall, our full year and fourth quarter results played out largely consistent with our expectations. For the full year, we grew loans, deposits and fee income and reduce expenses even as we continue to invest in technology and our businesses. In addition, we returned more capital to our shareholders while maintain strong capital levels. 
As a result, our 2015 net income was $4.1 billion or $7.39 per diluted common shares. Fourth quarter net income was $1 billion or $1.87 per diluted common share. 
Our balance sheet information is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. As you can see, total assets increased by $1.8 billion or 1% linked quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter a year ago, total assets grew by $21 billion or 6%, primarily reflecting increases in investment securities, loans and interest-earning assets, which includes balances held at the Federal Reserve for liquidity purposes. Total loans grew by $1.2 billion or 1% linked quarter, primarily due to growth in commercial real estate. 
It's worth noting that on a spot basis, total commercial lending grew $2.4 billion or 2%, primarily in PNC's real estate business, which includes an increase in multi family agency warehouse lending. For the year-over-year quarter, total loans increased by $3.1 billion or 2%. Again, driven by growth in commercial loans. Specifically, real estate and business credit as well as increased lending to our large corporate clients. 
Consumer lending decreased $396 million linked quarter as the decline in the nonstrategic consumer loan portfolio was somewhat offset by growth in credit card and auto lending. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, consumer lending was down $2.8 million or 4%, primarily due to the continued decline in nonstrategic home lending and lower educational loan balances. Again, partially offset by growth in credit cards. 
Investments securities were up $5.8 billion or 9% linked quarter and increased $13.6 billion or 25% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Portfolio purchases were comprised primarily of agency residential mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities. 
Our interest-earning deposits with the Federal Reserve were $31.5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, down from the third quarter as we reduced commercial paper outstandings and shifted some Fed deposits to higher yielding liquid assets. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, our interest-earning deposits with the Federal Reserve increased by $3.8 billion in support of our efforts to comply with the liquidity coverage standards. As of December 31, our estimated short-term liquidity coverage ratio exceeded 100% for both the bank and the bank holding company under the month-end calculation methodology. 
On the liability side, total deposits increased by $3.5 billion or 1% when compared to the third quarter, primarily driven by consumer deposit growth with an emphasis on savings products. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, total deposits increased by $17.5 billion or 8%. 
Turning to capital. As of December 31, 2015, our pro forma Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, fully phased-in and using the standardized approach, was estimated to be 10%, essentially flat linked quarter as we continue to return capital to shareholders through our dividends and share buybacks. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 5.8 million common shares for approximately $500 million. We are on track to meet our repurchase authorization of up to $2.875 billion for the 5-quarter period, which began April 1, 2015. Period and common shares us anywhere $504 million, down $19 million or 4% compared to the same time a year ago. 
Finally, our tangible book value reached $63.65 per common share as of December 31, a 6% increase compared to the same period a year ago. 
Turning to our income statement on Slide 5. Again, net income was $1 billion in the fourth quarter and $4.1 billion for the full year.  Our fourth quarter return on average assets was 1.12% and for the full year, it was 1.17%. In the fourth quarter, total revenue grew by $78 million or 2% compared to the third quarter as a result of higher net interest income and fee income. Core net interest income grew by $30 million or 1% compared to the third quarter, primarily driven by increased security balances and loan growth, while purchase accounting accretion was flat linked quarter due to greater than expected recoveries. For the full year 2015, purchase accounting accretion was down $164 million compared to 2014. This decline was somewhat less than expected due to higher header cash recoveries throughout the year. 
For 2016, we expect purchase accounting accretion to be down approximately $175 million compared to 2015. Total net interest margin was 2.7% in the fourth quarter, up 3 basis points linked quarter. Total noninterest income increased by $48 million or 3% compared to the third quarter, primarily driven by higher fee income. Total fee income grew by $27 million or 2% linked quarter due to growth in most categories, partially offset by lower fee revenue from residential mortgage and service charges on deposits. I'll have more to say about our fee income in a moment. 
Noninterest expense increased by $44 million or 2% linked quarter, largely due to higher business activity. Importantly, full year expenses were down $25 million. And as Bill mentioned, this marks the third straight year we reduced total expenses, while supporting significant investments in our business. So results were due in part to our continuous program or CIP. 
During 2015, we completed actions and exceeded our full-year goal of $500 million in cost savings. Looking forward to 2016, we have targeted an additional $400 million in cost savings through CIP, which we again expect to help fund a significant portion of our business and technology investments. 
Provision in the fourth quarter was $74 million, down $7 million or 9% from the third quarter, as overall credit quality remained relatively stable. 
Finally, our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 26.1%, up from 20% linked quarter as the third quarter reflected tax benefit. Our full year effective tax rate was 24.8%. 
Looking ahead, we expect our 2016 effective tax rate to be between 25% and 26%. As you can see on Slide 6, noninterest income as a percent of total revenue has steadily increased during the last 4 years and currently generates nearly half of our revenue. We have strategies in each of our lines of business to increase fee income across our franchise. 3 of our business activities, asset management, corporate and consumer services, each generated more than $1 billion in fee income in 2015 and their growth offset lower fee income from residential mortgage and service charges on deposits. 
For the full year, asset management fees increased by $54 million or 4% as a result of new primary client acquisition, net asset flows and positive market performance in the first half of the year. Full year 2015 results also benefited from a large trust settlement that occurred in the second quarter. 
On a linked quarter basis, asset management fees reflected stronger equity markets and increased by $23 million or 6% due to higher rankes from PNC's equity investment in Blackrock and new sales production. Assets under administration were $259 billion as of December 31, up $3 billion linked quarter, but lower than the $263 billion at the same time a year ago, largely reflecting equity market movements in both comparisons. 
Consumer service fees increased $81 million or 6% for the full year as a result of increased customer related debit, credit and merchant services activities along with higher brokerage income, all consistent with our strategy of growing share of wallet in retail. Reflecting this momentum, consumer services fees increased $8 million or 2% linked quarter due to higher merchant services and seasonally higher credit and debit card activity. 
Corporate services fees increased by $76 million or 5% in 2015 and included higher treasury management and commercial mortgage service fees. Our corporate and institutional business also saw a strong full year results in Capital Markets. On a linked quarter basis, corporate services fees increased by $10 million or 3%, primarily due to higher merger and acquisition advisory fees and higher loan syndications. 
Residential mortgage noninterest income declined by $52 million or 8% for the full year, primarily due to elevated secondary loan sales in 2014 that didn't repeat in 2015 as well as lower servicing fees. 
On a linked quarter basis, not residential mortgage fees decreased $12 million or 10%, primarily as a result of lower sales revenue and net hedging gains. Fourth quarter originations were $2.3 billion, down approximately $200 million or 8% compared to the same quarter a year ago, due in part to closing delays resulting from the implementation of new disclosure requirements. 
Service charges on deposits for the full year declined by $11 million or 2% and on a linked quarter basis, they were down $2 million or 1%. In both periods, the lower revenue was driven by evolving customer behavior and other changes. Lastly, full-year total other noninterest income decreased by $51 million or 4%, primarily due to a higher level of asset sales in 2014. Of note, gains from the sales of these Class B common shares were approximately $40 million less in 2015 compared to 2014. And on a linked quarter basis, total other noninterest income decreased by $21 million or 7%, primarily driven by asset sales. 
Turning to Slide 7. Overall credit quality remains relatively stable in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Nonperforming loans were down $51 million or 2% linked quarter, driven by improvements in the consumer lending portfolio, partially offset by increases in commercial loans. Total past 2 loans were down $23 million or 1% linked quarter, as we saw small declines in most categories. 
Net charge-offs of $120 million increased by $24 million due to higher growth charge off levels and lower recoveries compared to the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the net charge-off ratio was 23 basis points of average loans, up from 19 basis points in the prior quarter. Our provision of $74 million was down $7 million or 9% from the third quarter. Consistent with our previous disclosures during the fourth quarter, we implemented the de-recognition of $468 million in purchase credit impaired loan balances and the associated allowance for loan losses. These balances were related to loans that have been paid off, sold, foreclosed or have nominal value. 
Importantly, the exchange had no impact on EPS, the net carrying value of the pools or accretion accounting. The allowance for loans and lease losses to total loans is 1.32% as of December 31. This compares to 1.58% linked quarter and 1.63% at the same time a year ago. The decline in both periods was primarily attributable to the implementation of the de-recognition. 
We are cognizant of the volatility affecting the energy related in commodity sectors. That stated, not much has changed regarding our exposure since last quarter. Specifically on oil and gas, we have a total of $2.6 billion in outstanding, which is relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. This represents approximately 2% of our total commercial loan book. We have approximately $700 million in outstandings to energy and production companies, $1 billion to midstream and downstream and $900 million to oil services. Approximately $200 million of the service portfolio is not asset-based or investment-grade and this poses the greatest near-term risk, consistent with what we've been telling you in the last few quarters. 
We continue to experience some portfolio deterioration in the fourth quarter, though charge-offs were quite modest. And during the quarter, we increased our reserves to reflect the incremental impact of the continued decline in oil and gas prices. 
In summary, PNC posted fourth quarter and full-year earnings consistent with our expectations. Turning to 2016, we're obviously off to an unexpected rough start to the year relative to the global macro economy. However, our 2015 operating plan completed at the end of last year and prior to this recent volatility, assumes continued steady growth in GDP and a corresponding increase in short-term interest rates 3x this year, in March, June and December, with each increase being 25 basis points. Based on this assumptions, our full year 2016 guidance is for modest growth in revenue and stable expenses, which by definition positions us to deliver positive operating leverage. And as we said before, we continue to expect credit costs to normalize on a gradual basis. 
In regard to the recent economic conditions, we acknowledge it's unclear how long this conditions what may persist, but should they continue for a prolonged period, it will impact our plan and we will adjust accordingly. 
Looking ahead at the first quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 reported results. We expect spot loans to be up modestly, but average loans to be stable as the calculation of the average balances will be impacted by the de-recognition implementation. We expect net interest income to increase in the low single-digit range, we expect fee income to be down mid-single digits due to seasonality and typically lower first quarter client committee, we expect expenses to be down low single digits and we expect provision to be between $75 million and $125 million. 
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

We're 3 weeks into the year and so we're not going to bid a whole planning process until we see how it plays out. And as it plays out, we would give you, as we do all of these quarterly guidance, on what you might expect. I don't think -- as we've said before, that near-term pressures on rates and/or localized pressures on the economy are going to dramatically shift our investment profile, largely because we continue to be able to fund that profile through continuous improvement and hold costs in. So your broader question is, can we get the positive operating leverage, there's so many embedded assumptions on that in terms of what credit costs so and rates do and everything else, we'll have to see."

As we run our base case and the other thing that we've talked about in the past is that our base case typically, for a variety of reasons, ends up being lower than what we in fact produced in income. All of those things suggest that will have an opportunity to go back and be aggressive in terms of capital return until we see what actually comes out of the Fed in terms of instructions, that definition of aggressive will have to be rather vague at this point because as I've said, the fact where it ends today is really dependent on where we're going to end up post their stress scenario."

I know it's been a busy day for all of you and it was a pretty straightforward quarter and year for us, actually. So I'm just going to have a few brief observations to share and then I'll turn it over to Rob.
As you've seen today, we reported full year 2015 results with net income of $4.1 billion or $7.39 per diluted common share, and the return on average assets for the full year was 1.17%. In a pretty difficult revenue environment, PNC performed well by executing on our strategic priorities. And as we've said before, controlling the things that are in our power to control. I'd tell you, I'd even argue that the degree of difficulty in '15 was probably tougher than the year before, but again, we delivered the solid, consistent results that you guys have come to expect.
In 2015, we grew loans. We had average deposits up 8%. We had fee income up 3%. And noninterest income represented a higher percentage of our total revenue mix in '15 than in '14, which is an important priority for us. You will see we also maintained strong capital and liquidity positions even as we return more capital to shareholders through repurchases and higher dividends. And at the same time and importantly, we continue to control expenses well.
2015 was the third year in a row that we brought down expenses despite major ongoing investments in our businesses and infrastructure. In retail, we now have more than 375 branches using our universal banking model, and we plan to convert another 100 or even more in 2016.
In technology, we're in the late innings on our work to strengthen our core systems, fortify our cybersecurity and modernize applications. And once this is completed, this infrastructure is going to allow us to shift more of our spend to offense, focusing on consumer-facing products and services. Additionally, we continue to make progress on our other strategic priorities, building a leading banking franchise in our underpenetrated markets and capturing more investable assets.
Now we've got a few highlights there on the slide, and I'll be happy to take or talk more about these priorities during Q&A if you have specific questions. But as we look ahead into 2016, we do expect our strategic priorities are going to continue to drive growth in fee income. We have the right model, capabilities, culture and people to continue to manage what is in our power to control and to deliver for the customers, shareholders and communities that we serve. And I believe that we're well positioned, particularly if the Fed continues to raise rates, to generate positive operating leverage this year.
Having said that, we're obviously concerned about the global volatility in markets that we've seen over the last few weeks and even today and the potential for that to directly impact the U.S. economy and the resulting Fed actions. But I'm going to turn it over to Rob for now to just take a closer look at our fourth quarter and full year results and give you a few additional thoughts on '16 before we take your questions. Rob?"
294585,315512671,918993,"The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 15, 2016",2016-01-15,"Earnings Calls","The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone.

Overall, our full year and fourth quarter results played out largely consistent with our expectations. For the full year, we grew loans, deposits and fee income and reduced expenses even as we continue to invest in technology and our businesses. In addition, we returned more capital to our shareholders while maintaining strong capital levels.
As a result, our 2015 net income was $4.1 billion or $7.39 per diluted common share. Fourth quarter net income was $1 billion or $1.87 per diluted common share.
Our balance sheet information is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. As you can see, total assets increased by $1.8 billion or 1% linked quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter a year ago, total assets grew by $21 billion or 6%, primarily reflecting increases in investment securities, loans and interest-earning assets, which includes balances held at the Federal Reserve for liquidity purposes. Total loans grew by $1.2 billion or 1% linked quarter, primarily due to growth in commercial real estate.
It's worth noting that on a spot basis, total commercial lending grew $2.4 billion or 2%, primarily in PNC's real estate business, which includes an increase in multifamily agency warehouse lending. For the year-over-year quarter, total loans increased by $3.1 billion or 2%, again, driven by growth in commercial loans, specifically, real estate and business credit as well as increased lending to our large corporate clients.
Consumer lending decreased $396 million linked quarter as the decline in the nonstrategic consumer loan portfolio was somewhat offset by growth in credit card and auto lending. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, consumer lending was down $2.8 billion or 4%, primarily due to the continued decline in nonstrategic home lending and lower educational loan balances, again, partially offset by growth in credit card.
Investment securities were up $5.8 billion or 9% linked quarter and increased $13.6 billion or 25% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Portfolio purchases were comprised primarily of agency residential mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities.
Our interest-earning deposits with the Federal Reserve were $31.5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, down from the third quarter as we reduced commercial paper outstandings and shifted some Fed deposits to higher-yielding liquid assets. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, our interest-earning deposits with the Federal Reserve increased by $3.8 billion in support of our efforts to comply with the liquidity coverage standards. As of December 31, our estimated short-term liquidity coverage ratio exceeded 100% for both the bank and the bank holding company under the month-end calculation methodology.
On the liability side, total deposits increased by $3.5 billion or 1% when compared to the third quarter, primarily driven by consumer deposit growth with an emphasis on savings products. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, total deposits increased by $17.5 billion or 8%.
Turning to capital. As of December 31, 2015, our pro forma Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, fully phased-in and using the standardized approach, was estimated to be 10%, essentially flat linked quarter as we continue to return capital to shareholders through our dividends and share buybacks.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 5.8 million common shares for approximately $500 million. We are on track to meet our repurchase authorization of up to $2.875 billion for the 5-quarter period, which began April 1, 2015. Period end common shares outstanding were 504 million, down 19 million or 4% compared to the same time a year ago.
Finally, our tangible book value reached $63.65 per common share as of December 31, a 6% increase compared to the same period a year ago.
Turning to our income statement on Slide 5. Again, net income was $1 billion in the fourth quarter and $4.1 billion for the full year. Our fourth quarter return on average assets was 1.12%. And for the full year, it was 1.17%. In the fourth quarter, total revenue grew by $78 million or 2% compared to the third quarter as a result of higher net interest income and fee income. Core net interest income grew by $30 million or 1% compared to the third quarter, primarily driven by increased security balances and loan growth, while purchase accounting accretion was flat linked quarter due to greater-than-expected recoveries. For the full year 2015, purchase accounting accretion was down $164 million compared to 2014. This decline was somewhat less than expected due to higher cash recoveries throughout the year.
For 2016, we expect purchase accounting accretion to be down approximately $175 million compared to 2015. Total net interest margin was 2.7% in the fourth quarter, up 3 basis points linked quarter. Total noninterest income increased by $48 million or 3% compared to the third quarter, primarily driven by higher fee income. Total fee income grew by $27 million or 2% linked quarter due to growth in most categories, partially offset by lower fee revenue from residential mortgage and service charges on deposits. I'll have more to say about our fee income in a moment.
Noninterest expense increased by $44 million or 2% linked quarter, largely due to higher business activity. Importantly, full year expenses were down $25 million. And as Bill mentioned, this marks the third straight year we reduced total expenses, while supporting significant investments in our business. These results were due in part to our continuous improvement program or CIP.
During 2015, we completed actions and exceeded our full year goal of $500 million in cost savings. Looking forward to 2016, we have targeted an additional $400 million in cost savings through CIP, which we again expect to help fund a significant portion of our business and technology investments.
Provision in the fourth quarter was $74 million, down $7 million or 9% from the third quarter, as overall credit quality remained relatively stable.
Finally, our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 26.1%, up from 20% linked quarter as the third quarter reflected tax benefits. Our full year effective tax rate was 24.8%.
Looking ahead, we expect our 2016 effective tax rate to be between 25% and 26%. As you can see on Slide 6, noninterest income as a percent of total revenue has steadily increased during the last 4 years and currently generates nearly half of our revenue. We have strategies in each of our lines of business to increase fee income across our franchise. 3 of our business activities, asset management, corporate and consumer services, each generated more than $1 billion in fee income in 2015, and their growth offset lower fee income from residential mortgage and service charges on deposits.
For the full year, asset management fees increased by $54 million or 4% as a result of new primary client acquisition, net asset flows and positive market performance in the first half of the year. Full year 2015 results also benefited from a large trust settlement that occurred in the second quarter.
On a linked quarter basis, asset management fees reflected stronger equity markets and increased by $23 million or 6% due to higher earnings from PNC's equity investment in BlackRock and new sales production. Assets under administration were $259 billion as of December 31, up $3 billion linked quarter, but lower than the $263 billion at the same time a year ago, largely reflecting equity market movements in both comparisons.
Consumer service fees increased $81 million or 6% for the full year as a result of increased customer-related debit, credit and merchant services activity, along with higher brokerage income, all consistent with our strategy of growing share of wallet in retail. Reflecting this momentum, consumer services fees increased $8 million or 2% linked quarter due to higher merchant services and seasonally higher credit and debit card activity.
Corporate services fees increased by $76 million or 5% in 2015 and included higher treasury management and commercial mortgage service fees. Our corporate and institutional business also saw a strong full year result in Capital Markets. On a linked quarter basis, corporate services fees increased by $10 million or 3%, primarily due to higher merger and acquisition advisory fees and higher loan syndications.
Residential mortgage noninterest income declined by $52 million or 8% for the full year, primarily due to elevated secondary loan sales in 2014 that didn't repeat in 2015 as well as lower servicing fees.
On a linked quarter basis, residential mortgage fees decreased $12 million or 10%, primarily as a result of lower sales revenue and net hedging gains. Fourth quarter originations were $2.3 billion, down approximately $200 million or 8% compared to the same quarter a year ago, due in part to closing delays resulting from the implementation of new disclosure requirements.
Service charges on deposits for the full year declined by $11 million or 2%. And on a linked quarter basis, they were down by $2 million or 1%. In both periods, the lower revenue was driven by evolving customer behavior and product changes. Lastly, full year total other noninterest income decreased by $51 million or 4%, primarily due to a higher level of asset sales in 2014. Of note, gains from the sales of Visa Class B common shares were approximately $40 million less in 2015 compared to 2014. And on a linked quarter basis, total other noninterest income increased by $21 million or 7%, primarily driven by asset sales.
Turning to Slide 7. Overall credit quality remained relatively stable in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Nonperforming loans were down $51 million or 2% linked quarter, driven by improvements in the consumer lending portfolio, partially offset by increases in commercial loans. Total past due loans were down $23 million or 1% linked quarter, as we saw small declines in most categories.
Net charge-offs of $120 million increased by $24 million due to higher gross charge-off levels and lower recoveries compared to the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the net charge-off ratio was 23 basis points of average loans, up from 19 basis points in the prior quarter. Our provision of $74 million was down $7 million or 9% from the third quarter. Consistent with our previous disclosures, during the fourth quarter, we implemented the derecognition of $468 million in purchased credit-impaired loan balances and the associated allowance for loan losses. These balances were related to loans that have been paid off, sold, foreclosed or have nominal value.
Importantly, this change had no impact on EPS, the net carrying value of the pools or accretion accounting. The allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans is 1.32% as of December 31. This compares to 1.58% linked quarter and 1.63% at the same time a year ago. The decline in both periods was primarily attributable to the implementation of the derecognition.
We are cognizant of the volatility affecting the energy-related and commodity sectors. That stated, not much has changed regarding our exposure since last quarter. Specifically, on oil and gas, we have a total of $2.6 billion in outstandings, which is relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. This represents approximately 2% of our total commercial loan book. We have approximately $700 million in outstandings to energy and production companies, $1 billion to midstream and downstream and $900 million to oil services. Approximately $200 million of the services portfolio is not asset-based or investment-grade, and this poses the greatest near-term risk, consistent with what we've been telling you the last few quarters.
We continue to experience some portfolio deterioration in the fourth quarter, though charge-offs were quite modest. And during the quarter, we increased our reserves to reflect the incremental impact of the continued decline in oil and gas prices.
In summary, PNC posted fourth quarter and full year earnings consistent with our expectations. Turning to 2016, we're obviously off to an unexpected rough start to the year relative to the global macro economy. However, our 2016 operating plan completed at the end of last year and prior to this recent volatility assumes continued steady growth in GDP and a corresponding increase in short-term interest rates 3 times this year, in March, June and December, with each increase being 25 basis points. Based on these assumptions, our full year 2016 guidance is for modest growth in revenue and stable expenses, which by definition positions us to deliver positive operating leverage. And as we said before, we continue to expect credit cost to normalize on a gradual basis.
In regard to the recent economic conditions, we acknowledge it's unclear how long these conditions may persist, but should they continue for a prolonged period, it will impact our plan and we will adjust accordingly.
Looking ahead at the first quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 reported results. We expect spot loans to be up modestly, but average loans to be stable as the calculation of the average balances will be impacted by the derecognition implementation. We expect net interest income to increase in the low single-digit range. We expect fee income to be down mid-single digits due to seasonality and typically lower first quarter client activity. We expect expenses to be down low single digits, and we expect provision to be between $75 million and $125 million.
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

As we run our base case -- and the other thing that we've talked about in the past is that our base case, typically, for a variety of reasons, ends up being lower than what we, in fact, produce in income. All of those things suggest that we'll have an opportunity to go back and be aggressive in terms of capital-return ask until we see what actually comes out of the Fed in terms of instructions. That definition of aggressive will have to be rather vague at this point because as I said, despite the fact we're at 10% today, it's really dependent on where we're going to end up post their stress scenario."

I know it's been a busy day for all of you and it was a pretty straightforward quarter and year for us, actually. So I'm just going to have a few brief observations to share and then I'll turn it over to Rob.
As you've seen today, we reported full year 2015 results with net income of $4.1 billion or $7.39 per diluted common share, and the return on average assets for the full year was 1.17%. In a pretty difficult revenue environment, PNC performed well by executing on our strategic priorities. And as we've said before, controlling the things that are in our power to control. I'd tell you, I'd even argue that the degree of difficulty in '15 was probably tougher than the year before, but again, we delivered the solid, consistent results that you guys have come to expect.
In 2015, we grew loans. We had average deposits up 8%. We had fee income up 3%. And noninterest income represented a higher percentage of our total revenue mix in '15 than in '14, which is an important priority for us. You will see we also maintained strong capital and liquidity positions even as we return more capital to shareholders through repurchases and higher dividends. And at the same time and importantly, we continue to control expenses well.
2015 was the third year in a row that we brought down expenses despite major ongoing investments in our businesses and infrastructure. In retail, we now have more than 375 branches using our universal banking model, and we plan to convert another 100 or even more in 2016.
In technology, we're in the late innings on our work to strengthen our core systems, fortify our cybersecurity and modernize applications. And once this is completed, this infrastructure is going to allow us to shift more of our spend to offense, focusing on consumer-facing products and services. Additionally, we continue to make progress on our other strategic priorities, building a leading banking franchise in our underpenetrated markets and capturing more investable assets.
Now we've got a few highlights there on the slide, and I'll be happy to take or talk more about these priorities during Q&A if you have specific questions. But as we look ahead into 2016, we do expect our strategic priorities are going to continue to drive growth in fee income. We have the right model, capabilities, culture and people to continue to manage what is in our power to control and to deliver for the customers, shareholders and communities that we serve. And I believe that we're well positioned, particularly if the Fed continues to raise rates, to generate positive operating leverage this year.
Having said that, we're obviously concerned about the global volatility in markets that we've seen over the last few weeks and even today and the potential for that to directly impact the U.S. economy and the resulting Fed actions. But I'm going to turn it over to Rob for now to just take a closer look at our fourth quarter and full year results and give you a few additional thoughts on '16 before we take your questions. Rob?"
294585,315512671,919004,"The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 15, 2016",2016-01-15,"Earnings Calls","The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Overall, our full year and fourth quarter results played out largely consistent with our expectations.

Overall, our full year and fourth quarter results played out largely consistent with our expectations. For the full year, we grew loans, deposits and fee income and reduced expenses even as we continue to invest in technology and our businesses. In addition, we returned more capital to our shareholders while maintaining strong capital levels.
As a result, our 2015 net income was $4.1 billion or $7.39 per diluted common share. Fourth quarter net income was $1 billion or $1.87 per diluted common share.
Our balance sheet information is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. As you can see, total assets increased by $1.8 billion or 1% linked quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter a year ago, total assets grew by $21 billion or 6%, primarily reflecting increases in investment securities, loans and interest-earning assets, which includes balances held at the Federal Reserve for liquidity purposes. Total loans grew by $1.2 billion or 1% linked quarter, primarily due to growth in commercial real estate.
It's worth noting that on a spot basis, total commercial lending grew $2.4 billion or 2%, primarily in PNC's real estate business, which includes an increase in multifamily agency warehouse lending. For the year-over-year quarter, total loans increased by $3.1 billion or 2%, again, driven by growth in commercial loans, specifically, real estate and business credit as well as increased lending to our large corporate clients.
Consumer lending decreased $396 million linked quarter as the decline in the nonstrategic consumer loan portfolio was somewhat offset by growth in credit card and auto lending. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, consumer lending was down $2.8 billion or 4%, primarily due to the continued decline in nonstrategic home lending and lower educational loan balances, again, partially offset by growth in credit card.
Investment securities were up $5.8 billion or 9% linked quarter and increased $13.6 billion or 25% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Portfolio purchases were comprised primarily of agency residential mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities.
Our interest-earning deposits with the Federal Reserve were $31.5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, down from the third quarter as we reduced commercial paper outstandings and shifted some Fed deposits to higher-yielding liquid assets. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, our interest-earning deposits with the Federal Reserve increased by $3.8 billion in support of our efforts to comply with the liquidity coverage standards. As of December 31, our estimated short-term liquidity coverage ratio exceeded 100% for both the bank and the bank holding company under the month-end calculation methodology.
On the liability side, total deposits increased by $3.5 billion or 1% when compared to the third quarter, primarily driven by consumer deposit growth with an emphasis on savings products. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, total deposits increased by $17.5 billion or 8%.
Turning to capital. As of December 31, 2015, our pro forma Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, fully phased-in and using the standardized approach, was estimated to be 10%, essentially flat linked quarter as we continue to return capital to shareholders through our dividends and share buybacks.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 5.8 million common shares for approximately $500 million. We are on track to meet our repurchase authorization of up to $2.875 billion for the 5-quarter period, which began April 1, 2015. Period end common shares outstanding were 504 million, down 19 million or 4% compared to the same time a year ago.
Finally, our tangible book value reached $63.65 per common share as of December 31, a 6% increase compared to the same period a year ago.
Turning to our income statement on Slide 5. Again, net income was $1 billion in the fourth quarter and $4.1 billion for the full year. Our fourth quarter return on average assets was 1.12%. And for the full year, it was 1.17%. In the fourth quarter, total revenue grew by $78 million or 2% compared to the third quarter as a result of higher net interest income and fee income. Core net interest income grew by $30 million or 1% compared to the third quarter, primarily driven by increased security balances and loan growth, while purchase accounting accretion was flat linked quarter due to greater-than-expected recoveries. For the full year 2015, purchase accounting accretion was down $164 million compared to 2014. This decline was somewhat less than expected due to higher cash recoveries throughout the year.
For 2016, we expect purchase accounting accretion to be down approximately $175 million compared to 2015. Total net interest margin was 2.7% in the fourth quarter, up 3 basis points linked quarter. Total noninterest income increased by $48 million or 3% compared to the third quarter, primarily driven by higher fee income. Total fee income grew by $27 million or 2% linked quarter due to growth in most categories, partially offset by lower fee revenue from residential mortgage and service charges on deposits. I'll have more to say about our fee income in a moment.
Noninterest expense increased by $44 million or 2% linked quarter, largely due to higher business activity. Importantly, full year expenses were down $25 million. And as Bill mentioned, this marks the third straight year we reduced total expenses, while supporting significant investments in our business. These results were due in part to our continuous improvement program or CIP.
During 2015, we completed actions and exceeded our full year goal of $500 million in cost savings. Looking forward to 2016, we have targeted an additional $400 million in cost savings through CIP, which we again expect to help fund a significant portion of our business and technology investments.
Provision in the fourth quarter was $74 million, down $7 million or 9% from the third quarter, as overall credit quality remained relatively stable.
Finally, our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 26.1%, up from 20% linked quarter as the third quarter reflected tax benefits. Our full year effective tax rate was 24.8%.
Looking ahead, we expect our 2016 effective tax rate to be between 25% and 26%. As you can see on Slide 6, noninterest income as a percent of total revenue has steadily increased during the last 4 years and currently generates nearly half of our revenue. We have strategies in each of our lines of business to increase fee income across our franchise. 3 of our business activities, asset management, corporate and consumer services, each generated more than $1 billion in fee income in 2015, and their growth offset lower fee income from residential mortgage and service charges on deposits.
For the full year, asset management fees increased by $54 million or 4% as a result of new primary client acquisition, net asset flows and positive market performance in the first half of the year. Full year 2015 results also benefited from a large trust settlement that occurred in the second quarter.
On a linked quarter basis, asset management fees reflected stronger equity markets and increased by $23 million or 6% due to higher earnings from PNC's equity investment in BlackRock and new sales production. Assets under administration were $259 billion as of December 31, up $3 billion linked quarter, but lower than the $263 billion at the same time a year ago, largely reflecting equity market movements in both comparisons.
Consumer service fees increased $81 million or 6% for the full year as a result of increased customer-related debit, credit and merchant services activity, along with higher brokerage income, all consistent with our strategy of growing share of wallet in retail. Reflecting this momentum, consumer services fees increased $8 million or 2% linked quarter due to higher merchant services and seasonally higher credit and debit card activity.
Corporate services fees increased by $76 million or 5% in 2015 and included higher treasury management and commercial mortgage service fees. Our corporate and institutional business also saw a strong full year result in Capital Markets. On a linked quarter basis, corporate services fees increased by $10 million or 3%, primarily due to higher merger and acquisition advisory fees and higher loan syndications.
Residential mortgage noninterest income declined by $52 million or 8% for the full year, primarily due to elevated secondary loan sales in 2014 that didn't repeat in 2015 as well as lower servicing fees.
On a linked quarter basis, residential mortgage fees decreased $12 million or 10%, primarily as a result of lower sales revenue and net hedging gains. Fourth quarter originations were $2.3 billion, down approximately $200 million or 8% compared to the same quarter a year ago, due in part to closing delays resulting from the implementation of new disclosure requirements.
Service charges on deposits for the full year declined by $11 million or 2%. And on a linked quarter basis, they were down by $2 million or 1%. In both periods, the lower revenue was driven by evolving customer behavior and product changes. Lastly, full year total other noninterest income decreased by $51 million or 4%, primarily due to a higher level of asset sales in 2014. Of note, gains from the sales of Visa Class B common shares were approximately $40 million less in 2015 compared to 2014. And on a linked quarter basis, total other noninterest income increased by $21 million or 7%, primarily driven by asset sales.
Turning to Slide 7. Overall credit quality remained relatively stable in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Nonperforming loans were down $51 million or 2% linked quarter, driven by improvements in the consumer lending portfolio, partially offset by increases in commercial loans. Total past due loans were down $23 million or 1% linked quarter, as we saw small declines in most categories.
Net charge-offs of $120 million increased by $24 million due to higher gross charge-off levels and lower recoveries compared to the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the net charge-off ratio was 23 basis points of average loans, up from 19 basis points in the prior quarter. Our provision of $74 million was down $7 million or 9% from the third quarter. Consistent with our previous disclosures, during the fourth quarter, we implemented the derecognition of $468 million in purchased credit-impaired loan balances and the associated allowance for loan losses. These balances were related to loans that have been paid off, sold, foreclosed or have nominal value.
Importantly, this change had no impact on EPS, the net carrying value of the pools or accretion accounting. The allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans is 1.32% as of December 31. This compares to 1.58% linked quarter and 1.63% at the same time a year ago. The decline in both periods was primarily attributable to the implementation of the derecognition.
We are cognizant of the volatility affecting the energy-related and commodity sectors. That stated, not much has changed regarding our exposure since last quarter. Specifically, on oil and gas, we have a total of $2.6 billion in outstandings, which is relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. This represents approximately 2% of our total commercial loan book. We have approximately $700 million in outstandings to energy and production companies, $1 billion to midstream and downstream and $900 million to oil services. Approximately $200 million of the services portfolio is not asset-based or investment-grade, and this poses the greatest near-term risk, consistent with what we've been telling you the last few quarters.
We continue to experience some portfolio deterioration in the fourth quarter, though charge-offs were quite modest. And during the quarter, we increased our reserves to reflect the incremental impact of the continued decline in oil and gas prices.
In summary, PNC posted fourth quarter and full year earnings consistent with our expectations. Turning to 2016, we're obviously off to an unexpected rough start to the year relative to the global macro economy. However, our 2016 operating plan completed at the end of last year and prior to this recent volatility assumes continued steady growth in GDP and a corresponding increase in short-term interest rates 3 times this year, in March, June and December, with each increase being 25 basis points. Based on these assumptions, our full year 2016 guidance is for modest growth in revenue and stable expenses, which by definition positions us to deliver positive operating leverage. And as we said before, we continue to expect credit costs to normalize on a gradual basis.
In regard to the recent economic conditions, we acknowledge it's unclear how long these conditions may persist, but should they continue for a prolonged period, it will impact our plan and we will adjust accordingly.
Looking ahead at the first quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 reported results. We expect spot loans to be up modestly, but average loans to be stable as the calculation of the average balances will be impacted by the derecognition implementation. We expect net interest income to increase in the low single-digit range. We expect fee income to be down mid-single digits due to seasonality and typically lower first quarter client activity. We expect expenses to be down low single digits, and we expect provision to be between $75 million and $125 million.
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

As we run our base case -- and the other thing that we've talked about in the past is that our base case, typically, for a variety of reasons, ends up being lower than what we, in fact, produce in income. All of those things suggest that we'll have an opportunity to go back and be aggressive in terms of capital-return ask. Until we see what actually comes out of the Fed in terms of instructions, that definition of aggressive will have to be rather vague at this point because as I said, despite the fact we're at 10% today, it's really dependent on where we're going to end up post their stress scenario."

As you've all seen this morning, PNC reported net income of $943 million or $1.68 per diluted common share in the first quarter. Now that was down linked quarter and year-over-year as our results were impacted by weaker equity markets and lower Capital Markets activity, which impacted our fee revenues as well as continued pressures across the energy industry, which resulted in higher-than-expected loan-loss provisions.
In addition to normal seasonality, the weaker equity markets impacted the equity earnings that we see from our investment in BlackRock, whose results you've already likely seen today. And while our overall asset quality remained relatively stable, our loan loss provision did increase $78 million to $152 million this quarter. Now this increase is primarily related to reserves for our oil and gas and coal exposure. In spite of these factors, it was a pretty solid quarter for PNC as we continue to focus on the execution of our strategic priorities. We grew loans and deposits on a spot basis this quarter. You saw the net interest income increased linked quarter driven by growth in core NII. And importantly, noninterest expenses were down about 5% due to seasonally lower business activity but also our ongoing focus on disciplined expense management.
We also saw a good momentum in some of our businesses. In the corporate institutional bank, we saw continued year-over-year growth in treasury management as we benefit from new customer wins, strong growth trends and corporate payments and repricing activities.
We also maintain momentum in our other penetrated markets, particularly cross Southeast and Chicago, where we are building high-quality customer-driven franchises. Wins in the core middle market and cross sell demonstrate the efficacy of our model. Now within our retail bank, we saw good year-over-year and linked quarter growth in earnings, and we continue to see improved efficiency within the business as we execute ongoing strategy to reinvent the Retail Banking experience with more customers migrate into non-branch channels for most of the transactions and expansion of our universal branch model.
It's a decent quarter for Asset Management Group also. Inside this business, feel income was down just 4% linked quarter and 2% year-over-year despite the weakness in the equity markets during the quarter. Meanwhile, AUA actually ticked up during the quarter as we continue to seek positive flows.
At the same time, however, despite an increase in NII this quarter, we continue to be impacted by interest rates that remain near all-time lows, and we have had to adjust to the reality of at least 1 less rate hike in 2016 than we previously forecasted. Now Rob will have more to say about that in a few minutes.
But on the whole, although this quarter will be reported as a miss, we were solid in terms of our execution against the things that are in our power to control. Despite the hits to provision this quarter, beyond the energy book and certain exposures in the steel industry, we don't see negative trends in other areas of credit. In fact, our total nonperforming assets have declined by about $200 million year-over-year. And our core businesses performed well relative to market conditions and the ongoing interest rate environment.
Now Rob will speak to the guidance, but I would say as we look out of the landscape condition support our view that the fundamentals remain solid in the U.S. economy. The labor market continues to improve and the tight job markets can eventually lead business to raise wages, which should in turn support consumer spending. Also, we see housing and commercial construction offsetting from trade and the downturn and energy production.
Within our businesses, we continue to make progress against each of our strategic priorities. We are working hard to continuously improve the customer experience across our lines of business, and I am confident in our long-term ability to continue to create value for our shareholders.
And with that, I will turn it over to Rob for closer look at our first quarter results and then we'll take your questions."
294585,325760777,958713,"The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 14, 2016",2016-04-14,"Earnings Calls","The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. PNC's first quarter net income was $943 million or $1.68 per diluted common share. First quarter results reflected the expected seasonal decline in business activity. However, as Bill mentioned, results were also",2151,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. PNC's first quarter net income was $943 million or $1.68 per diluted common share. First quarter results reflected the expected seasonal decline in business activity. However, as Bill mentioned, results were also adversely affected by weaker equity markets, lower capital markets activity and energy portfolio pressures. Offsetting these items were growth in net interest income and strong expense management.
Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. Commercial lending was up $2 billion or 2% from the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting growth in commercial real estate along with increases in large corporate loans.
Average consumer lending declined by $865 million or 1% linked quarter, in part due to the year-end derecognition of purchase impaired loans as well as decreases in home equity and education loans.
Investment securities were up $2.4 billion or 4% linked quarter and increased $13.1 billion or 23% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Portfolio purchases were comprised primarily of agency residential mortgage-backed securities and other liquid debt and asset-backed securities.
Our interest-earning deposits with the Federal Reserve averaged $25.5 billion for the quarter, down $6 billion from the fourth quarter as we shifted from Fed deposits to higher-yielding assets.
On the liability side, total deposits declined by $803 million or less than 1% when compared to the fourth quarter as growth in consumer deposits was more than offset by seasonally lower commercial deposits.
Of note, consumer savings deposits increased by $5.5 billion linked quarter, reflecting our strategy toward relationship based savings products. Total equity remains stable in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Retained earnings and higher AOCI were essentially offset by common share repurchases.
Turning to capital. As of March 31, 2016, our pro forma Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, fully phased in and using the standardized approach, was estimated to be 10.1%, essentially flat linked quarter as we continue to return capital to shareholders through our dividends and share buybacks.
During the first quarter, we repurchased 5.9 million common shares for approximately $500 million. As a result, period end common shares outstanding were $499 million, down $21 million or 4% compared to the same time a year ago. For the fourth quarter period that ended March 31, 2016, our total payout ratio, including dividends and buybacks under the current share repurchase program was 85%.
Finally, our tangible book value reached $65.15 per common share as of March 31, a 6% increase compared to the same time a year ago.
As you can see on Slide 5, net income was $943 million. Highlights include the following: net interest income increased by $6 million linked quarter despite a lower day count, driven by growth of $10 million in core net interest income. Noninterest income was $1.6 billion, a decrease of $194 million or 11% linked quarter. This decline was primarily driven by weaker equity markets and lower Capital Markets activity, along with seasonally lower client revenue.
Noninterest expense increased by $150 million or 5% compared to the fourth quarter. Expenses continue to be well managed due in part to our continuous improvement program. However, expenses also declined as a result of lower business activity. Provision expense in the first quarter was $152 million, an increase of $78 million compared with the fourth quarter due to certain energy-related loans, which I'll discuss in more detail in a few minutes.
Finally, our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 23.5%, down from 26.1% rate in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 25%.
Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to net interest income on Slide 6. Core net interest income increased by $10 million linked quarter, primarily driven by higher loan and security balances and higher loan yields, partially offset by the impact of the consistently low interest rate and 1 less day in the quarter.
Purchase accounting accretion declined by $4 million linked quarter. For 2016, we continue to expect purchase accounting accretion to be down approximately $175 million compared to 2015. Net interest margin was 2.75%, an increase of 5 basis points compared to the fourth quarter. This was primarily due to the impact of lower Fed deposits and higher loan balances and yields.
Turning to noninterest income on Slide 7. In addition to normal seasonality, which typically impacts the first quarter, weaker equity markets and lower Capital Markets activity contributed further to the linked quarter decline of $194 million.
Asset management fees, which includes earnings from our equity investment in Black Rock, were down $58 million or 15% on a linked quarter basis. Of that amount, PNC's Asset Management Group represents $8 million of the decline.
Despite the decline in the equity markets, discretionary client assets under management increased by $1 billion linked quarter to $135 billion, reflecting solid net flows. Consumer services fees and deposit services charges were both lower compared to fourth quarter results, reflecting seasonally lower client activity.
Within consumer services, brokerage fees increased 4% linked quarter driven by account activity and growth. Compared to the first quarter of last year, consumer services fees grew by $26 million or 8%, with growth in all categories. Highlights include increased debit and credit card activity, along with higher brokerage income, all consistent with our efforts to meet the broad financial needs of our customers.
Service charges on deposits increased by $5 million or 3% compared to the same period a year ago, driven by higher customer activity. Corporate services fees declined by $69 million or 18% compared with the fourth quarter results which are typically strong. However, beyond seasonality, this category was also affected by lower activity levels in the broader Capital Markets. As a result, first quarter results were also lower year-over-year.
On the positive side, we saw good trends in our treasury management business on a year-over-year basis, and we expect that to continue to driven by strong customer relationships and new products.
Residential mortgage, noninterest income defined by $13 million or 12% linked quarter, most of the decrease was driven by our hedging results. Mortgage originations were down compared to the fourth quarter due in part to closing delays resulting from the implementation of new disclosure requirements. However, servicing fees increased both linked quarter and compared to the same quarter a year ago.
Other noninterest income decreased by $30 million or 9% linked quarter, primarily due to lower gains on asset dispositions. We also had slightly lower gains on the sale of Visa stock.
Going forward, we would expect this year's quarterly run rate for other noninterest income to be in the range of $225 million to $275 million, excluding net securities and fee for gains. In summary, despite weaker equity market and lower capital market activity in the first quarter, we continue to believe that our underlying transfer fee income are favorable, and we expect that to continue due to a strong new business pipeline.
Turning to expenses on Slide 8, first quarter level decreased by $115 million or 5%, reflecting our continued focus on disciplined expense management, along with those seasonal and lower market-related business activities.
The decline linked quarter was primarily due to lower variable compensation and employee benefits. As we previously stated, our continuous improvement program has a goal to reduce costs by $400 million in 2016. We're 1 quarter of the way through the year and we've already completed actions to capture more than 1/3 of our annual goal.
We remain confident that we'll achieve our for your target. Through this program, we intend to help fund the significant investment we are continuing to make in our technology and business infrastructure throughout the year. As a result, we continue to expect that our full year 2016 expenses will remain stable to 2015 levels.
Turning to Slide 9. Overall, we view our firm wide credit quality as relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter as improvements in our consumer loan and commercial real estate portfolios were offset by deterioration in our energy portfolio. Total delinquencies, including the impact of energy loans, continue to decline on both the year-over-year and linked quarter basis. In addition, it's important to note that many of our customers benefit from lower energy prices.
With the graph on Slide 9 depict is the impact on our credit metrics both energy-related loans as well as our nonenergy related portfolio. Nonperforming loans increased by $155 million or 7% linked quarter as $259 million of new nonperforming energy loans were partially offset by $104 million net reduction in nonenergy related commercial and consumer portfolios.
On a year-over-year basis, nonperforming loans decreased by $124 million or 5% even with the impact of managing nonperforming loans. Provision for credit losses increased by $78 million linked quarter and totaled $152 million. Over half of which was energy-related.
Nonenergy provision increased by $21 million, reflecting the continuing normalization over the historically and in our view unsustainably low levels we experienced throughout 2015.
Net charge-offs increased to $149 million in the quarter, resulting in a net charge-off ratio of 29 basis points. Energy-related charge-offs represented approximately 17% of losses and the remainder was due to consistent level of charge-offs for home equity, credit card and other commercial loans in the linked quarter comparison.
Now let's take a deeper look at our energy.
We view our energy portfolio, which represents 1.6% of our total outstanding loans as well defined and properly reserved. As you can see on Slide 10, at the end of the first quarter, we had total outstandings of $2.7 billion in oil and gas and $535 million in coal. Total outstandings in our oil and gas portfolio are up 4% on a linked quarter basis but down 5% compared to the first quarter of last year.
Breaking down the portfolio, we have approximately $800 million in outstandings to upstream exploration and production companies, $1 billion to midstream and downstream companies and $900 million to oil field services.
We believe this mix is favorable relative to others in the industry. As you know, our focus remains on the services book, and while we have seen some pressure on this portfolio, approximately $700 million or almost 80% of the $900 million is asset based, which by definition is collateralized. As of March 31, 2016, our loan loss reserves for oil and gas represented 5% of outstandings in this portfolio. This reserves include the impact of the recently completed share national credits. Utilization levels for oil and gas have remained fairly constant. There were 34% as of March 31 of this year, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter and the same time a year ago.
Total unused commitments were $5.4 billion as of March 31 of this year. Redetermination of the borrowing basis for E&P loans is ongoing and we would expect to see continued reductions in line as a result.
Approximately 38% of our oil and gas loans are criticized, up from 28% linked quarter. Turning to coal, our portfolio significantly contributed to our provision this quarter. Going forward, however, while coal prices remain under pressure, our overall portfolio is small and our remaining risk is concentrated in a handful of specific credits. Our reserve against this portfolio is 15% and criticize balance as represented approximately 37% of outstandings, up from 27% linked quarter.
Lastly, in regard to our overall energy portfolio, we continue to monitor market conditions as well as consequential impacts the other businesses. If energy prices remain pressured, this will continue to affect our provision.
In summary, PNC posted a solid first quarter driven by higher net interest income and strong expense management. Offsetting this weaker equity markets, lowered equity markets activity, energy pressures and seasonality. Looking ahead, we believe the economy will continue to grow at a steady pace, based on an improving labor market and solid overall economic trends.
Because of this, our current forecast anticipates that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates in both June and December, with each increase being 25 basis points.
Our full year 2016 guidance continues to call for modest growth in revenue and stable expenses, which by definition positions us to deliver positive operating leverage. Looking ahead at the second quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter reported results, we expect modest growth in loans, we expect modest increases in net interest income; we expect fee income to be up 10% to 12%, reflecting the higher anticipated business levels in the second quarter; we expect expenses to be up in the mid-single digits, primarily as a result of the higher anticipated business activity as well as seasonality; and expect provision to be between $125 million and $175 million, which reflects our view of continued near-term energy pressures.
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

As they go back into the normal range of what they had had, which they expect, you get to a 10% kind of number, maybe a little better. Our asset business is probably in the mid-to high single digits based on the pipeline. So asset management because it's weighted more towards BlackRock in terms of the second quarter in that range. Secondly, the corporate services is probably growing double-digit. If you take a look into that, our M&A business, our markets related were down. Business pipelines are very strong there so we would expect that to grow within the guidance range.

As you've all seen this morning, PNC reported net income of $943 million or $1.68 per diluted common share in the first quarter. Now that was down linked quarter and year-over-year, as our results were impacted by weaker equity markets and lower Capital Markets activity, which impacted our fee revenues as well as continued pressures across the energy industry, which resulted in higher-than-expected loan loss provision.
In addition to normal seasonality, the weaker equity markets impacted the equity earnings that we receive from our investment in BlackRock, whose results you've likely already seen today. And while our overall asset quality remained relatively stable, our loan loss provision did increase $78 million to $152 million this quarter. Now this increase is primarily related to reserves for our oil and gas and coal exposure. 
In spite of these factors, it was a pretty solid quarter for PNC as we continued to focus on the execution of our strategic priorities. We grew loans and deposits on a spot basis this quarter. You saw that net interest income increased linked quarter, driven by growth in core NII. And importantly, noninterest expenses were down about 5% due to seasonally lower business activity but also our ongoing focus on disciplined expense management.
We also saw a good momentum at some of our businesses. In the corporate and institutional bank, we saw continued year-over-year growth in treasury management as we benefit from new customer wins, strong growth trends in corporate payments and repricing activities.
We also maintained momentum in our under-penetrated markets, particularly cross the Southeast and Chicago, where we are building high-quality customer-driven franchises. Wins in the core middle market and cross-sell demonstrate the efficacy of our model. Now within our retail bank, we saw good year-over-year and linked-quarter growth in earnings, and we continued to see improved efficiency within the business as we execute our ongoing strategy to reinvent the Retail Banking experience, with more customers migrating to non-branch channels for most of their transactions and the expansion of our universal branch model.
It was a decent quarter for our Asset Management Group also. Inside this business, fee income was down just 4% linked quarter and 2% year-over-year despite the weakness in the equity markets during the quarter. Meanwhile, AUA actually ticked up during the quarter as we continued to see positive flows.
At the same time, however, despite an increase in NII this quarter, we continued to be impacted by interest rates that remain near all-time lows, and we have had to adjust to the reality of at least one less rate hike in 2016 than we'd previously forecast. Now Rob will have more to say about that in a few minutes.
But on the whole, although this quarter will be reported as a miss, we were solid in terms of our execution against the things that are in our power to control. Despite the hit to provision this quarter, beyond the energy book and certain exposures in the steel industry, we don't see negative trends in other areas of credit. In fact, our total nonperforming assets have declined by about $200 million year-over-year, and our core businesses performed well relative to market conditions and the ongoing interest rate environment.
Now Rob will speak to the details of our guidance, but I would say, as we look out at the landscape, the conditions support our view that the fundamentals remain solid in the U.S. economy. The labor market continues to improve, and the tight job market's going to eventually lead businesses to raise wages, which should, in turn, support consumer spending. Also, we see housing and commercial construction offsetting drags from trade and the downturn in energy production.
Within our businesses, we continue to make progress against each of our strategic priorities. We are working hard to continuously improve the customer experience across our lines of business, and I am confident in our long-term ability to continue to create value for our shareholders.
And with that, I will turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our first quarter results, and then we'll take your questions."
294585,325760777,958783,"The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 14, 2016",2016-04-14,"Earnings Calls","The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. PNC's first quarter net income was $943 million or $1.68 per diluted common share. First quarter results reflected the expected seasonal declines in business activity. However, as Bill mentioned, results were also",2141,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. PNC's first quarter net income was $943 million or $1.68 per diluted common share. First quarter results reflected the expected seasonal declines in business activity. However, as Bill mentioned, results were also adversely affected by weaker equity markets, lower capital markets activity and energy portfolio pressures. Offsetting these items were growth in net interest income and strong expense management.
Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. Commercial lending was up $2 billion or 2% from the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting growth in commercial real estate along with increases in large corporate loans.
Average consumer lending declined by $865 million or 1% linked quarter, in part due to the year-end derecognition of purchase-impaired loans as well as decreases in home equity and education loans.
Investment securities were up $2.4 billion or 4% linked quarter and increased $13.1 billion or 23% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Portfolio purchases were comprised primarily of agency residential mortgage-backed securities and other liquid debt and asset-backed securities.
Our interest-earning deposits with the Federal Reserve averaged $25.5 billion for the quarter, down $6 billion from the fourth quarter, as we shifted from Fed deposits to higher-yielding assets.
On the liabilities side, total deposits declined by $803 million or less than 1% when compared to the fourth quarter, as growth in consumer deposits was more than offset by seasonally lower commercial deposits.
Of note, consumer savings deposits increased by $5.5 billion linked quarter, reflecting our strategy toward relationship-based savings products. Total equity remained stable in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Retained earnings and higher AOCI were essentially offset by common share repurchases.
Turning to capital. As of March 31, 2016, our pro forma Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, fully phased in and using the standardized approach, was estimated to be 10.1%, essentially flat linked quarter, as we continued to return capital to shareholders through our dividends and share buybacks.
During the first quarter, we repurchased 5.9 million common shares for approximately $500 million. As a result, period-end common shares outstanding were 499 million, down 21 million or 4% compared to the same time a year ago. For the 4-quarter period that ended March 31, 2016, our total payout ratio, including dividends and buybacks under the current share repurchase program, was 85%.
Finally, our tangible book value reached $65.15 per common share as of March 31, a 6% increase compared to the same time a year ago.
As you can see on Slide 5, net income was $943 million. Highlights include the following: net interest income increased by $6 million linked quarter despite a lower day count, driven by growth of $10 million in core net interest income. Noninterest income was $1.6 billion, a decrease of $194 million or 11% linked quarter. This decline was primarily driven by weaker equity markets and lower Capital Markets activity, along with seasonally lower client revenue.
Noninterest expense decreased by $115 million or 5% compared to the fourth quarter. Expenses continued to be well managed due in part to our continuous improvement program. However, expenses also declined as a result of lower business activity. Provision expense in the first quarter was $152 million, an increase of $78 million compared with the fourth quarter, due to certain energy-related loans, which I'll discuss in more detail in a few minutes.
Finally, our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 23.5%, down from the 26.1% rate in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 25%.
Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to net interest income on Slide 6. Core net interest income increased by $10 million linked quarter, primarily driven by higher loan and securities balances and higher loan yields, partially offset by the impact of the consistently low interest rates and one less day in the quarter.
Purchase accounting accretion declined by $4 million linked quarter. For 2016, we continue to expect purchase accounting accretion to be down approximately $175 million compared to 2015. Net interest margin was 2.75%, an increase of 5 basis points compared to the fourth quarter. This was primarily due to the impact of lower Fed deposits and higher loan balances and yields.
Turning to noninterest income on Slide 7. In addition to normal seasonality, which typically impacts the first quarter, weaker equity markets and lower Capital Markets activity contributed further to the linked-quarter decline of $194 million.
Asset management fees, which includes earnings from our equity investment in BlackRock, were down $58 million or 15% on a linked-quarter basis. Of that amount, PNC's Asset Management Group represents $8 million of the decline.
Despite the decline in the equity markets, discretionary client assets under management increased by $1 billion linked quarter to $135 billion, reflecting solid net flows. Consumer services fees and deposit services charges were both lower compared to fourth quarter results, reflecting seasonally lower client activity.
Within consumer services, brokerage fees increased 4% linked quarter, driven by account activity and growth. Compared to the first quarter of last year, consumer services fees grew by $26 million or 8%, with growth in all categories. Highlights include increased debit and credit card activity along with higher brokerage income, all consistent with our efforts to meet the broad financial needs of our customers.
Service charges on deposits increased by $5 million or 3% compared to the same period a year ago, driven by higher customer activity. Corporate services fees declined by $69 million or 18% compared to fourth quarter results which are typically strong. However, beyond seasonality, this category was also affected by lower activity levels in the broader capital markets. As a result, first quarter results were also lower year-over-year.
On the positive side, we saw good trends in our treasury management business on a year-over-year basis, and we expect that to continue, driven by strong customer relationships and new products.
Residential mortgage noninterest income declined by $13 million or 12% linked quarter. Most of the decrease was driven by our hedging results. Mortgage originations were down compared to the fourth quarter, due in part to closing delays resulting from the implementation of new disclosure requirements. However, servicing fees increased both linked quarter and compared to the same quarter a year ago.
Other noninterest income decreased by $30 million or 9% linked quarter, primarily due to lower gains on asset dispositions. We also had slightly lower gains on the sale of Visa stock.
Going forward, we would expect this year's quarterly run rate for other noninterest income to be in the range of $225 million to $275 million, excluding net securities and Visa gains. 
In summary, despite weaker equity markets and lower capital markets activity in the first quarter, we continue to believe that our underlying trends for fee income are favorable, and we expect that to continue due to a strong new business pipeline.
Turning to expenses on Slide 8. First quarter levels decreased by $115 million or 5%, reflecting our continued focus on disciplined expense management, along with those seasonal and lower market-related business activities. The decline linked quarter was primarily due to lower variable compensation and employee benefits. 
As we've previously stated, our continuous improvement program has a goal to reduce costs by $400 million in 2016. We're 1 quarter of the way through the year, and we've already completed actions to capture more than 1/3 of our annual goal.
We remain confident we will achieve our full year target. Through this program, we intend to help fund the significant investments we are continuing to make in our technology and business infrastructure throughout the year. As a result, we continue to expect that our full year 2016 expenses will remain stable to 2015 levels.
Turning to Slide 9. Overall, we view our firm-wide credit quality as relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter, as improvements in our consumer loan and commercial real estate portfolios were offset by deterioration in our energy portfolio. Total delinquencies, including the impact of energy loans, continue to decline on both a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. In addition, it's important to note that many of our customers benefit from lower energy prices.
What the graphs on Slide 9 depict is the impact on our credit metrics of both energy-related loans as well as our nonenergy-related portfolio. Nonperforming loans increased by $155 million or 7% linked quarter as $259 million of new nonperforming energy loans were partially offset by $104 million net reduction in nonenergy-related commercial and consumer portfolios.
On a year-over-year basis, nonperforming loans decreased by $124 million or 5%, even with the impact of the energy nonperforming loans. Provision for credit losses increased by $78 million linked quarter and total $152 million, over half of which was energy-related.
Nonenergy provision increased by $21 million, reflecting the continuing normalization over the historically and, in our view, unsustainably low levels we experienced throughout 2015.
Net charge-offs increased to $149 million in the quarter, resulting in a net charge-off ratio of 29 basis points. Energy-related charge-offs represented approximately 17% of losses and the remainder was due to consistent levels of charge-offs for home equity, credit card and other commercial loans in the linked-quarter comparison.
Now let's take a deeper look at our energy book.
We view our energy portfolio, which represents 1.6% of our total outstanding loans, as well defined and properly reserved. As you can see on Slide 10, at the end of the first quarter, we had total outstandings of $2.7 billion in oil and gas and $535 million in coal. Total outstandings in our oil and gas portfolio were up 4% on a linked-quarter basis but down 5% compared to the first quarter of last year.
Breaking down the portfolio, we have approximately $800 million in outstandings to upstream exploration and production companies, $1 billion to midstream and downstream companies and $900 million to oilfield services. We believe this mix is favorable relative to others in the industry. 
As you know, our focus remains on the services book. And while we have seen some pressure on this portfolio, approximately $700 million or almost 80% of the $900 million is asset-based, which, by definition, is collateralized. As of March 31, 2016, our loan loss reserves for oil and gas represented 5% of outstandings in this portfolio. These reserves include the impact of the recently completed Shared National Credit exam. Utilization levels for oil and gas have remained fairly constant. They were at 34% as of March 31 of this year, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter and the same time a year ago.
Total unused commitments were $5.4 billion as of March 31 of this year. Redetermination of the borrowing basis for E&P loans is ongoing, and we would expect to see continued reductions in lines as a result.
Approximately 38% of our oil and gas loans are criticized, up from 28% linked quarter. 
Turning to coal, our portfolio significantly contributed to our provision this quarter. Going forward, however, while coal prices remain under pressure, our overall portfolio is small and our remaining risk is concentrated in a handful of specific credits. Our reserve against this portfolio is 15% and criticized balances represent approximately 37% of outstandings, up from 27% linked quarter.
Lastly, in regard to our overall energy portfolio, we continue to monitor market conditions as well as consequential impacts to other businesses. If energy prices remain pressured, this will continue to affect our provision.
In summary, PNC posted a solid first quarter driven by higher net interest income and strong expense management. Offsetting this were weaker equity markets, lower capital markets activity, energy pressures and seasonality. 
Looking ahead, we believe the economy will continue to grow at a steady pace, based on an improving labor market and solid overall economic trends. Because of this, our current forecast anticipates that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates in both June and December, with each increase being 25 basis points.
Our full year 2016 guidance continues to call for modest growth in revenue and stable expenses, which, by definition, positions us to deliver positive operating leverage. Looking ahead at the second quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter reported results, we expect modest growth in loans, we expect modest increases in net interest income; we expect fee income to be up 10% to 12%, reflecting the higher anticipated business levels in the second quarter; we expect expenses to be up in the mid-single digits, primarily as a result of the higher anticipated business activity as well as seasonality; and we expect provision to be between $125 million and $175 million, which reflects our view of continued near-term energy pressures.
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

Our asset management business is probably in the mid- to high single digits based on the pipeline, so asset management, because it's weighted more toward BlackRock in terms of the second quarter in that range. Secondly, the corporate services is probably growing double digit. As you -- if you take a look into that, our M&A business, our markets-related were down. Business pipelines are very strong there, so we would expect that to grow within the guidance range. Consumer services, which has been growing year-over-year, we expect that to continue probably in the mid- to high single digits that we've experienced.

You might see it simply for when somebody wants to make a payment they don't want to wait a day on. Whether or not that takes some or all of the volume off of ACH through time, we'll wait and see.

As you've all seen this morning, PNC reported net income of $943 million or $1.68 per diluted common share in the first quarter. Now that was down linked quarter and year-over-year, as our results were impacted",690,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everybody. As you've all seen this morning, PNC reported net income of $943 million or $1.68 per diluted common share in the first quarter. Now that was down linked quarter and year-over-year, as our results were impacted by weaker equity markets and lower Capital Markets activity, which impacted our fee revenues as well as continued pressures across the energy industry, which resulted in higher-than-expected loan loss provision.
In addition to normal seasonality, the weaker equity markets impacted the equity earnings that we receive from our investment in BlackRock, whose results you've likely already seen today. And while our overall asset quality remained relatively stable, our loan loss provision did increase $78 million, to $152 million this quarter. Now this increase is primarily related to reserves for our oil and gas and coal exposure. 
In spite of these factors, it was a pretty solid quarter for PNC as we continued to focus on the execution of our strategic priorities. We grew loans and deposits on a spot basis this quarter. You saw that net interest income increased linked quarter, driven by growth in core NII. And importantly, noninterest expenses were down about 5% due to seasonally lower business activity but also our ongoing focus on disciplined expense management.
We also saw a good momentum at some of our businesses. In the corporate and institutional bank, we saw continued year-over-year growth in treasury management as we benefit from new customer wins, strong growth trends in corporate payments and repricing activities.
We also maintained momentum in our under-penetrated markets, particularly across the Southeast and Chicago, where we are building high-quality customer-driven franchises. Wins in the core middle market and cross-sell demonstrate the efficacy of our model. Now within our retail bank, we saw good year-over-year and linked-quarter growth in earnings, and we continued to see improved efficiency within the business as we execute our ongoing strategy to reinvent the Retail Banking experience, with more customers migrating to non-branch channels for most of their transactions and the expansion of our universal branch model.
It was a decent quarter for our Asset Management Group also. Inside this business, fee income was down just 4% linked quarter and 2% year-over-year despite the weakness in the equity markets during the quarter. Meanwhile, AUA actually ticked up during the quarter as we continued to see positive flows.
At the same time, however, despite an increase in NII this quarter, we continued to be impacted by interest rates that remain near all-time lows, and we have had to adjust to the reality of at least one less rate hike in 2016 than we'd previously forecast. Now Rob will have more to say about that in a few minutes.
But on the whole, although this quarter will be reported as a miss, we were solid in terms of our execution against the things that are in our power to control. Despite the hit to provision this quarter, beyond the energy book and certain exposures in the steel industry, we don't see negative trends in other areas of credit. In fact, our total nonperforming assets have declined by about $200 million year-over-year, and our core businesses performed well relative to market conditions and the ongoing interest rate environment.
Now Rob will speak to the details of our guidance, but I would say, as we look out at the landscape, the conditions support our view that the fundamentals remain solid in the U.S. economy. The labor market continues to improve, and the tight job market's going to eventually lead businesses to raise wages, which should, in turn, support consumer spending. Also, we see housing and commercial construction offsetting drags from trade and the downturn in energy production.
Within our businesses, we continue to make progress against each of our strategic priorities. We are working hard to continuously improve the customer experience across our lines of business, and I am confident in our long-term ability to continue to create value for our shareholders.
And with that, I will turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our first quarter results, and then we'll take your questions."
294585,325760777,958795,"The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 14, 2016",2016-04-14,"Earnings Calls","The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. PNC's first quarter net income was $943 million or $1.68 per diluted common share. First quarter results reflected the expected seasonal declines in business activity.

First quarter results reflected the expected seasonal declines in business activity. However, as Bill mentioned, results were also adversely affected by weaker equity markets, lower capital markets activity and energy portfolio pressures. Offsetting these items were growth in net interest income and strong expense management.
Our balance sheet is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. Commercial lending was up $2 billion or 2% from the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting growth in commercial real estate along with increases in large corporate loans.
Average consumer lending declined by $865 million or 1% linked quarter, in part due to the year-end derecognition of purchase-impaired loans as well as decreases in home equity and education loans.
Investment securities were up $2.4 billion or 4% linked quarter and increased $13.1 billion or 23% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Portfolio purchases were comprised primarily of agency residential mortgage-backed securities and other liquid debt and asset-backed securities.
Our interest-earning deposits with the Federal Reserve averaged $25.5 billion for the quarter, down $6 billion from the fourth quarter, as we shifted from Fed deposits to higher-yielding assets.
On the liabilities side, total deposits declined by $803 million or less than 1% when compared to the fourth quarter, as growth in consumer deposits was more than offset by seasonally lower commercial deposits.
Of note, consumer savings deposits increased by $5.5 billion linked quarter, reflecting our strategy toward relationship-based savings products. Total equity remained stable in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Retained earnings and higher AOCI were essentially offset by common share repurchases.
Turning to capital. As of March 31, 2016, our pro forma Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, fully phased in and using the standardized approach, was estimated to be 10.1%, essentially flat linked quarter, as we continued to return capital to shareholders through our dividends and share buybacks.
During the first quarter, we repurchased 5.9 million common shares for approximately $500 million. As a result, period-end common shares outstanding were 499 million, down 21 million or 4% compared to the same time a year ago. For the 4-quarter period that ended March 31, 2016, our total payout ratio including dividends and buybacks under the current share repurchase program was 85%.
Finally, our tangible book value reached $65.15 per common share as of March 31, a 6% increase compared to the same time a year ago.
As you can see on Slide 5, net income was $943 million. Highlights include the following: net interest income increased by $6 million linked quarter despite a lower day count, driven by growth of $10 million in core net interest income. Noninterest income was $1.6 billion, a decrease of $194 million or 11% linked quarter. This decline was primarily driven by weaker equity markets and lower Capital Markets activity, along with seasonally lower client revenue.
Noninterest expense decreased by $115 million or 5% compared to the fourth quarter. Expenses continued to be well managed due in part to our continuous improvement program. However, expenses also declined as a result of lower business activity. Provision expense in the first quarter was $152 million, an increase of $78 million compared with the fourth quarter, due to certain energy-related loans, which I'll discuss in more detail in a few minutes.
Finally, our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 23.5%, down from the 26.1% rate in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 25%.
Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to net interest income on Slide 6. Core net interest income increased by $10 million linked quarter, primarily driven by higher loan and securities balances and higher loan yields, partially offset by the impact of the consistently low interest rates and one less day in the quarter.
Purchase accounting accretion declined by $4 million linked quarter. For 2016, we continue to expect purchase accounting accretion to be down approximately $175 million compared to 2015. Net interest margin was 2.75%, an increase of 5 basis points compared to the fourth quarter. This was primarily due to the impact of lower Fed deposits and higher loan balances and yields.
Turning to noninterest income on Slide 7. In addition to normal seasonality, which typically impacts the first quarter, weaker equity markets and lower Capital Markets activity contributed further to the linked-quarter decline of $194 million.
Asset management fees, which includes earnings from our equity investment in BlackRock, were down $58 million or 15% on a linked-quarter basis. Of that amount, PNC's Asset Management Group represents $8 million of the decline.
Despite the decline in the equity markets, discretionary client assets under management increased by $1 billion linked quarter to $135 billion, reflecting solid net flows. Consumer services fees and deposit services charges were both lower compared to fourth quarter results, reflecting seasonally lower client activity.
Within consumer services, brokerage fees increased 4% linked quarter, driven by account activity and growth. Compared to the first quarter of last year, consumer services fees grew by $26 million or 8%, with growth in all categories. Highlights include increased debit and credit card activity along with higher brokerage income, all consistent with our efforts to meet the broad financial needs of our customers.
Service charges on deposits increased by $5 million or 3% compared to the same period a year ago, driven by higher customer activity. Corporate services fees declined by $69 million or 18% compared to fourth quarter results, which are typically strong. However, beyond seasonality, this category was also affected by lower activity levels in the broader capital markets. As a result, first quarter results were also lower year-over-year.
On the positive side, we saw good trends in our treasury management business on a year-over-year basis, and we expect that to continue, driven by strong customer relationships and new products.
Residential mortgage noninterest income declined by $13 million or 12% linked quarter. Most of the decrease was driven by our hedging results. Mortgage originations were down compared to the fourth quarter, due in part to closing delays resulting from the implementation of new disclosure requirements. However, servicing fees increased both linked quarter and compared to the same quarter a year ago.
Other noninterest income decreased by $30 million or 9% linked quarter, primarily due to lower gains on asset dispositions. We also had slightly lower gains on the sale of Visa stock.
Going forward, we would expect this year's quarterly run rate for other noninterest income to be in the range of $225 million to $275 million, excluding net securities and Visa gains. 
In summary, despite weaker equity markets and lower capital markets activity in the first quarter, we continue to believe that our underlying trends for fee income are favorable, and we expect that to continue due to a strong new business pipeline.
Turning to expenses on Slide 8. First quarter levels decreased by $115 million or 5%, reflecting our continued focus on disciplined expense management, along with both seasonal and lower market-related business activities. The decline linked quarter was primarily due to lower variable compensation and employee benefits. 
As we've previously stated, our continuous improvement program has a goal to reduce costs by $400 million in 2016. We're 1 quarter of the way through the year, and we've already completed actions to capture more than 1/3 of our annual goal.
We remain confident we will achieve our full year target. Through this program, we intend to help fund the significant investments we are continuing to make in our technology and business infrastructure throughout the year. As a result, we continue to expect that our full year 2016 expenses will remain stable to 2015 levels.
Turning to Slide 9. Overall, we view our firm-wide credit quality as relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter, as improvements in our consumer loan and commercial real estate portfolios were offset by deterioration in our energy portfolio. Total delinquencies, including the impact of energy loans, continued to decline on both a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. In addition, it's important to note that many of our customers benefit from lower energy prices.
What the graphs on Slide 9 depict is the impact on our credit metrics of both energy-related loans as well as our nonenergy-related portfolio. Nonperforming loans increased by $155 million or 7% linked quarter as $259 million of new nonperforming energy loans were partially offset by $104 million net reduction in nonenergy-related commercial and consumer portfolios.
On a year-over-year basis, nonperforming loans decreased by $124 million or 5%, even with the impact of the energy nonperforming loans. Provision for credit losses increased by $78 million linked quarter and total $152 million, over half of which was energy-related.
Nonenergy provision increased by $21 million, reflecting the continuing normalization over the historically and, in our view, unsustainably low levels we experienced throughout 2015.
Net charge-offs increased to $149 million in the quarter, resulting in a net charge-off ratio of 29 basis points. Energy-related charge-offs represented approximately 17% of losses, and the remainder was due to consistent levels of charge-offs for home equity, credit card and other commercial loans in the linked-quarter comparison.
Now let's take a deeper look at our energy book.
We view our energy portfolio, which represents 1.6% of our total outstanding loans, as well defined and properly reserved. As you can see on Slide 10, at the end of the first quarter, we had total outstandings of $2.7 billion in oil and gas and $535 million in coal. Total outstandings in our oil and gas portfolio were up 4% on a linked-quarter basis but down 5% compared to the first quarter of last year.
Breaking down the portfolio, we have approximately $800 million in outstandings to upstream exploration and production companies, $1 billion to midstream and downstream companies and $900 million to oilfield services. We believe this mix is favorable relative to others in the industry. 
As you know, our focus remains on the services book. And while we have seen some pressure on this portfolio, approximately $700 million or almost 80% of the $900 million is asset-based, which, by definition, is collateralized. As of March 31, 2016, our loan loss reserves for oil and gas represented 5% of outstandings in this portfolio. These reserves include the impact of the recently completed Shared National Credit exam. Utilization levels for oil and gas have remained fairly constant. They were at 34% as of March 31 of this year, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter and the same time a year ago.
Total unused commitments were $5.4 billion as of March 31 of this year. Redetermination of the borrowing basis for E&P loans is ongoing, and we would expect to see continued reductions in lines as a result.
Approximately 38% of our oil and gas loans are criticized, up from 28% linked quarter. 
Turning to coal, our portfolio significantly contributed to our provision this quarter. Going forward, however, while coal prices remain under pressure, our overall portfolio is small, and our remaining risk is concentrated in a handful of specific credits. Our reserve against this portfolio is 15%, and criticized balances represent approximately 37% of outstandings, up from 27% linked quarter.
Lastly, in regard to our overall energy portfolio, we continue to monitor market conditions as well as consequential impacts to other businesses. If energy prices remain pressured, this will continue to affect our provision.
In summary, PNC posted a solid first quarter driven by higher net interest income and strong expense management. Offsetting this were weaker equity markets, lower capital markets activity, energy pressures and seasonality. 
Looking ahead, we believe the economy will continue to grow at a steady pace, based on an improving labor market and solid overall economic trends. Because of this, our current forecast anticipates that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates in both June and December, with each increase being 25 basis points.
Our full year 2016 guidance continues to call for modest growth in revenue and stable expenses, which, by definition, positions us to deliver positive operating leverage. Looking ahead at the second quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter reported results, we expect modest growth in loans, we expect modest increases in net interest income; we expect fee income to be up 10% to 12%, reflecting the higher anticipated business levels in the second quarter; we expect expenses to be up in the mid-single digits, primarily as a result of the higher anticipated business activity as well as seasonality; and we expect provision to be between $125 million and $175 million, which reflects our view of continued near-term energy pressures.
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

And if you just sort of break the components down, I'll help you with that math. Asset management, as you know, is comprised of both our equity investment in BlackRock as well as our own Asset Management Group. The BlackRock piece, as you heard this morning, BlackRock had an episodic-oriented first quarter. They do expect some to tailwinds going into the second quarter, but if they go back into the normal range of what they had, had, which they expect, you get to a 10% kind of number, maybe a little better. Our asset management business is probably in the mid- to high single digits based on the pipeline, so asset management, because it's weighted more toward BlackRock in terms of the second quarter in that range. Secondly, the corporate services is probably growing double digit. As you -- if you take a look into that, our M&A business, our markets-related were down. Business pipelines are very strong there, so we would expect that to grow within the guidance range. Consumer services, which has been growing year-over-year, we expect that to continue probably in the mid- to high single digits that we've experienced. And then, residential mortgage, which is small, coming off a seasonally low quarter, we would expect production gains, although small in the absolute dollar sense, to be comfortably in the guidance percentage range. So that's the math."

Just as an aside, one of the things that I think people miss, as it relates to a lot of the work we're doing in the core infrastructure, is what it ultimately allows us to do with customers in terms of product offerings and customer services. We held -- we actually had an API Fest internally here last week, where we had employees form teams and opened up all the API for our online -- mobile and online banking capabilities and turned them loose to create new service apps for customers. All of which is fantastic, but none of which works unless you have an environment that allows you to quickly deploy these new products. And that's what we're building, and that's where I think the big benefit ultimately comes from for all the money that we've spent inside the technology space."

Now Rob's going to take you through the numbers in a couple of minutes, but I'll call your attention to just a few highlights. 
Specifically, in the second quarter, we saw revenue growth on the back of strong fee income, expenses that were again well managed, a stable credit quality and growth in average loans and deposits. We maintained our strong capital position, and you have likely seen the announcement that the regulators did not object to our capital plan submitted as part of the 2016 CCAR process. And as such, we're pleased to be able to announce that the dividend will increase to $0.55 per share beginning in the third quarter. We also announced plans to repurchase up to $2 billion of common shares over the next 4 quarters. 
So all in all, it was a pretty good second quarter for PNC. Now as we look forward, in regards to the interest rates, the Fed appears to be back in [ph] a holding pattern on further target Fed fund rate increases, at least, according to the market. And post the Brexit vote, we've seen long-term rates rally as global investors reach for basically any positive yield. The combination of a strong dollar and positive yields in the U.S. makes the U.S. rate market preferable to virtually all others, and we've seen the impact of that. 
Now the impact of these 2 issues, which are part economic and part technical, will result in more pressure on NII and NIM over time for PNC and most of the industry. And in our case, this is largely going to be a function of our securities books, as higher-yielding securities give way to lower-yielding securities going forward. 
That being said, we know how to navigate in this environment. And as always, I can commit to you that we're very focused on those things that are within our power to control. 
We have opportunities to continue to grow fee income as we execute on our strategic priorities, and we're also in a good position relative to our ongoing expense management efforts, and we have the ability to enhance those efforts, to some extent, as we continue to drive multiyear transformation within our lines of business in order to create efficiencies and deliver superior customer experience. 
Equally important is what we're not going to do. Now while we won't speculate on the future path of rates, that doesn't mean that we don't have a view on value. We're not going to respond to market uncertainty by suddenly changing our risk profile and/or stretching on credit or by significantly leveraging our balance sheet at what is arguably the worst possible time in the cycle. 
Now PNC and its investors have long benefited from our disciplined commitment to well-managed risk, well-run businesses and well-served customers, and that's the approach that we will continue to take as we work to grow long-term relationships and create long-term value for all of our constituencies. You've heard me say this before, but banking is a cyclical business, and you can't beat the cycle. Our job is to mute the impact and to add to, rather than detract from, long-term value in the process. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our second quarter results, and then we'll take your questions."
294585,334769417,1007107,"The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2016",2016-07-15,"Earnings Calls","The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. PNC's second quarter net income was $989 million or $1.82 per diluted common share. Second quarter results reflected solid revenue growth, driven by our focus on generating fee income. We grew average loans",1867,"Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. PNC's second quarter net income was $989 million or $1.82 per diluted common share. Second quarter results reflected solid revenue growth, driven by our focus on generating fee income. We grew average loans and deposits, expenses remained well managed and overall credit quality was stable as broad improvements in our consumer portfolio essentially offset a modest deterioration in our energy book. 
Balance sheet information is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. Commercial loans were up $1.7 billion or 1% from the first quarter, reflecting growth in large corporate and real estate lending. Average consumer loans declined by $619 million or less than 1% linked quarter due to decreases in home equity and education lending, partially offset by growth in auto and credit card. Investment securities declined slightly linked quarter as our reinvestments essentially matched repayments. 
Our interest-earning deposits with banks, mostly at the Federal Reserve, averaged $26.5 billion for the second quarter, up $930 million from the first quarter, primarily due to the deposit growth. Average total deposits increased by $1.5 billion compared to the first quarter, driven by growth in interest-bearing deposits. 
On a year-to-date basis, an increase in savings deposits has been somewhat offset by a decline in money market accounts, a shift in mix that reflects our strategy to grow relationship-based savings products. Total equity increased more than $400 million linked quarter due to increased retained earnings and higher AOCI, primarily related to net unrealized securities gains. 
As of June 30, 2016, our pro forma Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio fully phased-in and using the standardized approach was estimated to be 10.2%, up from 10.1% linked quarter. Our return on average assets as of June 30 was 1.11%, an increase of 4 basis points linked quarter. 
And finally, our tangible book value reached $66.89 per common share as of June 30, an 8% increase compared to the same time a year ago. 
Turning to Slide 5. Our strong capital position has enabled us to continue to return substantial capital to shareholders. We completed our 5-quarter common stock repurchase programs in the second quarter. During that period, we repurchased 29.9 million shares for $2.7 billion. And when you combine that with the $1.3 billion in common dividends paid during the same period, we returned a total of $4 billion to shareholders, resulting in a payout ratio of approximately 83%. 
As you have seen -- as you definitely have seen since last month following the results of this year's CCAR process, we announced plans to repurchase an additional $2 billion of shares over the next 4 quarters, beginning in the third quarter of this year. And earlier this month, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in the quarterly common stock dividend effective with the upcoming August dividend. 
As I've already mentioned, and as you can see on Slide 6, net income was $989 million. Highlights include the following: total revenue was up by $129 million or 4% compared to the first quarter. Net interest income declined by $30 million linked quarter, primarily due to the lower purchase accounting accretion. Year-to-date, net interest income is up $42 million or 1% over the same period a year ago. 
Total noninterest income increased by $159 million or 10% linked quarter, primarily due to strong customer-driven activity in all our fee categories. Noninterest expense increased by $79 million or 3% compared to the first quarter as expenses continued to be well managed. 
Provision for credit losses in the second quarter was $127 million, down $25 million compared with the first quarter as we continued to see some impact from our energy book but to a lesser extent than we saw in the first quarter. 
Finally, our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 24.3%. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. 
Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to Slide 7. Net interest income declined by $30 million compared to the first quarter, primarily driven by a $22 million decline in purchase accounting accretion. Core NII decreased by $8 million linked quarter as lower securities yields and higher borrowing costs were partially offset by loan growth. 
Compared to the same quarter a year ago, core net interest income increased $63 million or 3%, primarily due to higher loan and securities balances and higher loan yields. Core net interest margin declined by 2 basis points linked quarter, reflecting a lower interest rate environment. 
Total net interest margin was 2.7%, which included an additional decline of 3 basis points due to lower purchase accounting accretion. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect purchase accounting accretion to be down approximately $175 million compared to 2015. 
Turning to Slide 8. Fee income increased by $201 million or 16% compared to the first quarter, driven by strong growth across all of our customer categories. Total noninterest income grew by $159 million or 10% compared to the first quarter as other noninterest income declined. 
Asset management fees increased by $36 million or 11% linked quarter, reflecting higher earnings from our equity investment in BlackRock as stronger equity markets benefited both BlackRock and our asset management business. Asset management fees were down year-over-year, primarily related to a $30 million trust settlement in the second quarter of 2015. 
Consumer services fees were up $17 million or 5% compared to the first quarter as a result of higher client activity and seasonal increases in debit card, credit card and merchant services. Compared to the second quarter of last year, consumer services fees grew by $20 million or 6%, consistent with our success in expanding relationships and growing share of wallet with our customers. 
Corporate services fees increased by $78 million or 24% compared to the first quarter, primarily due to higher merger and acquisition advisory fees and higher loan syndication fees, which, in part, represented some delayed deals from the first quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, corporate services fees grew by $34 million or 9% with the same primary drivers. 
Residential mortgage noninterest income grew by $65 million linked quarter, with most of the increase driven by net hedging gains of $35 million compared with a net hedging loss of $8 million in the first quarter. Production revenue also increased as mortgage originations were up 35% linked quarter. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, Residential mortgage noninterest income was essentially flat as higher servicing fees were offset by lower production revenue. 
Other noninterest income of $264 million declined $42 million or 14% linked quarter and included negative valuation adjustments of $51 million, primarily associated with nonconforming investments under the Volcker Rule provisions. We also realized $31 million in net gains on the sale of Visa during the quarter. Overall, our fee income results this quarter reflect our emphasis on our strategic initiatives and our efforts to grow fees across our businesses. 
Turning to expenses on Slide 9. As you can see in the chart, expenses have remained relatively stable, and we continue to invest in technology and infrastructure. 
Second quarter expenses increased by $79 million or 3%, primarily reflecting higher variable compensation associated with business activity and higher marketing costs, partially offset by the release of Residential mortgage foreclosure-related reserves of $24 million. 
Looking at the first 6 months of the year, expenses are down $74 million or 2% compared to the first half of last year. As we previously stated, our continuous improvement program has a goal to reduce costs by $400 million in 2016. We're halfway through the year, and we're already completed actions to capture more than 2/3 of our annual goal. We remain confident we will achieve our full year target. 
Through this program, we intend to help fund the significant investments we're continuing to make in our technology and business infrastructure throughout the year. As a result, we continue to expect that our full year 2016 expenses will remain stable with 2015 levels. 
Turning to Slide 10. Overall, credit quality was stable compared to the first quarter. The graphs on this slide depict the impact of both energy related and nonenergy-related loans on our credit metrics. In the second quarter, we continued to see some deterioration from our energy book but to a lesser extent than we saw in the first quarter, and I'll have more to say about that in a moment. 
Total nonperforming loans decreased by $17 million or 1% linked quarter, primarily due to the lower consumer NPLs. Provision for credit losses of $127 million decreased by $25 million linked quarter. However, our total provision, excluding energy, increased modestly compared to the first quarter, reflecting the continuing normalization over the historically, and in our view, unsustainably low levels we experienced last year. 
Net charge-offs decreased to $134 million in the second quarter, resulting in an annualized net charge-off ratio of 26 basis points, down 3 basis points from the first quarter. In addition, total delinquencies declined by $36 million or 2% compared to the first quarter. 
Turning to our energy book on Slide 11. Overall, not much has changed from the information we provided last quarter other than a slight decrease in exposures. At the end of the second quarter, our oil, gas and coal portfolios represented approximately 1.5% of our total outstanding loans, and we view this book as properly reserved. 
We did see an increase in net charge-offs in our coal portfolio in the second quarter, and this really relates to the small size of the portfolio, which, by definition, has some lumpiness as we highlighted during our first quarter call. And as we've already stated, we continue to monitor market conditions as well as impacts to other businesses. 
In summary, PNC posted a strong second quarter driven by growth in fee income, reflecting progress we're making on our strategic priorities along with well-managed expenses. We grew average loans and deposits and continued significant shareholder return. 
Looking ahead, we believe the U.S. economy will continue to grow at a steady pace. However, given the uncertainty of the global economy, we also acknowledge short-term interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve are unlikely to occur before December. 
As a result, our full year 2016 guidance now calls for stable revenue, down from our previous guidance of modest revenue growth. And consistent with our previous guidance, we continue to expect modest loan growth and stable expenses for the full year 2016. 
Looking ahead at the upcoming quarter, we expect it will look a lot like the most recently completed second quarter. We expect modest growth in loans. We expect stable net interest income. We expect fee income to be stable as we anticipate continued growth and business activity in the third quarter to be somewhat offset by the elevated corporate services and residential mortgage fees we recorded in the second quarter. We expect expenses to be stable as we continue to invest in our technology and infrastructure, and we expect provision to be between $100 million and $150 million. 
With that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

Now higher-yielding leverage loans have come way back in with the high-yield market itself, but we don't play in that space. Our issue with loans is more about total return across a relationship than it is about where the actual spread is on a loan, and that, of course, relates to how much of the fee wallet we can get from the client, at least, on the C&I side. On the retail side, there is opportunity and to be honest with you, in parts of it, we've been executing less well than we otherwise could. Some of that's related to -- in mortgage on Fed[ph] regulations, and some of it's related to things we can do to improve customer experience. So we want to grow loans, but we want to do it in a way where we're getting a return on capital that's suitable for shareholders. And lending a loan, particularly on the C&I side, does not do that. It's a lousy return on equity and it drops our ROE."

In retail, it's just a continuation of kind of what we've done seeing growth from retail to card to merchant to debit straight through the categories, and we just continue to pursue that. I think depending what happens here with rates through time, we also have an opportunity inside of retail to raise revenue as a function of what I'm going to call in-the-moment fees, and I think you've heard me talk about this before but not a standard fee, where we're just charging somebody more for some particular item but rather, offer products and services that a consumer can choose at the moment to pay for because it has particular value to them. For example, ready access to money real time and cashing a check or other things like that. So we've got a list, pages long, as to what we're going to do on fee initiatives to continue to drive growth, and we think the risk-return cost of that relative to simply adding loans without commensurate share of wallet from clients, it's a much better trade-off that longer-term opportunity for the company."

It will be, when it's fully formed and launched in formal fashion probably in the first quarter, it will be a realtime, ubiquitous P2P payment platform that offers alternatives to traditional ACH and debit and credit rails, and implications of that I'll leave to your imagination but potentially are quite powerful. The issue of charging for traditional P2P as it's used today if you think in the context of where small payments between individuals. That's, I think, rightly or wrongly, we've seen the standard set at 0 with first BofA and then U.S. bank revision to go to 0 price, and I think there's opportunities, in fact, I know there's opportunities as the use case of that products changes either for larger dollar amounts or for P to small b and so on and so forth.

294585,334769417,1007122,"The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2016",2016-07-15,"Earnings Calls","The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. You've seen this morning that we reported net income of $989 million or $1.82 per diluted common share in the second quarter. We continued to execute on our strategic priorities with overall performance, you wil",604,"Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. You've seen this morning that we reported net income of $989 million or $1.82 per diluted common share in the second quarter. We continued to execute on our strategic priorities with overall performance, you will have seen, consistent with our prior guidance. Now Rob's going to take you through the numbers in a couple of minutes, but I'll call your attention to just a few highlights. 
Specifically, in the second quarter, we saw revenue growth on the back of strong fee income, expenses that were again well managed, a stable credit quality and growth in average loans and deposits. We maintained our strong capital position, and you have likely seen the announcement that the regulators did not object to our capital plan submitted as part of the 2016 CCAR process. And as such, we're pleased to be able to announce that the dividend will increase to $0.55 per share beginning in the third quarter. We also announced plans to repurchase up to $2 billion of common shares over the next 4 quarters. 
So all in all, it was a pretty good second quarter for PNC. Now as we look forward, in regards to the interest rates, the Fed appears to be back in a holding pattern on further target Fed fund rate increases, at least, according to the market. And post the Brexit vote, we've seen long-term rates rally as global investors reach for basically any positive yield. The combination of a strong dollar and positive yields in the U.S. makes the U.S. rate market preferable to virtually all others, and we've seen the impact of that. 
Now the impact of these 2 issues, which are part economic and part technical, will result in more pressure on NII and NIM over time for PNC and most of the industry. And in our case, this is largely going to be a function of our securities books, as higher-yielding securities give way to lower-yielding securities going forward. 
That being said, we know how to navigate in this environment. And as always, I can commit to you that we're very focused on those things that are within our power to control. 
We have opportunities to continue to grow fee income as we execute on our strategic priorities, and we're also in a good position relative to our ongoing expense management efforts, and we have the ability to enhance those efforts, to some extent, as we continue to drive multiyear transformation within our lines of business in order to create efficiencies and deliver superior customer experience. 
Equally important is what we're not going to do. Now while we won't speculate on the future path of rates, that doesn't mean that we don't have a view on value. We're not going to respond to market uncertainty by suddenly changing our risk profile and/or stretching on credit or by significantly leveraging our balance sheet at what is arguably the worst possible time in the cycle. 
Now PNC and its investors have long benefited from our disciplined commitment to well-managed risk, well-run businesses and well-served customers, and that's the approach that we will continue to take as we work to grow long-term relationships and create long-term value for all of our constituencies. You've heard me say this before, but banking is a cyclical business, and you can't beat the cycle. Our job is to mute the impact and to add to, rather than detract from, long-term value in the process. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our second quarter results, and then we'll take your questions."
294585,334769417,1007122,"The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2016",2016-07-15,"Earnings Calls","The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. PNC's second quarter net income was $989 million or $1.82 per diluted common share. Second quarter results reflected solid revenue growth, driven by our focus on generating fee income. We grew average loans",1867,"Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. PNC's second quarter net income was $989 million or $1.82 per diluted common share. Second quarter results reflected solid revenue growth, driven by our focus on generating fee income. We grew average loans and deposits, expenses remained well managed and overall credit quality was stable as broad improvements in our consumer portfolio essentially offset a modest deterioration in our energy book. 
Balance sheet information is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. Commercial loans were up $1.7 billion or 1% from the first quarter, reflecting growth in large corporate and real estate lending. Average consumer loans declined by $619 million or less than 1% linked quarter due to decreases in home equity and education lending, partially offset by growth in auto and credit card. Investment securities declined slightly linked quarter as our reinvestments essentially matched repayments. 
Our interest-earning deposits with banks, mostly at the Federal Reserve, averaged $26.5 billion for the second quarter, up $930 million from the first quarter, primarily due to the deposit growth. Average total deposits increased by $1.5 billion compared to the first quarter, driven by growth in interest-bearing deposits. 
On a year-to-date basis, an increase in savings deposits has been somewhat offset by a decline in money market accounts, a shift in mix that reflects our strategy to grow relationship-based savings products. Total equity increased more than $400 million linked quarter due to increased retained earnings and higher AOCI, primarily related to net unrealized securities gains. 
As of June 30, 2016, our pro forma Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio fully phased-in and using the standardized approach was estimated to be 10.2%, up from 10.1% linked quarter. Our return on average assets as of June 30 was 1.11%, an increase of 4 basis points linked quarter. 
And finally, our tangible book value reached $66.89 per common share as of June 30, an 8% increase compared to the same time a year ago. 
Turning to Slide 5. Our strong capital position has enabled us to continue to return substantial capital to shareholders. We completed our 5-quarter common stock repurchase programs in the second quarter. During that period, we repurchased 29.9 million shares for $2.7 billion. And when you combine that with the $1.3 billion in common dividends paid during the same period, we returned a total of $4 billion to shareholders, resulting in a payout ratio of approximately 83%. 
As you have seen -- as you definitely have seen since last month following the results of this year's CCAR process, we announced plans to repurchase an additional $2 billion of shares over the next 4 quarters, beginning in the third quarter of this year. And earlier this month, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in the quarterly common stock dividend effective with the upcoming August dividend. 
As I've already mentioned, and as you can see on Slide 6, net income was $989 million. Highlights include the following: total revenue was up by $129 million or 4% compared to the first quarter. Net interest income declined by $30 million linked quarter, primarily due to the lower purchase accounting accretion. Year-to-date, net interest income is up $42 million or 1% over the same period a year ago. 
Total noninterest income increased by $159 million or 10% linked quarter, primarily due to strong customer-driven activity in all our fee categories. Noninterest expense increased by $79 million or 3% compared to the first quarter as expenses continued to be well managed. 
Provision for credit losses in the second quarter was $127 million, down $25 million compared with the first quarter as we continued to see some impact from our energy book but to a lesser extent than we saw in the first quarter. 
Finally, our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 24.3%. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. 
Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to Slide 7. Net interest income declined by $30 million compared to the first quarter, primarily driven by a $22 million decline in purchase accounting accretion. Core NII decreased by $8 million linked quarter as lower securities yields and higher borrowing costs were partially offset by loan growth. 
Compared to the same quarter a year ago, core net interest income increased $63 million or 3%, primarily due to higher loan and securities balances and higher loan yields. Core net interest margin declined by 2 basis points linked quarter, reflecting a lower interest rate environment. 
Total net interest margin was 2.7%, which included an additional decline of 3 basis points due to lower purchase accounting accretion. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect purchase accounting accretion to be down approximately $175 million compared to 2015. 
Turning to Slide 8. Fee income increased by $201 million or 16% compared to the first quarter, driven by strong growth across all of our customer categories. Total noninterest income grew by $159 million or 10% compared to the first quarter as other noninterest income declined. 
Asset management fees increased by $36 million or 11% linked quarter, reflecting higher earnings from our equity investment in BlackRock as stronger equity markets benefited both BlackRock and our asset management business. Asset management fees were down year-over-year, primarily related to a $30 million trust settlement in the second quarter of 2015. 
Consumer services fees were up $17 million or 5% compared to the first quarter as a result of higher client activity and seasonal increases in debit card, credit card and merchant services. Compared to the second quarter of last year, consumer services fees grew by $20 million or 6%, consistent with our success in expanding relationships and growing share of wallet with our customers. 
Corporate services fees increased by $78 million or 24% compared to the first quarter, primarily due to higher merger and acquisition advisory fees and higher loan syndication fees, which, in part, represented some delayed deals from the first quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, corporate services fees grew by $34 million or 9% with the same primary drivers. 
Residential mortgage noninterest income grew by $65 million linked quarter, with most of the increase driven by net hedging gains of $35 million compared with a net hedging loss of $8 million in the first quarter. Production revenue also increased as mortgage originations were up 35% linked quarter. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, Residential mortgage noninterest income was essentially flat as higher servicing fees were offset by lower production revenue. 
Other noninterest income of $264 million declined $42 million or 14% linked quarter and included negative valuation adjustments of $51 million, primarily associated with nonconforming investments under the Volcker Rule provisions. We also realized $31 million in net gains on the sale of Visa during the quarter. Overall, our fee income results this quarter reflect our emphasis on our strategic initiatives and our efforts to grow fees across our businesses. 
Turning to expenses on Slide 9. As you can see in the chart, expenses have remained relatively stable, and we continue to invest in technology and infrastructure. 
Second quarter expenses increased by $79 million or 3%, primarily reflecting higher variable compensation associated with business activity and higher marketing costs, partially offset by the release of Residential mortgage foreclosure-related reserves of $24 million. 
Looking at the first 6 months of the year, expenses are down $74 million or 2% compared to the first half of last year. As we previously stated, our continuous improvement program has a goal to reduce costs by $400 million in 2016. We're halfway through the year, and we're already completed actions to capture more than 2/3 of our annual goal. We remain confident we will achieve our full year target. 
Through this program, we intend to help fund the significant investments we're continuing to make in our technology and business infrastructure throughout the year. As a result, we continue to expect that our full year 2016 expenses will remain stable with 2015 levels. 
Turning to Slide 10. Overall, credit quality was stable compared to the first quarter. The graphs on this slide depict the impact of both energy related and nonenergy-related loans on our credit metrics. In the second quarter, we continued to see some deterioration from our energy book but to a lesser extent than we saw in the first quarter, and I'll have more to say about that in a moment. 
Total nonperforming loans decreased by $17 million or 1% linked quarter, primarily due to the lower consumer NPLs. Provision for credit losses of $127 million decreased by $25 million linked quarter. However, our total provision, excluding energy, increased modestly compared to the first quarter, reflecting the continuing normalization over the historically, and in our view, unsustainably low levels we experienced last year. 
Net charge-offs decreased to $134 million in the second quarter, resulting in an annualized net charge-off ratio of 26 basis points, down 3 basis points from the first quarter. In addition, total delinquencies declined by $36 million or 2% compared to the first quarter. 
Turning to our energy book on Slide 11. Overall, not much has changed from the information we provided last quarter other than a slight decrease in exposures. At the end of the second quarter, our oil, gas and coal portfolios represented approximately 1.5% of our total outstanding loans, and we view this book as properly reserved. 
We did see an increase in net charge-offs in our coal portfolio in the second quarter, and this really relates to the small size of the portfolio, which, by definition, has some lumpiness as we highlighted during our first quarter call. And as we've already stated, we continue to monitor market conditions as well as impacts to other businesses. 
In summary, PNC posted a strong second quarter driven by growth in fee income, reflecting progress we're making on our strategic priorities along with well-managed expenses. We grew average loans and deposits and continued significant shareholder return. 
Looking ahead, we believe the U.S. economy will continue to grow at a steady pace. However, given the uncertainty of the global economy, we also acknowledge short-term interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve are unlikely to occur before December. 
As a result, our full year 2016 guidance now calls for stable revenue, down from our previous guidance of modest revenue growth. And consistent with our previous guidance, we continue to expect modest loan growth and stable expenses for the full year 2016. 
Looking ahead at the upcoming quarter, we expect it will look a lot like the most recently completed second quarter. We expect modest growth in loans. We expect stable net interest income. We expect fee income to be stable as we anticipate continued growth and business activity in the third quarter to be somewhat offset by the elevated corporate services and residential mortgage fees we recorded in the second quarter. We expect expenses to be stable as we continue to invest in our technology and infrastructure, and we expect provision to be between $100 million and $150 million. 
With that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

They didn't really go out when the bond markets blew out, but they kind of stabilized, and they've stayed there. Now higher-yielding leverage loans have come way back in with the high-yield market itself, but we don't play in that space. Our issue with loans is more about total return across a relationship than it is about where the actual spread is on a loan, and that, of course, relates to how much of the fee wallet we can get from the client, at least, on the C&I side. On the retail side, there is opportunity and to be honest with you, in parts of it, we've been executing less well than we otherwise could. Some of that's related to -- in mortgage on Fed regulations, and some of it's related to things we can do to improve customer experience. So we want to grow loans, but we want to do it in a way where we're getting a return on capital that's suitable for shareholders. And lending a loan, particularly on the C&I side, does not do that. It's a lousy return on equity and it drops our ROE."

In retail, it's just a continuation of kind of what we've done, seeing growth from retail to card to merchant to debit to -- straight through the categories, and we just continue to pursue that.

We'll roll it out in the third quarter at some point to go live with it. I think it is incredibly important long term because, in effect, it creates a new payment rail. It will be -- when it's fully formed and launched in formal fashion probably in the first quarter, it will be a realtime, ubiquitous P2P payment platform that offers alternatives to traditional ACH and debit and credit rails, and the implications of that, I'll leave to your imagination, but potentially are quite powerful. The issue of charging for traditional P2P as it's used today, if you think in the context of Venmo, where it's small payments between individuals, that's -- I think, rightly or wrongly, we've seen the standard set at 0 with, first, BofA and then, U.S. Bank revision to go to 0 price. And I think there's opportunities, in fact, I know there's opportunities as the use case of that product changes, either for larger dollar amounts or for P to small B and so on and so forth. So I do think there's revenue opportunities associated with a pure P2P, but I think the bigger implication is the strategic importance of creating what, in effect, is an entirely new payment rail."

You've seen this morning that we reported net income of $989 million or $1.82 per diluted common share in the second quarter. We continued to execute on our strategic priorities with overall performance, you wil",604,"Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. You've seen this morning that we reported net income of $989 million or $1.82 per diluted common share in the second quarter. We continued to execute on our strategic priorities with overall performance, you will have seen, consistent with our prior guidance. Now Rob's going to take you through the numbers in a couple of minutes, but I'll call your attention to just a few highlights. 
Specifically, in the second quarter, we saw revenue growth on the back of strong fee income, expenses that were again well managed, a stable credit quality and growth in average loans and deposits. We maintained our strong capital position, and you have likely seen the announcement that the regulators did not object to our capital plan submitted as part of the 2016 CCAR process. And as such, we're pleased to be able to announce that the dividend will increase to $0.55 per share beginning in the third quarter. We also announced plans to repurchase up to $2 billion of common shares over the next 4 quarters. 
So all in all, it was a pretty good second quarter for PNC. Now as we look forward, in regards to the interest rates, the Fed appears to be back in a holding pattern on further target Fed fund rate increases, at least, according to the market. And post the Brexit vote, we've seen long-term rates rally as global investors reach for basically any positive yield. The combination of a strong dollar and positive yields in the U.S. makes the U.S. rate market preferable to virtually all others, and we've seen the impact of that. 
Now the impact of these 2 issues, which are part economic and part technical, will result in more pressure on NII and NIM over time for PNC and most of the industry. And in our case, this is largely going to be a function of our securities books, as higher-yielding securities give way to lower-yielding securities going forward. 
That being said, we know how to navigate in this environment. And as always, I can commit to you that we're very focused on those things that are within our power to control. 
We have opportunities to continue to grow fee income as we execute on our strategic priorities, and we're also in a good position relative to our ongoing expense management efforts, and we have the ability to enhance those efforts, to some extent, as we continue to drive multiyear transformation within our lines of business in order to create efficiencies and deliver superior customer experience. 
Equally important is what we're not going to do. Now while we won't speculate on the future path of rates, that doesn't mean that we don't have a view on value. We're not going to respond to market uncertainty by suddenly changing our risk profile and/or stretching on credit or by significantly leveraging our balance sheet at what is arguably the worst possible time in the cycle. 
Now PNC and its investors have long benefited from our disciplined commitment to well-managed risk, well-run businesses and well-served customers, and that's the approach that we will continue to take as we work to grow long-term relationships and create long-term value for all of our constituencies. You've heard me say this before, but banking is a cyclical business, and you can't beat the cycle. Our job is to mute the impact and to add to, rather than detract from, long-term value in the process. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our second quarter results, and then we'll take your questions."
294585,334769417,1007151,"The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2016",2016-07-15,"Earnings Calls","The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. PNC's second quarter net income was $989 million or $1.82 per diluted common share. Second quarter results reflected solid revenue growth, driven by our focus on generating fee income. We grew average loans",1867,"Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. PNC's second quarter net income was $989 million or $1.82 per diluted common share. Second quarter results reflected solid revenue growth, driven by our focus on generating fee income. We grew average loans and deposits, expenses remained well managed and overall credit quality was stable as broad improvements in our consumer portfolio essentially offset a modest deterioration in our energy book. 
Balance sheet information is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. Commercial loans were up $1.7 billion or 1% from the first quarter, reflecting growth in large corporate and real estate lending. Average consumer loans declined by $619 million or less than 1% linked quarter due to decreases in home equity and education lending, partially offset by growth in auto and credit card. Investment securities declined slightly linked quarter as our reinvestments essentially matched repayments. 
Our interest-earning deposits with banks, mostly at the Federal Reserve, averaged $26.5 billion for the second quarter, up $930 million from the first quarter, primarily due to the deposit growth. Average total deposits increased by $1.5 billion compared to the first quarter, driven by growth in interest-bearing deposits. 
On a year-to-date basis, an increase in savings deposits has been somewhat offset by a decline in money market accounts, a shift in mix that reflects our strategy to grow relationship-based savings products. Total equity increased more than $400 million linked quarter due to increased retained earnings and higher AOCI, primarily related to net unrealized securities gains. 
As of June 30, 2016, our pro forma Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio fully phased-in and using the standardized approach was estimated to be 10.2%, up from 10.1% linked quarter. Our return on average assets as of June 30 was 1.11%, an increase of 4 basis points linked quarter. 
And finally, our tangible book value reached $66.89 per common share as of June 30, an 8% increase compared to the same time a year ago. 
Turning to Slide 5. Our strong capital position has enabled us to continue to return substantial capital to shareholders. We completed our 5-quarter common stock repurchase programs in the second quarter. During that period, we repurchased 29.9 million shares for $2.7 billion. And when you combine that with the $1.3 billion in common dividends paid during the same period, we returned a total of $4 billion to shareholders, resulting in a payout ratio of approximately 83%. 
As you have seen -- as you definitely have seen since last month following the results of this year's CCAR process, we announced plans to repurchase an additional $2 billion of shares over the next 4 quarters, beginning in the third quarter of this year. And earlier this month, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in the quarterly common stock dividend effective with the upcoming August dividend. 
As I've already mentioned, and as you can see on Slide 6, net income was $989 million. Highlights include the following: total revenue was up by $129 million or 4% compared to the first quarter. Net interest income declined by $30 million linked quarter, primarily due to the lower purchase accounting accretion. Year-to-date, net interest income is up $42 million or 1% over the same period a year ago. 
Total noninterest income increased by $159 million or 10% linked quarter, primarily due to strong customer-driven activity in all our fee categories. Noninterest expense increased by $79 million or 3% compared to the first quarter as expenses continued to be well managed. 
Provision for credit losses in the second quarter was $127 million, down $25 million compared with the first quarter as we continued to see some impact from our energy book but to a lesser extent than we saw in the first quarter. 
Finally, our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 24.3%. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. 
Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to Slide 7. Net interest income declined by $30 million compared to the first quarter, primarily driven by a $22 million decline in purchase accounting accretion. Core NII decreased by $8 million linked quarter as lower securities yields and higher borrowing costs were partially offset by loan growth. 
Compared to the same quarter a year ago, core net interest income increased $63 million or 3%, primarily due to higher loan and securities balances and higher loan yields. Core net interest margin declined by 2 basis points linked quarter, reflecting a lower interest rate environment. 
Total net interest margin was 2.7%, which included an additional decline of 3 basis points due to lower purchase accounting accretion. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect purchase accounting accretion to be down approximately $175 million compared to 2015. 
Turning to Slide 8. Fee income increased by $201 million or 16% compared to the first quarter, driven by strong growth across all of our customer categories. Total noninterest income grew by $159 million or 10% compared to the first quarter as other noninterest income declined. 
Asset management fees increased by $36 million or 11% linked quarter, reflecting higher earnings from our equity investment in BlackRock as stronger equity markets benefited both BlackRock and our asset management business. Asset management fees were down year-over-year, primarily related to a $30 million trust settlement in the second quarter of 2015. 
Consumer services fees were up $17 million or 5% compared to the first quarter as a result of higher client activity and seasonal increases in debit card, credit card and merchant services. Compared to the second quarter of last year, consumer services fees grew by $20 million or 6%, consistent with our success in expanding relationships and growing share of wallet with our customers. 
Corporate services fees increased by $78 million or 24% compared to the first quarter, primarily due to higher merger and acquisition advisory fees and higher loan syndication fees, which, in part, represented some delayed deals from the first quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, corporate services fees grew by $34 million or 9% with the same primary drivers. 
Residential mortgage noninterest income grew by $65 million linked quarter, with most of the increase driven by net hedging gains of $35 million compared with a net hedging loss of $8 million in the first quarter. Production revenue also increased as mortgage originations were up 35% linked quarter. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, Residential mortgage noninterest income was essentially flat as higher servicing fees were offset by lower production revenue. 
Other noninterest income of $264 million declined $42 million or 14% linked quarter and included negative valuation adjustments of $51 million, primarily associated with nonconforming investments under the Volcker Rule provisions. We also realized $31 million in net gains on the sale of Visa during the quarter. Overall, our fee income results this quarter reflect our emphasis on our strategic initiatives and our efforts to grow fees across our businesses. 
Turning to expenses on Slide 9. As you can see in the chart, expenses have remained relatively stable, and we continue to invest in technology and infrastructure. 
Second quarter expenses increased by $79 million or 3%, primarily reflecting higher variable compensation associated with business activity and higher marketing costs, partially offset by the release of Residential mortgage foreclosure-related reserves of $24 million. 
Looking at the first 6 months of the year, expenses are down $74 million or 2% compared to the first half of last year. As we previously stated, our continuous improvement program has a goal to reduce costs by $400 million in 2016. We're halfway through the year, and we're already completed actions to capture more than 2/3 of our annual goal. We remain confident we will achieve our full year target. 
Through this program, we intend to help fund the significant investments we're continuing to make in our technology and business infrastructure throughout the year. As a result, we continue to expect that our full year 2016 expenses will remain stable with 2015 levels. 
Turning to Slide 10. Overall, credit quality was stable compared to the first quarter. The graphs on this slide depict the impact of both energy related and nonenergy-related loans on our credit metrics. In the second quarter, we continued to see some deterioration from our energy book but to a lesser extent than we saw in the first quarter, and I'll have more to say about that in a moment. 
Total nonperforming loans decreased by $17 million or 1% linked quarter, primarily due to the lower consumer NPLs. Provision for credit losses of $127 million decreased by $25 million linked quarter. However, our total provision, excluding energy, increased modestly compared to the first quarter, reflecting the continuing normalization over the historically, and in our view, unsustainably low levels we experienced last year. 
Net charge-offs decreased to $134 million in the second quarter, resulting in an annualized net charge-off ratio of 26 basis points, down 3 basis points from the first quarter. In addition, total delinquencies declined by $36 million or 2% compared to the first quarter. 
Turning to our energy book on Slide 11. Overall, not much has changed from the information we provided last quarter other than a slight decrease in exposures. At the end of the second quarter, our oil, gas and coal portfolios represented approximately 1.5% of our total outstanding loans, and we view this book as properly reserved. 
We did see an increase in net charge-offs in our coal portfolio in the second quarter, and this really relates to the small size of the portfolio, which, by definition, has some lumpiness as we highlighted during our first quarter call. And as we've already stated, we continue to monitor market conditions as well as impacts to other businesses. 
In summary, PNC posted a strong second quarter driven by growth in fee income, reflecting progress we're making on our strategic priorities along with well-managed expenses. We grew average loans and deposits and continued significant shareholder return. 
Looking ahead, we believe the U.S. economy will continue to grow at a steady pace. However, given the uncertainty of the global economy, we also acknowledge short-term interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve are unlikely to occur before December. 
As a result, our full year 2016 guidance now calls for stable revenue, down from our previous guidance of modest revenue growth. And consistent with our previous guidance, we continue to expect modest loan growth and stable expenses for the full year 2016. 
Looking ahead at the upcoming quarter, we expect it will look a lot like the most recently completed second quarter. We expect modest growth in loans. We expect stable net interest income. We expect fee income to be stable as we anticipate continued growth and business activity in the third quarter to be somewhat offset by the elevated corporate services and residential mortgage fees we recorded in the second quarter. We expect expenses to be stable as we continue to invest in our technology and infrastructure, and we expect provision to be between $100 million and $150 million. 
With that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

They didn't really go out when the bond markets blew out, but they kind of stabilized, and they've stayed there. Now higher-yielding leverage loans have come way back in with the high-yield market itself, but we don't play in that space. Our issue with loans is more about total return across the relationship than it is about where the actual spread is on a loan, and that, of course, relates to how much of the fee wallet we can get from the client, at least, on the C&I side. On the retail side, there is opportunity and to be honest with you, in parts of it, we've been executing less well than we otherwise could. Some of that's related to -- in mortgage on Fed regulations, and some of it's related to things we can do to improve customer experience. So we want to grow loans, but we want to do it in a way where we're getting a return on capital that's suitable for shareholders. And lending a loan, particularly on the C&I side, does not do that. It's a lousy return on equity, and it drops our ROE."

So lots of things at the margin that kind of add to our opportunity inside of TM. In retail, it's just a continuation of kind of what we've done, seeing growth from retail to card to merchant to debit to -- straight through the categories, and we just continue to pursue that. I think depending what happens here with rates through time, we also have an opportunity inside of retail to raise revenue as a function of what I'm going to call in-the-moment fees, and I think you've heard me talk about this before but not a standard fee, where we're just charging somebody more for some particular item but rather, offer products and services that a consumer can choose in-the-moment to pay for because it has particular value to them. For example, ready access to money realtime, cashing a check or other things like that. So we've got a list, pages long, as to what we're going to do on fee initiatives to continue to drive growth, and we think the risk-return cost of that relative to simply adding loans without commensurate share of wallet from clients, it's a much better trade-off and longer-term opportunity for the company."

The issue of charging for traditional P2P as it's used today, if you think in the context of Venmo, where it's small payments between individuals, that's -- I think, rightly or wrongly, we've seen the standard set at 0 with, first, BofA and then, U.S. Bank revision to go to 0 price. And I think there's opportunities, in fact, I know there's opportunities as the use case of that product changes, either for larger dollar amounts or for P to small B and so on and so forth. So I do think there's revenue opportunities associated with a pure P2P, but I think the bigger implication is the strategic importance of creating what, in effect, is an entirely new payment rail."

You've seen this morning that we reported net income of $989 million or $1.82 per diluted common share in the second quarter. We continued to execute on our strategic priorities with overall performance, you wil",604,"Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. You've seen this morning that we reported net income of $989 million or $1.82 per diluted common share in the second quarter. We continued to execute on our strategic priorities with overall performance, you will have seen, consistent with our prior guidance. Now Rob's going to take you through the numbers in a couple of minutes, but I'll call your attention to just a few highlights. 
Specifically, in the second quarter, we saw revenue growth on the back of strong fee income, expenses that were again well managed, a stable credit quality and growth in average loans and deposits. We maintained our strong capital position, and you have likely seen the announcement that the regulators did not object to our capital plan submitted as part of the 2016 CCAR process. And as such, we're pleased to be able to announce that the dividend will increase to $0.55 per share beginning in the third quarter. We also announced plans to repurchase up to $2 billion of common shares over the next 4 quarters. 
So all in all, it was a pretty good second quarter for PNC. Now as we look forward, in regards to the interest rates, the Fed appears to be back in a holding pattern on further target Fed fund rate increases, at least, according to the market. And post the Brexit vote, we've seen long-term rates rally as global investors reach for basically any positive yield. The combination of a strong dollar and positive yields in the U.S. makes the U.S. rate market preferable to virtually all others, and we've seen the impact of that. 
Now the impact of these 2 issues, which are part economic and part technical, will result in more pressure on NII and NIM over time for PNC and most of the industry. And in our case, this is largely going to be a function of our securities books, as higher-yielding securities give way to lower-yielding securities going forward. 
That being said, we know how to navigate in this environment. And as always, I can commit to you that we're very focused on those things that are within our power to control. 
We have opportunities to continue to grow fee income as we execute on our strategic priorities, and we're also in a good position relative to our ongoing expense management efforts, and we have the ability to enhance those efforts, to some extent, as we continue to drive multiyear transformation within our lines of business in order to create efficiencies and deliver superior customer experience. 
Equally important is what we're not going to do. Now while we won't speculate on the future path of rates, that doesn't mean that we don't have a view on value. We're not going to respond to market uncertainty by suddenly changing our risk profile and/or stretching on credit or by significantly leveraging our balance sheet at what is arguably the worst possible time in the cycle. 
Now PNC and its investors have long benefited from our disciplined commitment to well-managed risk, well-run businesses and well-served customers, and that's the approach that we will continue to take as we work to grow long-term relationships and create long-term value for all of our constituencies. You've heard me say this before, but banking is a cyclical business, and you can't beat the cycle. Our job is to mute the impact and to add to, rather than detract from, long-term value in the process. 
And with that, I will turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our second quarter results, and then we'll take your questions."
294585,334769417,1007300,"The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2016",2016-07-15,"Earnings Calls","The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. PNC's second quarter net income was $989 million or $1.82 per diluted common share. Second quarter results reflected solid revenue growth, driven by our focus on generating fee income. We grew average loans",1867,"Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. PNC's second quarter net income was $989 million or $1.82 per diluted common share. Second quarter results reflected solid revenue growth, driven by our focus on generating fee income. We grew average loans and deposits, expenses remained well managed and overall credit quality was stable as broad improvements in our consumer portfolio essentially offset a modest deterioration in our energy book. 
Balance sheet information is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. Commercial loans were up $1.7 billion or 1% from the first quarter, reflecting growth in large corporate and real estate lending. Average consumer loans declined by $619 million or less than 1% linked quarter due to decreases in home equity and education lending, partially offset by growth in auto and credit card. Investment securities declined slightly linked quarter as our reinvestments essentially matched repayments. 
Our interest-earning deposits with banks, mostly at the Federal Reserve, averaged $26.5 billion for the second quarter, up $930 million from the first quarter, primarily due to the deposit growth. Average total deposits increased by $1.5 billion compared to the first quarter, driven by growth in interest-bearing deposits. 
On a year-to-date basis, an increase in savings deposits has been somewhat offset by a decline in money market accounts, a shift in mix that reflects our strategy to grow relationship-based savings products. Total equity increased more than $400 million linked quarter due to increased retained earnings and higher AOCI, primarily related to net unrealized securities gains. 
As of June 30, 2016, our pro forma Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio fully phased-in and using the standardized approach was estimated to be 10.2%, up from 10.1% linked quarter. Our return on average assets as of June 30 was 1.11%, an increase of 4 basis points linked quarter. 
And finally, our tangible book value reached $66.89 per common share as of June 30, an 8% increase compared to the same time a year ago. 
Turning to Slide 5. Our strong capital position has enabled us to continue to return substantial capital to shareholders. We completed our 5-quarter common stock repurchase programs in the second quarter. During that period, we repurchased 29.9 million shares for $2.7 billion. And when you combine that with the $1.3 billion in common dividends paid during the same period, we returned a total of $4 billion to shareholders, resulting in a payout ratio of approximately 83%. 
As you have seen -- as you definitely have seen since last month following the results of this year's CCAR process, we announced plans to repurchase an additional $2 billion of shares over the next 4 quarters, beginning in the third quarter of this year. And earlier this month, our Board of Directors approved an 8% increase in the quarterly common stock dividend effective with the upcoming August dividend. 
As I've already mentioned, and as you can see on Slide 6, net income was $989 million. Highlights include the following: total revenue was up by $129 million or 4% compared to the first quarter. Net interest income declined by $30 million linked quarter, primarily due to the lower purchase accounting accretion. Year-to-date, net interest income is up $42 million or 1% over the same period a year ago. 
Total noninterest income increased by $159 million or 10% linked quarter, primarily due to strong customer-driven activity in all our fee categories. Noninterest expense increased by $79 million or 3% compared to the first quarter as expenses continued to be well managed. 
Provision for credit losses in the second quarter was $127 million, down $25 million compared with the first quarter as we continued to see some impact from our energy book but to a lesser extent than we saw in the first quarter. 
Finally, our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 24.3%. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. 
Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to Slide 7. Net interest income declined by $30 million compared to the first quarter, primarily driven by a $22 million decline in purchase accounting accretion. Core NII decreased by $8 million linked quarter as lower securities yields and higher borrowing costs were partially offset by loan growth. 
Compared to the same quarter a year ago, core net interest income increased $63 million or 3%, primarily due to higher loan and securities balances and higher loan yields. Core net interest margin declined by 2 basis points linked quarter, reflecting a lower interest rate environment. 
Total net interest margin was 2.7%, which included an additional decline of 3 basis points due to lower purchase accounting accretion. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect purchase accounting accretion to be down approximately $175 million compared to 2015. 
Turning to Slide 8. Fee income increased by $201 million or 16% compared to the first quarter, driven by strong growth across all of our customer categories. Total noninterest income grew by $159 million or 10% compared to the first quarter as other noninterest income declined. 
Asset management fees increased by $36 million or 11% linked quarter, reflecting higher earnings from our equity investment in BlackRock as stronger equity markets benefited both BlackRock and our asset management business. Asset management fees were down year-over-year, primarily related to a $30 million trust settlement in the second quarter of 2015. 
Consumer services fees were up $17 million or 5% compared to the first quarter as a result of higher client activity and seasonal increases in debit card, credit card and merchant services. Compared to the second quarter of last year, consumer services fees grew by $20 million or 6%, consistent with our success in expanding relationships and growing share of wallet with our customers. 
Corporate services fees increased by $78 million or 24% compared to the first quarter, primarily due to higher merger and acquisition advisory fees and higher loan syndication fees, which, in part, represented some delayed deals from the first quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, corporate services fees grew by $34 million or 9% with the same primary drivers. 
Residential mortgage noninterest income grew by $65 million linked quarter, with most of the increase driven by net hedging gains of $35 million compared with a net hedging loss of $8 million in the first quarter. Production revenue also increased as mortgage originations were up 35% linked quarter. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, Residential mortgage noninterest income was essentially flat as higher servicing fees were offset by lower production revenue. 
Other noninterest income of $264 million declined $42 million or 14% linked quarter and included negative valuation adjustments of $51 million, primarily associated with nonconforming investments under the Volcker Rule provisions. We also realized $31 million in net gains on the sale of Visa during the quarter. Overall, our fee income results this quarter reflect our emphasis on our strategic initiatives and our efforts to grow fees across our businesses. 
Turning to expenses on Slide 9. As you can see in the chart, expenses have remained relatively stable, and we continue to invest in technology and infrastructure. 
Second quarter expenses increased by $79 million or 3%, primarily reflecting higher variable compensation associated with business activity and higher marketing costs, partially offset by the release of Residential mortgage foreclosure-related reserves of $24 million. 
Looking at the first 6 months of the year, expenses are down $74 million or 2% compared to the first half of last year. As we previously stated, our continuous improvement program has a goal to reduce costs by $400 million in 2016. We're halfway through the year, and we're already completed actions to capture more than 2/3 of our annual goal. We remain confident we will achieve our full year target. 
Through this program, we intend to help fund the significant investments we're continuing to make in our technology and business infrastructure throughout the year. As a result, we continue to expect that our full year 2016 expenses will remain stable with 2015 levels. 
Turning to Slide 10. Overall, credit quality was stable compared to the first quarter. The graphs on this slide depict the impact of both energy related and nonenergy-related loans on our credit metrics. In the second quarter, we continued to see some deterioration from our energy book but to a lesser extent than we saw in the first quarter, and I'll have more to say about that in a moment. 
Total nonperforming loans decreased by $17 million or 1% linked quarter, primarily due to the lower consumer NPLs. Provision for credit losses of $127 million decreased by $25 million linked quarter. However, our total provision, excluding energy, increased modestly compared to the first quarter, reflecting the continuing normalization over the historically, and in our view, unsustainably low levels we experienced last year. 
Net charge-offs decreased to $134 million in the second quarter, resulting in an annualized net charge-off ratio of 26 basis points, down 3 basis points from the first quarter. In addition, total delinquencies declined by $36 million or 2% compared to the first quarter. 
Turning to our energy book on Slide 11. Overall, not much has changed from the information we provided last quarter other than a slight decrease in exposures. At the end of the second quarter, our oil, gas and coal portfolios represented approximately 1.5% of our total outstanding loans, and we view this book as properly reserved. 
We did see an increase in net charge-offs in our coal portfolio in the second quarter, and this really relates to the small size of the portfolio, which, by definition, has some lumpiness as we highlighted during our first quarter call. And as we've already stated, we continue to monitor market conditions as well as impacts to other businesses. 
In summary, PNC posted a strong second quarter driven by growth in fee income, reflecting progress we're making on our strategic priorities along with well-managed expenses. We grew average loans and deposits and continued significant shareholder return. 
Looking ahead, we believe the U.S. economy will continue to grow at a steady pace. However, given the uncertainty of the global economy, we also acknowledge short-term interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve are unlikely to occur before December. 
As a result, our full year 2016 guidance now calls for stable revenue, down from our previous guidance of modest revenue growth. And consistent with our previous guidance, we continue to expect modest loan growth and stable expenses for the full year 2016. 
Looking ahead at the upcoming quarter, we expect it will look a lot like the most recently completed second quarter. We expect modest growth in loans. We expect stable net interest income. We expect fee income to be stable as we anticipate continued growth and business activity in the third quarter to be somewhat offset by the elevated corporate services and residential mortgage fees we recorded in the second quarter. We expect expenses to be stable as we continue to invest in our technology and infrastructure, and we expect provision to be between $100 million and $150 million. 
With that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

They didn't really go out when the bond markets blew out, but they kind of stabilized, and they've stayed there. Now higher-yielding leverage loans have come way back in with the high-yield market itself, but we don't play in that space. Our issue with loans is more about total return across the relationship than it is about where the actual spread is on a loan, and that, of course, relates to how much of the fee wallet we can get from the client, at least, on the C&I side. On the retail side, there is opportunity and to be honest with you, in parts of it, we've been executing less well than we otherwise could. Some of that's related to -- in mortgage on Fed regulations, and some of it's related to things we can do to improve customer experience. So we want to grow loans, but we want to do it in a way where we're getting a return on capital that's suitable for shareholders. And lending a loan, particularly on the C&I side, does not do that. It's a lousy return on equity, and it drops our ROE."

So lots of things at the margin that kind of add to our opportunity inside of TM. In retail, it's just a continuation of kind of what we've done, seeing growth from retail to card to merchant to debit to -- straight through the categories, and we just continue to pursue that. I think depending what happens here with rates through time, we also have an opportunity inside of retail to raise revenue as a function of what I'm going to call in-the-moment fees, and I think you've heard me talk about this before but not a standard fee, where we're just charging somebody more for some particular item but rather, offer products and services that a consumer can choose in-the-moment to pay for because it has particular value to them. For example, ready access to money realtime, cashing a check or other things like that. So we've got a list, pages long, as to what we're going to do on fee initiatives to continue to drive growth, and we think the risk-return cost of that relative to simply adding loans without commensurate share of wallet from clients, it's a much better trade-off and longer-term opportunity for the company."

The issue of charging for traditional P2P as it's used today, if you think in the context of Venmo, where it's small payments between individuals, that's -- I think, rightly or wrongly, we've seen the standard set at 0 with, first, BofA and then, U.S. Bank revision to go to 0 price. And I think there's opportunities, in fact, I know there's opportunities as the use case of that product changes, either for larger dollar amounts or for P to small B and so on and so forth. So I do think there's revenue opportunities associated with a pure P2P, but I think the bigger implication is the strategic importance of creating what, in effect, is an entirely new payment rail."

You can have a scenario where the Fed actually raises the front-end, and the back-end rallies simply because of what's going on globally. But independent of all that, I think the simplest way to think about the direct impact of rates on our near-term income, all else equal, is a roll-off of our securities book which is at a 2.69% book yield, plus or minus, today and a replacement, equal risk, at about 1.69% over the course of a bunch of years that, that would play out. Now if we really gotten to an environment where we were going to be -- where we believed that we were stuck here, ala Japan, which I don't think is the case, we could put liquidity to work and raise our duration of equity if we got stuck into that. So there's offsets to it. And that also, obviously, assumes that we don't grow loans or do many other things we do, grow fee and so on and so forth.

I know everybody has a fairly busy morning this morning with all the earnings out, so I'm going to keep my comments very brief before I turn it over to Rob to take you through the numbers. 
Just to lead off. As you've seen this morning, PNC reported net income of $1 billion or $1.84 per diluted common share in the third quarter. You hopefully also saw it was a good, clean quarter with results that are kind of representative of the consistent execution our shareholders have come to expect from us in recent years. 
We grew loans by more than $1 billion, generated strong deposit growth. We had revenue up by $35 million or 1%, driven by both higher net interest income and noninterest income. And we had -- expenses again remained well controlled. And importantly, overall credit quality remained stable with the second quarter. 
Finally, and just briefly, I can assure you that we're hard at work on the execution of the growth drivers that we laid out at the recent Barclays conference. While the bulk of our consumer lending initiatives are going to take some time to execute, we've already started putting together the teams for the C&IB growth markets and, in fact, already have Dallas up and running. 
And with that brief update, I'll turn it over to Rob, who's going to take you through a closer look at the numbers, and then, of course, we'll be happy to answer your questions at the end. Rob?"

PNC's third quarter net income was $1 billion or $1.84 per diluted common share. These results reflected revenue growth, driven by higher net interest income and fee income. Expenses remained well managed and our provision declined. Balance sheet information is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. 
Commercial lending was up $597 million from the second quarter, reflecting growth in our large corporate client in our real estate businesses. Consumer lending was essentially flat linked quarter. We did see growth in auto, residential mortgage and credit card, which totaled approximately $400 million during the second quarter. However, that was offset by declines in the nonstrategic consumer portfolio and government-guaranteed education loans. 
Looking at our securities portfolio. We saw growth in both on [ph] average and spot basis, which was commensurate with a higher level of deposits. On an average basis, investment securities increased linked quarter by $1.5 billion or 2%. In total, deposits increased by $4.9 billion, which was also 2%. 
On a spot basis, investment securities increased by $6.7 billion or 9% and total deposits increased by $10.1 billion or 4%. Securities purchases were primarily residential, mortgage-backed and treasuries, a portion of which settled late in the third quarter, resulting in the increase in spot balances relative to average. 
Importantly, our asset sensitivity was not significantly impacted during the quarter, as 1/3 of the purchases were converted to floating rate. 
Average shareholders' equity increased by approximately $200 million linked quarter as we continued to return substantial capital to shareholders. During the third quarter, our capital return totaled $772 million, comprised of $499 million in share repurchases and $273 million in common dividends. This resulted in a payout ratio of approximately 85%. 
Period end common shares outstanding were $488 million, down $22 million or 4% compared to the same time a year ago. As of September 30, 2016, our pro forma Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio fully phased in and using the standardized approach, was estimated to be 10.2%, which was unchanged from June 30, 2016. 
Our tangible book value reached $67.93 per common share as of September 30, a 7% increase compared to the same time a year ago. And our return on average assets for the third quarter was 1.1%. 
As I've already mentioned, and as you can see on Slide 5, net income was $1 billion, and highlights include the following: Total revenue was up $35 million compared to the second quarter, driven by higher net interest income, which increased $27 million in part due to an additional day in the quarter. Noninterest income was up in the quarter as business activity and improved equity markets drove fee income growth of $30 million. 
As expected, expenses continued to be well managed. Noninterest expense increased by $34 million or 1% compared to the second quarter, reflecting increased business activity and the impact of the new FDIC surcharge. Provision for credit losses in the third quarter was $87 million, down $40 million compared with the second quarter, related to the stabilization in our energy-related loans portfolio. The nonenergy component of provision, which was essentially all of our provision in the third quarter, was up $6 million compared to the second quarter, reflecting the gradual normalization of credit costs. 
Finally, our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 25.4%. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. 
Now I will discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail.
Turning to Slide 6. Net interest income increased by $27 million or 1% compared to the second quarter. Core net interest income increased by $29 million, which was driven by an additional day in the quarter and higher earning assets that were partially offset by lower securities yields. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, core net interest income increased $61 million or 3% and included higher securities in loan balances and higher loan yields. 
Net interest margin of 2.68% declined by 2 basis points linked quarter, primarily reflecting the lower securities yields. Purchase accounting accretion was essentially flat linked quarter, as cash recoveries were higher than expected. For the fourth quarter, we expect purchase accounting accretion to be approximately $50 million. 
Turning to Slide 7. Noninterest income and, importantly, fee income, grew over the second quarter. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, total noninterest income grew despite a sizable decline in other income. Year-over-year, we saw strong fee income growth of $77 million or 6%, reflecting the continued success of our efforts across our businesses. Asset management fees, which include our equity investment in BlackRock, increased by 7% both year-over-year and linked quarter, reflecting stronger equity markets and new business activity. 
Consumer services fees remained relatively stable linked quarter compared to the third quarter of last year. Consumer services fees increased by $7 million or 2%, primarily due to higher customer activity, with growth in credit and debit cards. Corporate services fees declined by $14 million or 3% compared to the second quarter as higher Treasury management fees were offset by lower Capital Markets-related revenue and a lower benefit from commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation. 
Compared to the third quarter of last year, corporate services fees grew by $5 million or 1% due to increased customer activity, which included higher treasury management and merger and acquisition advisory fees. 
Residential mortgage noninterest income declined by $5 million or 3% linked quarter, as higher loan sales revenue driven by an increase in origination volume was offset by lower net hedging gains on mortgage servicing rights and lower servicing fees. Mortgage originations increased by 17% linked quarter. 
Compared to the same quarter a year ago, Residential mortgage noninterest income increased by $35 million or 28% as a result of higher loans sales revenue from increased origination volumes, higher servicing revenue and higher net hedging gains. Service charges on deposits increased by $11 million or 7% linked quarter, primarily due to seasonal customer activity. On a year-over-year basis, service charges on deposits remained relatively stable. Of note, with respect to other noninterest income, we had no sales of Visa shares in the third quarter. The year-over-year decline reflected the impact of the net Visa gains in the third quarter of 2015.
Turning to Slide 8. As you know, our expenses have declined 3 years in a row. And through the first 3 quarters of this year, expenses have remained well managed as we continue to invest in technology and business infrastructure. Third quarter expenses increased by $34 million or 1%, which included increased business activity as well as higher FDIC expenses of approximately $25 million, driven by the impact of the new surcharge. 
As we previously stated, our continuous improvement program has a goal to reduce costs by $400 million in 2016. We're now 9 months into the year, and we've completed actions related to capturing more than 75% of our annual goal. As a result, we remain confident we will achieve our full year objectives. 
Through this program, we intend to partially fund the significant investments in our business. Looking ahead, our fourth quarter will be impacted by seasonally higher expenses, which is consistent with prior years. We will also continue to make investments in technology in our Retail Banking and home lending transformations. As a result, we expect fourth quarter expenses to be up low single-digits on a percentage basis compared to the third quarter. 
We continue to expect that our full year 2016 expenses will remain stable with 2015 levels. As you can see on Slide 9, overall credit quality was stable compared to the second quarter. While we experienced stabilization in our energy-related portfolio in the third quarter, our credit quality was impacted by these loans in recent quarters. And as a result, we are continuing to provide the breakout of this portfolio. 
Total nonperforming loans decreased by $118 million or 5% linked quarter with declines across nearly all commercial and consumer categories. Total delinquencies decreased by $5 million compared to the second quarter. Provision for credit losses of $87 million decreased by $40 million linked quarter. Our third quarter provision included $2 million for loans in our energy sector compared to $48 million in the second quarter. The remaining $85 million of our provision for our nonenergy loans included the impact of increases on the consumer side offset by a lower commercial provision, which was driven in part by changes in expected default rates. 
Because of the stabilization in our energy portfolio, we expect our fourth quarter provision to be in the $75 million to $125 million range. Net charge-offs increased $20 million or $154 million in the third quarter. Higher commercial low net charge-offs across various industries were partially offset by lower charge-offs related to loans in the energy sector. 
Our third quarter annualized net charge-off ratio was 29 basis points, up 3 basis points from the second quarter. 
Turning to our energy book on Slide 10. Not much has changed from the information provided last quarter. At the end of the third quarter, our oil, gas and coal portfolios continued to represent a small portion of our outstanding loans, approximately 1.4%, and we view this book as appropriately reserved. And as we stated previously, we continue to monitor market conditions as well as impact to other businesses. 
Barring any dramatic changes in energy prices, we believe the majority of the energy-related credit pressures we've experienced in 2016 have largely subsided. 
In summary, PNC had a successful quarter driven by growth in revenue and well-managed expenses. We grew loans and deposits and continued to deliver significant shareholder returns. We believe the U.S. economy will continue to grow at a steady pace and our plans assume a 25 basis point increase in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve in December. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, and when compared to the third quarter reported results, we expect modest growth in loans, we expect stable net interest income, we expect stable fee income, we expect expenses to be up in the low single-digits and as I stated earlier, we expect provision to be be between $75 million and $125 million. 
With that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

In a prior question, somebody said that we've seen the turn in the corner and we will grow consumer from here. And I don't know that that's the case. But we have seen and continues the growth in credit card and in auto and importantly, inside of auto, we've seen continued accelerated growth in direct auto through our check ready product, which, I guess, I think it's in the first quarter of next year will actually have on mobile. So I think this will accelerate through time, but it's not something that's going to make a dramatic difference in the first half of '17.

I know everybody has a fairly busy morning this morning with all the earnings out, so I'm going to keep my comments very brief before I turn it over to Rob to take you through the numbers. 
Just to lead off. As you've seen this morning, PNC reported net income of $1 billion or $1.84 per diluted common share in the third quarter. You hopefully also saw it was a good, clean quarter with results that are kind of representative of the consistent execution our shareholders have come to expect from us in recent years. 
We grew loans by more than $1 billion, generated strong deposit growth. We had revenue up by $35 million or 1%, driven by both higher net interest income and noninterest income. And we had -- expenses again remained well controlled. And importantly, overall credit quality remained stable with the second quarter. 
Finally, and just briefly, I can assure you that we're hard at work on the execution of the growth drivers that we laid out at the recent Barclays conference. While the bulk of our consumer lending initiatives are going to take some time to execute, we've already started putting together the teams for the C&IB growth markets and, in fact, already have Dallas up and running. 
And with that brief update, I'll turn it over to Rob, who's going to take you through a closer look at the numbers, and then, of course, we'll be happy to answer your questions at the end. Rob?"

PNC's third quarter net income was $1 billion or $1.84 per diluted common share. These results reflected revenue growth, driven by higher net interest income and fee income. Expenses remained well managed and our provision declined. Balance sheet information is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. 
Commercial lending was up $597 million from the second quarter, reflecting growth in our large corporate client in our real estate businesses. Consumer lending was essentially flat linked quarter. We did see growth in auto, residential mortgage and credit card, which totaled approximately $400 million during the second quarter. However, that was offset by declines in the nonstrategic consumer portfolio and government-guaranteed education loans. 
Looking at our securities portfolio. We saw growth on both, on average and spot basis, which was commensurate with a higher level of deposits. On an average basis, investment securities increased linked quarter by $1.5 billion or 2%. In total, deposits increased by $4.9 billion, which was also 2%. 
On a spot basis, investment securities increased by $6.7 billion or 9% and total deposits increased by $10.1 billion or 4%. Securities purchases were primarily residential, mortgage-backed and treasuries, a portion of which settled late in the third quarter, resulting in the increase in spot balances relative to average. 
Importantly, our asset sensitivity was not significantly impacted during the quarter, as 1/3 of the purchases were converted to floating rate. 
Average shareholders' equity increased by approximately $200 million linked quarter as we continued to return substantial capital to shareholders. During the third quarter, our capital return totaled $772 million, comprised of $499 million in share repurchases and $273 million in common dividends. This resulted in a payout ratio of approximately 85%. 
Period end common shares outstanding were $488 million, down $22 million or 4% compared to the same time a year ago. As of September 30, 2016, our pro forma Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio fully phased in and using the standardized approach, was estimated to be 10.2%, which was unchanged from June 30, 2016. 
Our tangible book value reached $67.93 per common share as of September 30, a 7% increase compared to the same time a year ago. And our return on average assets for the third quarter was 1.1%. 
As I've already mentioned, and as you can see on Slide 5, net income was $1 billion, and highlights include the following: Total revenue was up $35 million compared to the second quarter, driven by higher net interest income, which increased $27 million in part due to an additional day in the quarter. Noninterest income was up in the quarter as business activity and improved equity markets drove fee income growth of $30 million. 
As expected, expenses continued to be well managed. Noninterest expense increased by $34 million or 1% compared to the second quarter, reflecting increased business activity and the impact of the new FDIC surcharge. Provision for credit losses in the third quarter was $87 million, down $40 million compared with the second quarter, related to the stabilization in our energy-related loans portfolio. The nonenergy component of provision, which was essentially all of our provision in the third quarter, was up $6 million compared to the second quarter, reflecting the gradual normalization of credit costs. 
Finally, our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 25.4%. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. 
Now I will discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail.
Turning to Slide 6. Net interest income increased by $27 million or 1% compared to the second quarter. Core net interest income increased by $29 million, which was driven by an additional day in the quarter and higher earning assets that were partially offset by lower securities yields. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, core net interest income increased $61 million or 3% and included higher securities in loan balances and higher loan yields. 
Net interest margin of 2.68% declined by 2 basis points linked quarter, primarily reflecting the lower securities yields. Purchase accounting accretion was essentially flat linked quarter, as cash recoveries were higher than expected. For the fourth quarter, we expect purchase accounting accretion to be approximately $50 million. 
Turning to Slide 7. Noninterest income and, importantly, fee income, grew over the second quarter. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, total noninterest income grew despite a sizable decline in other income. Year-over-year, we saw strong fee income growth of $77 million or 6%, reflecting the continued success of our efforts across our businesses. Asset management fees, which include our equity investment in BlackRock, increased by 7% both year-over-year and linked quarter, reflecting stronger equity markets and new business activity. 
Consumer services fees remained relatively stable linked quarter compared to the third quarter of last year. Consumer services fees increased by $7 million or 2%, primarily due to higher customer activity, with growth in credit and debit cards. Corporate services fees declined by $14 million or 3% compared to the second quarter as higher Treasury management fees were offset by lower Capital Markets-related revenue and a lower benefit from commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation. 
Compared to the third quarter of last year, corporate services fees grew by $5 million or 1% due to increased customer activity, which included higher treasury management and merger and acquisition advisory fees. 
Residential mortgage noninterest income declined by $5 million or 3% linked quarter, as higher loan sales revenue driven by an increase in origination volume was offset by lower net hedging gains on mortgage servicing rights and lower servicing fees. Mortgage originations increased by 17% linked quarter. 
Compared to the same quarter a year ago, Residential mortgage noninterest income increased by $35 million or 28% as a result of higher loan sales revenue from increased origination volumes, higher servicing revenue and higher net hedging gains. Service charges on deposits increased by $11 million or 7% linked quarter, primarily due to seasonal customer activity. On a year-over-year basis, service charges on deposits remained relatively stable. Of note, with respect to other noninterest income, we had no sales of Visa shares in the third quarter. The year-over-year decline reflected the impact of the net Visa gains in the third quarter of 2015.
Turning to Slide 8. As you know, our expenses have declined 3 years in a row. And through the first 3 quarters of this year, expenses have remained well managed as we continue to invest in technology and business infrastructure. Third quarter expenses increased by $34 million or 1%, which included increased business activity as well as higher FDIC expenses of approximately $25 million, driven by the impact of the new surcharge. 
As we've previously stated, our continuous improvement program has a goal to reduce costs by $400 million in 2016. We're now 9 months into the year, and we've completed actions related to capturing more than 75% of our annual goal. As a result, we remain confident we will achieve our full year objectives. 
Through this program, we intend to partially fund the significant investments in our business. Looking ahead, our fourth quarter will be impacted by seasonally higher expenses, which is consistent with prior years. We will also continue to make investments in technology, in our Retail Banking and home lending transformations. As a result, we expect fourth quarter expenses to be up low single digits on a percentage basis compared to the third quarter. 
We continue to expect that our full year 2016 expenses will remain stable with 2015 levels. As you can see on Slide 9, overall credit quality was stable compared to the second quarter. While we experienced stabilization in our energy-related portfolio in the third quarter, our credit quality was impacted by these loans in recent quarters, and as a result, we are continuing to provide the breakout of this portfolio. 
Total nonperforming loans decreased by $118 million or 5% linked quarter with declines across nearly all commercial and consumer categories. Total delinquencies decreased by $5 million compared to the second quarter. Provision for credit losses of $87 million decreased by $40 million linked quarter. Our third quarter provision included $2 million for loans in our energy sector compared to $48 million in the second quarter. The remaining $85 million of our provision for our nonenergy loans included the impact of increases on the consumer side, offset by a lower commercial provision, which was driven in part by changes in expected default rates. 
Because of the stabilization in our energy portfolio, we expect our fourth quarter provision to be in the $75 million to $125 million range. Net charge-offs increased $20 million or $154 million in the third quarter. Higher commercial loan net charge-offs across various industries were partially offset by lower charge-offs related to loans in the energy sector. 
Our third quarter annualized net charge-off ratio was 29 basis points, up 3 basis points from the second quarter. 
Turning to our energy book on Slide 10. Not much has changed from the information provided last quarter. At the end of the third quarter, our oil, gas and coal portfolios continued to represent a small portion of our outstanding loans, approximately 1.4%, and we view this book as appropriately reserved. And as we stated previously, we continue to monitor market conditions as well as impact to other businesses. 
Barring any dramatic changes in energy prices, we believe the majority of the energy-related credit pressures we've experienced in 2016 have largely subsided. 
In summary, PNC had a successful quarter, driven by growth in revenue and well-managed expenses. We grew loans and deposits and continued to deliver significant shareholder returns. We believe the U.S. economy will continue to grow at a steady pace, and our plans assume a 25 basis point increase in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve in December. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, and when compared to the third quarter reported results, we expect modest growth in loans, we expect stable net interest income, we expect stable fee income, we expect expenses to be up in the low single digits, and as I stated earlier, we expect provision to be between $75 million and $125 million. 
With that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

So we run the stress against effectively being able to pass the severely adverse and set a buffer on that and say that's the capital we're going to hold. Now, as you know, we've been running a little bit above that. These new changes, the combination of the ability to truncate your capital actions, the fact that they're not going to grow your balance sheet in the back end so your RWA is down and the fact that our, at least, most recent loss has been below their 2.5% kind of give us a lot of room here."

I know everybody has a fairly busy morning this morning with all the earnings out, so I'm going to keep my comments very brief before I turn it over to Rob to take you through the numbers. 
Just to lead off. As you've seen this morning, PNC reported net income of $1 billion or $1.84 per diluted common share in the third quarter. You hopefully also saw it was a good, clean quarter with results that are kind of representative of the consistent execution our shareholders have come to expect from us in recent years. 
We grew loans by more than $1 billion, generated strong deposit growth. We had revenue up by $35 million or 1%, driven by both higher net interest income and noninterest income. And we had -- expenses again remained well controlled. And importantly, overall credit quality remained stable with the second quarter. 
Finally, and just briefly, I can assure you that we're hard at work on the execution of the growth drivers that we laid out at the recent Barclays conference. While the bulk of our consumer lending initiatives are going to take some time to execute, we've already started putting together the teams for the C&IB growth markets and, in fact, already have Dallas up and running. 
And with that brief update, I'll turn it over to Rob, who's going to take you through a closer look at the numbers, and then, of course, we'll be happy to answer your questions at the end. Rob?"

PNC's third quarter net income was $1 billion or $1.84 per diluted common share. These results reflected revenue growth, driven by higher net interest income and fee income. Expenses remained well managed and our provision declined. Balance sheet information is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. 
Commercial lending was up $597 million from the second quarter, reflecting growth in our large corporate client in our real estate businesses. Consumer lending was essentially flat linked quarter. We did see growth in auto, residential mortgage and credit card, which totaled approximately $400 million during the second quarter. However, that was offset by declines in the nonstrategic consumer portfolio and government-guaranteed education loans. 
Looking at our securities portfolio. We saw growth on both, on average and spot basis, which was commensurate with a higher level of deposits. On an average basis, investment securities increased linked quarter by $1.5 billion or 2%. In total, deposits increased by $4.9 billion, which was also 2%. 
On a spot basis, investment securities increased by $6.7 billion or 9% and total deposits increased by $10.1 billion or 4%. Securities purchases were primarily residential, mortgage-backed and treasuries, a portion of which settled late in the third quarter, resulting in the increase in spot balances relative to average. 
Importantly, our asset sensitivity was not significantly impacted during the quarter, as 1/3 of the purchases were converted to floating rate. 
Average shareholders' equity increased by approximately $200 million linked quarter as we continued to return substantial capital to shareholders. During the third quarter, our capital return totaled $772 million, comprised of $499 million in share repurchases and $273 million in common dividends. This resulted in a payout ratio of approximately 85%. 
Period end common shares outstanding were $488 million, down $22 million or 4% compared to the same time a year ago. As of September 30, 2016, our pro forma Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio fully phased in and using the standardized approach, was estimated to be 10.2%, which was unchanged from June 30, 2016. 
Our tangible book value reached $67.93 per common share as of September 30, a 7% increase compared to the same time a year ago. And our return on average assets for the third quarter was 1.1%. 
As I've already mentioned, and as you can see on Slide 5, net income was $1 billion, and highlights include the following: Total revenue was up $35 million compared to the second quarter, driven by higher net interest income, which increased $27 million in part due to an additional day in the quarter. Noninterest income was up in the quarter as business activity and improved equity markets drove fee income growth of $13 million. 
As expected, expenses continued to be well managed. Noninterest expense increased by $34 million or 1% compared to the second quarter, reflecting increased business activity and the impact of the new FDIC surcharge. Provision for credit losses in the third quarter was $87 million, down $40 million compared with the second quarter, related to the stabilization in our energy-related loans portfolio. The nonenergy component of provision, which was essentially all of our provision in the third quarter, was up $6 million compared to the second quarter, reflecting the gradual normalization of credit costs. 
Finally, our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 25.4%. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. 
Now I will discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail.
Turning to Slide 6. Net interest income increased by $27 million or 1% compared to the second quarter. Core net interest income increased by $29 million, which was driven by an additional day in the quarter and higher earning assets that were partially offset by lower securities yields. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, core net interest income increased $61 million or 3% and included higher securities and loan balances and higher loan yields. 
Net interest margin of 2.68% declined by 2 basis points linked quarter, primarily reflecting the lower securities yields. Purchase accounting accretion was essentially flat linked quarter, as cash recoveries were higher than expected. For the fourth quarter, we expect purchase accounting accretion to be approximately $50 million. 
Turning to Slide 7. Noninterest income and, importantly, fee income, grew over the second quarter. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, total noninterest income grew despite a sizable decline in other income. Year-over-year, we saw strong fee income growth of $77 million or 6%, reflecting the continued success of our efforts across our businesses. Asset management fees, which include our equity investment in BlackRock, increased by 7% both year-over-year and linked quarter, reflecting stronger equity markets and new business activity. 
Consumer services fees remained relatively stable linked quarter compared to the third quarter of last year. Consumer services fees increased by $7 million or 2%, primarily due to higher customer activity, with growth in credit and debit cards. Corporate services fees declined by $14 million or 3% compared to the second quarter as higher Treasury management fees were offset by lower Capital Markets-related revenue and a lower benefit from commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation. 
Compared to the third quarter of last year, corporate services fees grew by $5 million or 1% due to increased customer activity, which included higher treasury management and merger and acquisition advisory fees. 
Residential mortgage noninterest income declined by $5 million or 3% linked quarter, as higher loan sales revenue driven by an increase in origination volume was offset by lower net hedging gains on mortgage servicing rights and lower servicing fees. Mortgage originations increased by 17% linked quarter. 
Compared to the same quarter a year ago, Residential mortgage noninterest income increased by $35 million or 28% as a result of higher loan sales revenue from increased origination volumes, higher servicing revenue and higher net hedging gains. Service charges on deposits increased by $11 million or 7% linked quarter, primarily due to seasonal customer activity. On a year-over-year basis, service charges on deposits remained relatively stable. Of note, with respect to other noninterest income, we had no sales of Visa shares in the third quarter. The year-over-year decline reflected the impact of the net Visa gains in the third quarter of 2015.
Turning to Slide 8. As you know, our expenses have declined 3 years in a row. And through the first 3 quarters of this year, expenses have remained well managed as we continue to invest in technology and business infrastructure. Third quarter expenses increased by $34 million or 1%, which included increased business activity as well as higher FDIC expenses of approximately $25 million, driven by the impact of the new surcharge. 
As we've previously stated, our continuous improvement program has a goal to reduce costs by $400 million in 2016. We're now 9 months into the year, and we've completed actions related to capturing more than 75% of our annual goal. As a result, we remain confident we will achieve our full year objectives. 
Through this program, we intend to partially fund the significant investments in our business. Looking ahead, our fourth quarter will be impacted by seasonally higher expenses, which is consistent with prior years. We will also continue to make investments in technology, in our Retail Banking and home lending transformations. As a result, we expect fourth quarter expenses to be up low single digits on a percentage basis compared to the third quarter. 
We continue to expect that our full year 2016 expenses will remain stable with 2015 levels. As you can see on Slide 9, overall credit quality was stable compared to the second quarter. While we experienced stabilization in our energy-related portfolio in the third quarter, our credit quality was impacted by these loans in recent quarters, and as a result, we are continuing to provide the breakout of this portfolio. 
Total nonperforming loans decreased by $118 million or 5% linked quarter with declines across nearly all commercial and consumer categories. Total delinquencies decreased by $5 million compared to the second quarter. Provision for credit losses of $87 million decreased by $40 million linked quarter. Our third quarter provision included $2 million for loans in our energy sector compared to $48 million in the second quarter. The remaining $85 million of our provision for our nonenergy loans included the impact of increases on the consumer side, offset by a lower commercial provision, which was driven in part by changes in expected default rates. 
Because of the stabilization in our energy portfolio, we expect our fourth quarter provision to be in the $75 million to $125 million range. Net charge-offs increased $20 million or $154 million in the third quarter. Higher commercial loan net charge-offs across various industries were partially offset by lower charge-offs related to loans in the energy sector. 
Our third quarter annualized net charge-off ratio was 29 basis points, up 3 basis points from the second quarter. 
Turning to our energy book on Slide 10. Not much has changed from the information provided last quarter. At the end of the third quarter, our oil, gas and coal portfolios continued to represent a small portion of our outstanding loans, approximately 1.4%, and we view this book as appropriately reserved. And as we stated previously, we continue to monitor market conditions as well as impact to other businesses. 
Barring any dramatic changes in energy prices, we believe the majority of the energy-related credit pressures we've experienced in 2016 have largely subsided. 
In summary, PNC had a successful quarter, driven by growth in revenue and well-managed expenses. We grew loans and deposits and continued to deliver significant shareholder returns. We believe the U.S. economy will continue to grow at a steady pace, and our plans assume a 25 basis point increase in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve in December. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, and when compared to the third quarter reported results, we expect modest growth in loans, we expect stable net interest income, we expect stable fee income, we expect expenses to be up in the low single digits, and as I stated earlier, we expect provision to be between $75 million and $125 million. 
With that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."

Just to lead off. As you've seen this morning, PNC reported net income of $1 billion or $1.84 per diluted common share in the third quarter. You hopefully also saw it was a good, clean quarter with results that are kind of representative of the consistent execution our shareholders have come to expect from us in recent years. 
We grew loans by more than $1 billion, generated strong deposit growth. We had revenue up by $35 million or 1%, driven by both higher net interest income and noninterest income. And we had -- expenses again remained well controlled. And importantly, overall credit quality remained stable with the second quarter. 
Finally, and just briefly, I can assure you that we're hard at work on the execution of the growth drivers that we laid out at the recent Barclays conference. While the bulk of our consumer lending initiatives are going to take some time to execute, we've already started putting together the teams for the C&IB growth markets and, in fact, already have Dallas up and running. 
And with that brief update, I'll turn it over to Rob, who's going to take you through a closer look at the numbers, and then, of course, we'll be happy to answer your questions at the end. Rob?"
294585,379466793,1055712,"The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 14, 2016",2016-10-14,"Earnings Calls","The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.","Executives","Great.

PNC's third quarter net income was $1 billion or $1.84 per diluted common share. These results reflected revenue growth, driven by higher net interest income and fee income. Expenses remained well managed and our provision declined. Balance sheet information is on Slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. 
Commercial lending was up $597 million from the second quarter, reflecting growth in our large corporate client in our real estate businesses. Consumer lending was essentially flat linked quarter. We did see growth in auto, residential mortgage and credit card, which totaled approximately $400 million during the second quarter. However, that was offset by declines in the nonstrategic consumer portfolio and government-guaranteed education loans. 
Looking at our securities portfolio. We saw growth on both, on average and spot basis, which was commensurate with a higher level of deposits. On an average basis, investment securities increased linked quarter by $1.5 billion or 2%. In total, deposits increased by $4.9 billion, which was also 2%. 
On a spot basis, investment securities increased by $6.7 billion or 9% and total deposits increased by $10.1 billion or 4%. Securities purchases were primarily residential, mortgage-backed and treasuries, a portion of which settled late in the third quarter, resulting in the increase in spot balances relative to average. 
Importantly, our asset sensitivity was not significantly impacted during the quarter, as 1/3 of the purchases were converted to floating rate. 
Average shareholders' equity increased by approximately $200 million linked quarter as we continued to return substantial capital to shareholders. During the third quarter, our capital return totaled $772 million, comprised of $499 million in share repurchases and $273 million in common dividends. This resulted in a payout ratio of approximately 85%. 
Period end common shares outstanding were $488 million, down $22 million or 4% compared to the same time a year ago. As of September 30, 2016, our pro forma Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio fully phased in and using the standardized approach, was estimated to be 10.2%, which was unchanged from June 30, 2016. 
Our tangible book value reached $67.93 per common share as of September 30, a 7% increase compared to the same time a year ago. And our return on average assets for the third quarter was 1.1%. 
As I've already mentioned, and as you can see on Slide 5, net income was $1 billion, and highlights include the following: Total revenue was up $35 million compared to the second quarter, driven by higher net interest income, which increased $27 million in part due to an additional day in the quarter. Noninterest income was up in the quarter as business activity and improved equity markets drove fee income growth of $13 million. 
As expected, expenses continued to be well managed. Noninterest expense increased by $34 million or 1% compared to the second quarter, reflecting increased business activity and the impact of the new FDIC surcharge. Provision for credit losses in the third quarter was $87 million, down $40 million compared with the second quarter, related to the stabilization in our energy-related loans portfolio. The nonenergy component of provision, which was essentially all of our provision in the third quarter, was up $6 million compared to the second quarter, reflecting the gradual normalization of credit costs. 
Finally, our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 25.4%. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. 
Now I will discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail.
Turning to Slide 6. Net interest income increased by $27 million or 1% compared to the second quarter. Core net interest income increased by $29 million, which was driven by an additional day in the quarter and higher earning assets that were partially offset by lower securities yields. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, core net interest income increased $61 million or 3% and included higher securities and loan balances and higher loan yields. 
Net interest margin of 2.68% declined by 2 basis points linked quarter, primarily reflecting the lower securities yields. Purchase accounting accretion was essentially flat linked quarter, as cash recoveries were higher than expected. For the fourth quarter, we expect purchase accounting accretion to be approximately $50 million. 
Turning to Slide 7. Noninterest income and, importantly, fee income, grew over the second quarter. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, total noninterest income grew despite a sizable decline in other income. Year-over-year, we saw strong fee income growth of $77 million or 6%, reflecting the continued success of our efforts across our businesses. Asset management fees, which include our equity investment in BlackRock, increased by 7% both year-over-year and linked quarter, reflecting stronger equity markets and new business activity. 
Consumer services fees remained relatively stable linked quarter compared to the third quarter of last year. Consumer services fees increased by $7 million or 2%, primarily due to higher customer activity, with growth in credit and debit cards. Corporate services fees declined by $14 million or 3% compared to the second quarter as higher Treasury management fees were offset by lower Capital Markets-related revenue and a lower benefit from commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation. 
Compared to the third quarter of last year, corporate services fees grew by $5 million or 1% due to increased customer activity, which included higher treasury management and merger and acquisition advisory fees. 
Residential mortgage noninterest income declined by $5 million or 3% linked quarter, as higher loan sales revenue driven by an increase in origination volume was offset by lower net hedging gains on mortgage servicing rights and lower servicing fees. Mortgage originations increased by 17% linked quarter. 
Compared to the same quarter a year ago, Residential mortgage noninterest income increased by $35 million or 28% as a result of higher loan sales revenue from increased origination volumes, higher servicing revenue and higher net hedging gains. Service charges on deposits increased by $11 million or 7% linked quarter, primarily due to seasonal customer activity. On a year-over-year basis, service charges on deposits remained relatively stable. Of note, with respect to other noninterest income, we had no sales of Visa shares in the third quarter. The year-over-year decline reflected the impact of the net Visa gains in the third quarter of 2015.
Turning to Slide 8. As you know, our expenses have declined 3 years in a row. And through the first 3 quarters of this year, expenses have remained well managed as we continue to invest in technology and business infrastructure. Third quarter expenses increased by $34 million or 1%, which included increased business activity as well as higher FDIC expenses of approximately $25 million, driven by the impact of the new surcharge. 
As we've previously stated, our continuous improvement program has a goal to reduce costs by $400 million in 2016. We're now 9 months into the year, and we've completed actions related to capturing more than 75% of our annual goal. As a result, we remain confident we will achieve our full year objectives. 
Through this program, we intend to partially fund the significant investments in our business. Looking ahead, our fourth quarter will be impacted by seasonally higher expenses, which is consistent with prior years. We will also continue to make investments in technology, in our Retail Banking and home lending transformations. As a result, we expect fourth quarter expenses to be up low single digits on a percentage basis compared to the third quarter. 
We continue to expect that our full year 2016 expenses will remain stable with 2015 levels. As you can see on Slide 9, overall credit quality was stable compared to the second quarter. While we experienced stabilization in our energy-related portfolio in the third quarter, our credit quality was impacted by these loans in recent quarters, and as a result, we are continuing to provide the breakout of this portfolio. 
Total nonperforming loans decreased by $118 million or 5% linked quarter with declines across nearly all commercial and consumer categories. Total delinquencies decreased by $5 million compared to the second quarter. Provision for credit losses of $87 million decreased by $40 million linked quarter. Our third quarter provision included $2 million for loans in our energy sector compared to $48 million in the second quarter. The remaining $85 million of our provision for our nonenergy loans included the impact of increases on the consumer side, offset by a lower commercial provision, which was driven in part by changes in expected default rates. 
Because of the stabilization in our energy portfolio, we expect our fourth quarter provision to be in the $75 million to $125 million range. Net charge-offs increased $20 million or $154 million in the third quarter. Higher commercial loan net charge-offs across various industries were partially offset by lower charge-offs related to loans in the energy sector. 
Our third quarter annualized net charge-off ratio was 29 basis points, up 3 basis points from the second quarter. 
Turning to our energy book on Slide 10. Not much has changed from the information provided last quarter. At the end of the third quarter, our oil, gas and coal portfolios continued to represent a small portion of our outstanding loans, approximately 1.4%, and we view this book as appropriately reserved. And as we stated previously, we continue to monitor market conditions as well as impact to other businesses. 
Barring any dramatic changes in energy prices, we believe the majority of the energy-related credit pressures we've experienced in 2016 have largely subsided. 
In summary, PNC had a successful quarter, driven by growth in revenue and well-managed expenses. We grew loans and deposits and continued to deliver significant shareholder returns. We believe the U.S. economy will continue to grow at a steady pace, and our plans assume a 25 basis point increase in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve in December. 
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, and when compared to the third quarter reported results, we expect modest growth in loans, we expect stable net interest income, we expect stable fee income, we expect expenses to be up in the low single digits, and as I stated earlier, we expect provision to be between $75 million and $125 million. 
With that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions."
