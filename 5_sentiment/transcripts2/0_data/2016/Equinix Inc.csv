Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. 2015 was a transformational year for Equinix.

Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. 2015 was a transformational year for Equinix. We delivered accelerated growth, expanded our global platform with 2 strategic acquisitions, completed our first year operating as a REIT and established ourselves as a foundation for the cloud ecosystem that continues to drive IT transformation. 
Our strong financial performance reflects our position as the global leader in retail co-location and interconnection, truly serving as the place where opportunity connects for leading networks, clouds, content providers and enterprises. We continue to extend our market-leading network density attracting wireline, wireless and increasingly, subsea carriers who are using Platform Equinix to efficiently interconnect and serve their end customers. 
Our data centers act as a powerful commerce center for the largest service providers to reach their customers and are positioning us to capture the enterprise as they implement next-generation IT architectures. We will further leverage our leadership position through the integration of Telecity and Bit-isle and scale the business to drive even more value for our combined customers. 
Before I turn to the quarterly results, I'd like to reflect on a few of the meaningful milestones we achieved in 2015. Starting with financial performance on Slide 3. With another year of record bookings activity in 2015, we generated over $2.7 billion of revenue, up 16% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. We delivered over $1.27 billion of adjusted EBITDA or a 47% margin, an over 100 basis point improvement over last year while continuing to invest in the business. This drove AFFO growth of 25% on a normalized and constant currency basis, exceeding our prior guidance after adjusting for the Telecity transaction-related FX loss. 
Second, it was a phenomenal year for our interconnection solutions. Interconnection revenue continues to outpace overall revenue, growing 20% year-over-year on a constant currency organic basis. With over 171,000 cross connects, 3,300 ports on our Internet exchange and dramatic growth on our Cloud Exchange, we are benefiting from the strong secular trends that are driving businesses to become increasingly interconnected. 
Third, we significantly expanded our global platform both organically and inorganically. Equinix completed 20 major IBX expansions in 2015, creating the needed capacity to support strong fill rates in high demand markets. 
Overall, our development activity continues to generate highly attractive returns and healthy yield on our sizable base of stabilized assets. With the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, we further expanded Platform Equinix, which now spans 145 data centers across 40 metros and 21 countries. Combined, Equinix now operates over 14 million gross square feet of co-location space, enhancing our position as the largest retail data center footprint in the world.
Fourth, we continue to establish Equinix as the home of the interconnected cloud, which in turn is attracting enterprises that are adopting hybrid and multi-cloud as their IT architecture of choice. Key cloud customers, including Amazon, Cisco, IBM, Microsoft and Oracle, to mention a few, are all using Equinix to scale their infrastructure globally and are now deployed across an average of 17 markets. 
And finally, we successfully completed our first year operating as a REIT and returned $394 million back to our shareholders. We were included in the S&P 500, the MSCI RMZ and the FTSE NAREIT indices, reflection of our position as both a technology leader and as the largest data center REIT. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet, raising $2.6 billion in debt and equity in the fourth quarter, fortifying our capital structure while providing a strong liquidity position.
Now turning to the quarter. We had a great finish to the year, delivering record bookings in the fourth quarter with particular strength in the Americas and robust metrics, including our highest-ever interconnection activity and very firm yield per cabinet. We continue to take market share, capture an outsized portion of the new infrastructure deployments from both clouds and enterprises. 
The quality and scale of our wins continues to increase, and we are proud that over 140 of the Fortune 500 are Equinix customers. Our geographic reach remains critical to customers, with over 55% of our revenue coming from customers deployed globally across all 3 regions and over 84% from customers deployed across multiple metros.
Our global platform is increasingly defensible, durable and hard to replicate with regards to reach and capacity as well as performance. With the addition of the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, we added 40 data centers and 1,100 people across Europe and Japan. This scale positions us well to build market leadership, increase capacity, enhanced cloud and network density and grow customer ecosystems for years to come. 
With Telecity, we've added 7 new metro markets to our portfolio, creating a large opportunity for current Equinix customers to expand further north and east across EMEA. Additionally, there are over 500 customers of former Telecity that have business presence in another country where Platform Equinix resides, creating a potential for powerful cross-selling opportunities as we integrate. We are confident both these transactions will drive significant long-term value creation for our customers and our partners.
Now let me cover quarterly highlights from our industry verticals. Starting with the network vertical. This customer base continues to grow as we enhance ecosystems in which networks and mobile providers can participate and grow their businesses. Strong global bandwidth demand is driving a resurgence of subsea cable projects, creating new opportunities for Equinix. These service providers are accelerating returns by terminating cables directly into our IBXs where they can further benefit by gaining access to key business ecosystems. 
In the content digital media vertical, content customers are expanding across our global platform to meet the continued explosion of consumer demand for digital content and applications. The advertising subsegment remains the fastest growth driver in this vertical as digital advertising takes share from traditional channels. 
Customers expanding this quarter include AppNexus, which optimizes programmatic digital advertising; AudienceScience, a global advertising technology and services company; and Criteo, a French company specializing in performance marketing. 
Turning to the financial services vertical. In addition to our strong electronic trading ecosystem, we continue to diversify across subsegments, including insurance, wealth management and banking, which contributed to record bookings for the quarter. New wins include a top 20 private wealth management firm initiating a multi-cloud strategy to speed to market; a Fortune 500 asset management company that is connecting to clouds over our Equinix Cloud Exchange; and a partner-led deal with a top 10 insurance firm based in Europe.
In cloud and IT services, the cloud ecosystem delivered strong growth this quarter, driven by key Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers such as AWS and Microsoft as well as momentum with Software-as-a-Service providers who represent the fastest-growing subsegment of this vertical. SaaS customer expansions include ServiceNow, an IT service management provider; and Shape Security, an advanced application defense provider that offers security services for cloud exchange clients. We continue to see momentum on our Cloud Exchange and have over 300 enterprises clouds, IT service providers and networks interconnecting using our solution.
Turning to the enterprise. The enterprise vertical delivered strong bookings as businesses seek to re-architect IT to adapt rapidly changing business requirements. By leveraging an interconnection-oriented architecture, enterprises can address multiple IT challenges and solve for the cost, scaling and performance needs of today's digital world. 
For the second quarter, enterprise was the largest source of new customer adds, with particular traction in manufacturing and Professional Services. New wins include Polo Ralph Laurent, a premium clothing and lifestyle brand; Granite Construction, an S&P 500 civil general contractor and construction material producer; and Cosmetics, a Swedish cosmetic manufacturer. 
Over 300 customers have deployed our Performance Hub solution, which is an extremely attractive entry point for enterprise customers who seek to optimize network architectures and also access the cloud and drive application performance. And we are already enjoying significant upsell in cross-sell traction with these customers. So let me stop here and turn it over to Keith to cover some more specifics for the quarter."
28202,321490066,936434,"Equinix, Inc.

Let me start by saying from so many points of view, Q4 was the best quarter we have experienced to date. The momentum in our organic business, combined with Telecity and Bit-isle, sets us up nicel",2074,"Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Let me start by saying from so many points of view, Q4 was the best quarter we have experienced to date. The momentum in our organic business, combined with Telecity and Bit-isle, sets us up nicely for 2016 as well as our initial look through into 2017. 
And with my prepared remarks, I'll first review our full year 2015 results then I'll provide some commentary on key metrics for '16, which have a number of moving parts. Finally, I'll wrap up with some high-level comments on the fourth quarter.
So starting with revenues. We reported revenues of over $2.72 billion for 2015, a 16% year-over-year normalized and constant currency growth rate, a clear demonstration of our ability to drive outsized growth as we benefit from the scale of our global platform as well as enjoy record nonrecurring revenue activity. And we believe this momentum will continue into 2016. 
We expect to deliver normalized and constant currency growth of greater than 13% for our organic business and over $540 million of revenues from Telecity and Bit-isle at current exchange rates. We believe the Telecity business, net of the expected divestitures, will grow revenues between 8% and 9% in 2016, while Bit-isle's revenues will remain essentially flat year-over-year, consistent with our expectations while we look to optimize this business over the next 24 months.
In 2015, we improved our organic adjusted EBITDA margin by over 100 basis points to 46.7%. And as we continue to scale the business, we expect to deliver another 100 basis points of improvement on the organic business in 2016 as we maintain disciplined and focused on our spending initiatives. 
Another key driver to our continued margin improvement is the healthy price yield derived from a disciplined pricing initiative and strong interconnection activity. For 2016, we expect our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins to be greater than 47.3%, excluding integration costs or 45.6% on an as-reported basis.
Our 2015 pro forma AFFO, which excludes the impact of the Telecity FX losses and the integration costs, was $905 million, significantly higher than expected for the year. Looking forward on a normalized and constant currency basis, 2016 AFFO is expected to grow greater than 23% over the prior year.
With respect to the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, we're very excited about these acquisitions and the ability to strengthen our market position. That said, I want to highlight a few areas recognizing we'll be incurring some costs that won't be part of the ongoing business, thereby allowing you to better understand the combined business on a go-forward basis. 
So let me start with FX. We elected to hedge the cash portion of the Telecity purchase price. In effect, we locked in the dollar value of this sizable deal. This resulted in an FX loss of $61 million in 2015, with $49 million of the loss being recognized in Q4. These losses impacted our AFFO metric for both Q3 and Q4 and for the year. 
For Q1, as we completed the purchase of the Telecity acquisition, we experienced an incremental $50 million loss in the quarter. Again, this loss will impact our Q1 and 2016 AFFO metric. Finally, it's important to note that the offset to the Telecity FX losses is a corresponding reduction to the purchase price of Telecity. 
For both Telecity and Bit-isle, we've begun the integration process to combined the teams, the organizations and the systems together. We expect to incur $58 million in integration costs in 2016, as anticipated in our investment models, with an approximate $20 million of additional integration costs being spent in 2017.
These costs support systems work, of significance, employees costs, including severance and retention and substantial organizational restructuring in support of our REIT and other tax initiatives. We expect incremental revenue, cost and CapEx synergies from the acquisitions from Telecity and Bit-isle as we integrate these businesses. 
Our current revenue guidance contemplates modest revenue synergy assumptions this year, which we expect to ramp up over time as both Equinix and Telecity customers leverage the expanded footprint service portfolio and rich ecosystems of the combined company. As we progress with our integration efforts, we also expect to achieve $30 million in annual cost savings, with about 50% of these savings being realized before the end of this year and the rest coming in 2017.
For CapEx synergies, the available Bit-isle inventory has positioned us well in the Tokyo market, allowing us to defer significant capital spend to other projects, while the Telecity capacity in our overlapping markets allows us to free up capital to be deployed in other markets, both in Europe and across the platform.
And as previously announced, we need to divest 8 assets from the combined Equinix Telecity EMEA business, with a target divestiture date of mid-2016. In light of the current momentum in the business and the size of the market opportunity in front of us, it is our intention to reinvest the divestiture proceeds back into the business. We currently believe this is the highest and best use of our capital. We believe this allows us to maximize both our short- and longer-term shareholder value objectives while driving -- I'm sorry, while providing us the strategic and operational flexibility we've historically enjoyed, particularly during volatile times. And these proceeds, along with capital raised in November, should allow us to self-fund the business for the foreseeable future despite our increased expansion activities and anticipated growing cash dividend.
From an AFFO perspective, the value of these acquisitions and our AFFO generating potential is better than our original assumptions. With a view towards 2017, we expect these acquisitions on a combined basis to be accretive to Equinix's AFFO per share for the 2017 reporting year excluding the integration costs. 
So turning to the fourth quarter. It was another terrific quarter at Equinix. Our strategy continues to deliver better-than-expected results across the company. At the global level, we had record gross and net bookings, with particular strength in the financial services and enterprise verticals. Our interconnection metrics were again outstanding as we added 7,500 cross connects and 162 exchange ports this quarter. Our MRR per cab on an FX-neutral basis was very firm, and we remain well positioned across each of our operating regions.
As depicted on Slide 4, global Q4 revenues were $730.5 million, our 52nd consecutive quarter of top line revenue growth, up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 17% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our as-reported revenues include $21.6 million of Bit-isle revenue from November and December, consistent with our expectations and the investment model. 
Q4 organic revenue, net of our FX hedges, absorbs an $8 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter and a $4 million negative currency impact when compared to our FX guidance rates. Currency, volatility against the majority of our key operating currencies continue to cause significant FX headwinds. For 2016, the strength in U.S. dollar creates a $51 million FX headwind against revenues and a $29 million headwind against adjusted EBITDA for our organic business when compared to the average FX raised -- rates used in 2015.
For Europe, we've hedged over 85% of our Equinix organic business. Given the growth of the international businesses, including Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, we expect our revenue mix to shift such as greater than 50% of our revenues will be generated from outside the U.S.
Global adjusted EBITDA was $333.1 million, up 4% over the prior quarter and 20% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant currency basis. Our normalized adjusted EBITDA margin was 46.4% and includes $2.8 million in integration costs. Our Q4 organic adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a negative $5.4 million currency impact when compared to the average FX rates last quarter and a $1.2 million negative impact when compared to our guidance rates.
Global AFFO was $178 million. Excluding the Telecity foreign currency loss and acquisition-related costs, AFFO on a normalized and constant currency basis increased 4% over the prior quarter, above the top end of our guidance range by $13 million, largely due to lower-than-expected cash taxes. 
And finally, moving to churn. Total MRR churn for Q4 was 2.3%, consistent with our prior guidance and weighted towards the end of the quarter. For 2016, we expect our quarterly MRR churn to remain in our targeted 2% to 2.5% quarterly range. 
I'd like to provide some highlights on the regions, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 to 7. All 3 regions delivered better-than-expected revenues, with EMEA and Asia Pacific showing normalized and constant currency growth of 20% and 25% respectively, while the Americas region produced growth of 13% on its much larger base. 
The Americas region had a great quarter, delivering record bookings driven by the financial and enterprise verticals, very firm yield per cabinet and the best interconnection quarter of all time. EMEA delivered another strong quarter of bookings, with particular strength in our French and German markets, while Asia Pacific continued its rapid growth as customers deployed across the region with gross bookings driven by cloud and IT services, enterprise and network verticals.
Interconnection revenues continued to outpace overall growth of the business, with the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific interconnection revenues now at 22%, 10% and 13%, respectively, of the recurring revenues.
And now looking at the balance sheet, please refer to Slide 8. Unrestricted cash and investments increased this quarter to $2.2 billion due to the successful financings in November on a restricted cash balances totaled $490 million, largely due to the escrow funds related to the Telecity deal. 
Our year-end net debt leverage ratio was 3.2x at Q4 and annualized adjusted EBITDA although steps up to greater than 4x after funding the cash portion of the Telecity transaction. Given the favorable cash flow attributes of the business model, we expect the Equinix calculated leverage ratio to return to the higher end of our targeted 3x to 4x adjusted EBITDA over the next 12 to 18 months.
Now switching to AFFO and dividends on Slide 9. For 2016, we expect our as-reported AFFO to be greater than $970 million, a 17% year-over-year increase. On a normalized and constant currency basis, AFFO would be greater than $1.078 billion or a 23% increase over the prior year.
Turning to dividends. Today, we announced our Q1 dividend of $1.75 a share, a 3.6% increase over the prior cash dividend per share. For 2016, our projected total cash dividends to be paid will increase to approximately $500 million, a 27% increase over the prior year. Our normalized AFFO payout ratio will approximate 52% in 2016. 
Our estimated share count for 2016 approximate 70.5 million shares, including 6.9 million shares issued to Telecity shareholders and 1.96 million shares expected to be issued in June 2016 to our convertible debt holders.
We continue to believe that both organic and inorganic growth will be the primary ingredient for a steadily growing cash dividend. And we've maintained the flexibility to move additional entities from the taxable REIT structure to the qualified REIT structure over time. 
Now looking at capital expenditures, please refer to Slide 10. For the quarter, our capital expenditures were $281 million, including recurring CapEx of $45 million, slightly higher than guidance due to the timing of cash payments to our contractors. We now have 14 [ph] expansion projects underway. 
For 2016, we expect 95% of expansion capital to be allocated to campus or existing market builds and 5% for new market development. Given the strong performance at our key markets, we expect to move forward with additional expansion phases in Ashburn, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Silicon Valley and a new flagship build in the Amsterdam Science Park, an interconnection hub. 
Also, given our high utilization rate of 81% and increasing as well as strong development returns, we expect 2016 CapEx to range between $900 million and $1 billion, which contemplates several new first phase IBX builds on our core Equinix owned campuses, including Ashburn and Silicon Valley as well as a number of non-U.S. campuses. 
And finally, we've provided you a number of slides that bridge the normalized 2015 performance to our 2016 guidance, including slides for revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Please refer to Slides 13 to 17. These slides also include the contributions from Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions."

Let me now cover our 2016 strategy on Slide 12. Our strategic priorities remain centered on driving growth by pressing our competitive advantage and investing to capture significant opportunities, such as the cloud-enabled enterprise.",540,"Okay. Thanks, Keith. Let me now cover our 2016 strategy on Slide 12. Our strategic priorities remain centered on driving growth by pressing our competitive advantage and investing to capture significant opportunities, such as the cloud-enabled enterprise. We will allocate capital towards these high-value opportunities and in turn will strengthen our economic model. 
In the near term, we will focus our energy on successfully integrating Telecity and Bit-isle and growing our market leadership globally. Organically, our efforts will be focused on capturing the enterprise through a series of initiatives to build cloud density, create and deploy innovative product solutions, generate demand in targeted segments and provide Professional Services focused on enabling the adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud. 
We will also continue to ramp our channel program to enhance our reach and to the enterprise through agents, resellers, systems integrators and key platform partners. Over the longer term, interconnection will continue to be the essence of our advantage, and Equinix is well positioned to become the intersection point between the Internet of Things, clouds, networks and the enterprises. 
We are making meaningful investments to foster new ecosystems to capture this opportunity, and we'll continue to invest in scaling our systems and processes and evolving our capabilities in response to these customer needs. 
Based on what we see in the market and the steps we are taking at Equinix to capitalize on these opportunities, I continue to be very optimistic about our future. And last on Slide 18, which summarizes our Q1 and full year 2016 guidance, including FX impacts. Let me cover a few thoughts on our 2016 outlook. 
First, we continue to deliver another solid year of growth. For the full year of 2016, we expect revenues to be greater than $3.55 billion, a 30% growth on an as-reported basis or a normalized and constant currency growth rate of greater than 13% year-over-year. 
Second, our organic adjusted EBITDA margin continues to improve as we drive increased efficiency into the business and scale our operating model. For 2016, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be greater than $1.62 billion or 16% year-over-year growth on a normalized and constant currency basis. This includes a 100 basis point adjusted EBITDA margin improvement for the Equinix organic business. 
And the growth of our business is driving increased adjusted funds from operations and ultimately cash flow and dividends. AFFO normalized for the Telecity transaction-related FX loss is expected to be greater than $1.078 billion, a 23% growth year-over-year, demonstrating the health of the business model. 
And finally, given our strong pipeline, firm yield and healthy returns, we continue to invest in our business and expect 2016 capital expenditures to range between $900 million and $1 billion for the year. 
So in closing, the strength of our business is translating into solid revenue growth, firm yield and healthy margins, all of which combine to give us the financial firepower to continue to invest in our global platform and develop innovative solutions. Our fundamental growth continues to drive significant value creation for our shareholders, a reflection of the important role that we play in the rapidly evolving digital economy. 
So let me stop here, and I'll turn it over to you, Sam, to open it up for questions."

And I guess the 3 things that really stand out are last quarter, you talked about a second consecutive quarter of positive pricing actions. You talked about an accelerating TAM and you talked about the beginning of the emergence of cloud-driven enterprise demand. And while you highlighted enterprise amongst the verticals that were strong, I'd certainly love to hear anything explicit as it applies to sort of again cloud-driven enterprise demand. So just if you could sort of review us on those 3 points."

Why don't I start with a couple of comments and Charles and Keith can chime in here. Those are 3 good questions, Jonathan.

Why don't I start with a couple of comments and Charles and Keith can chime in here. Those are 3 good questions, Jonathan. The pricing actions continue to be favorable to us as we renew and move forward with existing customers that are extending in multiple markets with us. So we're staying very disciplined with our activities and our actions and our deal reviews with our customers as they continue to grow into the global platform. And so that's showing up every quarter. And I would just tell you that's tied to the discipline of our deal reviews and how we manage that and Charles can talk about that in a second because he sits on top of those. The accelerating TAM generally is because we're prosecuting a dozen-plus other industry verticals that we refer to as the enterprise outside of our core 5 industry verticals that we've been focused on, and it goes to these hundreds of thousands of customers, prospects, I should say, that we're knocking on our doorknob via the channel or via the direct sales engine to talk to them about helping them enable them to get to the multi-cloud and get to the hybrid cloud environment. So the cloud enterprise, the simple answer, the reason why we're a cloud enabling these data centers is to replicate the network density that we achieved the first 16, 17 years of this company to make it easy for any CIO of an enterprise to look inside these facilities and see that they can publicly, privately move their traffic, certain applications that are mission-critical, revenue-facing, customer-focused applications that they can get them to the multi-cloud and get them to take advantage of the performance to cost and the IT transformation that's taking place. So it's -- we're seeing uplift across all 3 of these things because of generally because of the uptake in cloud and cloud is driving most of this. Charles, why don't you add a little bit of color here?"

The continued positive pricing actions, and as Steve said, that's showing up in our yield, continuing to be very firm across the board in terms of MRR per cab. The accelerating TAM is really absolutely linked to this enterprise phenomenon and building and the scaling of the cloud ecosystem, both the cloud density CSP side of that ecosystem as well as the enterprise. And I think we've had -- continue to have a number of big lighthouse wins. And what I would tell you is that I think this is probably the eighth consecutive quarter that both cloud and enterprise has overindexed on a bookings basis relative to their installed base, meaning that those who were continuing to see an evolution of the business not because our mature ecosystems are waning but rather because we're seeing an acceleration in the cloud ecosystem. And this big addressable market is really an artifact of people migrating to the cloud, adopting public cloud, using Equinix as a private access option to the public cloud and really enabling -- really selecting multi-cloud hybrid cloud as the IT architecture of choice. And I think if you look at it -- if you look at our core metrics, the business really hitting on all cylinders against all 3 of those factors."

We are one of them. And it -- our position is there are certain assets in those portfolios that we would be interested in. Obviously, where there's cloud network density and the power and location but there's many of those assets that wouldn't make any sense for us. So we're in the early stages, exploratory stages, talking to these companies. Those are the 2 that are public. There's other conversations going on. There's plenty of companies interested in getting out of the data center business. So it's a very active market on top of the divestiture that Keith mentioned that we're doing in Europe. So there's a lot of activity, mostly pressure-driven by the big Infrastructure-as-a-Service companies who are going as fast as they are, AWS, Microsoft, Google, et cetera, and they're putting a lot of pressure on companies in the decided to get into the Infrastructure-as-a-Service business and now they're deciding to get out of it. And the data centers are going with it. The telcos probably aimed at most of that cash that we collect on these will be aimed at, as you all know, in spectrum and aimed at their mobile initiatives. And so it makes sense why we're looking at these. But I said, there are specific assets that would make sense to us, but it's very early days in the dialogue. Charles, I don't know [indiscernible]."

I think what's really important to understand about Bit-isle, as we said in our prepared remarks, revenues are essentially flat quarter-over-quarter. And I want sort of investors to realize, from a margin perspective, Bit-isle is dilutive to our margins today. It is very clear to us given the inventory capacity they have in the Tokyo market specifically. This was an asset that we bought for a sub-10x multiple to EBITDA. We believe upon filling up our assets we're going to be able to enjoy the ability to fill up their assets over a period of time, while at the same time assessing, if you will, the strategic landscape of the number of operating units that Bit-isle had. And so as a company, we fully intend, over a reasonable period of time, it will not be over an 18- or 24-month period but probably over the next 3 to 4 years, that we would be able to capture all of the value associated with the Bit-isle acquisition, fill up their assets and get their margins up to basically where our Asia Pacific business is running today, which is in the 45% to 50% EBITDA margin basis. But we're being very disciplined about this acquisition. Culturally, it's a meaningful acquisition for us, and we're very sensitive to the environment that we are operating in. But we recognize in the investment decision that over the short term, we weren't going to see any meaningful uplift in the business model. And accretive from day 1 because we use debt to buy the asset. We're going to be very methodical about how we drive valley into that acquisition. Charles, you want to..."

I think these are obviously both somewhat localized assets with Telecity being a strictly European platform and Bit-isle really being contained to Japan. So our local teams both in the EMEA region and in Japan have the primary responsibility for driving the integration efforts. That said, we did take in individual from my team who is really in my right hand for quite a while when I ran the Americas business and into my role as the COO, who really understands our business deeply, has a deep network across the company. We've actually exported him to -- and he's living in Amsterdam now with his family and is leading the integration effort for Telecity and sort of providing overall oversight to our integration activities in terms of aligning them, keeping them consistent in approach, identifying and applying best practices, et cetera. So that's kind of how we're going about it. In terms of the metrics I think to watch, we're obviously watching them very closely, and we will update you as appropriate on these. But I think they are, number one, what -- how are we doing on integrating the sales teams and driving the upsell and the cross-sell activities? And that's one we're probably not going to give a ton of granular insight into publicly, but it's something that we obviously are watching very, very closely and feel very optimistic about. Secondly, the synergy capture. We talked about what we expect in terms of synergies, and we're driving the teams to those expectations to meet or exceed our synergy estimates from an energy standpoint. And then we're aligning our capital planning processes to make sure that we're gaining the capital -- the CapEx energies where we can and ensuring that we continue to have the capacity to respond to the fill rates in high demand markets. And then lastly, I think probably keeping an eye on our progress on the divestiture, and again, we'll report our progress to you on that as we have it."

Could you put in a AFFO number alongside the $77 million EBITDA number that you pulled out of the guidance for those divested assets, so we could kind of look at a pro forma more normalized number? And then the other moving parts on that would be great. And then second, again along the same lines, just to make sure, so we're all on the same page, in terms of the share count we want to be you seeing now, so we're looking at an AFFO per share, I think that there's a lot of numbers on Slide 38 in terms of the share count.

And so t",667,"Okay. Certainly, David. I think first and foremost, I think Page 35 clearly depicts the share count activity that you should be expecting, both as we sit here at the end of 12/31/15 and then certainly what you should expect on a go-forward basis. And so the numbers that I shared with you, the roughly 6.9 million [ph] shares will be issued to the Telecity shareholders and then the 1.96 million shares issued to convertible debt owners. That all said, I think there is somewhat -- there appears to be some clarity over what the base denominator share count. And so will discussion has to go into what's sitting up in the numerator. I think the most important thing is, as you've sort of alluded to, David, there is -- the divestiture is certainly, it's a meaningful divestiture. There's 8 assets as you can see. As reflected in our bridge, you can see there's roughly $70 million of revenue that's being taken -- sorry, pardon me, $70 million of EBITDA that's been taken out of the analysis and that's on Slide 14 for those who are following along. A lot of that value recognizing, that's coming right out of the AFFO base. There's nothing that [indiscernible] drag, along with that recognizing, of course, there'll be some movement in maybe how we recognize the revenue or the deferred installation. But overall, that's almost a complete drop-through to the AFFO line. And as a result, when we step back and look at how is the business performing relative to expectations, I think it's really important to note 2 things. Number one, is Equinix proper is driving more margin into the business? Not only did we do it this year, but we're setting ourselves up to do next year being 2016. So that $100 million -- the 100 basis points of improvement is certainly being realized. You can see that Telecity is coming in on -- with the assets, they're going to have a margin profile that's higher than Equinix proper. And then we're also going to continue to work on synergies in the business. So that's going to continue to add value to the go forward valuation. And then as I said earlier on, Bit-isle is the one piece we recognize that is relatively flat over a period of time. But we recognize that as we continue to synergize the business, as Charles alluded to, and drive up the occupancy of their asset, that's going to drive more value into the top line. So I think the combination of those 3 assets, the organic the 2 acquisitions and knowing that we are growing faster than certainly than we anticipated in 2015, and we think we've got a great growth rate coming into '16 at this stage of the game at greater than 13% organically, we're optimistic that the numerator will be -- will drive a lot of value into the per share calculations. All of that to say is we got to get through 2016. 2016's no different than 2015 when we convert to a REIT. 2016, there's a lot of noise in the system, not only with the REIT conversion and all the other work that we still are doing but also taking the Telecity assets and moving them into the structure. And so the costs to do that are substantial, but the benefits that we will realize from the Telecity acquisition, Steve's talked about there's revenues, there's cost, there's CapEx but there's also much more efficient tax structure that we will operate in under our structure, if you will. And all of that benefit you're really going to feel it more in '17 than you are in '16. And so you've going to look through '16 to recognize '17, I think sets us up well. The currency issues should be gone. The integration costs will really -- we expect them to have really been dialed out and the operating business should be accelerating as we've alluded to."

I think one thing about churn, let me break it down maybe not in -- let me break it down between the organic business Equinix proper. I would tell you our churn levels are at or near their best in a long, long time. That holds true also for 2016. As I mentioned, churn in Q4 was 2.3%. We telegraphed them being slightly higher. It was attributed to a single customer in our U.K. business that we knew that we'd be relocating to their own specialty build data center. That said, as we look forward, we see churn to be again at one of its lowest levels, I think, we ever experienced as a company organically. As you then go into the 2 other assets, the Telecity assets and the Bit-isle asset, Telecity is going to be really no different than what you see at the Equinix level. We're going to see slightly increased churn is really in Bit-isle. And a lot of reasons for when you look at how Bit-isle did in 2014 relative to 2015 and what we're guiding to 2016, there's a number of factors. Number one, they've got nonrecurring activities that will not repeat themselves. They have a little bit  to have an operating units and have built solar plant and sold off some of those assets. That was sitting in their '14 results, it's not in '15. Equally so, they have suffered some substantial churn. They've done exactly what we chose not to do, which is effectively build up a large portion of their inventory with some large customers. And when those customers run into trouble, as you can appreciate, vendors are fairly meaningful churn event. That's what Bit-isle is suffering through not only in '15, and that's why their value was so low, but also, we're still going to feel some of that in '16. And so from my perspective, churn will be, I think, at a very strong level looking into '16."

But to point out the churn and just say that again what we continue to see is just the discipline in the business and this commitment to the right application in the right asset, right customers, right applications, right asset continues to manifest itself both in terms of the positive price actions and correspondingly to the moderated churn levels. So I think it's absolutely a reflection of the strategy working as we would expect. The other 2 topics were interconnection. I would say that interconnection obviously, an incredibly strong quarter with 7,500 cross connects in aggregate. We track that at a very detailed level vertical essentially done on the firm [indiscernible] by every vertical. And every cell in the matrix is growing. The fastest-growing are the cloud-related sort of the cloud ecosystem on a percentage basis. But the most, in terms, the biggest contributor continues to be our mature network ecosystem. And the financial services ecosystem continues to contribute significantly. So -- but on a percentage basis, cloud is overindexing dramatically like 5x probably its installed base. And that's just a reflection of, I think, the early days of that and really starting to sort of take shape and scale as enterprises are adopting hybrid cloud. I would also say that part of the driver in the network adds on cross connects is these 300 customers that have adopted Performance Hub, many of whom are using that for WAN optimization strategies and therefore, driving significant cross connects to network providers. So that's a snapshot on interconnection. And then lastly on channel. What I would tell you is that we, over the last couple of quarters, have seen a number of our lighthouse marquee deals in the enterprise come through partners. And I think that's a reflection of many of those customers are finding that they need some combination of the infrastructure value delivered by Platform Equinix but desire a managed service element of that implementation. And our partners are doing that very effectively. And so we won some very big deals as we referenced in the script from -- through partners with our enterprise lighthouse wins. And we are seeing, in terms of allocation of percentage of bookings coming through indirect continue to grow steadily. And we're really focusing on set a high-impact partners that we think will help us continue to drive that through '16."

And so if you really look at the portion that we tend to play and around -- if you look at the growth of AWS, look at Microsoft's Azure revenues and their cloud participation, look at what Oracle is doing in terms of retooling their business into the cloud, those are all significant customers of ours. They're all scaling globally with us. And then we are really leveraging that cloud density with that sort of core group as well as very long tail of SaaS to really attract the enterprise customer and seeing some momentum there. So -- it is an environment, although there's market volatility and pressure I think on CIOs to manage spending and reduce expense, et cetera, they're often coming to us as a way to achieve those means. And whether that's reducing network costs, adopting public cloud at an accelerated rate or implementing hybrid cloud and moving out of their basement and avoiding spending that capital, those are all things that they can really use us for, so we feel well positioned even though there's some choppiness in the overall macro environment."

It's definitely being driven by cloud. We're involved in many more conversations than we ever have in the future or in the past, I should say. And the investments in technology today is allowing these operators to bypass the traditional shore-based lending facilities and go all the way to terminating at a data center like Equinix so we're catching that volume now. There's been 4 or 5 public announcements that we've made of ones there that we participated in. There's been a couple of connected U.S. Japan, New York, London, and so there's a whole bunch going on now. We're probably involved in a dozen more projects today that are at different stages of assessment, development and construction so it is very active it is driven by the cloud and by the bandwidth amount of traffic around the world, and they can terminate these cables today very easily into data centers. And so we're front and center on this topic."

I think what's most important to note, Mike, is we're not going in and cutting costs. What we're doing today is we're operating more efficiently. And it's important to recognize over the last 3 to 4 years, we've made heavy investments across a number of different functional groups to scale the organization to be global. And one of the biggest investments we've made has been in our IT systems and platforms and the people that's really continue to work very hard to make them run as efficiently as possible. And then we build processes and structures around them. That said, we've made those initial investments. We're investing in sale and sort of and customer-facing initiatives, which I would argue is driving a lot of the value that we see today. But we're also finding ways to reallocate our cost. And part of our efforts today not only as it related to '15 but also as we look to '16 is how do we run more efficiently and take resources that we're spending money in and run them more efficiently, so we can put it back into the business differently. And in fact, there's roughly $24 million of cost that we reallocated in our organization to support our investments in 2016. And so we feel very comfortable about that but quite frankly, it's a work in progress. We have to continue to lever off our systems, our processes, our people. And that's something that you will see in '16 but you're also going to see us globalize bring in Telecity we bring in Bit-isle over the next -- through '17, '18 and '19 will continue to make this investments and I would argue that can drive more value into the business."

You mentioned that you thought that Telecity would be accretive to 2017 after integration costs. You mentioned, integration costs, I think, in 2017 will be $20 million. Will be accretive even including those integration costs? And then the third question is on Telecity and your FX hedge. I think a mentioned that you hedge about 80% of your core business in Europe.

I think first and foremost, as it relates to the tax rates, probably a little bit premature for us to tell you what that's going to be because part of the reason we're making such a substantial investment in integration costs in 2016 is to change in the organizational structure to meet not only our REIT requirements but our commissioner requirements. And so suffice it to say, we feel that overall, our global tax rate will continue to be in the 10% to 15% cash rate basis. We, as a company and certainly our European business pretty organically has a lower tax rate than that of our competitors, and so we think we can benefit from that. So stay tuned on that one. Let us come back but there's a lot of work to deal with there. As it relates to Telecity on the FX side, I think it's important to note we have hedged 85% of the organic business. We have yet to take the position on the Telecity business in Europe primarily because their functional currency is not U.S. dollar. Our functional currency in Europe is U.S. dollar. And so the hedging strategies we would deploy aren't going to be different today at least for Equinix proper versus the Telecity asset. But suffice it to say, we're going to be looking very closely and try not to destroy value of the currency movement. So again, stay tuned on that one. And I'm sorry, I have the third one was..."

Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. 2015 was a transformational year for Equinix. We delivered accelerated growth, expanded our global platform with 2 strategic acquisitions, completed our first year operating as a REIT and established ourselves as a foundation for the cloud ecosystem that continues to drive IT transformation. 
Our strong financial performance reflects our position as the global leader in retail colocation and interconnection, truly serving as the place where opportunity connects for leading networks, clouds, content providers and enterprises. We continue to extend our market-leading network density, attracting wireline, wireless and, increasingly, subsea carriers who are using Platform Equinix to efficiently interconnect and serve their end customers. Our data centers act as a powerful commerce center for the largest service providers to reach their customers and are positioning us to capture the enterprise as they implement next-generation IT architectures. We will further leverage our leadership position through the integration of Telecity and Bit-isle and scale the business to drive even more value for our combined customers.
Before I turn to the quarterly results, I'd like to reflect on a few of the meaningful milestones we achieved in 2015, starting with financial performance on Slide 3. With another year of record bookings activity in 2015, we generated over $2.7 billion of revenue, up 16% year-over-year on a normalized and constant-currency basis. We delivered over $1.27 billion of adjusted EBITDA or a 47% margin and over 100 basis point improvement over last year while continuing to invest in the business. This drove AFFO growth of 25% on a normalized and constant-currency basis, exceeding our prior guidance after adjusting for the Telecity transaction-related FX loss.
Second, it was a phenomenal year for our interconnection solutions. Interconnection revenue continues to outpace overall revenue, growing 20% year-over-year on a constant-currency organic basis. With over 171,000 cross connects, 3,300 ports on our Internet exchange and dramatic growth on our Cloud Exchange, we are benefiting from the strong secular trends that are driving businesses to become increasingly interconnected.
Third, we significantly expanded our global platform both organically and inorganically. Equinix completed 20 major IBX expansions in 2015, creating the needed capacity to support strong fill rates in high demand markets. Overall, our development activity continues to generate highly attractive returns and healthy yield on our sizable base of stabilized assets. With the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, we further expanded Platform Equinix, which now spans 145 data centers across 40 metros and 21 countries. Combined, Equinix now operates over 14 million gross square feet of colocation space, enhancing our position as the largest retail data center footprint in the world.
Fourth, we continue to establish Equinix as the home of the interconnected cloud, which, in turn, is attracting enterprises that are adopting hybrid and multi-cloud as their IT architecture of choice. Key cloud customers, including Amazon, Cisco, IBM, Microsoft and Oracle, to mention a few, are all using Equinix to scale their infrastructure globally and are now deployed across an average of 17 markets.
And finally, we successfully completed our first year operating as a REIT and returned $394 million back to our shareholders. We were included in the S&P 500, the MSCI RMZ and the FTSE NAREIT indices, a reflection of our position as both a technology leader and as the largest data center REIT. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet, raising $2.6 billion in debt and equity in the fourth quarter, fortifying our capital structure while providing a strong liquidity position.
Now turning to the quarter. We had a great finish to the year, delivering record bookings in the fourth quarter with particular strength in the Americas and robust metrics, including our highest-ever interconnection activity and very firm yield per cabinet. We continue to take market share, capture an outsized portion of the new infrastructure deployments from both clouds and enterprises. The quality and scale of our wins continues to increase, and we are proud that over 140 of the Fortune 500 are Equinix customers. Our geographic reach remains critical to customers, with over 55% of our revenue coming from customers deployed globally across all 3 regions and over 84% from customers deployed across multiple metros.
Our global platform is increasingly defensible, durable and hard to replicate with regards to reach and capacity as well as performance. With the addition of the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, we added 40 data centers and 1,100 people across Europe and Japan. This scale positions us well to build market leadership, increase capacity, enhance cloud and network density and grow customer ecosystems for years to come. With Telecity, we've added 7 new metro markets to our portfolio, creating a large opportunity for current Equinix customers to expand further north and east across EMEA. Additionally, there are over 500 customers of former Telecity that have business presence in another country where Platform Equinix resides, creating a potential for powerful cross-selling opportunities as we integrate. We are confident both of these transactions will drive significant long-term value creation for our customers and our partners.
Now let me cover quarterly highlights from our industry verticals, starting with the network vertical. This customer base continues to grow as we enhance ecosystems in which networks and mobile providers can participate and grow their businesses. Strong global bandwidth demand is driving a resurgence of subsea cable projects, creating new opportunities for Equinix. These service providers are accelerating returns by terminating cables directly into our IBXs, where they can further benefit by gaining access to key business ecosystems.
In the content and digital media vertical, content customers are expanding across our global platform to meet the continued explosion of consumer demand for digital content and applications. The advertising subsegment remains the fastest growth driver in this vertical as digital advertising takes share from traditional channels. Customers expanding this quarter include AppNexus, which optimizes programmatic digital advertising; AudienceScience, a global advertising technology and services company; and Criteo, a French company specializing in performance marketing.
Turning to the financial services vertical. In addition to our strong electronic trading ecosystem, we continue to diversify across subsegments, including insurance, wealth management and banking, which contributed to record bookings for the quarter. New wins include a top 20 private wealth management firm initiating a multi-cloud strategy to speed to market; a Fortune 500 asset management company that is connecting to clouds over our Equinix Cloud Exchange; and a partner-led deal with a top 10 insurance firm based in Europe.
In cloud and IT services, the cloud ecosystem delivered strong growth this quarter, driven by key Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers, such as AWS and Microsoft, as well as momentum with Software-as-a-Service providers who represent the fastest-growing subsegment of this vertical. SaaS customer expansions include ServiceNow, an IT service management provider; and Shape Security, an advanced application defense provider that offers security services for Cloud Exchange clients. We continue to see momentum on our Cloud Exchange and have over 300 enterprises clouds, IT service providers and networks interconnecting using our solution.
Turning to the enterprise. The enterprise vertical delivered strong bookings as businesses seek to re-architect IT to adapt to rapidly changing business requirements. By leveraging an interconnection-oriented architecture, enterprises can address multiple IT challenges and solve for the cost, scaling and performance needs of today's digital world. For the second quarter, enterprise was the largest source of new customer adds, with particular traction in manufacturing and professional services. New wins include Polo Ralph Lauren, a premium clothing and lifestyle brand; Granite Construction, an S&P 500 civil general contractor and construction material producer; and Oriflame Cosmetics, a Swedish cosmetic manufacturer. Over 300 customers have deployed our Performance Hub solution, which is an extremely attractive entry point for enterprise customers who seek to optimize network architectures and also access the cloud and drive application performance, and we are already enjoying significant upsell and cross-sell traction with these customers.
So let me stop here and turn it over to Keith to cover some more specifics for the quarter."
28202,321490066,936639,"Equinix, Inc.

Let me start by saying from so many points of view, Q4 was the best quarter we have experienced to date. The momentum in our organic business, combined with Telecity and Bit-isle, sets us up nicely for 2016 as well as our initial look-through into 2017. And with my prepared remarks, I'll first review our full year 2015 results then I'll provide some commentary on key metrics for '16, which have a number of moving parts. Finally, I'll wrap up with some high-level comments on the fourth quarter.
So starting with revenues. We reported revenues of over $2.72 billion for 2015, a 16% year-over-year normalized and constant-currency growth rate, a clear demonstration of our ability to drive outsized growth as we benefit from the scale of our global platform as well as enjoy record nonrecurring revenue activity. And we believe this momentum will continue into 2016. We expect to deliver normalized and constant-currency growth of greater than 13% for our organic business and over $540 million of revenues from Telecity and Bit-isle at current exchange rates. We believe that Telecity business, net of the expected divestitures, will grow revenues between 8% and 9% in 2016; while Bit-isle's revenues will remain essentially flat year-over-year, consistent with our expectations while we look to optimize this business over the next 24 months.
In 2015, we improved our organic adjusted EBITDA margin by over 100 basis points to 46.7%. And as we continue to scale the business, we expect to deliver another 100 basis points of improvement on the organic business in 2016 as we maintain disciplined and focused on our spending initiatives. Another key driver to our continued margin improvement is the healthy price yield derived from a disciplined pricing initiative and strong interconnection activity. For 2016, we expect our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins to be greater than 47.3%, excluding integration costs, or 45.6% on an as-reported basis.
Our 2015 pro forma AFFO, which excludes the impact of the Telecity FX losses and the integration cost, was $905 million, significantly higher than expected for the year. Looking forward on a normalized and constant-currency basis, 2016 AFFO is expected to grow greater than 23% over the prior year.
With respect to the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, we're very excited about these acquisitions and the ability to strengthen our market position. That said, I want to highlight a few areas, recognizing we'll be incurring some costs that won't be part of the ongoing business, thereby allowing you to better understand the combined business on a go-forward basis.
So let me start with FX. We elected to hedge the cash portion of the Telecity purchase price. In effect, we locked in the dollar value of this sizable deal. This resulted in an FX loss of $61 million in 2015, with $49 million of the loss being recognized in Q4. These losses impacted our AFFO metric for both Q3 and Q4 and for the year. For Q1, as we completed the purchase of the Telecity acquisition, we experienced an incremental $50 million loss in the quarter. Again, this loss will impact our Q1 and 2016 AFFO metric. Finally, it's important to know that the offset to the Telecity FX losses is a corresponding reduction to the purchase price of Telecity.
For both Telecity and Bit-isle, we've begun the integration process to combine the teams, the organizations and the systems together. We expect to incur $58 million in integration cost in 2016, as anticipated in our investment models, with an approximate $20 million of additional integration cost being spent in 2017. This cost supports systems work, of significance, employees cost, including severance and retention and substantial organizational restructuring in support of our REIT and other tax initiatives. We expect incremental revenue, cost and CapEx synergies from the acquisitions of -- from Telecity and Bit-isle as we integrate these businesses. 
Our current revenue guidance contemplates modest revenue synergy assumptions this year, which we expect to ramp up over time as both Equinix and Telecity customers leverage the expanded footprint service portfolio and rich ecosystems of the combined company. As we progress with our integration efforts, we also expect to achieve $30 million in annual cost savings, with about 50% of these savings being realized before the end of this year and the rest coming in 2017. For CapEx synergies, the available Bit-isle inventory has positioned us well in the Tokyo market, allowing us to defer significant capital spend to other projects, while the Telecity capacity in our overlapping markets allows us to free up capital to be deployed in other markets, both in Europe and across the platform.
And as previously announced, we need to divest 8 assets from the combined Equinix-Telecity EMEA business, with a target divestiture date of mid-2016. In light of the current momentum in the business and the size of the market opportunity in front of us, it is our intention to reinvest the divestiture proceeds back into the business. We currently believe this is the highest and best use of our capital. We believe this allows us to maximize both our short- and longer-term shareholder value objectives while driving us -- oh sorry, while providing us the strategic and operational flexibility we've historically enjoyed particularly during volatile times. And these proceeds, along with capital raised in November, should allow us to self-fund the business for the foreseeable future despite our increased expansion activities and anticipated growing cash dividend.
From an AFFO perspective, the value of these acquisitions and their AFFO-generating potential is better than our original assumptions. With a review -- with a view towards 2017, we expect these acquisitions, on a combined basis, to be accretive to Equinix's AFFO per share for the 2017 reporting year excluding the integration cost.
So turning to the fourth quarter. It was another terrific quarter at Equinix. Our strategy continues to deliver better-than-expected results across the company. At the global level, we had record gross and net bookings, with particular strength in the financial services and enterprise verticals. Our interconnection metrics were again outstanding as we added 7,500 cross connects and 162 exchange ports this quarter. Our MRR per cab on an FX-neutral basis was very firm, and we remain well positioned across each of our operating regions.
As depicted on Slide 4, global Q4 revenues were $730.5 million, our 52nd consecutive quarter of top line revenue growth, up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 17% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant-currency basis. Our as-reported revenues include $21.6 million of Bit-isle revenue from November and December, consistent with our expectations and the investment model. Q4 organic revenues, net of our FX hedges, absorbs an $8 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter and a $4 million negative currency impact when compared to our FX guidance rates.
Currency volatility against the majority of our key operating currencies continue to cause significant FX headwinds. For 2016, the strength in U.S. dollar creates a $51 million FX headwind against revenues and a $29 million headwind against adjusted EBITDA for our organic business when compared to the average FX raised -- rates used in 2015. For Europe, we've hedged over 85% of our Equinix organic business. Given the growth of the international businesses, including Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, we expect our revenue mix to shift, such that greater than 50% of our revenues will be generated from outside the U.S.
Global adjusted EBITDA was $333.1 million, up 4% over the prior quarter and 20% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant-currency basis. Our normalized adjusted EBITDA margin was 46.4% and includes $2.8 million in integration cost. Our Q4 organic adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a negative $5.4 million currency impact when compared to the average FX rates last quarter and a $1.2 million negative impact when compared to our guidance rates.
Global AFFO was $178 million. Excluding the Telecity foreign currency loss and acquisition-related cost, AFFO, on a normalized and constant-currency basis, increased 4% over the prior quarter, above the top end of our guidance range by $13 million largely due to lower-than-expected cash taxes.
And finally, moving to churn. Global MRR churn for Q4 was 2.3%, consistent with our prior guidance and weighted towards the end of the quarter. For 2016, we expect our quarterly MRR churn to remain in our targeted 2% to 2.5% quarterly range.
I'd like to provide some highlights on the regions, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 to 7. All 3 regions delivered better-than-expected revenues, with EMEA and Asia Pacific showing normalized and constant-currency growth of 20% and 25% respectively, while the Americas region produced growth of 13% on its much larger base. The Americas region had a great quarter, delivering record bookings driven by the financial and enterprise verticals, very firm yield per cabinet and the best interconnection quarter of all time. EMEA delivered another strong quarter of bookings, with particular strength in our French and German markets; while Asia Pacific continued its rapid growth as customers deploy across the region, with gross bookings driven by cloud and IT services, enterprise and network verticals. Interconnection revenues continued to outpace overall growth of the business, with the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific interconnection revenues now at 22%, 10% and 13%, respectively, of the recurring revenues.
And now looking at balance sheet. Please refer to Slide 8. Unrestricted cash and investments increased this quarter to $2.2 billion due to the successful financings in November, while our restricted cash balances totaled $490 million largely due to the escrow funds related to the Telecity deal. Our year-end net debt leverage ratio was 3.2x at Q4 and annualized adjusted EBITDA although steps up to greater than 4x after funding the cash portion of the Telecity transaction. Given the favorable cash flow attributes of the business model, we expect the Equinix calculated leverage ratio to return to the higher end of our targeted 3 to 4x adjusted EBITDA over the next 12 to 18 months.
Now switching to AFFO and dividends on Slide 9. For 2016, we expect our as-reported AFFO to be greater than $970 million, a 17% year-over-year increase. On a normalized and constant-currency basis, AFFO would be greater than $1.078 billion or a 23% increase over the prior year.
Turning to dividends. Today, we announced our Q1 dividend of $1.75 a share, a 3.6% increase over the prior cash dividend per share. For 2016, our projected total cash dividends to be paid will increase to approximately $500 million, a 27% increase over the prior year. Our normalized AFFO payout ratio will approximate 52% in 2016. Our estimated share count for 2016 approximate 70.5 million shares, including 6.9 million shares issued to Telecity shareholders and 1.96 million shares expected to be issued in June 2016 to our convertible debt holders. We continue to believe that both organic and inorganic growth will be the primary ingredient for a steadily growing cash dividend, and we've maintained the flexibility to move additional entities from the taxable REIT structure to the qualified REIT structure over time.
Now looking at capital expenditures. Please refer to Slide 10. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $281 million, including recurring CapEx of $45 million, slightly higher than guidance due to the timing of cash payments to our contractors. We now have 14 announced expansion projects underway. For 2016, we expect 95% of expansion capital to be allocated to campus or existing market builds and 5% for new market development. Given the strong performance in our key markets, we expect to move forward with additional expansion phases in Ashburn, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Silicon Valley and a new flagship build in the Amsterdam Science Park, an interconnection hub. Also, given our high utilization rate of 81% and increasing as well as some strong development returns, we expect 2016 CapEx to range between $900 million and $1 billion, which contemplates several new first-phase IBX builds on our core Equinix-owned campuses, including Ashburn and Silicon Valley as well as a number of non-U.S. campuses.
And finally, we've provided you a number of slides that bridge the normalized 2015 performance to our 2016 guidance, including slides for revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Please refer to Slides 13 to 17. These slides also include the contributions from Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions. Steve?"

Thanks, Keith. Let me now cover our 2016 strategy on Slide 12. Our strategic priorities remain centered on driving growth by pressing our competitive advantage and investing to capture significant opportunities, such as the cloud-enabled enterprise. We will allocate capital towards these high-value opportunities and, in turn, will strengthen our economic model.
In the near term, we will focus our energy on successfully integrating Telecity and Bit-isle and growing our market leadership globally. Organically, our efforts will be focused on capturing the enterprise through a series of initiatives to build cloud density, create and deploy innovative product solutions, generate demand in targeted segments and provide professional services focused on enabling the adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud. We will also continue to ramp our channel program to enhance our reach and to the enterprise through agents, resellers, systems integrators and key platform partners.
Over the longer term, interconnection will continue to be the essence of our advantage, and Equinix is well positioned to become the intersection point between the Internet of Things, clouds, networks and the enterprises. We are making meaningful investments to foster new ecosystems to capture this opportunity, and we'll continue to invest in scaling our systems and processes and evolving our capabilities in response to these customer needs. Based on what we see in the market and the steps we are taking at Equinix to capitalize on these opportunities, I continue to be very optimistic about our future.
And last, on Slide 18, which summarizes our Q1 and full year 2016 guidance, including FX impacts. Let me cover a few thoughts on our 2016 outlook. First, we continue to deliver another solid year of growth. For the full year of 2016, we expect revenues to be greater than $3.55 billion, a 30% growth on an as-reported basis or a normalized and constant-currency growth rate of greater than 13% year-over-year.
Second, our organic adjusted EBITDA margin continues to improve as we drive increased efficiency into the business and scale our operating model. For 2016, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be greater than $1.62 billion or 16% year-over-year growth on a normalized and constant-currency basis. This includes a 100 basis point adjusted EBITDA margin improvement for the Equinix organic business.
And the growth of our business is driving increased adjusted funds from operations and, ultimately, cash flow and dividends. AFFO normalized for the Telecity transaction-related FX loss is expected to be greater than $1.078 billion, a 23% growth year-over-year, demonstrating the health of the business model.
And finally, given our strong pipeline, firm yield and healthy returns, we continue to invest in our business and expect 2016 capital expenditures to range between $900 million and $1 billion for the year.
So in closing, the strength of our business is translating into solid revenue growth, firm yield and healthy margins, all of which combine to give us the financial firepower to continue to invest in our global platform and develop innovative solutions. Our fundamental growth continues to drive significant value creation for our shareholders, a reflection of the important role that we play in the rapidly evolving digital economy.
So let me stop here, and I'll turn it over to you, Sam, to open it up for questions."

Why don't I start with a couple of comments and Charles and Keith can chime in here. Those are 3 good questions, Jonathan. The pricing actions continue to be favorable to us as we renew and move forward with existing customers that are extending in multiple markets with us. So we're staying very disciplined with our activities and our actions and our deal reviews with our customers as they continue to grow into the global platform. And so that's showing up every quarter. And I would just tell you that's tied to the discipline of our deal reviews and how we manage that, and Charles can talk about that in a second because he sits on top of those. The accelerating TAM, generally, is because we're prosecuting a dozen-plus other industry verticals that we refer to as the enterprise outside of our core 5 industry verticals that we've been focused on. And it goes to these hundreds of thousands of customers -- prospects, I should say, that we are knocking on their doorknob via the channel or via the direct sales engine to talk to them about helping them enable them to get to the multi-cloud and get to the hybrid cloud environment. So the cloud enterprise -- the simple answer, the reason why we're a cloud -- enabling these data centers is to replicate the network density that we achieved the first 16, 17 years of this company to make it easy for any CIO of an enterprise to look inside these facilities and see that they can publicly, privately move their traffic, certain applications that are mission-critical, revenue-facing, customer-focused applications that they can get them to the multi-cloud and get them to take advantage of the performance, the cost and the IT transformation that's taking place. So it's -- we're seeing uplift across all 3 of these things because of -- generally because of the uptake in cloud, and cloud is driving most of this. Charles, why don't you add a little bit of color here?"

We continue positive pricing actions, and as Steve said, that's showing up in our yield continuing to be very firm across the board in terms of MRR per cab. The accelerating TAM is really absolutely linked to this enterprise phenomenon and the building and the scaling of the cloud ecosystem, both the cloud density -- CSP side of that ecosystem as well as the enterprise. And I think we've had -- continue to have a number of big lighthouse wins. And what I would tell you is that I think this is probably the eighth consecutive quarter that both cloud and enterprise has over-indexed on a bookings basis relative to their installed base, meaning that those -- we're continuing to see an evolution of the business not because our mature ecosystems are waning but rather because we're seeing an acceleration in the cloud ecosystem. And this big addressable market is really an artifact of people migrating to the cloud, adopting public cloud, using Equinix as a private access option to the public cloud and really enabling -- really selecting multi-cloud, hybrid cloud as the IT architecture of choice. And I think if you look at our core metrics, the business is really hitting on all cylinders against all 3 of those factors."

Why don't I take that and let Keith and Charles add to what thoughts I might have here. So you -- most or all of you should be aware that publicly, there are a couple of big telcos that are interested in trying to divest some assets. And these are both the big telcos that acquired cloud companies 3, 4, 5 years ago, and it includes those cloud data centers. It's public. It's their position. They're talking to several people. We are one of them and it -- our position is there are certain assets in those portfolios that we would be interested in, obviously where there's cloud network density and the power and location. But there's many of those assets that wouldn't make any sense for us. So we're in the early stages, exploratory stages, talking to these companies. Those are the 2 that are public. There's other conversations going on. There's plenty of companies that are interested in getting out of the data center business. So it's a very active market on top of the divestiture that Keith mentioned that we're doing in Europe. So there's a lot of activity, mostly pressured and driven by the big Infrastructure-as-a-Service companies who are going as fast as they are, AWS, Microsoft, Google, et cetera. And they're putting a lot of pressure on companies that decided to get into the Infrastructure-as-a-Service business. And now they're deciding to get out of it, and the data centers are going with it. The telcos probably aimed -- most of that cash that we collect on these will be aimed at -- as you all know, aimed at spectrum and aimed at their mobile initiatives. And so it makes sense why they're looking at these. But as I said, we'll -- there are specific assets that would make sense to us, but it's very early days in the dialogue. Charles, I don't know what else should I -- you're in the middle of this."

I think what's really important to understand about Bit-isle, as we said in our prepared remarks, revenues are essentially flat quarter-over-quarter. And I want certainly investors to realize, from a margin perspective, Bit-isle is dilutive to our margins today. It is very clear to us given the inventory capacity they have in the Tokyo market specifically. This was an asset that we bought for a sub-10 multiple to EBITDA. We believe we -- upon filling up our assets, we're going to be able to enjoy the ability to fill up their assets over a period of time while at the same time assessing, if you will, the strategic landscape of the number of operating units that Bit-isle had. And so as a company, we fully intend, over a reasonable period of time -- it will not be over an 18- or 24-month period but probably over the next 3 to 4 years that we would be able to capture all of the value associated with the Bit-isle acquisition, fill up their assets and get their margins up to basically where our Asia Pacific business is running today, which is in the 45% to 50% EBITDA margin basis. But we're being very disciplined about this acquisition. Culturally, it's a meaningful acquisition for us, and we're very sensitive to the environment that we're operating in. But we recognize in the investment decision that over the short term, we weren't going to see any meaningful uplift in the business model and all will be accretive from day 1 because we used debt to buy the asset.

We've actually exported him to -- and he's living in Amsterdam now with his family and is leading the integration effort for Telecity and sort of providing overall oversight to our integration activities in terms of aligning them, keeping them consistent in approach, identifying and applying best practices, et cetera. So that's kind of how we're going about it. In terms of the metrics I think to watch, we're obviously watching them very closely and we will update you as appropriate on these. But I think they are -- number one, what is the -- how are we doing on integrating the sales teams and driving the upsell and the cross-sell activities? And that's one we're probably not going to give a ton of granular insight into publicly, but it's one something that we obviously are watching very, very closely and feel very optimistic about; secondly, the synergy capture. We talked about what we expect in terms of synergies, and we're driving the teams to those expectations to meet or exceed our synergy estimates from an expense synergy standpoint. And then we're aligning our capital planning processes to make sure that we are gaining the capital -- the CapEx energies where we can and ensuring that we continue to have the capacity to respond to the fill rates in high-demand markets; and then lastly, I think probably keeping an eye on our progress on the divestiture and we'll -- again, we'll report our progress to you on that as we have it."

And I feel like that probably had a lot to do with people not expecting a lot of the offices be moved into discontinued ops right away. Could you put a AFFO number alongside the $77 million EBITDA number that you pulled out of the guidance for those divested assets so we could kind of look at a pro forma more normalized number? And any other moving parts on that would be great. And then second, again, along the same lines, just to make sure so we're all on the same page, in terms of the share count we want to be using now -- so we're looking at an AFFO per share. I think that there's a lot of numbers on, I think, Slide 38 in terms of the share count. And if you could kind of tell us -- or 35, which one of these is the one we're supposed to be using to look at valuation?"

I think first and foremost, I think Page 35 clearly depicts the share count activity that you should be expecting both as we sit here at the end of 12/31/15 and then certainly what you should expect on a go-forward basis. And so th",694,"Okay. Certainly, David. I think first and foremost, I think Page 35 clearly depicts the share count activity that you should be expecting both as we sit here at the end of 12/31/15 and then certainly what you should expect on a go-forward basis. And so the numbers that I shared with you, the roughly 6.9 million shares, will be issued to the Telecity shareholders and then the 1.96 million shares issued to convertible debt holders. That all said, I think there is somewhat of a -- there appears to be some clarity over what base -- the denominator is, which is the share count. And so a lot of the discussion then really has to go into what's sitting up in the numerator. I think the most important thing is, as you've sort of alluded to, David, there is -- the divestiture is -- certainly, it's a meaningful divestiture. There's 8 assets, as you can see. As reflected in our bridge, you can see there's roughly $70 million of revenue that's been taken out -- sorry, pardon me, $70 million of EBITDA that's been taken out of the analysis, and that's on Slide 14 for those who are following along. A lot of that value recognizing, that's coming right out of the AFFO base. It's -- there's nothing that gets dragged along with that recognized. Of course, there'll be some movement in maybe how we recognize the revenue or the deferred installation. But overall, that's almost a complete drop-through to the AFFO line. And as a result, when we step back and look at how is the business performing relative to our expectations, I think it's really important to note 2 things. Number one is Equinix proper is driving more margin into the business. Not only did we do it this year, but we're setting ourselves up to do it next year, being 2016. So that $100 million -- the 100 basis points of improvement is certainly being realized. You can see that Telecity is coming in on -- with the remaining co assets, they're going to have a margin profile that's higher than Equinix proper. And then we're also going to continue to work on synergies in the business. So that's going to continue to add value to the go-forward valuation. And then as I said earlier on, Bit-isle is the one piece we recognize that is relatively flat over a period of time. But we recognize that as we continue to synergize the business, as Charles alluded to, and drive up the occupancy of their asset, that's going to drive more value into the top line. So I think the combination of those 3 assets, the organic with the 2 acquisitions, and knowing that we are growing faster than we -- than -- certainly than we anticipated in 2015. And we think we've got a great growth rate coming into '16 at this stage of the game at greater than 13% organically. We're optimistic that the numerator will be -- will drive a lot of value into the per share calculations. All of that to say is we've got to get through 2016. 2016's no different than 2015 when we converted to a REIT. 2016, there's a lot of noise in the system, not only with the REIT conversion and all the other work that we still are doing, but also taking the Telecity assets and moving them into the structure. And so the costs to do that are substantial, but the benefits that we will realize from the Telecity acquisition -- Steve's talked about it. There's revenues, there's cost, there's CapEx, but there's also a much more efficient tax structure that we will operate in under our structure, if you will. And all of that benefit, you're really going to feel it more in '17 than you are in '16. And so you've got to look through '16 to recognize '17. I think it sets itself up well. The currency issues should be gone. The integration cost will really -- we expect them to have really been dialed out, and the operating business should be accelerating as we've alluded to."

I think one thing about churn -- let me break it down maybe not in -- let me break it down between the organic business to Equinix proper. I would tell you our churn levels have -- are at or near their best in a long, long time. That holds true also for 2016. As I mentioned, churn in Q4 was 2.3%. We telegraphed them being as slightly higher. It was attributed to a single customer in our U.K. business that we knew that we'd be relocating to their own specialty built data center. That said, as we look forward, we see churn to be at -- again at one of its lowest levels, I think, we've ever experienced as a company organically. As you then go into the 2 other assets, the Telecity asset and the Bit-isle asset, Telecity is going to be really no different than what you'd see at the Equinix level. Where you're going to see a slightly increased churn is really in Bit-isle. And a lot of reasons for -- when you look at how Bit-isle did in 2014 relative to 2015 and what we're guiding to 2016, there's a number of factors. Number one, they've got nonrecurring activities that will not repeat themselves. They have a little bit of a -- they have an operating unit. It has -- that has -- they put a -- built a solar plant and then sold off some of those assets. That was sitting in their '14 results. It's not in '15. Equally so, they have suffered some substantial churn. They have done exactly what we choose not to do, which is effectively build up a large portion of their inventory with some large customers. And when those customers run into trouble, as you can appreciate, then there is a fairly meaningful churn event. That's what Bit-isle is suffering through not only in '15, and that's why their value was so low, but also, we're going to -- we're still going to feel some of that in '16. And so from my perspective, churn will be, I think, at a very strong level looking into '16."

I'll put -- point on the churn and just say that again, what we continue to see is just the discipline in the business and this commitment to the right application, in the right asset, right customers, right applications",414,"Yes, and I'll hit the other point. I'll put -- point on the churn and just say that again, what we continue to see is just the discipline in the business and this commitment to the right application, in the right asset, right customers, right applications. Right asset continues to manifest itself both in terms of the positive price actions and, correspondingly, to the moderated churn levels. So I think it's absolutely a reflection of the strategy working, as we would expect. The other 2 topics were interconnection. I would say that interconnection, obviously, had an incredibly strong quarter with 7,500 cross connects in aggregate. We track that at a very detailed level or vertical, essentially done on the firm and 2 by every vertical. And every cell in that matrix is growing. The fastest growing are the cloud-related -- sort of the cloud ecosystem on a percentage basis. But the most -- in absolute terms, the biggest contributor continues to be our mature network ecosystem. And the financial services ecosystem continues to contribute significantly. So -- but on a percentage basis, cloud is over-indexing dramatically, like 5x probably, its installed base. And that's just a reflection of, I think, the early days of that and really starting to sort of take shape and scale as enterprises are adopting hybrid cloud. I would also say that part of the driver in the network adds on cross connects is these 300 customers that have adopted Performance Hub, many of whom are using that for WAN optimization strategies and, therefore, driving significant cross connects to network providers. So that's a snapshot on interconnection. And then lastly, on channel, what I would tell you is that we, over the last couple of quarters, have seen a number of our lighthouse marquee deals in the enterprise come through partners. And I think that's a reflection of the -- many of those customers are finding that they need some combination of the infrastructure value delivered by Platform Equinix but desire a managed service element of that implementation. And our partners are doing that very effectively. And so we won some very big deals, as we referenced in the script, from -- through partners with our enterprise lighthouse wins. And we are seeing -- in terms of allocation, the percentage of bookings coming through indirect continue to grow steadily. And we're really focusing, I said, on high-impact partners that we think will help us continue to drive that through '16."

So because of our discipline on executing in that part of the application workload of our customer base and that part of the -- that's non-back-office, non-server farm type workload, we tend to push right through this. And the demand that we see from our customer base today is high, trying to figure out how to take advantage of the cloud computing model.

Look at what Oracle is doing in terms of retooling their business into the cloud. Those are all significant customers of ours. They're all scaling globally with us. And then we are really leveraging that cloud density with that sort of core group as well as a very long tail of SaaS to really attract the enterprise customer and seeing some momentum there. So -- and it is an environment -- although there is market volatility and pressure, I think, on CIOs to manage spending and reduce expense, et cetera, they're often coming to us as a way to achieve those means. And whether that's reducing network cost, adopting public cloud at an accelerated rate or implementing hybrid cloud and moving out of their basement and avoiding spending that capital, those are all things that they can really use us for.

And one of the biggest investments we've made has been in our IT systems and platforms and the people that really continue to work very hard to make them run as efficiently as possible, and then we build the processes and structures around them. That said, we've made those initial investments. We're investing in sale and sort of -- and customer-facing initiatives, which, I would argue, is driving a lot of the value that we see today. But we're also finding ways to reallocate our cost. And part of our efforts today, not only as it related to '15 but also as we look to '16, is how do we run more efficiently and take resources that we're spending money in, make -- run them more efficiently so we can put it back into the business differently. And in fact, there is roughly $24 million of cost that we reallocated in our organization to support our investments in 2016. And so we feel very comfortable about that, but quite frankly, it's a work in progress. We have to continue to lever off our systems, our processes, our people.

I think first and foremost, as it relates to the tax rate, probably a little bit premature for us to tell you what that's going to be because part of the reason we're making such a substantial investment in integration cost in 2016 is to change the organizational structure to meet not only our REIT requirements but our commissioner requirements. And so suffice it to say, we feel that overall, our global tax rate will continue to be in the 10% to 15% cash rate basis. We, as a company and certainly our European business pre-organically, has a lower tax rate than that of our competitors, and so we think we can benefit from that. So stay tuned on that one. Let us come back, but there's a lot of work to deal with there. As it relates to Telecity on the FX side, I think it's important to note we have hedged 85% of the organic business. We have yet to take the position on the Telecity business in Europe primarily because their functional currency is not U.S. dollar. Our functional currency in Europe is U.S. dollar, and so the hedging strategies we would deploy are going to be different today at least for Equinix proper versus the Telecity asset. But suffice it to say, we're going to be looking very closely and try not to destroy value with currency movement. So again, stay tuned on that one. And I'm sorry, I have numbers -- the third one was..."

Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. 2015 was a transformational year for Equinix. We delivered accelerated growth, expanded our global platform with 2 strategic acquisitions, completed our first year operating as a REIT, and established ourselves as a foundation for the cloud ecosystem that continues to drive IT transformation. 
Our strong financial performance reflects our position as the global leader in retail colocation and interconnection, truly serving as the place where opportunity connects for leading networks, clouds, content providers and enterprises. We continue to extend our market-leading network density, attracting wireline, wireless and, increasingly, subsea carriers who are using Platform Equinix to efficiently interconnect and serve their end customers. Our data centers act as a powerful commerce center for the largest service providers to reach their customers and are positioning us to capture the enterprise as they implement next-generation IT architectures. We will further leverage our leadership position through the integration of Telecity and Bit-isle and scale the business to drive even more value for our combined customers.
Before I turn to the quarterly results, I'd like to reflect on a few of the meaningful milestones we achieved in 2015, starting with financial performance on Slide 3. With another year of record bookings activity in 2015, we generated over $2.7 billion of revenue, up 16% year-over-year on a normalized and constant-currency basis. We delivered over $1.27 billion of adjusted EBITDA or a 47% margin, an over 100 basis point improvement over last year, while continuing to invest in the business. This drove AFFO growth of 25% on a normalized and constant-currency basis, exceeding our prior guidance after adjusting for the Telecity transaction-related FX loss.
Second, it was a phenomenal year for our interconnection solutions. Interconnection revenue continues to outpace overall revenue, growing 20% year-over-year on a constant-currency organic basis. With over 171,000 cross connects, 3,300 ports on our Internet exchange and dramatic growth on our Cloud Exchange, we are benefiting from the strong secular trends that are driving businesses to become increasingly interconnected.
Third, we significantly expanded our global platform both organically and inorganically. Equinix completed 20 major IBX expansions in 2015, creating the needed capacity to support strong fill rates in high-demand markets. Overall, our development activity continues to generate highly attractive returns and healthy yield on our sizable base of stabilized assets. With the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, we further expanded Platform Equinix, which now spans 145 data centers across 40 metros and 21 countries. Combined, Equinix now operates over 14 million gross square feet of colocation space, enhancing our position as the largest retail data center footprint in the world.
Fourth, we continue to establish Equinix as the home of the interconnected cloud, which, in turn, is attracting enterprises that are adopting hybrid and multi-cloud as their IT architecture of choice. Key cloud customers, including Amazon, Cisco, IBM, Microsoft and Oracle, to mention a few, are all using Equinix to scale their infrastructure globally and are now deployed across an average of 17 markets.
And finally, we successfully completed our first year operating as a REIT and returned $394 million back to our shareholders. We were included in the S&P 500, the MSCI RMZ and the FTSE NAREIT indices, a reflection of our position as both a technology leader and as the largest data center REIT. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet, raising $2.6 billion in debt and equity in the fourth quarter, fortifying our capital structure while providing a strong liquidity position.
Now turning to the quarter. We had a great finish to the year, delivering record bookings in the fourth quarter with particular strength in the Americas, and robust metrics, including our highest-ever interconnection activity, and very firm yield per cabinet. We continue to take market share, capture an outsized portion of the new infrastructure deployments from both clouds and enterprises. The quality and scale of our wins continues to increase, and we are proud that over 140 of the Fortune 500 are Equinix customers. Our geographic reach remains critical to customers, with over 55% of our revenue coming from customers deployed globally across all 3 regions and over 84% from customers deployed across multiple metros.
Our global platform is increasingly defensible, durable and hard to replicate with regards to reach and capacity as well as performance. With the addition of the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, we added 40 data centers and 1,100 people across Europe and Japan. This scale positions us well to build market leadership, increase capacity, enhance cloud and network density and grow customer ecosystems for years to come. With Telecity, we've added 7 new metro markets to our portfolio, creating a large opportunity for current Equinix customers to expand further north and east across EMEA. Additionally, there are over 500 customers of former Telecity that have business presence in another country where Platform Equinix resides, creating a potential for powerful cross-selling opportunities as we integrate. We are confident both of these transactions will drive significant long-term value creation for our customers and our partners.
Now let me cover quarterly highlights from our industry verticals, starting with the network vertical. This customer base continues to grow as we enhance ecosystems in which networks and mobile providers can participate and grow their businesses. Strong global bandwidth demand is driving a resurgence of subsea cable projects, creating new opportunities for Equinix. These service providers are accelerating returns by terminating cables directly into our IBXs, where they can further benefit by gaining access to key business ecosystems.
In the content and digital media vertical, content customers are expanding across our global platform to meet the continued explosion of consumer demand for digital content and applications. The advertising subsegment remains the fastest growth driver in this vertical as digital advertising takes share from traditional channels. Customers expanding this quarter include AppNexus, which optimizes programmatic digital advertising; AudienceScience, a global advertising technology and services company; and Criteo, a French company specializing in performance marketing.
Turning to the financial services vertical. In addition to our strong electronic trading ecosystem, we continue to diversify across subsegments, including insurance, wealth management and banking, which contributed to record bookings for the quarter. New wins include a top 20 private wealth management firm initiating a multi-cloud strategy to speed to market, a Fortune 500 asset management company that is connecting to clouds over our Equinix Cloud Exchange, and a partner-led deal with a top 10 insurance firm based in Europe.
In cloud and IT services, the cloud ecosystem delivered strong growth this quarter, driven by key Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers, such as AWS and Microsoft, as well as momentum with Software-as-a-Service providers who represent the fastest-growing subsegment of this vertical. SaaS customer expansions include ServiceNow, an IT service management provider; and Shape Security, an advanced application defense provider that offers security services for Cloud Exchange clients. We continue to see momentum on our Cloud Exchange and have over 300 enterprises clouds, IT service providers and networks interconnecting using our solution.
Turning to the enterprise. The enterprise vertical delivered strong bookings as businesses seek to re-architect IT to adapt to rapidly changing business requirements. By leveraging an interconnection-oriented architecture, enterprises can address multiple IT challenges and solve for the cost, scaling and performance needs of today's digital world. For the second quarter, enterprise was the largest source of new customer adds, with particular traction in manufacturing and professional services. New wins include Polo Ralph Lauren, a premium clothing and lifestyle brand; Granite Construction, an S&P 500 civil general contractor and construction material producer; and Oriflame Cosmetics, a Swedish cosmetic manufacturer. Over 300 customers have deployed our Performance Hub solution, which is an extremely attractive entry point for enterprise customers who seek to optimize network architectures and also access the cloud and drive application performance, and we are already enjoying significant upsell and cross-sell traction with these customers.
So let me stop here and turn it over to Keith to cover some more specifics for the quarter."
28202,321490066,936671,"Equinix, Inc.

Let me start by saying from so many points of view, Q4 was the best quarter we have experienced to date. The momentum in our organic business, combined with Telecity and Bit-isle, sets us up nicely for 2016 as well as our initial look-through into 2017. And with my prepared remarks, I'll first review our full year 2015 results, then I'll provide some commentary on key metrics for '16, which have a number of moving parts. Finally, I'll wrap up with some high-level comments on the fourth quarter.
So starting with revenues. We reported revenues of over $2.72 billion for 2015, a 16% year-over-year normalized and constant-currency growth rate, a clear demonstration of our ability to drive outsized growth as we benefit from the scale of our global platform as well as enjoy record nonrecurring revenue activity. And we believe this momentum will continue into 2016. We expect to deliver normalized and constant-currency growth of greater than 13% for our organic business and over $540 million of revenues from Telecity and Bit-isle at current exchange rates. We believe the Telecity business, net of the expected divestitures, will grow revenues between 8% and 9% in 2016, while Bit-isle's revenues will remain essentially flat year-over-year, consistent with our expectations while we look to optimize this business over the next 24 months.
In 2015, we improved our organic adjusted EBITDA margin by over 100 basis points to 46.7%. And as we continue to scale the business, we expect to deliver another 100 basis points of improvement on the organic business in 2016 as we maintain discipline and focus on our spending initiatives. Another key driver to our continued margin improvement is the healthy price yield derived from a disciplined pricing initiative and strong interconnection activity. For 2016, we expect our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins to be greater than 47.3%, excluding integration costs, or 45.6% on an as-reported basis.
Our 2015 pro forma AFFO, which excludes the impact of the Telecity FX losses and the integration cost, was $905 million, significantly higher than expected for the year. Looking forward on a normalized and constant-currency basis, 2016 AFFO is expected to grow greater than 23% over the prior year.
With respect to the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, we're very excited about these acquisitions and the ability to strengthen our market position. That said, I want to highlight a few areas, recognizing we'll be incurring some costs that won't be part of the ongoing business, thereby allowing you to better understand the combined business on a go-forward basis.
So let me start with FX. We elected to hedge the cash portion of the Telecity purchase price. In effect, we locked in the dollar value of this sizable deal. This resulted in an FX loss of $61 million in 2015, with $49 million of the loss being recognized in Q4. These losses impacted our AFFO metric for both Q3 and Q4 and for the year. For Q1, as we completed the purchase of the Telecity acquisition, we experienced an incremental $50 million loss in the quarter. Again, this loss will impact our Q1 and 2016 AFFO metric. Finally, it's important to know that the offset to the Telecity FX losses is a corresponding reduction to the purchase price of Telecity.
For both Telecity and Bit-isle, we've begun the integration process to combine the teams, the organizations and the systems together. We expect to incur $58 million in integration cost in 2016, as anticipated in our investment models, with an approximate $20 million of additional integration cost being spent in 2017. These costs supports systems work of significance, employees cost, including severance and retention, and substantial organizational restructuring in support of our REIT and other tax initiatives. We expect incremental revenue, cost and CapEx synergies from the acquisitions of -- from Telecity and Bit-isle as we integrate these businesses. 
Our current revenue guidance contemplates modest revenue synergy assumptions this year, which we expect to ramp up over time as both Equinix and Telecity customers leverage the expanded footprint, service portfolio and rich ecosystems of the combined company. As we progress with our integration efforts, we also expect to achieve $30 million in annual cost savings, with about 50% of these savings being realized before the end of this year and the rest coming in 2017. For CapEx synergies, the available Bit-isle inventory has positioned us well in the Tokyo market, allowing us to defer significant capital spend to other projects, while the Telecity capacity in our overlapping markets allows us to free up capital to be deployed in other markets, both in Europe and across the platform.
And as previously announced, we need to divest 8 assets from the combined Equinix-Telecity EMEA business, with a target divestiture date of mid-2016. In light of the current momentum in the business and the size of the market opportunity in front of us, it is our intention to reinvest the divestiture proceeds back into the business. We currently believe this is the highest and best use of our capital. We believe this allows us to maximize both our short- and longer-term shareholder value objectives while driving us -- oh sorry, while providing us the strategic and operational flexibility we've historically enjoyed, particularly during volatile times. And these proceeds, along with capital raised in November, should allow us to self-fund the business for the foreseeable future despite our increased expansion activities and anticipated growing cash dividend.
From an AFFO perspective, the value of these acquisitions and their AFFO-generating potential is better than our original assumptions. With a review -- with a view towards 2017, we expect these acquisitions, on a combined basis, to be accretive to Equinix's AFFO per share for the 2017 reporting year, excluding the integration cost.
So turning to the fourth quarter. It was another terrific quarter at Equinix. Our strategy continues to deliver better-than-expected results across the company. At the global level, we had record gross and net bookings, with particular strength in the financial services and enterprise verticals. Our interconnection metrics were again outstanding as we added 7,500 cross connects and 162 exchange ports this quarter. Our MRR per cab on an FX-neutral basis was very firm, and we remain well positioned across each of our operating regions.
As depicted on Slide 4, global Q4 revenues were $730.5 million, our 52nd consecutive quarter of top line revenue growth, up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 17% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant-currency basis. Our as-reported revenues include $21.6 million of Bit-isle revenue from November and December, consistent with our expectations and the investment model. Q4 organic revenues, net of our FX hedges, absorbs an $8 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter and a $4 million negative currency impact when compared to our FX guidance rates.
Currency volatility against the majority of our key operating currencies continue to cause significant FX headwinds. For 2016, the strength in the U.S. dollar creates a $51 million FX headwind against revenues and a $29 million headwind against adjusted EBITDA for our organic business when compared to the average FX raised -- rates used in 2015. For Europe, we've hedged over 85% of our Equinix organic business. Given the growth of the international businesses, including Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions, we expect our revenue mix to shift, such that greater than 50% of our revenues will be generated from outside the U.S.
Global adjusted EBITDA was $333.1 million, up 4% over the prior quarter and 20% over the same quarter last year on a normalized and constant-currency basis. Our normalized adjusted EBITDA margin was 46.4% and includes $2.8 million in integration cost. Our Q4 organic adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a negative $5.4 million currency impact when compared to the average FX rates last quarter and a $1.2 million negative impact when compared to our guidance rates.
Global AFFO was $178 million. Excluding the Telecity foreign currency loss and acquisition-related cost, AFFO, on a normalized and constant-currency basis, increased 4% over the prior quarter, above the top end of our guidance range by $13 million, largely due to lower-than-expected cash taxes.
And finally, moving to churn. Global MRR churn for Q4 was 2.3%, consistent with our prior guidance and weighted towards the end of the quarter. For 2016, we expect our quarterly MRR churn to remain in our targeted 2% to 2.5% quarterly range.
I'd like to provide some highlights on the regions, whose full results are covered on Slides 5 to 7. All 3 regions delivered better-than-expected revenues, with EMEA and Asia Pacific showing normalized and constant-currency growth of 20% and 25% respectively, while the Americas region produced growth of 13% on its much larger base. The Americas region had a great quarter, delivering record bookings driven by the financial and enterprise verticals, very firm yield per cabinet and the best interconnection quarter of all time. EMEA delivered another strong quarter of bookings, with particular strength in our French and German markets, while Asia Pacific continued its rapid growth as customers deploy across the region, with gross bookings driven by cloud and IT services, enterprise and network verticals. Interconnection revenues continued to outpace overall growth of the business, with the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific interconnection revenues now at 22%, 10% and 13%, respectively, of the recurring revenues.
And now looking at balance sheet. Please refer to Slide 8. Unrestricted cash and investments increased this quarter to $2.2 billion due to the successful financings in November, while our restricted cash balances totaled $490 million, largely due to the escrow funds related to the Telecity deal. Our year-end net debt leverage ratio was 3.2x at Q4-end annualized adjusted EBITDA, although steps up to greater than 4x after funding the cash portion of the Telecity transaction. Given the favorable cash flow attributes of the business model, we expect the Equinix calculated leverage ratio to return to the higher end of our targeted 3 to 4x adjusted EBITDA over the next 12 to 18 months.
Now switching to AFFO and dividends on Slide 9. For 2016, we expect our as-reported AFFO to be greater than $970 million, a 17% year-over-year increase. On a normalized and constant-currency basis, AFFO would be greater than $1.078 billion or a 23% increase over the prior year.
Turning to dividends. Today, we announced our Q1 dividend of $1.75 a share, a 3.6% increase over the prior cash dividend per share. For 2016, our projected total cash dividends to be paid will increase to approximately $500 million, a 27% increase over the prior year. Our normalized AFFO payout ratio will approximate 52% in 2016. Our estimated share count for 2016 approximate 70.5 million shares, including 6.9 million shares issued to Telecity shareholders and 1.96 million shares expected to be issued in June 2016 to our convertible debt holders. We continue to believe that both organic and inorganic growth will be the primary ingredient for a steadily growing cash dividend, and we've maintained the flexibility to move additional entities from the taxable REIT structure to the qualified REIT structure over time.
Now looking at capital expenditures. Please refer to Slide 10. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $281 million, including recurring CapEx of $45 million, slightly higher than guidance due to the timing of cash payments to our contractors. We now have 14 announced expansion projects underway. For 2016, we expect 95% of expansion capital to be allocated to campus or existing market builds and 5% for new market development. Given the strong performance in our key markets, we expect to move forward with additional expansion phases in Ashburn, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Silicon Valley and a new flagship build in the Amsterdam Science Park, an interconnection hub. Also, given our high utilization rate of 81% and increasing, as well as some strong development returns, we expect 2016 CapEx to range between $900 million and $1 billion, which contemplates several new first-phase IBX builds on our core Equinix-owned campuses, including Ashburn and Silicon Valley as well as a number of non-U.S. campuses.
And finally, we've provided you a number of slides that bridge the normalized 2015 performance to our 2016 guidance, including slides for revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Please refer to Slides 13 to 17. These slides also include the contributions from Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions. Steve?"

Thanks, Keith. Let me now cover our 2016 strategy on Slide 12. Our strategic priorities remain centered on driving growth by pressing our competitive advantage and investing to capture significant opportunities, such as the cloud-enabled enterprise. We will allocate capital towards these high-value opportunities and, in turn, will strengthen our economic model.
In the near term, we will focus our energy on successfully integrating Telecity and Bit-isle and growing our market leadership globally. Organically, our efforts will be focused on capturing the enterprise through a series of initiatives to build cloud density, create and deploy innovative product solutions, generate demand in targeted segments and provide professional services focused on enabling the adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud. We will also continue to ramp our channel program to enhance our reach and to the enterprise through agents, resellers, systems integrators and key platform partners.
Over the longer term, interconnection will continue to be the essence of our advantage, and Equinix is well positioned to become the intersection point between the Internet of Things, clouds, networks and the enterprises. We are making meaningful investments to foster new ecosystems to capture this opportunity, and we'll continue to invest in scaling our systems and processes and evolving our capabilities in response to these customer needs. Based on what we see in the market and the steps we are taking at Equinix to capitalize on these opportunities, I continue to be very optimistic about our future.
And last, on Slide 18, which summarizes our Q1 and full year 2016 guidance, including FX impacts. Let me cover a few thoughts on our 2016 outlook. First, we continue to deliver another solid year of growth. For the full year of 2016, we expect revenues to be greater than $3.55 billion, a 30% growth on an as-reported basis, or a normalized and constant-currency growth rate of greater than 13% year-over-year.
Second, our organic adjusted EBITDA margin continues to improve as we drive increased efficiency into the business and scale our operating model. For 2016, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be greater than $1.62 billion or 16% year-over-year growth on a normalized and constant-currency basis. This includes a 100 basis point adjusted EBITDA margin improvement for the Equinix organic business.
And the growth of our business is driving increased adjusted funds from operations and, ultimately, cash flow and dividends. AFFO normalized for the Telecity transaction-related FX loss is expected to be greater than $1.078 billion, a 23% growth year-over-year, demonstrating the health of the business model.
And finally, given our strong pipeline, firm yield and healthy returns, we continue to invest in our business and expect 2016 capital expenditures to range between $900 million and $1 billion for the year.
So in closing, the strength of our business is translating into solid revenue growth, firm yield and healthy margins, all of which combine to give us the financial firepower to continue to invest in our global platform and develop innovative solutions. Our fundamental growth continues to drive significant value creation for our shareholders, a reflection of the important role that we play in the rapidly evolving digital economy.

And I guess the 3 things that really stand out are, last quarter, you talked about a second consecutive quarter of positive pricing actions, you talked about an accelerating TAM and you talked about the beginning of the emergence of cloud-driven enterprise demand. And while you highlighted enterprise amongst the verticals that were strong, I'd certainly love to hear anything explicit as it applies to sort of, again, cloud-driven enterprise demand. So just if you could sort of review us on those 3 points."

Why don't I start with a couple of comments, and Charles and Keith can chime in here. Those are 3 good questions, Jonathan. The pricing actions continue to be favorable to us as we renew and move forward with existing customers that are extending in multiple markets with us. So we're staying very disciplined with our activities and our actions and our deal reviews with our customers as they continue to grow into the global platform. And so that's showing up every quarter. And I would just tell you that's tied to the discipline of our deal reviews and how we manage that, and Charles can talk about that in a second because he sits on top of those. The accelerating TAM, generally, is because we're prosecuting a dozen-plus other industry verticals that we refer to as the enterprise, outside of our core 5 industry verticals that we've been focused on. And it goes to these hundreds of thousands of customers -- prospects, I should say, that we are knocking on their door now via the channel or via the direct sales engine to talk to them about helping them enable them to get to the multi-cloud and get to the hybrid cloud environment. So the cloud enterprise -- the simple answer, the reason why we're a cloud -- enabling these data centers is to replicate the network density that we achieved the first 16, 17 years of this company to make it easy for any CIO of an enterprise to look inside these facilities and see that they can publicly, privately move their traffic, certain applications that are mission-critical, revenue-facing, customer-focused applications that they can get them to the multi-cloud and get them to take advantage of the performance, the cost and the IT transformation that's taking place. So it's -- we're seeing uplift across all 3 of these things because of -- generally because of the uptake in cloud, and cloud is driving most of this. Charles, why don't you add a little bit of color here?"

We continue positive pricing actions, and as Steve said, that's showing up in our yield continuing to be very firm across the board in terms of MRR per cab. The accelerating TAM is really absolutely linked to this enterprise phenomenon and the building and the scaling of the cloud ecosystem, both the cloud density -- CSP side of that ecosystem as well as the enterprise. And I think we've had -- continue to have a number of big lighthouse wins. And what I would tell you is that I think this is probably the eighth consecutive quarter that both cloud and enterprise has over-indexed on a bookings basis relative to their installed base, meaning that those -- we're continuing to see an evolution of the business not because our mature ecosystems are waning, but rather because we're seeing an acceleration in the cloud ecosystem. And this big addressable market is really an artifact of people migrating to the cloud, adopting public cloud, using Equinix as a private-access option to the public cloud and really enabling -- really selecting multi-cloud, hybrid cloud as the IT architecture of choice. And I think if you look at our core metrics, the business is really hitting on all cylinders against all 3 of those factors."

Why don't I take that and let Keith and Charles add to what thoughts I might have here. So you -- most or all of you should be aware that publicly, there are a couple of big telcos that are interested in trying to divest some assets. And these are both the big telcos that acquired cloud companies 3, 4, 5 years ago, and it includes those cloud data centers. It's public. It's -- they're positioning them. They're talking to several people. We are one of them and it -- our position is there are certain assets in those portfolios that we would be interested in, obviously where there's cloud network density and the power and location. But there's many of those assets that wouldn't make any sense for us. So we're in the early stages, exploratory stages, talking to these companies. Those are the 2 that are public. There's other conversations going on. There's plenty of companies that are interested in getting out of the data center business. So it's a very active market, on top of the divestiture that Keith mentioned that we're doing in Europe. So there's a lot of activity, mostly pressured and driven by the big Infrastructure-as-a-Service companies who are going as fast as they are, AWS, Microsoft, Google, et cetera. And they're putting a lot of pressure on companies that decided to get into the Infrastructure-as-a-Service business. And now they're deciding to get out of it, and the data centers are going with it. The telcos probably aimed -- most of that cash that we collect on these will be aimed at -- as you all know, aimed at spectrum and aimed at their mobile initiatives. And so it makes sense why they're looking at these. But as I said, we'll -- there are specific assets that would make sense to us, but it's very early days in the dialogue.

Let me first start with Bit-isle because I think that's an important one. Then Charles, perhaps you can take the Telecity one. I think what's really important to understand about Bit-isle, as we said in our prepared remarks, revenues are essentially flat quarter-over-quarter. And I want certainly investors to realize, from a margin perspective, Bit-isle is dilutive to our margins today. It is very clear to us, given the inventory capacity they have in the Tokyo market specifically. This was an asset that we bought for a sub-10 multiple to EBITDA. We believe we -- upon filling up our assets, we're going to be able to enjoy the ability to fill up their assets over a period of time while at the same time assessing, if you will, the strategic landscape of the number of operating units that Bit-isle had. And so as a company, we fully intend, over a reasonable period of time -- it will not be over an 18- or 24-month period but probably over the next 3 to 4 years, that we would be able to capture all of the value associated with the Bit-isle acquisition, fill up their assets and get their margins up to basically where our Asia Pacific business is running today, which is in the 45% to 50% EBITDA margin basis. But we're being very disciplined about this acquisition. Culturally, it's a meaningful acquisition for us, and we're very sensitive to the environment that we're operating in. But we recognize in the investment decision that over the short term, we weren't going to see any meaningful uplift in the business model, and albeit it's accretive from day 1 because we used debt to buy the asset, we're going to be very methodical about how we drive value into that acquisition.

I think that these are obviously both somewhat localized assets, with Telecity being a strictly European platform and Bit-isle really being contained to Japan. So our local teams, both in EMEA region and in Japan have, have primary responsibility for driving the integration efforts. That said, we did take an individual from my team, who really has been my right hand for quite a while when I ran the Americas business and into my role as the COO, who really understands our business deeply, has a deep network across the company. We've actually exported him to -- and he's living in Amsterdam now with his family and is leading the integration effort for Telecity and sort of providing overall oversight to our integration activities in terms of aligning them, keeping them consistent in approach, identifying and applying best practices, et cetera. So that's kind of how we're going about it. In terms of the metrics I think to watch, we're obviously watching them very closely and we will update you as appropriate on these. But I think they are -- number one, what is the -- how are we doing on integrating the sales teams and driving the upsell and the cross-sell activities? And that's one we're probably not going to give a ton of granular insight into publicly, but it's something that we obviously are watching very, very closely and feel very optimistic about. Secondly, the synergy capture. We talked about what we expect in terms of synergies, and we're driving the teams to those expectations to meet or exceed our synergy estimates from an expense synergy standpoint. And then we're aligning our capital planning processes to make sure that we are gaining the capital -- the CapEx energies where we can and ensuring that we continue to have the capacity to respond to the fill rates in high-demand markets. And then lastly, I think probably keeping an eye on our progress on the divestiture and we'll -- again, we'll report our progress to you on that as we have it."

Could you put an AFFO number alongside the $77 million EBITDA number that you pulled out of the guidance for those divested assets so we could kind of look at a pro forma more normalized number? And any other moving parts on that would be great. And then second, again, along the same lines, just to make sure so we're all on the same page, in terms of the share count we want to be using now -- so we're looking at an AFFO per share. I think that there's a lot of numbers on, I think, Slide 38 in terms of the share count. And if you could kind of tell us -- or 35, which one of these is the one we're supposed to be using to look at valuation?"

And so th",693,"Okay. Certainly, David. I think first and foremost, I think Page 35 clearly depicts the share count activity that you should be expecting both as we sit here at the end of 12/31/15 and then certainly what you should expect on a go-forward basis. And so the numbers that I shared with you, the roughly 6.9 million shares will be issued to the Telecity shareholders and then the 1.96 million shares issued to convertible debt holders. That all said, I think there is somewhat of a -- there appears to be some clarity over what base the denominator is, which is the share count. And so a lot of the discussion then really has to go into what's sitting up in the numerator. I think the most important thing is, as you've sort of alluded to, David, there is -- the divestiture is -- certainly, it's a meaningful divestiture. There's 8 assets, as you can see. As reflected in our bridge, you can see there's roughly $70 million of revenue that's been taken out -- sorry, pardon me, $70 million of EBITDA that's been taken out of the analysis, and that's on Slide 14 for those who are following along. A lot of that value recognizing, that's coming right out of the AFFO base. It's -- there's nothing that gets dragged along with that recognized. Of course, there'll be some movement in maybe how we recognize the revenue or the deferred installation. But overall, that's almost a complete drop-through to the AFFO line. And as a result, when we step back and look at how is the business performing relative to our expectations, I think it's really important to note 2 things. Number one is Equinix proper is driving more margin into the business. Not only did we do it this year, but we're setting ourselves up to do it next year, being 2016. So that $100 million -- the 100 basis points of improvement is certainly being realized. You can see that Telecity is coming in on -- with the remaining co [ph] assets, they're going to have a margin profile that's higher than Equinix proper. And then we're also going to continue to work on synergies in the business. So that's going to continue to add value to the go-forward valuation. And then as I said earlier on, Bit-isle is the one piece we recognize that is relatively flat over a period of time. But we recognize that as we continue to synergize the business, as Charles alluded to, and drive up the occupancy of their assets, that's going to drive more value into the top line. So I think the combination of those 3 assets, the organic with the 2 acquisitions, and knowing that we are growing faster than we -- than -- certainly than we anticipated in 2015, and we think we've got a great growth rate coming into '16 at this stage of the game at greater than 13% organically, we're optimistic that the numerator will be -- will drive a lot of value into the per-share calculations. All of that to say is we've got to get through 2016. 2016's no different than 2015 when we converted to a REIT. 2016, there's a lot of noise in the system, not only with the REIT conversion and all the other work that we still are doing, but also taking the Telecity assets and moving them into the structure. And so the costs to do that are substantial, but the benefits that we will realize from the Telecity acquisition -- Steve's talked about it. There's revenues, there's cost, there's CapEx, but there's also a much more efficient tax structure that we will operate in under our structure, if you will. And all of that benefit, you're really going to feel it more in '17 than you are in '16. And so you've got to look through '16 to recognize '17. I think it sets itself up well. The currency issues should be gone. The integration cost will really -- we expect them to have really been dialed down, and the operating business should be accelerating, as we've alluded to."

I think one thing about churn -- let me break it down maybe not in -- let me break it down between the organic business or Equinix proper. I would tell you our churn levels have -- are at or near their best in a long, long time. That holds true also for 2016. As I mentioned, churn in Q4 was 2.3%. We telegraphed them being slightly higher. It was attributed to a single customer in our U.K. business that we knew that we'd be relocating to their own specialty-built data center. That said, as we look forward, we see churn to be at -- again at one of its lowest levels, I think, we've ever experienced as a company organically. As you then go into the 2 other assets, the Telecity asset and the Bit-isle asset, Telecity is going to be really no different than what you'd see at the Equinix level. Where you're going to see a slightly increased churn is really in Bit-isle. And a lot of reasons for -- when you look at how Bit-isle did in 2014 relative to 2015 and what we're guiding to 2016, there's a number of factors. Number one, they've got nonrecurring activities that will not repeat themselves. They have a little bit of a -- they have an operating unit that it has -- that has -- they put a -- built a solar plant and then sold off some of those assets. That was sitting in their '14 results. It's not in '15. Equally so, they have suffered some substantial churn. They have done exactly what we choose not to do, which is effectively build up a large portion of their inventory with some large customers. And when those customers run into trouble, as you can appreciate, then there is a fairly meaningful churn event. That's what Bit-isle is suffering through not only in '15, and that's why their value was so low, but also, we're going to -- we're still going to feel some of that in '16. And so from my perspective, churn will be, I think, at a very strong level looking into '16."

I'll put -- point on the churn and just say that again, what we continue to see is just the discipline in the business and this commitment to the right application, in the right asset, right customers, right applications",416,"Yes, and I'll hit the other point. I'll put -- point on the churn and just say that again, what we continue to see is just the discipline in the business and this commitment to the right application, in the right asset, right customers, right applications, right asset, continues to manifest itself both in terms of the positive price actions and, correspondingly, to the moderated churn levels. So I think it's absolutely a reflection of the strategy working as we would expect. The other 2 topics were interconnection. I would say that interconnection, obviously, had an incredibly strong quarter with 7,500 cross connects in aggregate. We track that at a very detailed level of vertical, essentially done on the from and to by every vertical. And every cell in that matrix is growing. The fastest growing are the cloud-related -- sort of the cloud ecosystem on a percentage basis. But the most -- in absolute terms, the biggest contributor continues to be our mature network ecosystem. And the financial services ecosystem continues to contribute significantly. So -- but on a percentage basis, cloud is over-indexing dramatically, like 5x, probably, its installed base. And that's just a reflection of, I think, the early days of that and really starting to sort of take shape and scale as enterprises are adopting hybrid cloud. I would also say that part of the driver in the network adds on cross connects is these 300 customers that have adopted Performance Hub, many of whom are using that for WAN optimization strategies and, therefore, driving significant cross connects to network providers. So that's a snapshot on interconnection. And then lastly, on channel, what I would tell you is that we, over the last couple of quarters, have seen a number of our lighthouse marquee deals in the enterprise come through partners. And I think that's a reflection of the -- that many of those customers are finding that they need some combination of the infrastructure value delivered by Platform Equinix but desire a managed service element of that implementation. And our partners are doing that very effectively. And so we won some very big deals, as we referenced in the script, from -- through partners with our enterprise lighthouse wins. And we are seeing -- in terms of allocation, the percentage of bookings coming through indirect continue to grow steadily. And we're really focusing, as I said, on high-impact partners that we think will help us continue to drive that through '16."

We -- because we're so focused on the type of application workload with our client base that is not considered discretionary and it's more mission-critical, even in volatile times, as Keith alluded to, we tend to perform better than the market because we are dealing with revenue, customer-facing, globally deployed-type application workloads that are critical to run these businesses. So because of our discipline on executing in that part of the application workload of our customer base and that part of the -- that's non-back-office, non-server-farm-type workload, we tend to push right through this. And the demand that we see from our customer base today is high, trying to figure out how to take advantage of the cloud computing model. And so our pipeline, if you were able to see into our pipeline, which you guys can't, you would see very good coverage ratios, and you would see the strongest pipeline in the history of the company. So the signals for us across all the regions are -- emanate themselves on our pipeline and emanate themselves on our coverage ratios, and all I can tell you at this point is they are strong as they've ever been.

Look at what Oracle is doing in terms of retooling their business into the cloud. Those are all significant customers of ours. They're all scaling globally with us. And then we are really leveraging that cloud density with that sort of core group as well as a very long tail of SaaS to really attract the enterprise customer and seeing some momentum there. So -- and it is an environment -- although there is market volatility and pressure, I think, on CIOs to manage spending and reduce expense, et cetera, they're often coming to us as a way to achieve those means. And whether that's reducing network cost, adopting public cloud at an accelerated rate or implementing hybrid cloud and moving out of their basement and avoiding spending that capital, those are all things that they can really use us for.

So there's a lot of focus out there, some private investment, partially funded by some of the big global -- the global cloud providers. It's definitely being driven by cloud. We're involved in many more conversations than we ever have in the future -- or in the past, I should say. And the advancements in technology today is allowing these operators to bypass the traditional shore-based landing facilities and go all the way to terminating at a data center like Equinix. So we're catching that volume now. There's been 4 or 5 public announcements that we've made of ones there that we participated in. There's been a couple that have connected U.S., Japan, New York, London. And so there's a whole bunch going on now. We're probably involved in a dozen more projects today that are at different stages of assessment, development and construction. So it is very active. It is driven by the cloud and by the bandwidth amount of traffic around the world, and they can terminate these cables today very easily into data centers. And so we're front and center on this topic."

What we're doing today is we're operating more efficiently. And it's important to recognize over the last 3 to 4 years, we've made heavy investments across a number of different functional groups to scale the organization to be global. And one of the biggest investments we've made has been in our IT systems and platforms and the people that really continue to work very hard to make them run as efficiently as possible, and then we build the processes and structures around them. That said, we've made those initial investments. We're investing in sale and sort of -- and customer-facing initiatives, which, I would argue, is driving a lot of the value that we see today. But we're also finding ways to reallocate our cost. And part of our efforts today, not only as it related to '15 but also as we look to '16, is how do we run more efficiently and take resources that we're spending money in, make -- run them more efficiently so we can put it back into the business differently. And in fact, there is roughly $24 million of cost that we reallocated in our organization to support our investments in 2016. And so we feel very comfortable about that, but quite frankly, it's a work in progress. We have to continue to lever off our systems, our processes, our people. And that's something that you'll see in '16, but you're also going to see us globalize it as we bring in Telecity and we bring in Bit-isle over the next -- through '17, '18 and '19. We'll continue to make these investments, and I would argue that can drive more value into the business."

So hopefully, you guys can bang out them pretty quickly. The first one is on Telecity. I was curious what tax rate we should thinking about for 2016. My understanding is that they're still under the U.K. tax jurisdiction, which is different than how you guys treat your European assets. And when is it that we might actually see Telecity shift from its current tax structure to that of the overall Equinix business? The second one is on 2017. You mentioned that you thought that Telecity would be accretive to 2017 after integration costs. You mentioned integration costs, I think, in 2017, will be $20 million. Will it be accretive even including those integration costs? And then the third question is on Telecity and your FX hedge. I think you mentioned that you've hedged about 80% of your core business in Europe. Do you plan on hedging any of the Telecity revenues at some point this year? And perhaps how much would those be?"

I think first and foremost, as it relates to the tax rate, probably a little bit premature for us to tell you what that's going to be because part of the reason we're making such a substantial investment in integration cost in 2016 is to change the organizational structure to meet not only our REIT requirements but our commissionary [ph] requirements. And so suffice it to say, we feel that overall, our global tax rate will continue to be in the 10% to 15% on a cash rate basis. We, as a company, and certainly our European business pre-organically, has a lower tax rate than that of our competitors, and so we think we can benefit from that. So stay tuned on that one. Let us come back, but there's a lot of work to deal with there. As it relates to Telecity on the FX side, I think it's important to note we have hedged 85% of the organic business. We have yet to take the position on the Telecity business in Europe, primarily because their functional currency is not U.S. dollar. Our functional currency in Europe is U.S. dollar, and so the hedging strategies we would deploy are going to be different, today at least, for Equinix proper versus the Telecity asset. But suffice it to say, we're going to be looking very closely and try not to destroy value with currency movement. So again, stay tuned on that one.

Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We had a great start to 2016, delivering both revenue and adjusted EBITDA above the top end of our guidance ranges as demand for interconnected colocation continues to drive strong performance across all 3 of our regions. 
As depicted on Slide 3, revenues were $844.2 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 16% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $380.7 million for the quarter, up 4% over the prior quarter and up 17% year-over-year on an organic and constant currency basis. This drove AFFO growth of 35% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. 
For the quarter, we delivered strong gross and net bookings, with solid production from both our direct and indirect channels as we scale our go-to-market efforts. Our key operating metrics demonstrate the strength of our ecosystem-centric business model with firm MRR per cabinet, low churn and healthy interconnection growth. 
Our global platform continues to be a critical source of differentiation, making us the partner of choice for customers looking to respond effectively through increasingly distributed infrastructure requirements. Our reach is allowing us to gain market share while tapping into higher growth markets, with EMEA and Asia Pacific now contributing greater than 50% of our revenues and our geographic reach stretching across 21 countries and 40 metros. 
We are pleased with the Telecity acquisition and are excited to add this great set of quality assets and people to the platform -- to Platform Equinix. With less than 90 days under our belt, we are already seeking healthy momentum across platform bookings and are making rapid progress on integration despite the significance size and complexity of this transaction. 
Overall, the Telecity assets delivered solid financial performance consistent with our guidance for revenue and adjusted EBITDA while absorbing efforts related to the deal close and the planned divestitures. We see the anticipated revenue synergies materializing and are tracking well to our expected cost and CapEx synergies, all of which is a great validation of the deal rationale.
Bit-isle is also progressing well, tracking above our prior guidance with several strategic wins enabled by these new assets. Our integration efforts are on track, and our plans to optimize the business remain ahead of schedule. As we integrate these 2 acquisitions, we expect to achieve a combined $30 million in annual cost savings, with about 50% of these savings realized before the end of this year and the remainder in 2017. 
With Telecity and Bit-isle, we now serve over 8,000 customers and are proud that over 150 of the Fortune 500 are Equinix customers. We have increased our already market-leading network density from 1,100 to over 1,400 networks and have added a number of critical new cloud notes to Platform Equinix. 
We are extending our value proposition as the home of the interconnected cloud with industry-leading providers such as AWS, Microsoft and Google, contributing directly to the increase in our enterprise business by enabling enterprise CIOs to quickly and cost-effectively implement multi-cloud architectures. 
Our cloud and enterprise verticals, which represent 28% and 13% of our revenues, respectively, remain our fastest-growing market segments and contributed the highest number of new customer additions for the sixth quarter in a row. 
Interconnection revenue grew a healthy 19% year-over-year on an organic and constant currency basis. With over 176,000 cross connects and significant growth on an Internet and our Cloud Exchange, Equinix is benefiting from strong secular trends that are driving businesses to become increasingly interconnected. We run the largest Internet exchange globally with 5.5 terabits of peak traffic growing 30% year-over-year as networks and cloud providers continue to upgrade their capacity. 
Given our high utilization rate of 80% and strong returns on development capital, we continue to expand in core markets, heavily weighted towards existing campuses in Tier 1 markets -- metros, which exhibit strong pipelines and attractive supply-demand profiles. We now have 16 announced expansion projects underway, and this quarter, we are moving forward with additional expansions in Silicon Valley, New York and Hong Kong, totaling over $200 million of CapEx. 
In Silicon Valley, demand remains robust and we are building SV10, a new IBX located directly adjacent to our Great Oaks campus, home to a rich ecosystem of networking cloud hubs and the second-largest peering market in the U.S. after our Ashburn campus in Northern Virginia. Notably, for SV10, we purchased the 11 acres of land for this project, expanding our asset ownership in this important market. 
In New York, we are proceeding with the second phase of New York 5, the flagship asset on our Secaucus campus, which is comprised of 4 adjacent data centers with over 10,000 cabinets and is a key growth engine for our Americas business. New York 5 saw strong pull-through post the deployment of the trading engine and is also seeing solid demand from the broader financial services community as they embrace hybrid cloud. Our first phase of New York 5 project is already 85% full with strong pricing.
Our capital investments continued to deliver very healthy growth as well as strong returns across our new expansion and stabilized IBXs as shown on Slide 4. The operating performance of our 70 stabilized global IBXs delivered steady revenue growth of 7%, an increase over the prior quarter, while generating a 31% cash on cash return on the gross PP&E invested, reflecting the tremendous economic value of these stabilized campuses. 
Stabilized assets include projects that have been open for more than 1 year with all phases built out. As we shift to 2016, a net 3 IBXs were added to this category and utilization of these assets remains a healthy 86%. 
Let me now cover quarterly highlights from our industry verticals and I'll start with the networks. This vertical experienced strong bookings, driven by multisite expansions with Tier 1 service providers and new wins with Tier 2 providers and cable operators who are shifting their portfolios to address demand for IP and digital services. 
We are seeing a resurgence of subsea cable projects to support global cloud deployments and growth of international data traffic, which are creating new opportunities for Equinix. There are more than 50 global submarine cable projects under consideration over the coming 2 years, which places Equinix in a great position to win a portion of this next generation of submarine cable investment.
In the content digital media vertical, performance was driven by expansions from both traditional lighthouse content providers and our Ad-IX ecosystem. Advertisers continued to optimize user experience while architecting for increasing traffic volumes driven by the explosive growth of mobile advertising. Customer wins included Content Bridge, a supply chain management digital right service provider, and Grapeshot, an innovative provider of analytics and keyword targeting. 
The financial services vertical experienced the second highest bookings of all time, with strength across insurance, electronic payments, trading and retail banking. We also saw a sharp growth in Performance Hub deployment as financial services enterprise continue to re-architect their IT. Customer wins included Deutsch Bank, ABN AMRO, a 3-region expansion by Thomson Reuters for electronic trading and EP2, an Australian provider of digital payment solutions leveraging the Equinix Cloud Exchange.
The cloud and IT services vertical experienced strong bookings across all regions this quarter, including strategic wins with leading Software-as-a-Service providers, furthering our cloud density objectives. Cloud services adoption continues with over 370 enterprises, clouds, IT service providers and networks interconnecting on Cloud Exchange in addition to the healthy growth in direct connect activity to cloud providers. Customer wins included Pure Storage, a cloud scale data platform providing hybrid cloud data management for Microsoft Azure; and Blue Jeans, an enterprise video cloud provider enabling direct access via Cloud Exchange. 
And finally, turning to the enterprise. This vertical delivered strong bookings, driven by manufacturing, travel and government wins as enterprises leverage our global platform both directly and through our growing base of Equinix partners to re-architect their infrastructure. Over 370 customers have deployed our Performance Hub solution, which helps enterprises optimize their network architectures, access the cloud and drive application performance.
Customer wins included Nucor, a Fortune 200 steel manufacturer, leveraging Equinix to solve for hybrid cloud connectivity; and Avant Homes, a residential and commercial property development firm. We are growing our enterprise customer base at an accelerated pace as CIOs adopt an interconnected-oriented architecture as shown on Slide 5. 
IOA is a blueprint to help CIOs re-architect their IT delivery to better interconnect people, locations, clouds and data. Leveraging our global data center footprint and multi-cloud interconnection capabilities, interconnection-oriented architectures represent a fundamental shift away from centralized legacy enterprise IT models to distributed and dynamic models. 
Direct interconnectivity enables enterprises to react in real time, adapt quickly to change and leverage digital ecosystems to create new value and growth. Enterprises are increasingly looking to Equinix as they embark on this journey, moving away from in-house data centers in order to leverage multi-cloud architectures placed closer to users and their customers. We believe this trend will continue to significantly increase our opportunities within this market segment. 
So let me stop there and turn it over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter."
28202,330928820,973082,"Equinix, Inc. (REIT), Equinix, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Equinix, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone. So our first quarter represents a great start to 2016. We continued to deliver top line growth, expand margins and drive sales across our expanded platform. We had strong bookings in each of our regions,",1556,"Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone. So our first quarter represents a great start to 2016. We continued to deliver top line growth, expand margins and drive sales across our expanded platform. 
We had strong bookings in each of our regions, including solid cross-region execution. This quarter, we were able to benefit from record 3 region deployments across all of our segments as customers leverage our geographic reach. Including the recent acquisitions, greater than 53% of our revenues come from customers deployed globally across all 3 regions and over 81% from customers deployed across multiple metros.
Our interconnection additions remained very positive, adding another 5,600 net cross connects and almost 180 exchange ports in the quarter. This is the seventh quarter in a row where we've added greater than 5,000 cross connects in a quarter. Interconnection revenues represent 16% of our global recurring revenues. 
Moving to acquisitions. We've seen early momentum from both the Telecity and Bit-isle businesses, delivering against our guidance expectations while progressing well towards our expected synergy targets. The Internet -- integration efforts are well underway. We've selected the senior leadership team for the EMEA business, who are in the advanced stages of aligning our sales and delivery teams. 
Cross-selling across the combined platform is taking root, and after we divested the 8 assets held for sale, we believe that we'll be able to accelerate our sales efforts as customers decide the optimum location to deploy their infrastructure. In addition, we've reduced our expected 2016 integration spend to $55 million. These costs will support our significant systems work, employee severance and retention costs and a substantial organizational restructuring cost related to our REIT and other tax initiatives. As it relates data assets held for sale, we remain on track to divest these assets by mid-2016.
Now as it relates to our full year guidance, the weakening U.S. dollar has provided us significant FX tailwinds. And this uptick, along with better-than-expected operating performance in the first quarter, allows us to increase our revenue guidance with flow-through benefits to both EBITDA and AFFO. 
Our updated annual revenue guidance continues to include flat nonrecurring revenues compared to the prior year as well as refining our annual view related to the Telecity business as we continue to work through the divestiture process and complete our integration efforts and have further visibility into their data. 
So turning to the first quarter. As depicted on Slide 6, Global Q1 revenues were 842 -- $844.2 million, up 3% over the prior quarter and 16% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis, our 53rd straight quarter of top line growth. As our -- or reported revenues include $119 million from acquisitions, consistent with our expectations. 
Q1 revenues that have our FX hedges include a $3.3 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter and a $1.4 million positive currency benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar. 
For Europe, we've hedged approximately 80% of our Equinix organic business. Global adjusted EBITDA was $380.7 million, up 4% over the prior quarter and 17% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis, above prior guidance due to revenue flow-through, lower SG&A and innovation costs. 
Our as-reported EBITDA includes $52 million of contribution from our acquisitions as well as $13 million in integration costs. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 45.1% or 46.9% on an organic and constant currency basis. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of FX hedges, reflects a negative $3.8 million currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter and a $1.3 million negative impact when compared to our FX guidance rates.
Global AFFO was $210 million, including $64 million loss related to the Telecity hedge. Excluding the Telecity foreign currency loss and cost, AFFO on a normalized basis and constant currency increased 20% over the prior quarter to $287 million, tracking above the top end of our guidance range, largely due to the business performance and lower-than-expected taxes and interest expense. 
As we continue to focus on value creation per share, upon the maturity of the remaining portion of our convertible -- our June '16 [ph] convertible debt instrument, we have elected to receive the proceeds from the related cap call in the form of shares, thereby reducing the net dilution from this debt instrument by approximately 400,000 shares.
Moving to churn. Global MRR churn for Q1 was 2.2% or 2.1% on an organic basis, consistent with our prior guidance. We continue to expect our quarterly MRR churn rate to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% quarterly. 
And one final note before I discuss the regional performance. Our nonfinancial metric sheet and supplemental, including our segment IBX reporting, will not include the acquisitions until early next year as we work to integrate their unit metrics and results into our financial systems.
Now I'd like to provide a few highlights on the regions, whose full results are covered on Slides 7 through 9. Our global platform continues to expand with EMEA and Asia Pacific growing organic and constant currency growth over the same quarter last year of 17% and 25%, respectively while the Americas region produced steady growth of 13%. 
We added over 1,500 cabinets, down from the prior quarter due to timing of installs and churn, and we expect a more normalized net cabinets billing increase next quarter. MRR per cabinet was firm at $1,970, up $11 on a constant currency basis. 
The Americas region had another strong quarter, delivering solid bookings from the network and financial verticals, an increasing yield per cabinet and the second best interconnection quarter of all time. EMEA delivered a solid quarter of bookings [indiscernible] strength in the Dutch and German markets while absorbing higher churn in the U.K. at the end of last quarter. 
Asia Pacific continued steady growth with Tokyo and Hong Kong as the fastest-growing markets driven by cloud and content verticals. Interconnection revenues continued to outpace overall growth of the business with the Americas, APAC and EMEA interconnection revenues now at 23%, 13% and 8%, respectively, of recurring revenues. 
EMEA's interconnection revenues declined as a percent of the region's recurring revenue as the region absorbed the Telecity results. It is our intention to increase interconnection revenues as a percent of this region's recurring revenues over the medium and longer term.
And now looking at the balance sheet. Please refer to Slide 10. Unrestricted cash and investments decreased this quarter to $650 million, largely due to the closing of the Telecity acquisition on January 15. Our net debt leverage ratio stepped up to 4.3x our Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA, although we expect to return to our range of 3 to 4x adjusted EBITDA over the next 12 to 18 months. 
Now switching to AFFO and dividends on Slide 11. For 2016, we're raising our as-reported AFFO to be greater than 1 billion -- sorry, $1.015 billion, a 22% year-over-year increase. On a normalized basis, AFFO would be greater than $1.134 billion or at 28% constant currency increase over prior year. 
Adjusting for the $6 million of interest earned on the convertible debt through the first half of the year, our fully diluted AFFO per share would be $16.13 using a weighted average of 70.7 million shares outstanding as presented on Page 34 of the earnings deck. 
Also today, we announced our Q2 dividend of $1.75 a share, consistent with our Q1 quarterly dividend. Our AFFO payout ratio is now expected to be approximately 49% for 2016. 
Now looking at capital expenditures. Please refer to Slide 12. For the quarter, CapEx was $198 million, including recurring CapEx of $32 million, below our guidance due to timing of cash payments to our contractors. 
With respect to our new builds, during the quarter, we opened Tokyo 5 IBX, our 10th IBX in the Tokyo Metro, taking into consideration Bit-isle's 5 assets in Tokyo. Tokyo 5 is located near the financial district and approximate to our existing network-dense Tokyo 3 IBX. 
[indiscernible] these 2 assets together, thereby allowing our Tokyo 5 customers to access the rich set of networks in Tokyo 3. And given our current high utilization rate of 80%, the strong development returns, we continue to invest across many key markets with new IBX builds scheduled to open in the next year, including Amsterdam, São Paulo, Silicon Valley and Sydney in addition to the expansion phases in Ashburn, Atlanta, Dublin, Frankfurt, Hong Kong and Warsaw.
Also, we will continue to purchase and develop land, including our recently purchased Silicon Valley land parcels. Over time, we expect revenues from our own sites to increase. Owned properties generate 30% -- 38% of the organic recurring revenues or 34% of our revenues on a combined basis as the acquisitions have a higher percent of leased sites. 
Including acquisitions, over 85% of our recurring revenue is generated by either owned properties or properties where our lease expiration extends to 2029 or beyond. And finally, we've provided you a number of slides that bridge our 2016 guidance from the normalized 2015 performance, including slides for revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Please refer to these slides on Slides 13 through 16. I'll turn the call back to Steve."

Thanks, Keith. And finally on Slide 17, which summarizes our Q2 and our full year 2016 guidance, which includes our FX impacts, let me now cover our updated 2016 outlook.
For the full year of 2016, we are raising our revenue guidance to be greater than $3.595 billion, 32% growth on an as-reported basis or an organic and constant currency growth rate of greater than 13.4% compared to the prior year. This $45 million revenue increase includes a $42 million positive foreign currency benefit when compared to the prior guidance rates and a $3 million increase due to stronger Q1 operating performance.
For 2016, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to be greater than $1.65 billion, a 30% increase on an as-reported basis or a greater than 16% year-over-year growth rate on an organic and constant currency basis. This $30 million adjusted EBITDA increase includes an $18 million positive foreign currency benefit when compared to prior guidance rates and $9 million increase due to Q1 operating performance and $3 million in lower-than-expected integration costs.
And the growth of our business is driving increased adjusted funds from operations and ultimately cash flow and dividends. We are raising AFFO to be greater than $1.134 billion, normalized for the Telecity transaction-related FX loss and integration costs, a 28% constant currency growth compared to the prior year. This $56 million AFFO increase includes a $14 million positive foreign currency benefit when compared to the prior guidance rates, a $20 million -- $29 million reduction in interest and tax costs and better-than-expected operating performance and lower integration costs. And finally, we expect 2016 capital expenditures to continue to range between $900 million and $1 billion for the year.
So in closing, Platform Equinix is the critical intersection point between clouds, networks and the enterprise, and this opportunity is translating into solid revenue growth, firm yield and healthy returns on our stabilized and expansion IBXs. Our platform continues to scale organically, and we are progressing well with our strategic acquisitions, positioning us to extend our market leadership, enhance our cloud and network density and grow our customer ecosystems. So let me stop here, and we'll open it up to questions. So over to you, Carrie."

So we have worked very hard, as you know, the people on his phone, now to populate our facilities around the world with access points, network nodes, cash nodes, whatever you want to call them, to make it very easy for enterprises of all shapes and sizes to find these cloud providers and buy those services as a service. And so that is happening as a thesis -- has continues to prove itself and as the numbers continue to show you, enterprises is growing at the highest rate. Now the marketing teams and the sales teams around the world are pursuing different industry verticals and different countries. So we are building use cases and success stories across multiple industry verticals. There's probably a dozen where we have different use cases being built and they vary by region and by country. The demand is pretty standard around the world. It probably parallels the growth rates that we see. We're growing the fastest in Asia, followed by Europe followed by the Americas. So I would say particularly global enterprises are demanding footprint across all the big markets and all the big regions -- across all 3 regions. So it's pretty steady demand, pretty steady demand and it's underpinning most of our new logo accumulation. But Charles, I don't know if you add anything."

But there are some variations country to country in terms of cloud adoption. I would say that, for example, Australia tends to be an outlier on the high side being receptive to cloud and hybrid cloud as an architecture of choice. And -- but we're seeing good solid demand across all 3 regions."

But the cloud spending continues to fuel the data center requirements, which is what we're benefiting from. And the robust leasing activity that we're seeing is really driven by the cloud, which is attracting the enterprises that are -- almost all enterprises we talk to today are moving some portion of their applications workload to get access to the hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, et cetera. And so I think most of the industry analyst data points suggest that's high teens today is enterprises that are taking advantage of cloud offerings. And that will move over the coming 4 years to 50%, 60% of the workloads. Certainly in the conversations that we're having, that's very -- and that's a very common conversation. I would tell you that we hear security requirements, we heard cloud requirements, we hear big data requirements and we are hearing the early signs of IoT plans with enterprises, trying to figure out how to instrument, monitor and measure all these data that creating to try to monetize it.

And I guess I'd just offer and add that we're seeing is that hybrid cloud adoption is accelerating. And in fact, I think we look at interconnection-oriented architectures as essentially a mechanism by which these enterprise CIOs are allowing them to do more with less and that's a key priority for them. And if you look at adoption rates, IDC says that 65% of enterprises are going to be committed to hybrid and multi-cloud by the end of this year. And so we're seeing a very rapid clip of adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud and a real resonance to interconnection-oriented architecture. And while they may be -- their overall spend levels may be reducing because they're not spending as much on traditional IT spend categories, I think that the hybrid cloud enablement in that area is actually increasing in total spend, at least from what we're seeing with the enterprise customers that we're serving."

So what does that mean in terms of the availability of growth to the business over the next few quarters? And what does that mean for future capital? Should we expect capital to accelerate, to give you more capacity, which will naturally push that utilization down? Or are you maturing as a business and you're just going to run at higher utilization levels than some of your history?"

First, as it relates to nonrecurring, we did see a little bit of an uptick this quarter. One of the things that we started the year with, Mike, as you know, is we took a very strong view, the amount of nonrecurring business we did in fiscal year '15 and the number of meaningful deployments we did across our platform. We made a conscious decision because they do come in ebbs and flows to hold that flat for fiscal year '16. Now you saw a little bit of a step-up in the Q1 results. That's just a reflection of the lumpiness, if you will, of the nonrecurring activity. As I then sort of taken to Q2, we are assuming that the nonrecurring activity will go down quarter-over-quarter, partly because of what we see in our pipeline and partly it's what's -- not what's just in the pipeline, what's in our backlog. So we expect that we'll reduce our nonrecurring revenues by roughly $5.5 million next quarter or roughly 60 basis points of growth. So that -- that gives you a sense. Again, we still look to do a lot of it, again, hold it at the same level as '15 but we will see it move around quarter-over-quarter. As it relates to utilization levels, yes, no surprise. We are running at higher levels. We've had a tremendous amount of success over a number of quarters. And when you see that success and also the incremental cabinets billing, that's a clear indication that we're filling up our assets, and it suggests that we're going to have to continue to put capital to work. There are certainly some markets that are more constrained than others. Charles was great in alluding to the Tokyo market, whereby through the acquisition of Bit-isle, we got a very large asset, which will allow us to delay any meaningful future spend in Japan for some time period. Yes, there's other markets where we talked about in the last earnings call where we're now going to do what we call first-phase builds, which come with a much larger capital deployment in that initial phase. Silicon Valley is a perfect example, the one that Steve alluded to. And there's São Paulo as well and Sydney 4 and the like. So we are continuing to make sure we manage ourselves. I want to leave you with a couple of thoughts on how we manage our CapEx. We go through a very detailed exercise. We're looking 5 years out. We're looking across markets and IBXs to make sure we understand what our fill rates are, what is the empirical data telling us and what does that imply against our future expectations, understanding what competitive landscapes like in each of those markets or specific to that IBX. And so when we do that, we look out 5 years. We have a pretty good view on what we think we could spend. So then in conclusion, to go back -- to address your final question, we're very much aware of what our capital spend is. As you know, that can ebb and flow based on our performance, knowing that your lead times are going to be anywhere from 9 months to 18 months depending on whether it's an incremental phase or a new build. That's going to dictate what the capital dollars are, but there is an expectation that we will continue to spend at these levels for a period of time, given that demand that we see in the marketplace. I will say one last thing, which I think is important. One of the things that we want to do is continue to see our utilization go up, but we recognize that you're at a point where you don't want to constrain the business. There's certainly some markets where we feel a little bit more constrained today than we'd otherwise like to feel. And so we need to put the capital to work in those markets. Silicon Valley comes to mind again as a critical market where we're very eager to get out the -- to put up that Silicon Valley 10 asset because left unchecked, it will put a constraint on our ability to grow. But we feel we're in a great position to deliver the inventory on a fairly just-in-time basis."

One is your question, Mike, around sort of growth and what utilization implies. If you look at our stabilized assets chart, delivered 7%, I think, was this quarter was. And what you'll see there is actually we've seen that -- we see that bounce around a little bit pretty good quarter and a constant currency basis have seen even better quarters. And so you see that the stabilized assets still have meaningful growth potential in them even at quite high utilization rates. And then the second point I'd make is that we are making a very purposeful push to phase our capital as best as possible. And so we're trying to be as innovative as possible in phasing our capital, and that is going to have a natural tendency to sort of pressure utilization up a bit, which is a good thing as long as we still have the flexibility to respond and not go dark in the market. And so that's the balance we're striking and I do think kudos to our engineering and construction teams for really phasing our capital in ways that are allowing us to still be responsive with higher levels of utilization."

And then second, I guess, I don't know who this will be for if Charles online maybe for you. But if there's one kind of fear that people may have, that as the public cloud gets more reliable, more secure, that it has the potential to accommodate a growing share of all the outsourced applications that are existing, and that slowly the public-private hybrid cloud becomes a little less private, a little bit more public and it creates a cannibalization risk. Could you kind of talk about how you view that issue, and if there's any evidence that it's happening in any way inside the Equinix facilities today?"

Let me start in the public cloud question and then Charles can jump in here on that and maybe give you an update on Telecity. Very good question. I know the big concern would be is everything going to move to public? And is there going to be a need for the type of structure hosting and managed services and colo providers are providing. The world that we see unfolding and certainly, all the industry analysts and all the customers we talked to, certainly supports the thesis that the hybrid cloud, customers needing access to public Internet capability, which has always been there at Equinix for years and years and years is not going to go away. We've been working very hard the last 4, 5 years working with all the cloud providers to provide this private connectivity to give the combination of the 2, which in our language, gives you the hybrid capability to be able to move your traffic around the world is continuing to build and unfold. And most of the documentation writings  today suggest the public cloud's going to continue to grow from high teens to, like I said, earlier, 40%, 50%, 60% of workloads going to the public cloud. And the thing that I think people get confused about, even the big public cloud providers who build their big data centers and build their back-office facilities all over the world, still require the Equinixes of the world and the other data center providers of the world for the distributed part of their network because they're not terribly interested in putting capital in 40 different markets and 20 different countries, and so they're going to take advantage of the capacity that's out there with the Equinixes of the world to build the hub and spoke, if you will, or build the centralized and decentralized network to run these cloud offerings. Because users are all over the world, customers are all over the world, latency is a big factor, and that's why you see the continued rollout of public-private connectivity and capability. I don't to that Charles."

So we absolutely see that, we embrace it. And in fact, our platform is really facilitating it. And so I think if I were a commodity provider at colocation, we'd be very worried about that substitution. But that's not really the business we're in. We're in a business of enabling that hybrid cloud connectivity. One through -- via the CSPs and so the supply side of the cloud ecosystem is very relevant for us. And in fact, our top 6 customers are all delivering cloud services using Platform Equinix as some portion of their architecture to do so. And so it's a big opportunity for us. And then we see a big basket -- a very big basket of enterprise workloads that we believe will sort of reside in the private infrastructure side of things and really be implemented in the sort of hybrid cloud, multi-cloud setup. And so for us, we think it's very much a net positive, but I do believe that this trend you're talking about for cloud service providers increasingly capable is real and will affect, I think, the broader data center market. And then let me circle back to Telecity now and I'll give you sort of a quick update and everybody can add color as they wish. We're less than 90 days into the post-combination world. And I'll tell you the headline, we remain very optimistic and thoroughly convinced of the rationale for that transaction. Really cements our leadership in EMEA, 34 new locations and 7 new metros, 6 new countries, material improvement in our network density, which was already market-leading in EMEA. And we add a number of really critical cloud nodes to our platform. Of note would be the new Telecity locations in Dublin, which are a great addition for us and seeing significant demand. And overall, we're really delighted with the quality assets and people that we've added to the teen. As we said in our prepared remarks, a lot of progress on the integration. We've announced a senior leadership team well advanced and aligning the crosstraining sales and delivery teams, well advanced in our rebranding plan of taking on the steps we need to be fully REIT compliant. And as I said, we are already seeing cross-platform opportunities both in the form of Telecity customers with an interest in Equinix facilities but, a bit more so right now of our Equinix customers really seeing opportunities to purchase capacity in the Telecity sites. And I think we're seeing more in that directionally because we have a larger force selling that on the Equinix side, and we're working through the sort of natural distractions of a team going through an integration on the Telecity side. So -- but we feel good about the synergies. We actually think we're going to exceed synergy estimates that we have previously provided. All that's baked into the guidance you see here today. And again, we do think there is, over time, meaningful, meaningful revenue synergies as well as the cost synergies, which I said I think will exceed and the CapEx synergies that are allowing us to defer some investment in EMEA."

What we talked about in the last earnings call was Bit-isle, part of the reason that we felt comfortable holding the revenues flat relative to first [ph] '16 over '15 was the fact that they did have this increased level of churn. Now having said all of that, coming out of our prior guidance the Bit-isle team did a little bit better than we originally anticipated. It's more so in their other services and less in their co-location business. But suffice it to say, between what they're doing in the co-location business and what they're performing in the managed services business, there's a direct correlation between what they do in managed services and the pull-through to colo. So we're very excited about their performance to date, and we continue to focus on very much optimizing that acquisition.

Generally, I would say that the company's had a fairly consistent strategy in the marketplace, so probably not a dramatic set of changes in the product portfolios there, but we are in the process of taking those and aligning the product portfolios. I will say that as Keith commented on, we have -- interconnection is a very central part of how we go to market and how we position with customers. And so it's really -- it's a -- it's critical that we have a great track record of getting the value, delivering great value to our customers through cross connects and through interconnection. And we also have a great track record of making sure that we get value back in the form of how that's priced. And so needless to say, we'll maintain that strategy and we'll implement it within the Telecity environment as over time, because I think our customers are really getting superior value from that. So -- we're in the process of figuring out what that implies in terms of aligning the product portfolios. We're well advanced in that effort and I think we will start's to see the results of that over the coming quarters."

As it relates to Telecity, Charles alluded to a number of the points. We're certainly going to look to what are the opportunities on the top line on driving incremental revenue attached to alignment of our product portfolio and the like. And we are very confident, albeit we've said there's only modest revenue attachment to that this year, but we're very confident that, that will continue to be something that will drive value going forward. As it relates to the cost side, that's the $30 million we referred to. We talked about $15 million this year, $15 million in 2017. Again, we're optimistic that we're not only going to be able to get that number but we'll get beyond that number. Again, I'm reticent to give you the exact numbers just yet because given the lack of visibility that we had into the numbers prior to January 15, we're still doing a lot of work, as we said, to align the sales and delivery organization as well as all of the back office. But again, I want you to walk away being confident that we see some incremental benefit. As it relates to the bottom line activity more specifically around Texas and again, we think of our tax structure as a competitive advantage. And no surprise to you as we then deploy that structure across our portfolio, that will generate benefits to our shareholders, and so we're excited about that as well. Now the other thing I will say is recognizing that Telecity, we're in the business of investing in this business. And so what we want to make sure is that we continue to invest alongside it, so we're managing the synergies with continuing to drive value into the assets and expand that portfolio, consistent with what Equinix's expectations would be. As it relates to Bit-isle, that one, there's less synergies perhaps but overall, a greater opportunity to fill up their -- sorry, less cost synergies, pardon me, but a greater opportunity to enjoy revenue synergies because of the underutilization of their assets. And that's where we're really excited about the opportunity, coupled with some other ways that we think we can optimize the overall business. Again, we want to be a little bit reserved in our comments right now as we continue to think about our strategy. But overall, in the next few quarters, you'll hear us talk more firmly about what's happening in the Bit-isle integration."

We have a strong client service management team that's applied to each of the customers to understand what their combined footprint looks like. They continue to get the service levels that they are contracted for and expect from both of those. Obviously, it doesn't come necessarily without any hiccups, but we have client service managers of that are applied to those accounts to deal with issues as they arise. And that's -- so that's how we're doing in terms of customers that are keeping or maintaining a footprint between both facilities. In some cases, more challenging one might be where we are actually separating out the assets [indiscernible]. And that is a more complicated process in that sort of perhaps against their will, to some degree, a customer may be sort of splitting their implementation now between Equinix and between the eventual buyer of the assets. That is a delicate customer communication. It's one that we would prefer have not have had to do but it was unfortunately, the European Commission didn't cooperate in that regard. And so it's simply a matter of us being clear and consistent with the communications to the customer and then stepping and then standing up what we refer to as standing up divestiture organization or vested organization to be fully capable or responding to that. I would say is we spent an enormous amount of money to make sure that, that divestiture goes out in a way that makes it readily operable on day 1 to serve those customer needs."

I think the challenge that when we talked about -- we have a commentary on Telecity more trending towards of the lower end of the range, that's really more associated with the fact that we're taking 2 organizations, we're putting them together, when we give our initial guidance. We didn't have the data and the visibility we have. Now we're just refining our numbers because we have much more clarity on what we think we can do is a business but at the same time aligning our salesforce and delivery teams to meet the expectation. I think the other thing again, Steve and Charles I think both alluded to the fact that because we have the benefit of being able to import many of these global deals into markets, and London being one of our stronger market, we see that as an opportunity and the number of 3-region deals that are in our pipeline today, I would perhaps not kind of probably larger than we've seen in a long time. And so that gives us confidence with London and Amsterdam being some key nodes on those typical global deployments. That's continues to be an opportunity for us. So overall, I wouldn't say anything meaningful yet. We're certainly going to pay attention to it and we are monitoring it. We do get a number of questions from our investors on that subject matter, but it's a bit early to say with any confidence that there's any real impact from this potential matter."

There is a variety of different -- obviously Western Europe is clearly a fully regulated telecom market. And so it is -- it does -- network density something that does really benefit customers in a similar way, but they started from a place where interconnection was really sort of, as Keith earlier referenced, sort of packed in and not really clearly delineated part of the value proposition. And so it's been a bit of a journey for us in terms of being more clear with customers about the distinctive and extraordinary value they're getting from cross connects. And so whether or not you could achieve the same level that we do now, north of 20% in the U.S., it's hard to tell. But I do think that we certainly continue to see upside opportunity in both regions to meaningfully improve those, both through quantity and price levers that are available to us. And so I think they'll filter north for sure whether or not they can get to those same levels, I don't know, but I think they can go meaningfully higher than where they are today."

So frankly, what we've told you on a constant currency basis that organic business can grow greater than 13.4%. Now as you recognize Q1 when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, it's 16%. And so we're stepping -- we're effectively stepping that down in the second quarter to a midpoint of guidance of roughly 2.6% growth quarter-over-quarter if you're looking at top end of the range, 2.9% quarter-over-quarter growth. 60 basis points of that is coming from the fact that right now, we're assuming that nonrecurring revenue will be $5.5 million less in Q2 than it was in Q1. So number one, there's an element of what's going on in the nonrecurring space. Number two, when we look at that sort of the second half of the year, one of the things we are really given the level of activity and other matters affecting the combination of the business is and Bit-isle Telecity [indiscernible] we're very much -- we're being very disciplined in what we want the future guidance to be. Right now, we're leaving as greater than 13.4%. And that's really a reflection of there's a lot of activity that's taking place in the company right now. And because of that, we want to make sure we continue to have a relatively conservative view on what it means for the back half of the year. Notwithstanding the fact that we are working very hard, as I said, to integrate the businesses. And between the integration of the businesses and running the organic business, we're optimistic that we can continue to scale the business or to grow the business on a year-over-year basis greater than that 13.4%.

Number -- first and foremost, it's the size of the deals that we've looked at. The average size of deal that we did this quarter is a lot greater than the averages that we saw in the prior quarters. So that's number one. We didn't do a lot of what I call larger footprint of deals in the quarter. Number two, as you know, we've rolled out a new basic quote-to-cash platform and that quote-to-cash platform is putting more -- is putting a little bit of [indiscernible] new in the system, it's different for our customers, it's different for our employees. And so as we continue to refine, if you will, our platform, we think that, that's going to continue to increase the number of cabinet adds. Number three, I'll tell you that our pipeline or our backlog is, more particularly the backlog, is higher than it has been before. And as a result, there's that, that going to give us confidence of that is going to come into the revenue stream and to the billing cabinets. And then the fourth thing I will say is this is an area that we've seen before. It generally relates to things that happened near the end of quarter. Churn is a perfect example. Last quarter, as you'll recall, we referred to a U.K.-based churn relative to churn that affect not only our churn MRR metric but also affects the number of cabinets because the customers affect for the entire quarter and then it churns out and so you lose those cabinets. No different this quarter. We had a number of churn activities that happened at the back end of the quarter and they were cabinet as a result, reduced the overall level cabinets billing. Bottom line is we're optimistic that you're going to see that number rebound. We've seen it before this pattern and something that we anticipate changes as we look to the latter part of the year. The one thing you can get great confidence is irrespective of what that number is because it's calculated metric, we are continue to drive revenues up, and you can see by the guidance that we provided that we will expect to deliver $22 million of incremental revenue Q2 over Q1, which is a strong indication that we've got a number of billing cabinets in the system."

Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We had a great start to 2016, delivering both revenue and adjusted EBITDA above the top end of our guidance ranges as demand for interconnected colocation continues to drive strong performance across all 3 of our regions. 
As depicted on Slide 3, revenues were $844.2 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 16% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $380.7 million for the quarter, up 4% over the prior quarter and up 17% year-over-year on an organic and constant currency basis. This drove AFFO growth of 35% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. 
For the quarter, we delivered strong gross and net bookings, with solid production from both our direct and indirect channels as we scale our go-to-market efforts. Our key operating metrics demonstrate the strength of our ecosystem-centric business model with firm MRR per cabinet, low churn and a healthy interconnection growth. 
Our global platform continues to be a critical source of differentiation, making us the partner of choice for customers looking to respond effectively through increasingly distributed infrastructure requirements. Our reach is allowing us to gain market share while tapping into higher-growth markets, with EMEA and Asia Pacific now contributing greater than 50% of our revenues and our geographic reach stretching across 21 countries and 40 metros. 
We are pleased with the Telecity acquisition and are excited to add this great set of quality assets and people to the platform -- to Platform Equinix. With less than 90 days under our belt, we are already seeing healthy momentum in cross-platform bookings and are making rapid progress on integration despite the significance size and complexity of this transaction. 
Overall, the Telecity assets delivered solid financial performance consistent with our guidance for revenue and adjusted EBITDA while absorbing efforts related to the deal close and the planned divestitures. We see the anticipated revenue synergies materializing and are tracking well to our expected cost and CapEx synergies, all of which is a great validation of the deal rationale.
Bit-isle is also progressing well, tracking above our prior guidance with several strategic wins enabled by these new assets. Our integration efforts are on track, and our plans to optimize the business remain ahead of schedule. As we integrate these 2 acquisitions, we expect to achieve a combined $30 million in annual cost savings, with about 50% of these savings realized before the end of this year and the remainder in 2017. 
With Telecity and Bit-isle, we now serve over 8,000 customers and are proud that over 150 of the Fortune 500 are Equinix customers. We have increased our already market-leading network density from 1,100 to over 1,400 networks and have added a number of critical new cloud notes to Platform Equinix. 
We are extending our value proposition as the home of the interconnected cloud with industry-leading providers such as AWS, Microsoft and Google, contributing directly to the increase in our enterprise business by enabling enterprise CIOs to quickly and cost-effectively implement multicloud architectures. 
Our cloud and enterprise verticals, which represent 28% and 13% of our revenues, respectively, remain our fastest-growing market segments and contributed the highest number of new customer additions for the sixth quarter in a row. 
Interconnection revenue grew a healthy 19% year-over-year on an organic and constant currency basis. With over 176,000 cross connects and significant growth on our Internet and our Cloud Exchange, Equinix is benefiting from strong secular trends that are driving businesses to become increasingly interconnected. We run the largest Internet exchange globally with 5.5 terabits of peak traffic growing 30% year-over-year as networks and cloud providers continue to upgrade their capacity. 
Given our high utilization rate of 80% and strong returns on development capital, we continue to expand in core markets heavily weighted towards existing campuses in Tier 1 market -- metros, which exhibit strong pipelines and attractive supply-demand profiles. We now have 16 announced expansion projects underway, and this quarter, we are moving forward with additional expansions in Silicon Valley, New York and Hong Kong, totaling over $200 million of CapEx. 
In Silicon Valley, demand remains robust, and we are building SV10, a new IBX located directly adjacent to our Great Oaks campus, home to a rich ecosystem of networking cloud hubs and the second-largest peering market in the U.S. after our Ashburn campus in Northern Virginia. Notably, for SV10, we purchased the 11 acres of land for this project, expanding our asset ownership in this important market. 
In New York, we are proceeding with the second phase of New York 5, the flagship asset on our Secaucus campus, which is comprised of 4 adjacent data centers with over 10,000 cabinets and is a key growth engine for our Americas business. New York 5 saw a strong pull-through post the deployment of badge trading engine and is also seeing solid demand from the broader financial services community as they embrace hybrid cloud. Our first phase of New York 5 project is already 85% full with strong pricing.
Our capital investments continue to deliver very healthy growth as well as strong returns across, our new expansion and stabilized IBXs as shown on Slide 4. The operating performance of our 70 stabilized global IBXs delivered steady revenue growth of 7%, an increase over the prior quarter, while generating a 31% cash on cash return on the gross PP&E invested, reflecting the tremendous economic value of these stabilized campuses. 
Stabilized assets include projects that have been open for more than 1 year with all phases built out. As we shift to 2016, a net 3 IBXs were added to this category and utilization of these assets remains a healthy 86%.  
Let me now cover quarterly highlights from our industry verticals, and I'll start with the networks. This vertical experienced strong bookings, driven by multisite expansions with Tier 1 service providers and new wins with Tier 2 providers and cable operators who are shifting their portfolios to address demand for IP and digital services. 
We are seeing a resurgence of subsea cable projects to support global cloud deployments and growth of international data traffic, which are creating new opportunities for Equinix. There are more than 50 global submarine cable projects under consideration over the coming 2 years, which places Equinix in a great position to win a portion of this next generation of submarine cable investment.
In the content digital media vertical, performance was driven by expansions from both traditional lighthouse content providers and our Ad-IX ecosystem. Advertisers continue to optimize user experience while architecting for increasing traffic volumes driven by the explosive growth of mobile advertising. Customer wins included Content Bridge, a supply chain management digital right service provider, and Grapeshot, an innovative provider of analytics and keyword targeting. 
The financial services vertical experienced the second highest bookings of all time, with strength across insurance, electronic payments, trading and retail banking. We also saw a sharp growth in Performance Hub deployments as financial services enterprise continue to re-architect their IT. Customer wins included Deutsch Bank, ABN AMRO, a 3-region expansion by Thomson Reuters for electronic trading and EP2, an Australian provider of digital payment solutions leveraging the Equinix Cloud Exchange.
The cloud and IT services vertical experienced strong bookings across all regions this quarter, including strategic wins with leading Software-as-a-Service providers furthering our cloud density objectives. Cloud services adoption continues with over 370 enterprises, clouds, IT service providers and networks interconnecting on Cloud Exchange in addition to the healthy growth in direct connect activity to cloud providers. Customer wins included Pure Storage, a cloud scale data platform providing hybrid cloud data management for Microsoft Azure; and Blue Jeans, an enterprise video cloud provider enabling direct access via Cloud Exchange. 
And finally, turning to the enterprise, this vertical delivered strong bookings, driven by manufacturing, travel and government wins as enterprises leverage our global platform, both directly and through our growing base of Equinix partners to re-architect their infrastructure. Over 370 customers have deployed our Performance Hub solution, which helps enterprises optimize their network architectures, access the cloud and drive application performance.
Customer wins, included Nucor, a Fortune 200 steel manufacturer, leveraging Equinix to solve for hybrid cloud connectivity, and AVANT Homes, a residential and commercial property development firm. 
We are growing our enterprise customer base at an accelerated pace as CIOs adopt an interconnected-oriented architecture as shown on Slide 5. 
IOA is a blueprint to help CIOs re-architect their IT delivery to better interconnect people, locations, clouds and data. Leveraging our global data center footprint and multi-cloud interconnection capabilities, interconnection-oriented architectures represent a fundamental shift away from centralized legacy enterprise IT models to distributed and dynamic models. 
Direct interconnectivity enables enterprises to react in real time, adapt quickly to change and leverage digital ecosystems to create new value and growth. Enterprises are increasingly looking to Equinix as they embark on this journey, moving away from in-house data centers in order to leverage multi-cloud architectures placed closer to users and their customers. We believe this trend will continue to significantly increase our opportunities within this market segment. 
So let me stop there and turn it over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter."
28202,330928820,973375,"Equinix, Inc. (REIT), Equinix, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Equinix, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone. So our first quarter represents a great start to 2016. We continued to deliver top line growth, expand margins and drive sales across our expanded platform. We had strong bookings in each of our regions,",1559,"Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone. So our first quarter represents a great start to 2016. We continued to deliver top line growth, expand margins and drive sales across our expanded platform. 
We had strong bookings in each of our regions, including solid cross-region execution. This quarter, we were able to benefit from record 3 region deployments across all of our segments as customers leverage our geographic reach. Including recent acquisitions, greater than 53% of our revenues come from customers deployed globally across all 3 regions and over 81% from customers deployed across multiple metros.
Our interconnection additions remained very positive, adding another 5,600 net cross connects and almost 180 exchange ports in the quarter. This is the seventh quarter in a row where we've added greater than 5,000 cross connects in a quarter. Interconnection revenues represent 16% of our global recurring revenues. 
Moving to acquisitions. We've seen early momentum from both the Telecity and Bit-isle businesses, delivering against our guidance expectations while progressing well towards our expected synergy targets. The Internet -- the integration efforts are well underway. We've selected the senior leadership team for the EMEA business, who are in the advanced stages of aligning our sales and delivery teams. 
Cross-selling across the combined platform is taking root. And after we divest of the 8 assets held for sale, we believe that we'll be able to accelerate our sales efforts as customers decide the optimum location to deploy their infrastructure. In addition, we've reduced our expected 2016 integration spend to $55 million. These costs will support our significant systems work, employee severance and retention costs and a substantial organizational restructuring cost related to our REIT and other tax initiatives. As it relates to data assets held for sale, we remain on track to divest these assets by mid-2016.
Now as it relates to our full year guidance, the weakening U.S. dollar has provided us significant FX tailwinds. And this uptick, along with better-than-expected operating performance in the first quarter, allows us to increase our revenue guidance with flow-through benefits to both EBITDA and AFFO. 
Our updated annual revenue guidance continues to include flat nonrecurring revenues compared to the prior year as well as refining our annual view related to the Telecity business as we continue to work through the divestiture process and complete our integration efforts and have further visibility into their data. 
So turning to the first quarter. As depicted on Slide 6, Global Q1 revenues were 842 -- $844.2 million, up 3% over the prior quarter and 16% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis, our 53rd straight quarter of top line growth. As our -- our as-reported revenues include $119 million from acquisitions, consistent with our expectations. 
Q1 revenues that have our FX hedges include a $3.3 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter and a $1.4 million positive currency benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar. 
For Europe, we've hedged approximately 80% of our Equinix organic business. Global adjusted EBITDA was $380.7 million, up 4% over the prior quarter and 17% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis, above prior guidance due to revenue flow-through, lower SG&A and innovation costs. 
Our as-reported EBITDA includes $52 million of contribution from our acquisitions as well as $13 million in integration costs. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 45.1% or 46.9% on an organic and constant currency basis. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance net of FX hedges reflects a negative $3.8 million currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter and a $1.3 million negative impact when compared to our FX guidance rates.
Global AFFO was $210 million, including $64 million loss related to the Telecity hedge. Excluding the Telecity foreign currency loss and integration cost, AFFO on a normalized basis and constant currency increased 20% over the prior quarter to $287 million, tracking above the top end of our guidance range largely due to the business performance and lower-than-expected taxes and interest expense. 
As we continue to focus on value creation per share, upon the maturity of the remaining portion of our convertible -- our June '16 convertible debt instrument, we have elected to receive the proceeds from the related cap call in the form of shares, thereby reducing the net dilution from this debt instrument by approximately 400,000 shares.
Moving to churn. Global MRR churn for Q1 was 2.2% or 2.1% on an organic basis, consistent with our prior guidance. We continue to expect our quarterly MRR churn rate to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% quarterly. 
And one final note before I discuss the regional performance. Our nonfinancial metric sheet and supplemental, including our segment IBX reporting, will not include the acquisitions until early next year as we work to integrate their unit metrics and results into our financial systems.
And now I'd like to provide a few highlights on the regions, whose full results are covered on Slides 7 through 9. Our global platform continues to expand with EMEA and Asia Pacific growing organic and constant currency growth over the same quarter last year of 17% and 25%, respectively, while the Americas region produced steady growth of 13%. 
We added over 1,500 cabinets, down from the prior quarter due to timing of installs and churn, and we expect a more normalized net cabinets billing increase next quarter. MRR per cabinet was firm at $1,970, up $11 on a constant currency basis. 
The Americas region had another strong quarter, delivering solid bookings from the network and financial verticals, an increasing yield per cabinet and the second-best interconnection quarter of all time. EMEA delivered a solid quarter of bookings with [indiscernible] strength in the Dutch and German markets while absorbing higher churn in the U.K. at the end of last quarter. 
Asia Pacific continued a steady growth with Tokyo and Hong Kong as the fastest-growing markets driven by cloud and content verticals. Interconnection revenues continued to outpace overall growth of the business with the Americas, APAC and EMEA interconnection revenues now at 23%, 13% and 8%, respectively, of recurring revenues. 
EMEA's interconnection revenues declined as a percent of the region's recurring revenue as the region absorbed the Telecity results. It is our intention to increase interconnection revenues as a percent of this region's recurring revenues over the medium and longer term.
And now looking at the balance sheet, please refer to Slide 10. Unrestricted cash and investments decreased this quarter to $650 million, largely due to the closing of the Telecity acquisition on January 15. Our net debt leverage ratio stepped up to 4.3x our Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA, although we expect to return to our range of 3 to 4x adjusted EBITDA over the next 12 to 18 months. 
Now switching to AFFO and dividends on Slide 11. For 2016, we're raising our as-reported AFFO to be greater than $1 billion -- sorry, $1.015 billion, a 22% year-over-year increase. On a normalized basis, AFFO would be greater than $1.134 billion or at 28% constant currency increase over prior year. 
Adjusting for the $6 million of interest earned on the convertible debt through the first half of the year, our fully diluted AFFO per share would be $16.13 using a weighted average 70.7 million shares outstanding, as presented on Page 34 of the earnings deck. 
Also today, we announced our Q2 dividend of $1.75 a share, consistent with our Q1 quarterly dividend. Our AFFO payout ratio is now expected to be approximately 49% for 2016. 
Now looking at capital expenditures. Please refer to Slide 12. For the quarter, CapEx was $198 million, including recurring CapEx of $32 million, below our guidance due to timing of cash payments to our contractors. 
With respect to our newbuilds, during the quarter, we opened Tokyo 5 IBX, our 10th IBX in the Tokyo Metro, taking into consideration Bit-isle's 5 assets in Tokyo. Tokyo 5 is located near the financial district and approximate to our existing network-dense Tokyo 3 IBX. 
We've tailored these 2 assets together, thereby allowing our Tokyo 5 customers to access the rich set of networks in Tokyo 3. And given our current high utilization rate of 80%, the strong development returns, we continue to invest across many key markets with new IBX builds scheduled to open in the next year, including Amsterdam, São Paulo, Silicon Valley and Sydney in addition to the expansion phases in Ashburn, Atlanta, Dublin, Frankfurt, Hong Kong and Warsaw.
Also, we will continue to purchase and develop land, including our recently purchased Silicon Valley land parcels. Over time, we expect revenues from our own sites to increase. Owned properties generate 30% -- 38% of the organic recurring revenues or 34% of our revenues on a combined basis as the acquisitions have a higher percent of leased sites. 
Including acquisitions, over 85% of our recurring revenue is generated by either owned properties or properties where our lease expiration extends to 2029 or beyond. And finally, we've provided you a number of slides that bridge our 2016 guidance from the normalized 2015 performance, including slides for revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Please refer to these slides on Slides 13 through 16. I'll turn the call back to Steve."

Thanks, Keith. And finally, on Slide 17, which summarizes our Q2 and our full year 2016 guidance, which includes our FX impacts, let me now cover our updated 2016 outlook.
For the full year of 2016, we are raising our revenue guidance to be greater than $3.595 billion, 32% growth on an as-reported basis or an organic and constant currency growth rate of greater than 13.4% compared to the prior year. This $45 million revenue increase includes a $42 million positive foreign currency benefit when compared to the prior guidance rates and a $3 million increase due to stronger Q1 operating performance.
For 2016, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to be greater than $1.65 billion, a 30% increase on an as-reported basis or a greater than 16% year-over-year growth rate on an organic and constant currency basis. This $30 million adjusted EBITDA increase includes an $18 million positive foreign currency benefit when compared to prior guidance rates and $9 million increase due to Q1 operating performance and $3 million in lower-than-expected integration costs.
And the growth of our business is driving increased adjusted funds from operations and ultimately, cash flow and dividends. We are raising AFFO to be greater than $1.134 billion, normalized for the Telecity transaction-related FX loss and integration costs, a 28% constant currency growth compared to the prior year. This $56 million AFFO increase includes a $14 million positive foreign currency benefit when compared to the prior guidance rates, a $20 million -- $29 million reduction in interest and tax costs and better-than-expected operating performance and lower integration costs. And finally, we expect 2016 capital expenditures to continue to range between $900 million and $1 billion for the year.
So in closing, Platform Equinix is the critical intersection point between clouds, networks and the enterprise, and this opportunity is translating into solid revenue growth, firm yield and healthy returns on our stabilized and expansion IBXs. Our platform continues to scale organically, and we are progressing well with our strategic acquisitions, positioning us to extend our market leadership, enhance our cloud and network density and grow our customer ecosystems. So let me stop here, and we'll open it up to questions. So over to you, Carrie."

So we have worked very hard, as you know, the people on his phone now, to populate our facilities around the world with access points, network nodes, cash nodes, whatever you want to call them, to make it very easy for enterprises of all shapes and sizes to find these cloud providers and buy those services as a service. And so that is happening as a thesis, has -- continues to prove itself and as the numbers continue to show you, enterprises is growing at the highest rate. Now the marketing teams and the sales teams around the world are pursuing different industry verticals and different countries. So we are building use cases and success stories across multiple industry verticals. There's probably a dozen where we have different use cases being built and they vary by region and by country. The demand is pretty standard around the world. It probably parallels the growth rates that we see. We're growing the fastest in Asia, followed by Europe followed by the Americas. So I would say enterprise, particularly global enterprises are demanding footprint across all the big markets and all the big -- across all 3 regions. So it's pretty steady demand, pretty steady demand, and it's underpinning most of our new logo accumulation. But Charles, I don't know. Would you add anything?"

But there are some variations country to country in terms of cloud adoption. I would say that, for example, Australia tends to be an outlier on the high side, being receptive to cloud and hybrid cloud as an architecture of choice. And -- but we're seeing good, solid demand across all 3 regions."

But the cloud spending continues to fuel the data center requirements, which is what we're benefiting from. And the robust leasing activity that we're seeing is really driven by the cloud, which is attracting the enterprises that are -- almost all enterprises we talk to today are moving some portion of their applications workload to get access to the hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, et cetera. And so I think most of the industry analyst data points suggest that high-teens today is enterprises that are taking advantage of cloud offerings, and that will move over the coming 4 years to 50%, 60% of the workloads. Certainly in the conversations that we're having, that's very -- that's a very common conversation. I would tell you that we hear security requirements. We heard cloud requirements. We hear big data requirements and we are hearing the early signs of IoT plans with enterprises, trying to figure out how to instrument and monitor and measure all these data that they're creating to try to monetize this. So there's certainly plenty of trends from the enterprise across these big segments that we're all reading about in these reports."

And in fact, I think we look at interconnection-oriented architectures as essentially a mechanism by which these enterprise CIOs are allowing them to do more with less, and that's a key priority for them. And if you look at adoption rates, IDC says that 65% of enterprises are going to be committed to hybrid and multi-cloud by the end of this year. And so we're seeing a very rapid clip of adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud and a real resonance to interconnection-oriented architecture. And while they may be -- their overall spend levels may be reducing because they're not spending as much on traditional IT spend categories, I think that the hybrid cloud enablement in that area is actually increasing in total spend, at least from what we're seeing with the enterprise customers that we're serving."

First, as it relates to nonrecurring, we did see a little bit of an uptick this quarter. One of the things that we started the year with, Mike, as you know, is we took a very strong view because of the amount of nonrecurring business we did in fiscal year '15 and the number of meaningful deployments we did across our platform, we made a conscious decision because they do come in ebbs and flows to hold that flat for fiscal year '16. Now you saw a little bit of a step-up in the Q1 results. That's just a reflection of the lumpiness, if you will, of the nonrecurring activity. As I then sort of take it into Q2, we are assuming that the nonrecurring activity will go down quarter-over-quarter, partly because of what we see in our pipeline and partly it's what's -- not what's just in the pipeline, what's in our backlog. So we expect that we'll reduce our nonrecurring revenues by roughly $5.5 million next quarter or roughly 60 basis points of growth. So that -- that gives you a sense. Again, we still look to do a lot of it, again, and hold it at the same level as '15, but we will see -- we'll see it move around quarter-over-quarter. As it relates to utilization levels, yes, no surprise. We are running at higher levels. We've had a tremendous amount of success over a number of quarters. And when you see that success and also the incremental cabinets billing, that's a clear indication that we're filling up our assets, and it suggests that we're going to have to continue to put capital to work. There are certainly some markets that are more constrained than others. Charles was great in alluding to the Tokyo market, whereby through the acquisition of Bit-isle, we got a very large asset, which will allow us to delay any meaningful future spend in Japan for some time period. Yes, there's other markets where we talked about it on the last earnings call where we're now going to do what we call first-phase builds, which come with a much larger capital deployment in that initial phase. Silicon Valley is a perfect example, the one that Steve alluded to. And there's São Paulo as well and Sydney 4 and the like. So we are continuing to make sure we manage ourselves. I want to leave you with a couple of thoughts on how we manage our CapEx. We go through a very detailed exercise. We're looking 5 years out. We're looking across markets and IBXs to make sure we understand what our fill rates are, what is the empirical data telling us and what does that imply against our future expectations, understanding what competitive landscapes like in each of those markets or specific to that IBX. And so when we do that, if we look out 5 years, we have a pretty good view on what we think we could spend. So then in conclusion, to go back -- to address your final question, we are very much aware of what our capital spend is. As you know, that can ebb and flow based on our performance, knowing that your lead times are going to be anywhere from 9 months to 18 months depending on whether it's an incremental phase or a new build. That's going to dictate what the capital dollars are, but there is an expectation that we will continue to spend at these levels for a period of time given the demand that we see in the marketplace. I will say one last thing, which I think is important. One of the things that we want to do is continue to see our utilization go up, but we recognize that you're at a point where you don't want to constrain the business. There's certainly some markets where we feel a little bit more constrained today than we'd otherwise like to feel. And so we need to put the capital to work in those markets. Silicon Valley comes to mind again as a critical market where we're very eager to get out that -- to put up that Silicon Valley 10 asset because left unchecked, it will put a constraint on our ability to grow. But we feel we're in a great position to deliver the inventory on a fairly, what I'd say, just-in-time basis."

One is your question, Mike, around sort of growth and what the utilization implies. If you look at our stabilized assets chart, delivered 7%, I think, was what this quarter was. And what you'll see there is actually we've seen that -- we see that bounce around a little bit, just pretty good quarter and on a constant currency basis have seen even better quarters. And so you see that the stabilized assets still have meaningful growth potential in them even at quite high utilization rates. And then the second point I'd make is that we are making a very purposeful push to phase our capital as best as possible. And so we're trying to be as innovative as possible in phasing our capital, and that is going to have a natural tendency to sort of pressure utilization up a bit, which is a good thing as long as we still have the flexibility to respond and not go dark in a market. And so that's the balance we are striking, and I do think kudos to our engineering and construction teams for really phasing our capital in ways that are allowing us to still be responsive with higher levels of utilization."

And then second, I guess, I don't know who this will be for, if Charles is on the line, maybe for you. But if there's one kind of fear that people may have, it's that as the public cloud gets more reliable, more secure, that it has the potential to accommodate a growing share of all the outsourced applications that are existing, and that slowly the public-private hybrid cloud becomes a little less private and a little bit more public and it creates a cannibalization risk. Could you kind of talk about how you view that issue and if there's any evidence that it's happening in any way inside the Equinix facilities today?"

Let me start in the public cloud question and then Charles can jump in here on that and maybe give you an update on Telecity. Very good question. I know the big concern would be, is everything going to move to public? And is there going to be a need for the type of stuff that hosting and managed services and colo providers are providing. The world that we see unfolding and certainly all the industry analysts and all the customers we talk to certainly supports the thesis that the hybrid cloud, customers needing access to public Internet capability, which has always been there at Equinix for years and years and years is not going to go away. We've been working very hard the last 4 or 5 years working with all the cloud providers to provide this private connectivity to give the combination of the 2, which in our language gives you the hybrid capability to be able to move your traffic around the world is continuing to build and unfold. And most of the documentation, writings today suggest that public cloud is going to continue to grow from high teens to, like I said, earlier, 40%, 50%, 60% of workloads going to the public cloud. And the thing that I think people get confused about, even the big public cloud providers who build their big data centers and build their back-office facilities all over the world, still require the Equinixes of the world and the other data center providers of the world for the distributed part of their network because they're not terribly interested in putting capital in 40 different markets and 20 different countries, and so they're going to take advantage of the capacity that's out there with the Equinixes of the world to build the hub-and-spoke, if you will, or build the centralized and decentralized network to run these cloud offerings. Because users are all over the world, customers are all over the world, latency is a big factor, and that's why you see the continued rollout of public-private connectivity and capability. I don't know what you'd add to that Charles."

So we absolutely see that. We embrace it. And in fact, our platform is really facilitating it. And so I think if I were a commodity provider of colocation, we'd be very worried about that substitution, but that's not really the business we're in. We're in the business of enabling that hybrid cloud connectivity. One through -- via the CSPs and so the supply side of the cloud ecosystem is very relevant for us. And in fact, our top 6 customers are all delivering cloud services using Platform Equinix as some portion of their architecture to do so. And so it's a big opportunity for us. And then we see a big basket -- a very big basket of enterprise workloads that we believe will sort of reside in the private infrastructure side of things and really be implemented in the sort of hybrid cloud, multi-cloud setup. And so for us, we think it's very much a net positive, but I do believe that this trend you're talking about for cloud service providers becoming increasingly capable is real and will affect, I think, the broader data center market. And then let me circle back to Telecity now and I'll give you sort of a quick update and anybody can add color as they wish. We're less than 90 days into the post-combination world. And I'd tell you as a headline, we remain very optimistic and thoroughly convinced of the rationale for that transaction. Deal really cements our leadership in EMEA, 34 new locations and 7 new metros, 6 new countries, a material improvement in our network density, which was already market-leading in EMEA. And we add a number of really critical cloud nodes to our platform. Of note would be the new Telecity locations in Dublin, which are a great addition for us and seeing significant demand. And overall, we're really delighted with the quality assets and people that we've added to the team. As we said in our prepared remarks, a lot of progress on the integration. We've announced a senior leadership team, well advanced in aligning and cross-training the sales and delivery teams, well advanced in our rebranding plan of taking all the steps we needed to be fully REIT compliant. And as I said, we're already seeing cross-platform opportunities, both in the form of Telecity customers with an interest in Equinix facilities, but a bit more so right now of our Equinix customers really seeing opportunities to purchase capacity in the Telecity sites. And I think we're seeing more in that directionally because we have a larger force selling that on the Equinix side, and we're working through the sort of natural distractions of a team going through an integration on the Telecity side. So -- but we feel good about the synergies. We actually think we're going to exceed the synergy estimates that we had previously provided. All that's baked into the guidance you see here today. And again, we do think there is, over time, meaningful, meaningful revenue synergies as well as the cost synergies, which I said I think we'll exceed and the CapEx synergies that are allowing us to defer some investment in EMEA."

If you look at the organic churn in Q1 though, we're roughly 2.1%, consistent with where we think there's a natural churn level in and around that level in the organic business, where you're seeing slightly increased churn is attributed to the Bit-isle business. What we talked about in the last earnings call was effectively Bit-isle. Part of the reason that we felt comfortable holding their revenues flat relative to -- for '16 over '15 was the fact that they did have this increased level of churn. Now having said all of that, coming out of our prior guidance, the Bit-isle team did a little bit better than we originally anticipated. It's more so in their other services and less in their colocation business. But suffice it to say, between what they're doing in the colocation business and what they're performing in the managed services business, there's a direct correlation between what they do in managed services and the pull-through to colo. So Phil, we're very excited about their performance to date, and we continue to focus on very much optimizing that acquisition.

I will say that as Keith commented on, we have -- interconnection is a very central part of how we go to market and how we position with customers. And so it's really -- it's a -- it's critical that we -- we have a great track record of getting the value, delivering great value to our customers through cross connects and through interconnection. And we also have a great track record of making sure that we get value back in the form of how that's priced. And so needless to say, we'll maintain that strategy and we'll implement it within the Telecity environment over time because I think our customers are really getting superior value from that. So -- but we're in the process of figuring out what that implies in terms of aligning the product portfolios. We're well advanced in that effort and I think we'll start to see the results of that over the coming quarters."

As it relates to Telecity, Charles alluded to a number of the points. We're certainly going to look to what are the opportunities on the top line on driving incremental revenue attached to alignment of our product portfolio and the like. And we are very confident, albeit we've said there's only modest revenue attachment to that this year, but we're very confident that, that will continue to be something that will drive value going forward. As it relates to the cost side, that's the $30 million we referred to. We talked about $15 million this year, $15 million in 2017. Again, we're optimistic that we're not only going to be able to get that number, but we'll get beyond that number. Again, I'm reticent to give you the exact numbers just yet because given the lack of visibility that we had into the numbers prior to January 15, we're still doing a lot of work, as we said, to align the sales and delivery organizations as well as all of the back office. But again, I want you to walk away being confident that we see some incremental benefit. As it relates to the below-the-line activity, more specifically around taxes, again, we think of our tax structure as a competitive advantage. And no surprise to you as we then deploy that structure across our portfolio, that will generate benefits to our shareholders. And so we're excited about that as well. Now the other thing I would say is, recognizing that Telecity, we're in the business of investing in this business. And so what we want to make sure is that we continue to invest alongside it. So we're managing the synergies with continuing to drive value into the asset and expand that portfolio, consistent with what Equinix's expectations would be. As it relates to Bit-isle, that one, there's less synergies perhaps, but overall, a greater opportunity to fill up their -- sorry, less cost synergies, pardon me, but a greater opportunity to enjoy revenue synergies because of the underutilization of their assets. And that's where we're really excited about the opportunity, coupled with some other ways that we think we can optimize the overall business. Again, we want to be a little bit reserved in our comments right now as we continue to think about our strategy. But overall, in the next few quarters, you'll hear us talk more firmly about what's happening in the Bit-isle integration."

We have a strong client service management team that's applied to each of the customers to understand what their combined footprint looks like. They continue to get the service levels that they are contracted for and expect from both of those. Obviously, it doesn't come necessarily without any hiccups, but we have client service managers that are applied to those accounts to deal with issues as they arise. And that's -- so that's how we're doing in terms of customers that are keeping or maintaining a footprint between both facilities. In some cases, a more challenging one might be where we are actually separating out the assets associated with the divestiture. And that is a more complicated process in that sort of perhaps against their will to some degree, a customer may be sort of splitting their implementation now between Equinix and between the eventual buyer of the treated assets. That is a delicate customer communication. It's one that we would prefer have not to have had to do, but it was -- unfortunately, the European Commission didn't cooperate in that regard. And so it's simply a matter of us being clear and consistent with the communications to the customer and then stepping -- and then standing up, what we refer to -- standing up to a divestiture organization or the divested organization to be fully capable or responding to that. What I would say is we spent an enormous amount of money to make sure that, that divestiture goes out in a way that makes it readily operable on Day 1 to serve those customer needs."

We, as a company, when we see the performance of the business, I would say there's nothing meaningful that would indicate that we're seeing a slowdown. I think the challenge that when we talked about -- we had a commentary on Telecity more trending towards the lower end of the range. That's really more associated with the fact that we're taking 2 organizations, we're putting them together. When we gave our initial guidance, we didn't have the data and the visibility we have. Now we're just refining our numbers because we have much more clarity on what we think we can do as a business, but at the same time aligning our sales force and delivery teams to meet the expectation. I think the other thing again, Steve and Charles, I think both alluded to the fact that because we have the benefit of being able to import many of these global deals into markets, and London being one of our stronger market, we see that as an opportunity. And the number of 3-region deals that are in our pipeline today, perhaps not scientifically, but I would say it's probably larger than we've seen in a long time. And so that gives us confidence with London and Amsterdam being some key nodes on those typical global deployments. That continues to be an opportunity for us. So overall, I wouldn't say anything meaningful yet, but we're certainly going to pay attention to it and we are monitoring it. We do get a number of questions from our investors on that subject matter, but it's a bit early to say with any confidence that there's any real impact from this potential Brexit matter."

There is a variety of different -- obviously, Western Europe is clearly a fully deregulated telecom market. And so it is -- it does -- network density is something that does really benefit customers in a similar way, but they started from a place where interconnection was really sort of, as Keith earlier referenced, sort of packed in and not really clearly delineated as part of the value proposition. And so it's been a bit of a journey for us in terms of being more clear with customers about the distinctive and extraordinary value they're getting from cross connects. And so whether or not you could achieve the same level that we do now, which are in the north of 20% in the U.S., it's hard to tell. But I do think that we certainly continue to see upside opportunity in both regions to meaningfully improve those, both through quantity and price levers that are available to us. And so I think they'll filter north for sure. Whether or not they can get to those same levels, I don't know, but I think they can go meaningfully higher than where they are today."

So frankly, what we've told you on a constant currency basis that organic business can grow greater than 13.4%. Now as you recognize Q1 when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, it's 16%. And so we're stepping -- we're effectively stepping that down in the second quarter to a midpoint of guidance of roughly 2.6% growth quarter-over-quarter. If you're looking at top end of the range, 2.9% quarter-over-quarter growth. 60 basis points of that is coming from the fact that right now we're assuming that nonrecurring revenue will be $5.5 million less in Q2 than it was in Q1. And so number one, there's an element of what's going on in the nonrecurring space. Number two, when we look at that sort of the second half of the year, one of the things we're really given, given the level of activity and other matters are affecting the combination of the businesses between Bit-isle, Telecity and ourself, we're very much -- we're being very disciplined in what we want the future guidance to be. Right now, we're leaving it as greater than 13.4%. And that's really a reflection of there's a lot of activity that's taking place in the company right now. And because of that, we want to make sure we're continuing to have a relatively conservative view on what it means for the back half of the year. Notwithstanding the fact that we are working very hard, as I said, to integrate the businesses. And between the integration of the businesses and running the organic business, we're optimistic that we can continue to scale the business or to grow the business on a year-over-year basis greater than that 13.4%.

First and foremost, it's the size of the deals that we have looked at. The average size of deal that we did this quarter is a lot greater than the averages that we saw in the prior quarters. So that's number one. We didn't do a lot of what I'd call larger footprint deals in the quarter. Number two, as you know, we've rolled out a new basic quote-to-cash platform. And that quote-to-cash platform is putting more -- is putting a little bit of what's new -- is new in the system. It's different for our customers. It's different for our employees. And so as we continue to refine, if you will, our platform, we think that, that's going to continue to increase the number of cabinet adds. Number three, I would tell you that our pipeline or our backlog is -- more particularly the backlog, is higher than it has been before. And as a result, there's that, that going to give us confidence that it's going to come into the revenue stream and ultimately to the billing cabinets. And then the fourth thing I would say is, look, this is an area that we've seen before. It generally relates to things that happen near our end of quarter. Churn is a perfect example. Last quarter, as you recall, we referred to a U.K.-based churn, a relatively large churn that would affect not only our churn MRR metric, but also affects the number of cabinets because the customer is effectively there for the entire quarter and then it churns out and so you lose those cabinets. No different this quarter. We had a number of churn activities that happened at the back end of the quarter. And they were cabinet dense, and as a result, it reduced the overall level of cabinets billing. Bottom line is, we're optimistic that you're going to see that number rebound. We've seen it before, this pattern, and it's something that we'd anticipate changes as we look to the latter part of the year. The one thing that you can get great confidence in is irrespective of what that number is because it's a calculated metric, we are continuing to drive our revenues up. And you can see by the guidance that we provided that we would expect to deliver $22 million of incremental revenue Q2 over Q1, which is a strong indication that we've got a number of billing cabinets in the system."

Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We had a great start to 2016, delivering both revenue and adjusted EBITDA above the top end of our guidance ranges as demand for interconnected colocation continues to drive strong performance across all 3 of our regions. 
As depicted on Slide 3, revenues were $844.2 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 16% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $380.7 million for the quarter, up 4% over the prior quarter and up 17% year-over-year on an organic and constant currency basis. This drove AFFO growth of 35% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. 
For the quarter, we delivered strong gross and net bookings, with solid production from both our direct and indirect channels as we scale our go-to-market efforts. Our key operating metrics demonstrate the strength of our ecosystem-centric business model with firm MRR per cabinet, low churn and a healthy interconnection growth. 
Our global platform continues to be a critical source of differentiation, making us the partner of choice for customers looking to respond effectively to increasingly distributed infrastructure requirements. Our reach is allowing us to gain market share while tapping into higher-growth markets, with EMEA and Asia Pacific now contributing greater than 50% of our revenues and our geographic reach stretching across 21 countries and 40 metros. 
We are pleased with the Telecity acquisition and are excited to add this great set of quality assets and people to the platform -- to Platform Equinix. With less than 90 days under our belt, we are already seeing healthy momentum in cross-platform bookings and are making rapid progress on integration despite the significance size and complexity of this transaction. 
Overall, the Telecity assets delivered solid financial performance consistent with our guidance for revenue and adjusted EBITDA while absorbing efforts related to the deal close and the planned divestitures. We see the anticipated revenue synergies materializing and are tracking well to our expected cost and CapEx synergies, all of which is a great validation of the deal rationale.
Bit-isle is also progressing well, tracking above our prior guidance with several strategic wins enabled by these new assets. Our integration efforts are on track, and our plans to optimize the business remain ahead of schedule. As we integrate these 2 acquisitions, we expect to achieve a combined $30 million in annual cost savings, with about 50% of these savings realized before the end of this year and the remainder in 2017. 
With Telecity and Bit-isle, we now serve over 8,000 customers and are proud that over 150 of the Fortune 500 are Equinix customers. We have increased our already market-leading network density from 1,100 to over 1,400 networks and have added a number of critical new cloud nodes to Platform Equinix. 
We are extending our value proposition as the home of the interconnected cloud with industry-leading providers such as AWS, Microsoft and Google, contributing directly to the increase in our enterprise business by enabling enterprise CIOs to quickly and cost-effectively implement multicloud architectures. 
Our cloud and enterprise verticals, which represent 28% and 13% of our revenues, respectively, remain our fastest-growing market segments and contributed the highest number of new customer additions for the sixth quarter in a row. 
Interconnection revenue grew a healthy 19% year-over-year on an organic and constant currency basis. With over 176,000 cross connects and significant growth on our Internet and our Cloud Exchange, Equinix is benefiting from strong secular trends that are driving businesses to become increasingly interconnected. We run the largest Internet exchange globally with 5.5 terabits of peak traffic growing 30% year-over-year as networks and cloud providers continue to upgrade their capacity. 
Given our high utilization rate of 80% and strong returns on development capital, we continue to expand in core markets heavily weighted towards existing campuses in Tier 1 market -- metros, which exhibit strong pipelines and attractive supply-demand profiles. We now have 16 announced expansion projects underway, and this quarter, we are moving forward with additional expansions in Silicon Valley, New York and Hong Kong, totaling over $200 million of CapEx. 
In Silicon Valley, demand remains robust, and we are building SV10, a new IBX located directly adjacent to our Great Oaks campus, home to a rich ecosystem of networking cloud hubs and the second-largest peering market in the U.S. after our Ashburn campus in Northern Virginia. Notably, for SV10, we purchased the 11 acres of land for this project, expanding our asset ownership in this important market. 
In New York, we are proceeding with the second phase of New York 5, the flagship asset on our Secaucus campus, which is comprised of 4 adjacent data centers with over 10,000 cabinets and is a key growth engine for our Americas business. New York 5 saw a strong pull-through post the deployment of BATS trading engine and is also seeing solid demand from the broader financial services community as they embrace hybrid cloud. Our first phase of New York 5 project is already 85% full with strong pricing.
Our capital investments continue to deliver very healthy growth as well as strong returns across our new expansion and stabilized IBXs as shown on Slide 4. The operating performance of our 70 stabilized global IBXs delivered steady revenue growth of 7%, an increase over the prior quarter, while generating a 31% cash on cash return on the gross PP&E invested, reflecting the tremendous economic value of these stabilized campuses. 
Stabilized assets include projects that have been open for more than 1 year with all phases built out. As we shift to 2016, a net 3 IBXs were added to this category and utilization of these assets remains a healthy 86%.  
Let me now cover quarterly highlights from our industry verticals, and I'll start with the networks. This vertical experienced strong bookings, driven by multisite expansions with Tier 1 service providers and new wins with Tier 2 providers and cable operators who are shifting their portfolios to address demand for IP and digital services. 
We are seeing a resurgence of subsea cable projects to support global cloud deployments and growth of international data traffic, which are creating new opportunities for Equinix. There are more than 50 global submarine cable projects under consideration over the coming 2 years, which places Equinix in a great position to win a portion of this next generation of submarine cable investment.
In the content digital media vertical, performance was driven by expansions from both traditional lighthouse content providers and our Ad-IX ecosystem. Advertisers continue to optimize user experience while architecting for increasing traffic volumes driven by the explosive growth of mobile advertising. Customer wins included Content Bridge, a supply chain management digital right service provider, and Grapeshot, an innovative provider of analytics and keyword targeting. 
The financial services vertical experienced the second highest bookings of all time, with strength across insurance, electronic payments, trading and retail banking. We also saw a sharp growth in Performance Hub deployments as financial services enterprise continue to re-architect their IT. Customer wins included Dutch Bank, ABN AMRO, a 3-region expansion by Thomson Reuters for electronic trading and EP2, an Australian provider of digital payment solutions leveraging the Equinix Cloud Exchange.
The cloud and IT services vertical experienced strong bookings across all regions this quarter, including strategic wins with leading Software-as-a-Service providers, furthering our cloud density objectives. Cloud services adoption continues with over 370 enterprises, clouds, IT service providers and networks interconnecting on Cloud Exchange in addition to the healthy growth in direct connect activity to cloud providers. Customer wins included Pure Storage, a cloud scale data platform providing hybrid cloud data management for Microsoft Azure; and Blue Jeans, an enterprise video cloud provider enabling direct access via Cloud Exchange. 
And finally, turning to the enterprise, this vertical delivered strong bookings, driven by manufacturing, travel and government wins as enterprises leverage our global platform, both directly and through our growing base of Equinix partners to re-architect their infrastructure. Over 370 customers have deployed our Performance Hub solution, which helps enterprises optimize their network architectures, access the cloud and drive application performance.
Customer wins, included Nucor, a Fortune 200 steel manufacturer, leveraging Equinix to solve for hybrid cloud connectivity, and AVANT Homes, a residential and commercial property development firm. 
We are growing our enterprise customer base at an accelerated pace as CIOs adopt an interconnected-oriented architecture as shown on Slide 5. 
IOA is a blueprint to help CIOs re-architect their IT delivery to better interconnect people, locations, clouds and data. Leveraging our global data center footprint and multi-cloud interconnection capabilities, interconnection-oriented architectures represent a fundamental shift away from centralized legacy enterprise IT models to distributed and dynamic models. 
Direct interconnectivity enables enterprises to react in real time, adapt quickly to change and leverage digital ecosystems to create new value and growth. Enterprises are increasingly looking to Equinix as they embark on this journey, moving away from in-house data centers in order to leverage multi-cloud architectures placed closer to users and their customers. We believe this trend will continue to significantly increase our opportunities within this market segment. 
So let me stop there and turn it over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter."
28202,330928820,973425,"Equinix, Inc. (REIT), Equinix, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Equinix, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone. So our first quarter represents a great start to 2016. We continued to deliver top line growth, expand margins and drive sales across our expanded platform. We had strong bookings in each of our regions,",1560,"Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone. So our first quarter represents a great start to 2016. We continued to deliver top line growth, expand margins and drive sales across our expanded platform. 
We had strong bookings in each of our regions, including solid cross-region execution. This quarter, we were able to benefit from record 3 region deployments across all of our segments as customers leverage our geographic reach. Including recent acquisitions, greater than 53% of our revenues come from customers deployed globally across all 3 regions and over 81% from customers deployed across multiple metros.
Our interconnection additions remained very positive, adding another 5,600 net cross connects and almost 180 exchange ports in the quarter. This is the seventh quarter in a row where we've added greater than 5,000 cross connects in a quarter. Interconnection revenues represent 16% of our global recurring revenues. 
Moving to acquisitions. We've seen early momentum from both the Telecity and Bit-isle businesses, delivering against our guidance expectations while progressing well towards our expected synergy targets. The Internet -- the integration efforts are well underway. We've selected the senior leadership team for the EMEA business, who are in the advanced stages of aligning our sales and delivery teams. 
Cross-selling across the combined platform is taking root. And after we divest of the 8 assets held for sale, we believe that we'll be able to accelerate our sales efforts as customers decide the optimum location to deploy their infrastructure. In addition, we've reduced our expected 2016 integration spend to $55 million. These costs will support our significant systems work, employee severance and retention costs and a substantial organizational restructuring cost related to our REIT and other tax initiatives. As it relates to the 8 assets held for sale, we remain on track to divest these assets by mid-2016.
Now as it relates to our full year guidance, the weakening U.S. dollar has provided us significant FX tailwinds. And this uptick, along with better-than-expected operating performance in the first quarter, allows us to increase our revenue guidance with flow-through benefits to both EBITDA and AFFO. 
Our updated annual revenue guidance continues to include flat nonrecurring revenues compared to the prior year as well as refining our annual view related to the Telecity business as we continue to work through the divestiture process and complete our integration efforts and have further visibility into their data. 
So turning to the first quarter. As depicted on Slide 6, Global Q1 revenues were 842 -- $844.2 million, up 3% over the prior quarter and 16% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis, our 53rd straight quarter of top line growth. As our -- our as-reported revenues include $119 million from acquisitions, consistent with our expectations. 
Q1 revenues net of our FX hedges include a $3.3 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter and a $1.4 million positive currency benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar. 
For Europe, we've hedged approximately 80% of our Equinix organic business. Global adjusted EBITDA was $380.7 million, up 4% over the prior quarter and 17% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis, above prior guidance due to revenue flow-through, lower SG&A and innovation costs. 
Our as-reported EBITDA includes $52 million of contribution from our acquisitions as well as $13 million in integration costs. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 45.1% or 46.9% on an organic and constant currency basis. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance net of FX hedges reflects a negative $3.8 million currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter and a $1.3 million negative impact when compared to our FX guidance rates.
Global AFFO was $210 million, including $64 million loss related to the Telecity hedge. Excluding the Telecity foreign currency loss and integration cost, AFFO on a normalized basis and constant currency increased 20% over the prior quarter to $287 million, tracking above the top end of our guidance range largely due to the business performance and lower-than-expected taxes and interest expense. 
As we continue to focus on value creation per share, upon the maturity of the remaining portion of our convertible -- our June '16 convertible debt instrument, we have elected to receive the proceeds from the related cap call in the form of shares, thereby reducing the net dilution from this debt instrument by approximately 400,000 shares.
Moving to churn. Global MRR churn for Q1 was 2.2% or 2.1% on an organic basis, consistent with our prior guidance. We continue to expect our quarterly MRR churn rate to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% quarterly. 
And one final note before I discuss the regional performance. Our nonfinancial metric sheet and supplemental, including our segment IBX reporting, will not include the acquisitions until early next year as we work to integrate their unit metrics and results into our financial systems.
And now I'd like to provide a few highlights on the regions, whose full results are covered on Slides 7 through 9. Our global platform continues to expand with EMEA and Asia Pacific growing organic and constant currency growth over the same quarter last year of 17% and 25%, respectively, while the Americas region produced steady growth of 13%. 
We added over 1,500 cabinets, down from the prior quarter due to timing of installs and churn, and we expect a more normalized net cabinets billing increase next quarter. MRR per cabinet was firm at $1,970, up $11 on a constant currency basis. 
The Americas region had another strong quarter, delivering solid bookings from the network and financial verticals, an increasing yield per cabinet and the second-best interconnection quarter of all time. EMEA delivered a solid quarter of bookings with particular strength in the Dutch and German markets while absorbing higher churn in the U.K. at the end of last quarter. 
Asia Pacific continued a steady growth with Tokyo and Hong Kong as the fastest-growing markets driven by cloud and content verticals. Interconnection revenues continued to outpace overall growth of the business with the Americas, APAC and EMEA interconnection revenues now at 23%, 13% and 8%, respectively, of recurring revenues. 
EMEA's interconnection revenues declined as a percent of the region's recurring revenue as the region absorbed the Telecity results. It is our intention to increase interconnection revenues as a percent of this region's recurring revenues over the medium and longer term.
And now looking at the balance sheet, please refer to Slide 10. Unrestricted cash and investments decreased this quarter to $650 million, largely due to the closing of the Telecity acquisition on January 15. Our net debt leverage ratio stepped up to 4.3x our Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA, although we expect to return to our range of 3 to 4x adjusted EBITDA over the next 12 to 18 months. 
Now switching to AFFO and dividends on Slide 11. For 2016, we're raising our as-reported AFFO to be greater than $1 billion -- sorry, $1.015 billion, a 22% year-over-year increase. On a normalized basis, AFFO would be greater than $1.134 billion or at 28% constant currency increase over prior year. 
Adjusting for the $6 million of interest earned on the convertible debt through the first half of the year, our fully diluted AFFO per share would be $16.13 using a weighted average 70.7 million shares outstanding, as presented on Page 34 of the earnings deck. 
Also today, we announced our Q2 dividend of $1.75 a share, consistent with our Q1 quarterly dividend. Our AFFO payout ratio is now expected to be approximately 49% for 2016. 
Now looking at capital expenditures. Please refer to Slide 12. For the quarter, CapEx was $198 million, including recurring CapEx of $32 million, below our guidance due to timing of cash payments to our contractors. 
With respect to our newbuilds, during the quarter, we opened Tokyo 5 IBX, our 10th IBX in the Tokyo Metro, taking into consideration Bit-isle's 5 assets in Tokyo. Tokyo 5 is located near the financial district and proximate to our existing network-dense Tokyo 3 IBX. 
We've tethered these 2 assets together, thereby allowing our Tokyo 5 customers to access the rich set of networks in Tokyo 3. And given our current high utilization rate of 80%, the strong development returns, we continue to invest across many key markets with new IBX builds scheduled to open in the next year, including Amsterdam, São Paulo, Silicon Valley and Sydney, in addition to the expansion phases in Ashburn, Atlanta, Dublin, Frankfurt, Hong Kong and Warsaw.
Also, we will continue to purchase and develop land, including our recently purchased Silicon Valley land parcels. Over time, we expect revenues from our own sites to increase. Owned properties generate 30% -- 38% of the organic recurring revenues or 34% of our revenues on a combined basis as the acquisitions have a higher percent of leased sites. 
Including acquisitions, over 85% of our recurring revenue is generated by either owned properties or properties where our lease expiration extends to 2029 or beyond. And finally, we've provided you a number of slides that bridge our 2016 guidance from the normalized 2015 performance, including slides for revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Please refer to these slides on Slides 13 through 16. I'll turn the call back to Steve."

Thanks, Keith. And finally, on Slide 17, which summarizes our Q2 and our full year 2016 guidance, which includes our FX impacts, let me now cover our updated 2016 outlook.
For the full year of 2016, we are raising our revenue guidance to be greater than $3.595 billion, 32% growth on an as-reported basis or an organic and constant currency growth rate of greater than 13.4% compared to the prior year. This $45 million revenue increase includes a $42 million positive foreign currency benefit when compared to the prior guidance rates and a $3 million increase due to stronger Q1 operating performance.
For 2016, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to be greater than $1.65 billion, a 30% increase on an as-reported basis or a greater than 16% year-over-year growth rate on an organic and constant currency basis. This $30 million adjusted EBITDA increase includes an $18 million positive foreign currency benefit when compared to prior guidance rates and $9 million increase due to Q1 operating performance and $3 million in lower-than-expected integration costs.
And the growth of our business is driving increased adjusted funds from operations and ultimately, cash flow and dividends. We are raising AFFO to be greater than $1.134 billion, normalized for the Telecity transaction-related FX loss and integration costs, a 28% constant currency growth compared to the prior year. This $56 million AFFO increase includes a $14 million positive foreign currency benefit when compared to the prior guidance rates, a $20 million -- $29 million reduction in interest and tax costs and better-than-expected operating performance and lower integration costs. And finally, we expect 2016 capital expenditures to continue to range between $900 million and $1 billion for the year.
So in closing, Platform Equinix is the critical intersection point between clouds, networks and the enterprise, and this opportunity is translating into solid revenue growth, firm yield and healthy returns on our stabilized and expansion IBXs. Our platform continues to scale organically, and we are progressing well with our strategic acquisitions, positioning us to extend our market leadership, enhance our cloud and network density and grow our customer ecosystems. So let me stop here, and we'll open it up to questions. So over to you, Carrie."

So we have worked very hard, as you know, the people on his phone know, to populate our facilities around the world with access points, network nodes, cash nodes, whatever you want to call them, to make it very easy for enterprises of all shapes and sizes to find these cloud providers and buy those services as a service. And so that is happening as a thesis, has -- continues to prove itself and as the numbers continue to show you, enterprises is growing at the highest rate. Now the marketing teams and the sales teams around the world are pursuing different industry verticals in different countries. So we are building use cases and success stories across multiple industry verticals. There's probably a dozen where we have different use cases being built and they vary by region and by country. The demand is pretty standard around the world. It probably parallels the growth rates that we see. We're growing the fastest in Asia, followed by Europe followed by the Americas. So I would say enterprise, particularly global enterprises are demanding footprint across all the big markets and all the big -- across all 3 regions. So it's pretty steady demand, pretty steady demand, and it's underpinning most of our new logo accumulation. But Charles, I don't know. Would you add anything?"

But there are some variations country to country in terms of cloud adoption. I would say that, for example, Australia tends to be an outlier on the high side, being receptive to cloud and hybrid cloud as an architecture of choice. And -- but we're seeing good, solid demand across all 3 regions."

But the cloud spending continues to fuel the data center requirements, which is what we're benefiting from. And the robust leasing activity that we're seeing is really driven by the cloud, which is attracting the enterprises that are -- almost all enterprises we talk to today are moving some portion of their applications workload to get access to the hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, et cetera. And so I think most of the industry analyst data points suggest that high-teens today is enterprises that are taking advantage of cloud offerings, and that will move over the coming 4 years to 50%, 60% of the workloads. Certainly in the conversations that we're having, that's very -- that's a very common conversation. I would tell you that we hear security requirements. We heard cloud requirements.

So there's certainly plenty of trends from the enterprise across these big segments that we're all reading about in these reports."

And I guess I'd just offer and add that what we're seeing is that hybrid cloud adoption is accelerating. And in fact, I think we look at interconnection-oriented architectures as essentially a mechanism by which these enterprise CIOs are allowing them to do more with less, and that's a key priority for them. And if you look at adoption rates, IDC says that 65% of enterprises are going to be committed to hybrid and multi-cloud by the end of this year. And so we're seeing a very rapid clip of adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud and a real resonance to interconnection-oriented architecture. And while they may be -- their overall spend levels may be reducing because they're not spending as much on traditional IT spend categories, I think that the hybrid cloud enablement in that area is actually increasing in total spend, at least from what we're seeing with the enterprise customers that we're serving."

So what does that mean in terms of the availability of growth to the business over the next few quarters? And what does that mean for future capital? Should we expect capital to accelerate, to give you more capacity, which will naturally push that utilization down?

First, as it relates to nonrecurring, we did see a little bit of an uptick this quarter. One of the things that we started the year with, Mike, as you know, is we took a very strong view because of the amount of nonrecurring business we did in fiscal year '15 and the number of meaningful deployments we did across our platform, we made a conscious decision because they do come in ebbs and flows to hold that flat for fiscal year '16. Now you saw a little bit of a step-up in the Q1 results. That's just a reflection of the lumpiness, if you will, of the nonrecurring activity. As I then sort of take it into Q2, we are assuming that the nonrecurring activity will go down quarter-over-quarter, partly because of what we see in our pipeline and partly it's what's -- not what's just in the pipeline, what's in our backlog. So we expect that we'll reduce our nonrecurring revenues by roughly $5.5 million next quarter or roughly 60 basis points of growth. So that -- that gives you a sense. Again, we still look to do a lot of it, again, and hold it at the same level as '15, but we will see -- we'll see it move around quarter-over-quarter. As it relates to utilization levels, yes, no surprise. We are running at higher levels. We've had a tremendous amount of success over a number of quarters. And when you see that success and also the incremental cabinets billing, that's a clear indication that we're filling up our assets, and it suggests that we're going to have to continue to put capital to work. There are certainly some markets that are more constrained than others. Charles was great in alluding to the Tokyo market, whereby through the acquisition of Bit-isle, we got a very large asset, which will allow us to delay any meaningful future spend in Japan for some time period. Yes, there's other markets where we talked about it on the last earnings call where we're now going to do what we call first-phase builds, which come with a much larger capital deployment in that initial phase. Silicon Valley is a perfect example, the one that Steve alluded to. And there's São Paulo as well and Sydney 4 and the like. So we are continuing to make sure we manage ourselves. I want to leave you with a couple of thoughts on how we manage our CapEx. We go through a very detailed exercise. We're looking 5 years out. We're looking across markets and IBXs to make sure we understand what our fill rates are, what is the empirical data telling us and what does that imply against our future expectations, understanding what competitive landscapes like in each of those markets or specific to that IBX. And so when we do that, if we look out 5 years, we have a pretty good view on what we think we could spend. So then in conclusion, to go back -- to address your final question, we are very much aware of what our capital spend is. As you know, that can ebb and flow based on our performance, knowing that your lead times are going to be anywhere from 9 months to 18 months depending on whether it's an incremental phase or a new build. That's going to dictate what the capital dollars are, but there is an expectation that we will continue to spend at these levels for a period of time given the demand that we see in the marketplace. I will say one last thing, which I think is important. One of the things that we want to do is continue to see our utilization go up, but we recognize that you're at a point where you don't want to constrain the business. There's certainly some markets where we feel a little bit more constrained today than we'd otherwise like to feel. And so we need to put the capital to work in those markets. Silicon Valley comes to mind again as a critical market where we're very eager to get out that -- to put up that Silicon Valley 10 asset because left unchecked, it will put a constraint on our ability to grow. But we feel we're in a great position to deliver the inventory on a fairly, what I'd say, just-in-time basis."

One is your question, Mike, around sort of growth and what the utilization implies. If you look at our stabilized assets chart, delivered 7%, I think, was what this quarter was. And what you'll see there is actually we've seen that -- we see that bounce around a little bit, just pretty good quarter and on a constant currency basis have seen even better quarters. And so you see that the stabilized assets still have meaningful growth potential in them even at quite high utilization rates. And then the second point I'd make is that we are making a very purposeful push to phase our capital as best as possible. And so we're trying to be as innovative as possible in phasing our capital, and that is going to have a natural tendency to sort of pressure utilization up a bit, which is a good thing as long as we still have the flexibility to respond and not go dark in a market. And so that's the balance we are striking, and I do think kudos to our engineering and construction teams for really phasing our capital in ways that are allowing us to still be responsive with higher levels of utilization."

And then second, I guess, I don't know who this will be for, if Charles is on the line, maybe for you. But if there's one kind of fear that people may have, it's that as the public cloud gets more reliable, more secure, that it has the potential to accommodate a growing share of all the outsourced applications that are existing, and that slowly the public-private hybrid cloud becomes a little less private and a little bit more public and it creates a cannibalization risk. Could you kind of talk about how you view that issue and if there's any evidence that it's happening in any way inside the Equinix facilities today?"

Let me start in the public cloud question and then Charles can jump in here on that and maybe give you an update on Telecity. Very good question. I know the big concern would be, is everything going to move to public? And is there going to be a need for the type of stuff that hosting and managed services and colo providers are providing. The world that we see unfolding and certainly all the industry analysts and all the customers we talk to certainly supports the thesis that the hybrid cloud, customers needing access to public Internet capability, which has always been there at Equinix for years and years and years is not going to go away. We've been working very hard the last 4 or 5 years working with all the cloud providers to provide this private connectivity to give the combination of the 2, which in our language gives you the hybrid capability to be able to move your traffic around the world is continuing to build and unfold. And most of the documentation, writings today suggest that public cloud is going to continue to grow from high teens to, like I said, earlier, 40%, 50%, 60% of workloads going to the public cloud. And the thing that I think people get confused about, even the big public cloud providers who build their big data centers and build their back-office facilities all over the world, still require the Equinixes of the world and the other data center providers of the world for the distributed part of their network because they're not terribly interested in putting capital in 40 different markets and 20 different countries, and so they're going to take advantage of the capacity that's out there with the Equinixes of the world to build the hub-and-spoke, if you will, or build the centralized and decentralized network to run these cloud offerings. Because users are all over the world, customers are all over the world, latency is a big factor, and that's why you see the continued rollout of public-private connectivity and capability. I don't know what you'd add to that Charles."

So we absolutely see that. We embrace it. And in fact, our platform is really facilitating it. And so I think if I were a commodity provider of colocation, we'd be very worried about that substitution, but that's not really the business we're in. We're in the business of enabling that hybrid cloud connectivity. One through -- via the CSPs and so the supply side of the cloud ecosystem is very relevant for us. And in fact, our top 6 customers are all delivering cloud services using Platform Equinix as some portion of their architecture to do so. And so it's a big opportunity for us. And then we see a big basket -- a very big basket of enterprise workloads that we believe will sort of reside in the private infrastructure side of things and really be implemented in the sort of hybrid cloud, multi-cloud setup. And so for us, we think it's very much a net positive, but I do believe that this trend you're talking about for cloud service providers becoming increasingly capable is real and will affect, I think, the broader data center market. And then let me circle back to Telecity now and I'll give you sort of a quick update and anybody can add color as they wish. We're less than 90 days into the post-combination world. And I'd tell you as a headline, we remain very optimistic and thoroughly convinced of the rationale for that transaction. Deal really cements our leadership in EMEA, 34 new locations and 7 new metros, 6 new countries, a material improvement in our network density, which was already market-leading in EMEA. And we add a number of really critical cloud nodes to our platform. Of note would be the new Telecity locations in Dublin, which are a great addition for us and seeing significant demand. And overall, we're really delighted with the quality assets and people that we've added to the team. As we said in our prepared remarks, a lot of progress on the integration. We've announced a senior leadership team, well advanced in aligning and cross-training the sales and delivery teams, well advanced in our rebranding plan of taking all the steps we needed to be fully REIT compliant. And as I said, we're already seeing cross-platform opportunities, both in the form of Telecity customers with an interest in Equinix facilities, but a bit more so right now of our Equinix customers really seeing opportunities to purchase capacity in the Telecity sites. And I think we're seeing more in that directionally because we have a larger force selling that on the Equinix side, and we're working through the sort of natural distractions of a team going through an integration on the Telecity side. So -- but we feel good about the synergies. We actually think we're going to exceed the synergy estimates that we had previously provided. All that's baked into the guidance you see here today. And again, we do think there is, over time, meaningful, meaningful revenue synergies as well as the cost synergies, which I said I think we'll exceed and the CapEx synergies that are allowing us to defer some investment in EMEA."

If you look at the organic churn in Q1 though, we're roughly 2.1%, consistent with where we think there's a natural churn level in and around that level in the organic business, where you're seeing slightly increased churn is attributed to the Bit-isle business. What we talked about in the last earnings call was effectively Bit-isle. Part of the reason that we felt comfortable holding their revenues flat relative to -- for '16 over '15 was the fact that they did have this increased level of churn. Now having said all of that, coming out of our prior guidance, the Bit-isle team did a little bit better than we originally anticipated. It's more so in their other services and less in their colocation business. But suffice it to say, between what they're doing in the colocation business and what they're performing in the managed services business, there's a direct correlation between what they do in managed services and the pull-through to colo. So Phil, we're very excited about their performance to date, and we continue to focus on very much optimizing that acquisition.

But we are in the process of aligning the product portfolios. Generally, I would say that the company has had a fairly consistent strategy in the marketplace, so probably not a dramatic set of changes in the product portfolios there, but we are in the process of taking those and aligning the product portfolios. I will say that as Keith commented on, we have -- interconnection is a very central part of how we go to market and how we position with customers. And so it's really -- it's an -- it's critical that we -- we have a great track record of getting the value, delivering great value to our customers through cross connects and through interconnection. And we also have a great track record of making sure that we get value back in the form of how that's priced. And so needless to say, we'll maintain that strategy and we'll implement it within the Telecity environment over time because I think our customers are really getting superior value from that. So -- but we're in the process of figuring out what that implies in terms of aligning the product portfolios. We're well advanced in that effort and I think we'll start to see the results of that over the coming quarters."

As it relates to Telecity, Charles alluded to a number of the points. We're certainly going to look to what are the opportunities on the top line on driving incremental revenue attached to alignment of our product portfolio and the like. And we are very confident, albeit we've said there's only modest revenue attachment to that this year, but we're very confident that, that will continue to be something that will drive value going forward. As it relates to the cost side, that's the $30 million we referred to. We talked about $15 million this year, $15 million in 2017. Again, we're optimistic that we're not only going to be able to get that number, but we'll get beyond that number. Again, I'm reticent to give you the exact numbers just yet because given the lack of visibility that we had into the numbers prior to January 15, we're still doing a lot of work, as we said, to align the sales and delivery organizations as well as all of the back office. But again, I want you to walk away being confident that we see some incremental benefit. As it relates to the below-the-line activity, more specifically around taxes, again, we think of our tax structure as a competitive advantage. And no surprise to you as we then deploy that structure across our portfolio, that will generate benefits to our shareholders. And so we're excited about that as well. Now the other thing I would say is, recognizing that Telecity, we're in the business of investing in this business. And so what we want to make sure is that we continue to invest alongside it. So we're managing the synergies with continuing to drive value into the asset and expand that portfolio, consistent with what Equinix's expectations would be. As it relates to Bit-isle, that one, there's less synergies perhaps, but overall, a greater opportunity to fill up their -- sorry, less cost synergies, pardon me, but a greater opportunity to enjoy revenue synergies because of the underutilization of their assets. And that's where we're really excited about the opportunity, coupled with some other ways that we think we can optimize the overall business. Again, we want to be a little bit reserved in our comments right now as we continue to think about our strategy. But overall, in the next few quarters, you'll hear us talk more firmly about what's happening in the Bit-isle integration."

We have a strong client service management team that's applied to each of the customers to understand what their combined footprint looks like. They continue to get the service levels that they are contracted for and expect from both of those. Obviously, it doesn't come necessarily without any hiccups, but we have client service managers that are applied to those accounts to deal with issues as they arise. And that's -- so that's how we're doing in terms of customers that are keeping or maintaining a footprint between both facilities. In some cases, a more challenging one might be where we are actually separating out the assets associated with the divestiture. And that is a more complicated process in that sort of perhaps against their will to some degree, a customer may be sort of splitting their implementation now between Equinix and between the eventual buyers of the Cheetah assets. That is a delicate customer communication. It's one that we would prefer have not to have had to do, but it was -- unfortunately, the European Commission didn't cooperate in that regard. And so it's simply a matter of us being clear and consistent with the communications to the customer and then stepping -- and then standing up, what we refer to -- standing up to a divestiture organization or the divested organization to be fully capable or responding to that. What I would say is we spent an enormous amount of money to make sure that, that divestiture goes out in a way that makes it readily operable on Day 1 to serve those customer needs."

We, as a company, when we see the performance of the business, I would say there's nothing meaningful that would indicate that we're seeing a slowdown. I think the challenge that when we talked about -- we had a commentary on Telecity more trending towards the lower end of the range. That's really more associated with the fact that we're taking 2 organizations, we're putting them together. When we gave our initial guidance, we didn't have the data and the visibility we have. Now we're just refining our numbers because we have much more clarity on what we think we can do as a business, but at the same time aligning our sales force and delivery teams to meet the expectation. I think the other thing again, Steve and Charles, I think both alluded to the fact that because we have the benefit of being able to import many of these global deals into markets, and London being one of our stronger market, we see that as an opportunity. And the number of 3-region deals that are in our pipeline today, perhaps not scientifically, but I would say it's probably larger than we've seen in a long time. And so that gives us confidence with London and Amsterdam being some key nodes on those typical global deployments. That continues to be an opportunity for us. So overall, I wouldn't say anything meaningful yet, but we're certainly going to pay attention to it and we are monitoring it. We do get a number of questions from our investors on that subject matter, but it's a bit early to say with any confidence that there's any real impact from this potential Brexit matter."

There is a variety of different -- obviously, Western Europe is clearly a fully deregulated telecom market. And so it is -- it does -- network density is something that does really benefit customers in a similar way, but they started from a place where interconnection was really sort of, as Keith earlier referenced, sort of packed in and not really clearly delineated as part of the value proposition. And so it's been a bit of a journey for us in terms of being more clear with customers about the distinctive and extraordinary value they're getting from cross connects. And so whether or not you could achieve the same level that we do now, which are in the north of 20% in the U.S., it's hard to tell. But I do think that we certainly continue to see upside opportunity in both regions to meaningfully improve those, both through quantity and price levers that are available to us. And so I think they'll filter north for sure. Whether or not they can get to those same levels, I don't know, but I think they can go meaningfully higher than where they are today."

So frankly, what we've told you on a constant currency basis that organic business can grow greater than 13.4%. Now as you recognize Q1 when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, it's 16%. And so we're stepping -- we're effectively stepping that down in the second quarter to a midpoint of guidance of roughly 2.6% growth quarter-over-quarter. If you're looking at top end of the range, 2.9% quarter-over-quarter growth. 60 basis points of that is coming from the fact that right now we're assuming that nonrecurring revenue will be $5.5 million less in Q2 than it was in Q1. And so number one, there's an element of what's going on in the nonrecurring space. Number two, when we look at that sort of the second half of the year, one of the things we're really given, given the level of activity and other matters are affecting the combination of the businesses between Bit-isle, Telecity and our self, we're very much -- we're being very disciplined in what we want the future guidance to be. Right now, we're leaving it as greater than 13.4%. And that's really a reflection of there's a lot of activity that's taking place in the company right now. And because of that, we want to make sure we're continuing to have a relatively conservative view on what it means for the back half of the year. Notwithstanding the fact that we are working very hard, as I said, to integrate the businesses. And between the integration of the businesses and running the organic business, we're optimistic that we can continue to scale the business or to grow the business on a year-over-year basis greater than that 13.4%.

First and foremost, it's the size of the deals that we have looked at. The average size of deal that we did this quarter is a lot greater than the averages that we saw in the prior quarters. So that's number one. We didn't do a lot of what I'd call larger footprint deals in the quarter. Number two, as you know, we've rolled out a new basic quote-to-cash platform. And that quote-to-cash platform is putting more -- is putting a little bit of what's new -- is new in the system. It's different for our customers. It's different for our employees. And so as we continue to refine, if you will, our platform, we think that, that's going to continue to increase the number of cabinet adds. Number three, I would tell you that our pipeline or our backlog is -- more particularly the backlog, is higher than it has been before. And as a result, there's that, that going to give us confidence that it's going to come into the revenue stream and ultimately to the billing cabinets. And then the fourth thing I would say is, look, this is an area that we've seen before. It generally relates to things that happen near our end of quarter. Churn is a perfect example. Last quarter, as you recall, we referred to a U.K.-based churn, a relatively large churn that would affect not only our churn MRR metric, but also affects the number of cabinets because the customer is effectively there for the entire quarter and then it churns out and so you lose those cabinets. No different this quarter. We had a number of churn activities that happened at the back end of the quarter. And they were cabinet dense, and as a result, it reduced the overall level of cabinets billing. Bottom line is, we're optimistic that you're going to see that number rebound. We've seen it before, this pattern, and it's something that we'd anticipate changes as we look to the latter part of the year. The one thing that you can get great confidence in is irrespective of what that number is because it's a calculated metric, we are continuing to drive our revenues up. And you can see by the guidance that we provided that we would expect to deliver $22 million of incremental revenue Q2 over Q1, which is a strong indication that we've got a number of billing cabinets in the system."

Thank you, Katrina, and good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We had a great start to 2016, delivering both revenue and adjusted EBITDA above the top end of our guidance ranges as demand for interconnected colocation continues to drive strong performance across all 3 of our regions. 
As depicted on Slide 3, revenues were $844.2 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 16% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $380.7 million for the quarter, up 4% over the prior quarter and up 17% year-over-year on an organic and constant currency basis. This drove AFFO growth of 35% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. 
For the quarter, we delivered strong gross and net bookings, with solid production from both our direct and indirect channels as we scale our go-to-market efforts. Our key operating metrics demonstrate the strength of our ecosystem-centric business model with firm MRR per cabinet, low churn and a healthy interconnection growth. 
Our global platform continues to be a critical source of differentiation, making us the partner of choice for customers looking to respond effectively to increasingly distributed infrastructure requirements. Our reach is allowing us to gain market share while tapping into higher-growth markets, with EMEA and Asia Pacific now contributing greater than 50% of our revenues and our geographic reach stretching across 21 countries and 40 metros. 
We are pleased with the Telecity acquisition and are excited to add this great set of quality assets and people to the platform -- to Platform Equinix. With less than 90 days under our belt, we are already seeing healthy momentum in cross-platform bookings and are making rapid progress on integration despite the significance size and complexity of this transaction. 
Overall, the Telecity assets delivered solid financial performance consistent with our guidance for revenue and adjusted EBITDA while absorbing efforts related to the deal close and the planned divestitures. We see the anticipated revenue synergies materializing and are tracking well to our expected cost and CapEx synergies, all of which is a great validation of the deal rationale.
Bit-isle is also progressing well, tracking above our prior guidance with several strategic wins enabled by these new assets. Our integration efforts are on track, and our plans to optimize the business remain ahead of schedule. As we integrate these 2 acquisitions, we expect to achieve a combined $30 million in annual cost savings, with about 50% of these savings realized before the end of this year and the remainder in 2017. 
With Telecity and Bit-isle, we now serve over 8,000 customers and are proud that over 150 of the Fortune 500 are Equinix customers. We have increased our already market-leading network density from 1,100 to over 1,400 networks and have added a number of critical new cloud nodes to Platform Equinix. 
We are extending our value proposition as the home of the interconnected cloud with industry-leading providers such as AWS, Microsoft and Google, contributing directly to the increase in our enterprise business by enabling enterprise CIOs to quickly and cost-effectively implement multicloud architectures. 
Our cloud and enterprise verticals, which represent 28% and 13% of our revenues, respectively, remain our fastest-growing market segments and contributed the highest number of new customer additions for the sixth quarter in a row. 
Interconnection revenue grew a healthy 19% year-over-year on an organic and constant currency basis. With over 176,000 cross connects and significant growth on our Internet and our Cloud Exchange, Equinix is benefiting from strong secular trends that are driving businesses to become increasingly interconnected. We run the largest Internet exchange globally with 5.5 terabits of peak traffic growing 30% year-over-year as networks and cloud providers continue to upgrade their capacity. 
Given our high utilization rate of 80% and strong returns on development capital, we continue to expand in core markets heavily weighted towards existing campuses in Tier 1 market -- metros, which exhibit strong pipelines and attractive supply-demand profiles. We now have 16 announced expansion projects underway, and this quarter, we are moving forward with additional expansions in Silicon Valley, New York and Hong Kong, totaling over $200 million of CapEx. 
In Silicon Valley, demand remains robust, and we are building SV10, a new IBX located directly adjacent to our Great Oaks campus, home to a rich ecosystem of networking cloud hubs and the second-largest peering market in the U.S. after our Ashburn campus in Northern Virginia. Notably, for SV10, we purchased the 11 acres of land for this project, expanding our asset ownership in this important market. 
In New York, we are proceeding with the second phase of New York 5, the flagship asset on our Secaucus campus, which is comprised of 4 adjacent data centers with over 10,000 cabinets and is a key growth engine for our Americas business. New York 5 saw a strong pull-through post the deployment of BATS trading engine and is also seeing solid demand from the broader financial services community as they embrace hybrid cloud. Our first phase of New York 5 project is already 85% full with strong pricing.
Our capital investments continue to deliver very healthy growth as well as strong returns across our new expansion and stabilized IBXs as shown on Slide 4. The operating performance of our 70 stabilized global IBXs delivered steady revenue growth of 7%, an increase over the prior quarter, while generating a 31% cash on cash return on the gross PP&E invested, reflecting the tremendous economic value of these stabilized campuses. 
Stabilized assets include projects that have been open for more than 1 year with all phases built out. As we shift to 2016, a net 3 IBXs were added to this category and utilization of these assets remains a healthy 86%.  
Let me now cover quarterly highlights from our industry verticals, and I'll start with the networks. This vertical experienced strong bookings, driven by multisite expansions with Tier 1 service providers and new wins with Tier 2 providers and cable operators who are shifting their portfolios to address demand for IP and digital services. 
We are seeing a resurgence of subsea cable projects to support global cloud deployments and growth of international data traffic, which are creating new opportunities for Equinix. There are more than 50 global submarine cable projects under consideration over the coming 2 years, which places Equinix in a great position to win a portion of this next generation of submarine cable investment.
In the content digital media vertical, performance was driven by expansions from both traditional lighthouse content providers and our Ad-IX ecosystem. Advertisers continue to optimize user experience while architecting for increasing traffic volumes driven by the explosive growth of mobile advertising. Customer wins included Content Bridge, a supply chain management digital right service provider, and Grapeshot, an innovative provider of analytics and keyword targeting. 
The financial services vertical experienced the second highest bookings of all time, with strength across insurance, electronic payments, trading and retail banking. We also saw a sharp growth in Performance Hub deployments as financial services enterprise continue to re-architect their IT. Customer wins included Dutch Bank, ABN AMRO, a 3-region expansion by Thomson Reuters for electronic trading and EP2, an Australian provider of digital payment solutions leveraging the Equinix Cloud Exchange.
The cloud and IT services vertical experienced strong bookings across all regions this quarter, including strategic wins with leading Software-as-a-Service providers, furthering our cloud density objectives. Cloud services adoption continues with over 370 enterprises, clouds, IT service providers and networks interconnecting on Cloud Exchange in addition to the healthy growth in direct connect activity to cloud providers. Customer wins included Pure Storage, a cloud scale data platform providing hybrid cloud data management for Microsoft Azure; and Blue Jeans, an enterprise video cloud provider enabling direct access via Cloud Exchange. 
And finally, turning to the enterprise, this vertical delivered strong bookings, driven by manufacturing, travel and government wins as enterprises leverage our global platform, both directly and through our growing base of Equinix partners to re-architect their infrastructure. Over 370 customers have deployed our Performance Hub solution, which helps enterprises optimize their network architectures, access the cloud and drive application performance.
Customer wins, included Nucor, a Fortune 200 steel manufacturer, leveraging Equinix to solve for hybrid cloud connectivity, and AVANT Homes, a residential and commercial property development firm. 
We are growing our enterprise customer base at an accelerated pace as CIOs adopt an interconnected-oriented architecture as shown on Slide 5. 
IOA is a blueprint to help CIOs re-architect their IT delivery to better interconnect people, locations, clouds and data. Leveraging our global data center footprint and multi-cloud interconnection capabilities, interconnection-oriented architectures represent a fundamental shift away from centralized legacy enterprise IT models to distributed and dynamic models. 
Direct interconnectivity enables enterprises to react in real time, adapt quickly to change and leverage digital ecosystems to create new value and growth. Enterprises are increasingly looking to Equinix as they embark on this journey, moving away from in-house data centers in order to leverage multi-cloud architectures placed closer to users and their customers. We believe this trend will continue to significantly increase our opportunities within this market segment. 
So let me stop there and turn it over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter."
28202,330928820,974986,"Equinix, Inc. (REIT), Equinix, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Equinix, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone. So our first quarter represents a great start to 2016. We continued to deliver top line growth, expand margins and drive sales across our expanded platform. We had strong bookings in each of our regions,",1560,"Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone. So our first quarter represents a great start to 2016. We continued to deliver top line growth, expand margins and drive sales across our expanded platform. 
We had strong bookings in each of our regions, including solid cross-region execution. This quarter, we were able to benefit from record 3 region deployments across all of our segments as customers leverage our geographic reach. Including recent acquisitions, greater than 53% of our revenues come from customers deployed globally across all 3 regions and over 81% from customers deployed across multiple metros.
Our interconnection additions remained very positive, adding another 5,600 net cross connects and almost 180 exchange ports in the quarter. This is the seventh quarter in a row where we've added greater than 5,000 cross connects in a quarter. Interconnection revenues represent 16% of our global recurring revenues. 
Moving to acquisitions. We've seen early momentum from both the Telecity and Bit-isle businesses, delivering against our guidance expectations while progressing well towards our expected synergy targets. The Internet -- the integration efforts are well underway. We've selected the senior leadership team for the EMEA business, who are in the advanced stages of aligning our sales and delivery teams. 
Cross-selling across the combined platform is taking root. And after we divest of the 8 assets held for sale, we believe that we'll be able to accelerate our sales efforts as customers decide the optimum location to deploy their infrastructure. In addition, we've reduced our expected 2016 integration spend to $55 million. These costs will support our significant systems work, employee severance and retention costs and a substantial organizational restructuring cost related to our REIT and other tax initiatives. As it relates to the 8 assets held for sale, we remain on track to divest these assets by mid-2016.
Now as it relates to our full year guidance, the weakening U.S. dollar has provided us significant FX tailwinds. And this uptick, along with better-than-expected operating performance in the first quarter, allows us to increase our revenue guidance with flow-through benefits to both EBITDA and AFFO. 
Our updated annual revenue guidance continues to include flat nonrecurring revenues compared to the prior year as well as refining our annual view related to the Telecity business as we continue to work through the divestiture process and complete our integration efforts and have further visibility into their data. 
So turning to the first quarter. As depicted on Slide 6, Global Q1 revenues were 842 -- $844.2 million, up 3% over the prior quarter and 16% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis, our 53rd straight quarter of top line growth. As our -- our as-reported revenues include $119 million from acquisitions, consistent with our expectations. 
Q1 revenues net of our FX hedges include a $3.3 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter and a $1.4 million positive currency benefit when compared to our FX guidance rates due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar. 
For Europe, we've hedged approximately 80% of our Equinix organic business. Global adjusted EBITDA was $380.7 million, up 4% over the prior quarter and 17% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis, above prior guidance due to revenue flow-through, lower SG&A and innovation costs. 
Our as-reported EBITDA includes $52 million of contribution from our acquisitions as well as $13 million in integration costs. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 45.1% or 46.9% on an organic and constant currency basis. Our Q1 adjusted EBITDA performance net of FX hedges reflects a negative $3.8 million currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter and a $1.3 million negative impact when compared to our FX guidance rates.
Global AFFO was $210 million, including $64 million loss related to the Telecity hedge. Excluding the Telecity foreign currency loss and integration cost, AFFO on a normalized basis and constant currency increased 20% over the prior quarter to $287 million, tracking above the top end of our guidance range largely due to the business performance and lower-than-expected taxes and interest expense. 
As we continue to focus on value creation per share, upon the maturity of the remaining portion of our convertible -- our June '16 convertible debt instrument, we have elected to receive the proceeds from the related cap call in the form of shares, thereby reducing the net dilution from this debt instrument by approximately 400,000 shares.
Moving to churn. Global MRR churn for Q1 was 2.2% or 2.1% on an organic basis, consistent with our prior guidance. We continue to expect our quarterly MRR churn rate to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% quarterly. 
And one final note before I discuss the regional performance. Our nonfinancial metric sheet and supplemental, including our segment IBX reporting, will not include the acquisitions until early next year as we work to integrate their unit metrics and results into our financial systems.
And now I'd like to provide a few highlights on the regions, whose full results are covered on Slides 7 through 9. Our global platform continues to expand with EMEA and Asia Pacific growing organic and constant currency growth over the same quarter last year of 17% and 25%, respectively, while the Americas region produced steady growth of 13%. 
We added over 1,500 cabinets, down from the prior quarter due to timing of installs and churn, and we expect a more normalized net cabinets billing increase next quarter. MRR per cabinet was firm at $1,970, up $11 on a constant currency basis. 
The Americas region had another strong quarter, delivering solid bookings from the network and financial verticals, an increasing yield per cabinet and the second-best interconnection quarter of all time. EMEA delivered a solid quarter of bookings with particular strength in the Dutch and German markets while absorbing higher churn in the U.K. at the end of last quarter. 
Asia Pacific continued a steady growth with Tokyo and Hong Kong as the fastest-growing markets driven by cloud and content verticals. Interconnection revenues continued to outpace overall growth of the business with the Americas, APAC and EMEA interconnection revenues now at 23%, 13% and 8%, respectively, of recurring revenues. 
EMEA's interconnection revenues declined as a percent of the region's recurring revenue as the region absorbed the Telecity results. It is our intention to increase interconnection revenues as a percent of this region's recurring revenues over the medium and longer term.
And now looking at the balance sheet, please refer to Slide 10. Unrestricted cash and investments decreased this quarter to $650 million, largely due to the closing of the Telecity acquisition on January 15. Our net debt leverage ratio stepped up to 4.3x our Q1 annualized adjusted EBITDA, although we expect to return to our range of 3 to 4x adjusted EBITDA over the next 12 to 18 months. 
Now switching to AFFO and dividends on Slide 11. For 2016, we're raising our as-reported AFFO to be greater than $1 billion -- sorry, $1.015 billion, a 22% year-over-year increase. On a normalized basis, AFFO would be greater than $1.134 billion or at 28% constant currency increase over prior year. 
Adjusting for the $6 million of interest earned on the convertible debt through the first half of the year, our fully diluted AFFO per share would be $16.13 using a weighted average 70.7 million shares outstanding, as presented on Page 34 of the earnings deck. 
Also today, we announced our Q2 dividend of $1.75 a share, consistent with our Q1 quarterly dividend. Our AFFO payout ratio is now expected to be approximately 49% for 2016. 
Now looking at capital expenditures. Please refer to Slide 12. For the quarter, CapEx was $198 million, including recurring CapEx of $32 million, below our guidance due to timing of cash payments to our contractors. 
With respect to our newbuilds, during the quarter, we opened Tokyo 5 IBX, our 10th IBX in the Tokyo Metro, taking into consideration Bit-isle's 5 assets in Tokyo. Tokyo 5 is located near the financial district and proximate to our existing network-dense Tokyo 3 IBX. 
We've tethered these 2 assets together, thereby allowing our Tokyo 5 customers to access the rich set of networks in Tokyo 3. And given our current high utilization rate of 80%, the strong development returns, we continue to invest across many key markets with new IBX builds scheduled to open in the next year, including Amsterdam, São Paulo, Silicon Valley and Sydney, in addition to the expansion phases in Ashburn, Atlanta, Dublin, Frankfurt, Hong Kong and Warsaw.
Also, we will continue to purchase and develop land, including our recently purchased Silicon Valley land parcels. Over time, we expect revenues from our own sites to increase. Owned properties generate 30% -- 38% of the organic recurring revenues or 34% of our revenues on a combined basis as the acquisitions have a higher percent of leased sites. 
Including acquisitions, over 85% of our recurring revenue is generated by either owned properties or properties where our lease expiration extends to 2029 or beyond. And finally, we've provided you a number of slides that bridge our 2016 guidance from the normalized 2015 performance, including slides for revenues, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Please refer to these slides on Slides 13 through 16. I'll turn the call back to Steve."

Thanks, Keith. And finally, on Slide 17, which summarizes our Q2 and our full year 2016 guidance, which includes our FX impacts, let me now cover our updated 2016 outlook.
For the full year of 2016, we are raising our revenue guidance to be greater than $3.595 billion, 32% growth on an as-reported basis or an organic and constant currency growth rate of greater than 13.4% compared to the prior year. This $45 million revenue increase includes a $42 million positive foreign currency benefit when compared to the prior guidance rates and a $3 million increase due to stronger Q1 operating performance.
For 2016, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to be greater than $1.65 billion, a 30% increase on an as-reported basis or a greater than 16% year-over-year growth rate on an organic and constant currency basis. This $30 million adjusted EBITDA increase includes an $18 million positive foreign currency benefit when compared to prior guidance rates and $9 million increase due to Q1 operating performance and $3 million in lower-than-expected integration costs.
And the growth of our business is driving increased adjusted funds from operations and ultimately, cash flow and dividends. We are raising AFFO to be greater than $1.134 billion, normalized for the Telecity transaction-related FX loss and integration costs, a 28% constant currency growth compared to the prior year. This $56 million AFFO increase includes a $14 million positive foreign currency benefit when compared to the prior guidance rates, a $20 million -- $29 million reduction in interest and tax costs and better-than-expected operating performance and lower integration costs. And finally, we expect 2016 capital expenditures to continue to range between $900 million and $1 billion for the year.
So in closing, Platform Equinix is the critical intersection point between clouds, networks and the enterprise, and this opportunity is translating into solid revenue growth, firm yield and healthy returns on our stabilized and expansion IBXs. Our platform continues to scale organically, and we are progressing well with our strategic acquisitions, positioning us to extend our market leadership, enhance our cloud and network density and grow our customer ecosystems. So let me stop here, and we'll open it up to questions. So over to you, Carrie."

So we have worked very hard, as you know, the people on his phone know, to populate our facilities around the world with access points, network nodes, cash nodes, whatever you want to call them, to make it very easy for enterprises of all shapes and sizes to find these cloud providers and buy those services as a service. And so that is happening as a thesis, has -- continues to prove itself and as the numbers continue to show you, enterprises is growing at the highest rate. Now the marketing teams and the sales teams around the world are pursuing different industry verticals in different countries. So we are building use cases and success stories across multiple industry verticals. There's probably a dozen where we have different use cases being built and they vary by region and by country. The demand is pretty standard around the world. It probably parallels the growth rates that we see. We're growing the fastest in Asia, followed by Europe followed by the Americas. So I would say enterprise, particularly global enterprises are demanding footprint across all the big markets and all the big -- across all 3 regions. So it's pretty steady demand, pretty steady demand, and it's underpinning most of our new logo accumulation. But Charles, I don't know. Would you add anything?"

But there are some variations country to country in terms of cloud adoption. I would say that, for example, Australia tends to be an outlier on the high side, being receptive to cloud and hybrid cloud as an architecture of choice. And -- but we're seeing good, solid demand across all 3 regions."

And so I think most of the industry analyst data points suggest that high-teens today is enterprises that are taking advantage of cloud offerings, and that will move over the coming 4 years to 50%, 60% of the workloads. Certainly in the conversations that we're having, that's very -- that's a very common conversation. I would tell you that we hear security requirements. We heard cloud requirements. We hear big data requirements and we are hearing the early signs of IoT plans with enterprises, trying to figure out how to instrument and monitor and measure all these data that they're creating to try to monetize this. So there's certainly plenty of trends from the enterprise across these big segments that we're all reading about in these reports."

And I guess I'd just offer and add that what we're seeing is that hybrid cloud adoption is accelerating. And in fact, I think we look at interconnection-oriented architectures as essentially a mechanism by which these enterprise CIOs are allowing them to do more with less, and that's a key priority for them. And if you look at adoption rates, IDC says that 65% of enterprises are going to be committed to hybrid and multi-cloud by the end of this year. And so we're seeing a very rapid clip of adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud and a real resonance to interconnection-oriented architecture. And while they may be -- their overall spend levels may be reducing because they're not spending as much on traditional IT spend categories, I think that the hybrid cloud enablement in that area is actually increasing in total spend, at least from what we're seeing with the enterprise customers that we're serving."

So what does that mean in terms of the availability of growth to the business over the next few quarters? And what does that mean for future capital? Should we expect capital to accelerate, to give you more capacity, which will naturally push that utilization down?

First, as it relates to nonrecurring, we did see a little bit of an uptick this quarter. One of the things that we started the year with, Mike, as you know, is we took a very strong view because of the amount of nonrecurring business we did in fiscal year '15 and the number of meaningful deployments we did across our platform, we made a conscious decision because they do come in ebbs and flows to hold that flat for fiscal year '16. Now you saw a little bit of a step-up in the Q1 results. That's just a reflection of the lumpiness, if you will, of the nonrecurring activity. As I then sort of take it into Q2, we are assuming that the nonrecurring activity will go down quarter-over-quarter, partly because of what we see in our pipeline and partly it's what's -- not what's just in the pipeline, what's in our backlog. So we expect that we'll reduce our nonrecurring revenues by roughly $5.5 million next quarter or roughly 60 basis points of growth. So that -- that gives you a sense. Again, we still look to do a lot of it, again, and hold it at the same level as '15, but we will see -- we'll see it move around quarter-over-quarter. As it relates to utilization levels, yes, no surprise. We are running at higher levels. We've had a tremendous amount of success over a number of quarters. And when you see that success and also the incremental cabinets billing, that's a clear indication that we're filling up our assets, and it suggests that we're going to have to continue to put capital to work. There are certainly some markets that are more constrained than others. Charles was great in alluding to the Tokyo market, whereby through the acquisition of Bit-isle, we got a very large asset, which will allow us to delay any meaningful future spend in Japan for some time period. Yes, there's other markets where we talked about it on the last earnings call where we're now going to do what we call first-phase builds, which come with a much larger capital deployment in that initial phase. Silicon Valley is a perfect example, the one that Steve alluded to. And there's São Paulo as well and Sydney 4 and the like. So we are continuing to make sure we manage ourselves. I want to leave you with a couple of thoughts on how we manage our CapEx. We go through a very detailed exercise. We're looking 5 years out. We're looking across markets and IBXs to make sure we understand what our fill rates are, what is the empirical data telling us and what does that imply against our future expectations, understanding what competitive landscapes like in each of those markets or specific to that IBX. And so when we do that, if we look out 5 years, we have a pretty good view on what we think we could spend. So then in conclusion, to go back -- to address your final question, we are very much aware of what our capital spend is. As you know, that can ebb and flow based on our performance, knowing that your lead times are going to be anywhere from 9 months to 18 months depending on whether it's an incremental phase or a new build. That's going to dictate what the capital dollars are, but there is an expectation that we will continue to spend at these levels for a period of time given the demand that we see in the marketplace. I will say one last thing, which I think is important. One of the things that we want to do is continue to see our utilization go up, but we recognize that you're at a point where you don't want to constrain the business. There's certainly some markets where we feel a little bit more constrained today than we'd otherwise like to feel. And so we need to put the capital to work in those markets. Silicon Valley comes to mind again as a critical market where we're very eager to get out that -- to put up that Silicon Valley 10 asset because left unchecked, it will put a constraint on our ability to grow. But we feel we're in a great position to deliver the inventory on a fairly, what I'd say, just-in-time basis."

One is your question, Mike, around sort of growth and what the utilization implies. If you look at our stabilized assets chart, delivered 7%, I think, was what this quarter was. And what you'll see there is actually we've seen that -- we see that bounce around a little bit, just pretty good quarter and on a constant currency basis have seen even better quarters. And so you see that the stabilized assets still have meaningful growth potential in them even at quite high utilization rates. And then the second point I'd make is that we are making a very purposeful push to phase our capital as best as possible. And so we're trying to be as innovative as possible in phasing our capital, and that is going to have a natural tendency to sort of pressure utilization up a bit, which is a good thing as long as we still have the flexibility to respond and not go dark in a market. And so that's the balance we are striking, and I do think kudos to our engineering and construction teams for really phasing our capital in ways that are allowing us to still be responsive with higher levels of utilization."

And then second, I guess, I don't know who this will be for, if Charles is on the line, maybe for you. But if there's one kind of fear that people may have, it's that as the public cloud gets more reliable, more secure, that it has the potential to accommodate a growing share of all the outsourced applications that are existing, and that slowly the public-private hybrid cloud becomes a little less private and a little bit more public and it creates a cannibalization risk. Could you kind of talk about how you view that issue and if there's any evidence that it's happening in any way inside the Equinix facilities today?"

Let me start in the public cloud question and then Charles can jump in here on that and maybe give you an update on Telecity. Very good question. I know the big concern would be, is everything going to move to public? And is there going to be a need for the type of stuff that hosting and managed services and colo providers are providing. The world that we see unfolding and certainly all the industry analysts and all the customers we talk to certainly supports the thesis that the hybrid cloud, customers needing access to public Internet capability, which has always been there at Equinix for years and years and years is not going to go away. We've been working very hard the last 4 or 5 years working with all the cloud providers to provide this private connectivity to give the combination of the 2, which in our language gives you the hybrid capability to be able to move your traffic around the world is continuing to build and unfold. And most of the documentation, writings today suggest that public cloud is going to continue to grow from high teens to, like I said, earlier, 40%, 50%, 60% of workloads going to the public cloud. And the thing that I think people get confused about, even the big public cloud providers who build their big data centers and build their back-office facilities all over the world, still require the Equinixes of the world and the other data center providers of the world for the distributed part of their network because they're not terribly interested in putting capital in 40 different markets and 20 different countries, and so they're going to take advantage of the capacity that's out there with the Equinixes of the world to build the hub-and-spoke, if you will, or build the centralized and decentralized network to run these cloud offerings. Because users are all over the world, customers are all over the world, latency is a big factor, and that's why you see the continued rollout of public-private connectivity and capability. I don't know what you'd add to that Charles."

So we absolutely see that. We embrace it. And in fact, our platform is really facilitating it. And so I think if I were a commodity provider of colocation, we'd be very worried about that substitution, but that's not really the business we're in. We're in the business of enabling that hybrid cloud connectivity. One through -- via the CSPs and so the supply side of the cloud ecosystem is very relevant for us. And in fact, our top 6 customers are all delivering cloud services using Platform Equinix as some portion of their architecture to do so. And so it's a big opportunity for us. And then we see a big basket -- a very big basket of enterprise workloads that we believe will sort of reside in the private infrastructure side of things and really be implemented in the sort of hybrid cloud, multi-cloud setup. And so for us, we think it's very much a net positive, but I do believe that this trend you're talking about for cloud service providers becoming increasingly capable is real and will affect, I think, the broader data center market. And then let me circle back to Telecity now and I'll give you sort of a quick update and anybody can add color as they wish. We're less than 90 days into the post-combination world. And I'd tell you as a headline, we remain very optimistic and thoroughly convinced of the rationale for that transaction. Deal really cements our leadership in EMEA, 34 new locations and 7 new metros, 6 new countries, a material improvement in our network density, which was already market-leading in EMEA. And we add a number of really critical cloud nodes to our platform. Of note would be the new Telecity locations in Dublin, which are a great addition for us and seeing significant demand. And overall, we're really delighted with the quality assets and people that we've added to the team. As we said in our prepared remarks, a lot of progress on the integration. We've announced a senior leadership team, well advanced in aligning and cross-training the sales and delivery teams, well advanced in our rebranding plan of taking all the steps we needed to be fully REIT compliant. And as I said, we're already seeing cross-platform opportunities, both in the form of Telecity customers with an interest in Equinix facilities, but a bit more so right now of our Equinix customers really seeing opportunities to purchase capacity in the Telecity sites. And I think we're seeing more in that directionally because we have a larger force selling that on the Equinix side, and we're working through the sort of natural distractions of a team going through an integration on the Telecity side. So -- but we feel good about the synergies. We actually think we're going to exceed the synergy estimates that we had previously provided. All that's baked into the guidance you see here today. And again, we do think there is, over time, meaningful, meaningful revenue synergies as well as the cost synergies, which I said I think we'll exceed and the CapEx synergies that are allowing us to defer some investment in EMEA."

If you look at the organic churn in Q1 though, we're roughly 2.1%, consistent with where we think there's a natural churn level in and around that level in the organic business, where you're seeing slightly increased churn is attributed to the Bit-isle business. What we talked about in the last earnings call was effectively Bit-isle. Part of the reason that we felt comfortable holding their revenues flat relative to -- for '16 over '15 was the fact that they did have this increased level of churn. Now having said all of that, coming out of our prior guidance, the Bit-isle team did a little bit better than we originally anticipated. It's more so in their other services and less in their colocation business. But suffice it to say, between what they're doing in the colocation business and what they're performing in the managed services business, there's a direct correlation between what they do in managed services and the pull-through to colo. So Phil, we're very excited about their performance to date, and we continue to focus on very much optimizing that acquisition.

What is sort of the composition of that?"

Generally, I would say that the company has had a fairly consistent strategy in the marketplace, so probably not a dramatic set of changes in the product portfolios there, but we are in the process of taking those and aligning the product portfolios. I will say that as Keith commented on, we have -- interconnection is a very central part of how we go to market and how we position with customers. And so it's really -- it's an -- it's critical that we -- we have a great track record of getting the value, delivering great value to our customers through cross connects and through interconnection. And we also have a great track record of making sure that we get value back in the form of how that's priced. And so needless to say, we'll maintain that strategy and we'll implement it within the Telecity environment over time because I think our customers are really getting superior value from that. So -- but we're in the process of figuring out what that implies in terms of aligning the product portfolios. We're well advanced in that effort and I think we'll start to see the results of that over the coming quarters."

As it relates to Telecity, Charles alluded to a number of the points. We're certainly going to look to what are the opportunities on the top line on driving incremental revenue attached to alignment of our product portfolio and the like. And we are very confident, albeit we've said there's only modest revenue attachment to that this year, but we're very confident that, that will continue to be something that will drive value going forward. As it relates to the cost side, that's the $30 million we referred to. We talked about $15 million this year, $15 million in 2017. Again, we're optimistic that we're not only going to be able to get that number, but we'll get beyond that number. Again, I'm reticent to give you the exact numbers just yet because given the lack of visibility that we had into the numbers prior to January 15, we're still doing a lot of work, as we said, to align the sales and delivery organizations as well as all of the back office. But again, I want you to walk away being confident that we see some incremental benefit. As it relates to the below-the-line activity, more specifically around taxes, again, we think of our tax structure as a competitive advantage. And no surprise to you as we then deploy that structure across our portfolio, that will generate benefits to our shareholders. And so we're excited about that as well. Now the other thing I would say is, recognizing that Telecity, we're in the business of investing in this business. And so what we want to make sure is that we continue to invest alongside it. So we're managing the synergies with continuing to drive value into the asset and expand that portfolio, consistent with what Equinix's expectations would be. As it relates to Bit-isle, that one, there's less synergies perhaps, but overall, a greater opportunity to fill up their -- sorry, less cost synergies, pardon me, but a greater opportunity to enjoy revenue synergies because of the underutilization of their assets. And that's where we're really excited about the opportunity, coupled with some other ways that we think we can optimize the overall business. Again, we want to be a little bit reserved in our comments right now as we continue to think about our strategy. But overall, in the next few quarters, you'll hear us talk more firmly about what's happening in the Bit-isle integration."

We have a strong client service management team that's applied to each of the customers to understand what their combined footprint looks like. They continue to get the service levels that they are contracted for and expect from both of those. Obviously, it doesn't come necessarily without any hiccups, but we have client service managers that are applied to those accounts to deal with issues as they arise. And that's -- so that's how we're doing in terms of customers that are keeping or maintaining a footprint between both facilities. In some cases, a more challenging one might be where we are actually separating out the assets associated with the divestiture. And that is a more complicated process in that sort of perhaps against their will to some degree, a customer may be sort of splitting their implementation now between Equinix and between the eventual buyers of the Cheetah assets. That is a delicate customer communication. It's one that we would prefer have not to have had to do, but it was -- unfortunately, the European Commission didn't cooperate in that regard. And so it's simply a matter of us being clear and consistent with the communications to the customer and then stepping -- and then standing up, what we refer to -- standing up to a divestiture organization or the divested organization to be fully capable or responding to that. What I would say is we spent an enormous amount of money to make sure that, that divestiture goes out in a way that makes it readily operable on Day 1 to serve those customer needs."

We, as a company, when we see the performance of the business, I would say there's nothing meaningful that would indicate that we're seeing a slowdown. I think the challenge that when we talked about -- we had a commentary on Telecity more trending towards the lower end of the range. That's really more associated with the fact that we're taking 2 organizations, we're putting them together. When we gave our initial guidance, we didn't have the data and the visibility we have. Now we're just refining our numbers because we have much more clarity on what we think we can do as a business, but at the same time aligning our sales force and delivery teams to meet the expectation. I think the other thing again, Steve and Charles, I think both alluded to the fact that because we have the benefit of being able to import many of these global deals into markets, and London being one of our stronger market, we see that as an opportunity. And the number of 3-region deals that are in our pipeline today, perhaps not scientifically, but I would say it's probably larger than we've seen in a long time. And so that gives us confidence with London and Amsterdam being some key nodes on those typical global deployments. That continues to be an opportunity for us. So overall, I wouldn't say anything meaningful yet, but we're certainly going to pay attention to it and we are monitoring it. We do get a number of questions from our investors on that subject matter, but it's a bit early to say with any confidence that there's any real impact from this potential Brexit matter."

There is a variety of different -- obviously, Western Europe is clearly a fully deregulated telecom market. And so it is -- it does -- network density is something that does really benefit customers in a similar way, but they started from a place where interconnection was really sort of, as Keith earlier referenced, sort of packed in and not really clearly delineated as part of the value proposition. And so it's been a bit of a journey for us in terms of being more clear with customers about the distinctive and extraordinary value they're getting from cross connects. And so whether or not you could achieve the same level that we do now, which are in the north of 20% in the U.S., it's hard to tell. But I do think that we certainly continue to see upside opportunity in both regions to meaningfully improve those, both through quantity and price levers that are available to us. And so I think they'll filter north for sure. Whether or not they can get to those same levels, I don't know, but I think they can go meaningfully higher than where they are today."

So frankly, what we've told you on a constant currency basis that organic business can grow greater than 13.4%. Now as you recognize Q1 when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, it's 16%. And so we're stepping -- we're effectively stepping that down in the second quarter to a midpoint of guidance of roughly 2.6% growth quarter-over-quarter. If you're looking at top end of the range, 2.9% quarter-over-quarter growth. 60 basis points of that is coming from the fact that right now we're assuming that nonrecurring revenue will be $5.5 million less in Q2 than it was in Q1. And so number one, there's an element of what's going on in the nonrecurring space. Number two, when we look at that sort of the second half of the year, one of the things we're really given, given the level of activity and other matters are affecting the combination of the businesses between Bit-isle, Telecity and our self, we're very much -- we're being very disciplined in what we want the future guidance to be. Right now, we're leaving it as greater than 13.4%. And that's really a reflection of there's a lot of activity that's taking place in the company right now. And because of that, we want to make sure we're continuing to have a relatively conservative view on what it means for the back half of the year. Notwithstanding the fact that we are working very hard, as I said, to integrate the businesses. And between the integration of the businesses and running the organic business, we're optimistic that we can continue to scale the business or to grow the business on a year-over-year basis greater than that 13.4%.

First and foremost, it's the size of the deals that we have looked at. The average size of deal that we did this quarter is a lot greater than the averages that we saw in the prior quarters. So that's number one. We didn't do a lot of what I'd call larger footprint deals in the quarter. Number two, as you know, we've rolled out a new basic quote-to-cash platform. And that quote-to-cash platform is putting more -- is putting a little bit of what's new -- is new in the system. It's different for our customers. It's different for our employees. And so as we continue to refine, if you will, our platform, we think that, that's going to continue to increase the number of cabinet adds. Number three, I would tell you that our pipeline or our backlog is -- more particularly the backlog, is higher than it has been before. And as a result, there's that, that going to give us confidence that it's going to come into the revenue stream and ultimately to the billing cabinets. And then the fourth thing I would say is, look, this is an area that we've seen before. It generally relates to things that happen near our end of quarter. Churn is a perfect example. Last quarter, as you recall, we referred to a U.K.-based churn, a relatively large churn that would affect not only our churn MRR metric, but also affects the number of cabinets because the customer is effectively there for the entire quarter and then it churns out and so you lose those cabinets. No different this quarter. We had a number of churn activities that happened at the back end of the quarter. And they were cabinet dense, and as a result, it reduced the overall level of cabinets billing. Bottom line is, we're optimistic that you're going to see that number rebound. We've seen it before, this pattern, and it's something that we'd anticipate changes as we look to the latter part of the year. The one thing that you can get great confidence in is irrespective of what that number is because it's a calculated metric, we are continuing to drive our revenues up. And you can see by the guidance that we provided that we would expect to deliver $22 million of incremental revenue Q2 over Q1, which is a strong indication that we've got a number of billing cabinets in the system."

We had a great first half of 2016, delivering both revenues and adjusted EBITDA above the top end of our guidance range as our global scale and reach, strength of our digital ecosystems and service excellence continue to drive profitable growth. 
As depicted on Slide 3 of our presentation, second quarter revenues were $900.5 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 15% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant-currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $420.3 million for the quarter, up 5% over the prior quarter and up 18% year-over-year on an organic and constant-currency basis. This drove AFFO growth of 37% year-over-year on a normalized and constant-currency basis. 
We delivered strong growth in net bookings, with increasing contribution from our indirect channel. Our key operating metrics continue to be very healthy with firm MRR per cabinet, low churn and strong growth in both billable cabinet and interconnection. We continue to progress against key operational and business objectives in 2016 to grow our market position globally, generating on successful acquisition integration, sustained organic development and scaling our interconnection services. So let me provide some commentary in each of these in turn. 
Starting with acquisition. We are focusing our energy on successfully integrating Telecity and Bit-isle, scaling the business to drive even more value for our customers and enhancing our cloud and network density across EMEA and Asia. We've delivered against key integration goals and milestones and are pleased with the progress we have made in the first half. 
The Telecity business delivered solid financial performance despite normal integration challenges and complexity associated with the divestitures, and we are seeing value creation across a broad range of synergy categories. Our EMEA sales force has been fully integrated, and our cost selling program is tracking ahead of plan, with particular customer interest in the overlapping markets of London and Amsterdam and our new markets in Stockholm and Manchester. 
The financial and IT systems work is well underway, and we've defined the critical initiatives to operationally integrate our back op [ph] We have completed the first large systems conversion with the Telecity Dutch business now operating within the Equinix corporate systems and processes and plan to migrate the remaining countries through 2017. 
In early July, we also completed the sale of 8 European assets for $882 million, updated for FX as we required by the European  Commission as part of its approval of our purchase of Telecity Group. Completing this last milestone in the acquisition process paves the way for us to fully focus on selling our newly combined European platform. 
We're also pleased with Bit-isle's progress and the market reaction to the acquisition has been positive. The business is performing well, with cross-selling momentum accelerating including several wins with Japanese multinationals that are leveraging space and connectivity across existing and acquired sites. We are further optimizing this business by divesting 2 small noncore businesses, which we completed in the first half of 2016. We also expect to divest Terra Power, a collection of solar power assets in the second half of this year. 
Turning to our organic development activity. We continue to invest in expanding globally, allocating 95% of our expansion capital to building off-campus our existing market build or a deep knowledge of fill rate, pipeline and competitive supply to higher returns. We now have 19 announced expansion projects underway, and in this quarter, we are moving forward with additional expansions in Ashburn, Frankfurt, Paris and Singapore totaling over $250 million of capital expenditures. 
We are starting work on DC12, the first data center build in our Ashburn, in Northern Virginia, which is on 44 acres of owned, undeveloped land next to our current Ashburn North Campus. Today, Ashburn is one of our major campuses with over 14,000 cabinets across 10 IBX, and it's the largest Internet exchange point in North America. The new Ashburn North Campus, which we plan to develop over the next few years, will expand our asset ownership and effectively double our capacity in this important market. 
Turning to Frankfurt, we see continued demand in this vibrant market coming from Internet and cloud providers due to data sovereignty compliance as well as financial services growth. We are building Frankfurt 6, a new IBX located on owned land next to Frankfurt 4 and tethered to our core network hub in this market. 
These capital investments are delivering very healthy growth and strong returns as shown on Slide 4. Revenues from our 70 stabilized IBXs grew 8% year-over-year, above our historical trend line and largely driven by an increase in cross connect and power density. We continue to find ways to optimize our asset base, putting the right customer and application into the right assets, which drives a firm yield per cabinet. These stabilized assets are generating a 32% cash on cash return on the gross PP&E invested and utilization remains at a stable 86%. 
In terms of our asset ownership strategy, our goal is to produce over 50% from owned properties over time by developing land such as in Silicon Valley and Ashburn as well as purchasing additional site as it makes economic and strategic sense. Consistent with this strategy, we purchased our Paris 2 and 3 IBXs for $211 million from Digital Realty, which closed this week. 
Over 70 carriers reside in Paris 2 and 3 most densely connected data center campus in France. Ownership will enable us to achieve better operating costs, enhanced customer service and further expand this campus over time. The acquisition of Paris 2 and 3 is an example of where we can acquire assets and operate the property more efficiently for our own purpose, thereby allowing us to enjoy a higher return. With this purchase, 35% of our revenues now come from owned assets. 
Turning to interconnection. The need to build next-generation IT architectures that connect network, cloud, people and data continues to drive customer demand for interconnection. We now have 183,000 cross connects, and interconnection revenue grew 21% year-over-year on an organic and constant-currency basis. 
Interconnection revenues represent 16% of our global recurring revenues, and this is the eighth quarter in a row where we had a greater than 5,000 cross connects. We saw particularly strong growth in connections to cloud providers, with accelerated additions of participants and virtual circuit on our market-leading Cloud Exchange platform and strong sales of cross connect to facilitate direct connect into pure play cloud. 
Our Internet exchange continues to scale with 5.6 terabits of peak traffic, growing over 35% year-over-year as network and cloud providers upgrade their capacity and transition to 100-gig equipment. The transition to cloud continues to unfold as enterprises are re-architecting IT to drive down costs, improve performance and leverage clouds and network. 
We continue to see growth in Fortune 500 new customer and expansion wins as the explosion of data and devices are transforming how large multinationals architect their infrastructure leveraging interconnection as a core design principle. We added 7 new Fortune 500 customers in the quarter such as Ticketmaster, an online ticket vendor, leveraging Equinix to improve digital experience and integrate cloud infrastructure. We now have over 150 of the Fortune 500 customers and over 500 of the Global 2000. 
Now let me cover quarterly highlights from our industry vertical, starting with the network. This vertical experienced strong bookings, led by strength in Asia as wireline providers including Telstra, SingTel and Softbank expanded with multi-region deployment. We saw growth with regional Internet service providers including U.S. Internet Corp., a regional ISP peering to support growing enterprise cloud demand; and GCI, a regional telecom provider, adding cloud connectivity capabilities via our Cloud Exchange to augment their network service offering. 
Additionally, our strength as a global platform allows us to target strategic subsea cable projects to land within our ecosystem hub. And we are seeing pipeline and activity build in this growing segment including 2 new wins this quarter. Equinix is the biggest aggregator of digital ecosystems, making us the most logical choice for subsea cable operators to get the immediate benefit tapping into a mature ecosystem of buyers. 
The financial services vertical experienced continued expansion into our core electronic trading ecosystem as well as diversification into other subsegments. This quarter, we saw additional expansions from investment banks such as Morgan Stanley better leveraging Equinix for critical data center, network and cloud connectivity. We are also observing the beginning of clustering of electronic payment counterparties across regions, including the addition of Merchant Customer Exchange, a leading merchant payment system that is deployed to peer traffic and connect to multiple clouds. 
In the content digital media vertical, advertisers from digital media were the growth drivers for booking. Asia delivered strong bookings this quarter, reflecting digital adoption in the region. Customer wins included Index Exchange, a premier ad tech firm leveraging Ad-IX and a content discovery platform, optimizing performance at the edge to better serve the APAC region. 
The cloud and IT service vertical is the second fastest-growing vertical, driven by cloud hyperscalars continue to deploy globally as well strategic wins with leading SaaS providers. Our traction in the Software as a Service base is enhancing the value of our platform to enterprise clients. We are also observing a maturity cycle where many SaaS providers launch in the public cloud then transition to hybrid cloud as they scale and service their wider customer base. We had a great quarter for cloud services adoption, with over 460 enterprises, clouds, IT service providers and networks now interconnecting on our Cloud Exchange. 
Turning to the enterprise. This vertical continues to be the fastest-growing vertical, with a record number of performance hub deployments this quarter. Wins included a Fortune 100 manufacturer that is re-architecting by building edge note at Equinix; and a U.S. federal agency providing delivery services that is deploying multiple performance hubs and integrating multiple clouds on our platform. 
Today, over 470 customers have deployed our performance hub solution, which helps enterprises optimize their network architectures, access the cloud and drive application performance. Updated for acquisition, cloud and IT services and enterprise verticals now represent 29% and 14% of our revenues, respectively, and we continue to expect these verticals to lead growth as we progress with enterprise cloud adoption. 
And finally, we are seeing solid progress in our channel and partner programs as a percentage of our bookings coming from channel has increased from high single-digits 3 years ago to over 15% today. Our channel strategy leverages a range of partner types, each playing a critical role in scaling our enterprise 
Platform partners help us leverage mind share and awareness with high-value target customers committed to hybrid cloud as the IT architecture of choice. Referral partners create leverage in our lead generation engine, and resellers magnify our sales effort and combine key value-added services with Equinix offers to deliver complete solutions that more directly address the integrated needs of enterprise customers. 
By coordinating our sales activity with key partners at the local level, we've been able to meaningfully expand our market reach and have seen our channel program as our most prolific source of new logos for the past several quarters. So let me stop here and turn it over to Keith to cover some of the results for the quarter."
28202,374039919,1024001,"Equinix, Inc. (REIT), Equinix, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Equinix, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone in the call. It's great to be able to update you on our second quarter performance, our 54th quarter of top line revenue growth. By almost any measure, this was another strong quarter for Equinix. Since f",1775,"Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone in the call. It's great to be able to update you on our second quarter performance, our 54th quarter of top line revenue growth. By almost any measure, this was another strong quarter for Equinix. 
Since first half 2016, we delivered results better than our expectations and created value for our investors by scaling revenues while improving margins, resulting in meaningful flow-through to adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, with an absolute dollar terms as well as on a per-share basis. 
The organic business continues to perform well, and our acquisitions are delivering against our expectations. Also the number of cross-sell successes and of the depth of the sales pipeline continues to grow. Overall, we're delighted with the progress of our integration efforts related to both Bit-isle and Telecity. 
sale has have moved up the margin curve faster than expected despite our anticipated higher churn levels, and we've optimized the business more quickly than originally planned. As Steve noted, we now expect sales [indiscernible] outbid our business lines prior to the end of the year. This allows us to focus on the higher-value colocation and interconnection offerings, along with some services in support of the local Tokyo market. 
With regard to Telecity, now that the divestiture process is complete, the team is highly focused on integrating the former Telecity businesses into Equinix as quickly as possible. In the July, we fully integrated the Dutch business, which is now operating within our systems and processes. This will soon be followed by the U.K., Irish and Swedish businesses over the next few quarters. 
With regards to our key operating metrics, as highlighted by Steve yet worth mentioning again, our IRR per cabinet yield remains firm at just over $2,000 per cabinet, up $18 on a constant-currency basis over the prior quarter, with particular strenght in the Americas region. Also, we added 3,300 net billable cabinets for the quarter, effectively returning to our normalized level. And the MR churn was lower than expected. 
With respect to our interconnection offerings, net gross connect addition remains very positive, adding another 6,100 in the quarter. Also, the provision capacity and traffic growth on our Internet exchange has substantially outpace our competitor, partially reflected by the meaningful increase in the number of 100-gig ports provisioned on our exchanges. As we measure the health and success of our exchanges, we now will report provision capacity in addition to the total port [indiscernible] to highlight the momentum we're seeing in the interconnection offering. 
I would like to add a few on the foreign currency improvement in the quarter. The U.S. dollar weakened during the back half of Q1 through most of Q2 against many of our operating currency. This resulted in a meaningful FX benefit for the second quarter relative to Q1. 
However, following the Brexit announcement on June 24, the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against the British pound and the euro. Despite these FX movements, we expect no significant change in either our 2016 revenue or adjusted EBITDA guidance related to FX movements as many of the other operating currencies that we operate in strengthened against the U.S. dollar in Q2.
Now we continue to place currency hedges into our business to produce financial volatility and protect currency of our cash flows. Most recently, we benefited from the FX hedges put in place to protect the proceeds we expected to receive from the EMEA asset sales, which were denominated in pound sterling and euros. 
With these hedges in place, our U.S. dollar proceeds totaled $882 million but would have been $55 million lower without these hedges. Separately, we also hedged approximately 50% of the EMEA revenues in cash flow as we continue to integrate and business, will increase our revenue and net cash flow hedge position. 
Turning to the second quarter. As depicted on Slide 5, owned Q2 revenues were $900.5 million, the first time we've achieved this milestone level. Revenues were up 3% over the prior quarter and 15% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant-currency basis. Our global platform continues to expand with Asia Pacific and EMEA showing organic and constant currency growth over the same quarter last year of 21% and 15% respectively, while the Americas region produced steady growth of 12%. 
Our as-reported revenues include $144.5 million from acquisition, consistent with our expectation. Q2 revenue, net of FX hedges, included a $15.5 million positive currency benefit when compared to the average FX rate used last quarter and a $2 million positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance range. 
Total adjusted EBITDA was $420.3 million, up 5% over the prior quarter and 18% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant-currency basis, above our expectations for strong revenue flow-through and lower-than-expected utility and integration costs. Our as-reported adjusted EBITDA includes $64 million of contribution from our acquisition and $10 million of integration costs. 
Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46.7%, a 160 basis point increase over the prior quarter. Our Q2 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a positive $8.7 million currency benefit when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter and a $1.3 million positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance rate. 
Global AFFO was $290.5 million, a 38% increase over the prior quarter and increased 69% [ph] -- sorry, and increased to 69% of our adjusted EBITDA. Excluding integration costs, the AFFO on a normalized and constant-currency basis increased 7% over the prior quarter, largely due to a strong business performance and lower-than-expected interest expense.
AFFO per share on a fully diluted basis was $4.04 for Q2. If we exclude integration costs, $4.18 on a per-share basis. After we posted our original earnings deck today, please note that we have reissued our earnings deck and posted a new deck that will include AFFO per share data.
Moving to churn. Global MRR churn for Q2 was 1.8%, better than our expectations. We expect the MRR churn for the second half of 2016 to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter. And as mentioned at the Analyst Day in June, we continue to expect 2017 MRR churn now average 2% to 2.5% per quarter, which includes the elevated churn in Q1 2017 related to the final phase of Lincoln's bifurcation strategy.
I've said before, MRR churn be lumpy and is a perfect example of it. Although the length in churn will increase in both our cabinet and MRR dollar churn, we expect our MRR per cabinet yields to increase at the same point in time, reflective of Lincoln's per cabinet yield being significant below the Americas MRR per cabinet average. 
Now I'd like to provide a few highlights on the regions. These full results are covered on Slides 6 through 8. The Americas region had another strong revenue quarter, with particularly strength coming from the Brazilian business. The region's MRR per cabinet yield benefited from continued interconnection growth and lower-than-planned MRR churn. Also, the region had higher-than-expected adjusted EBITDA, largely due to the lower-than-expected utility expenses. 
EMEA delivered another solid quarter of revenues, with particular strength in our Dutch market. EMEA continued to execute against these key business initiatives, including the integration of the Telecity business. 
Asia Pacific remains our fastest-growing region with strong bookings in our Tokyo- and Sydney-based market, driven by network and IT verticals. Interconnection revenues continued to face overall growth of the business with the Americas, APAC and EMEA interconnection revenues now at 23%, 13% and 8%, respectively, of recurring revenues. 
Now looking at the balance sheet Steve referred on Slide 9. Unrestricted cash and investments increased over $1 billion after taking into consideration the proceeds related to the EMEA asset sale as well as funds used to purchase to Paris 2 and 3 assets. 
Again, as mentioned during the Analyst Day, although our business plan remains fully funded, including the partial drawdown of our revolving line of credit, we do expect to fully consume the cash in our balance sheet as we continue to invest in scaling our organic with capital expansion initiatives as well as returning capital to our shareholders through our quarterly cash dividend payout. 
Finally, we settled the remaining portion of our June -- the remaining portion of our June '16 convertible debt instrument and capital with a net 1.6 million of shares issued. Our pro forma net leverage stepped down to 3.5x at Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA, largely due to cash received from the EMEA asset sales, bringing us back into our targeted net leverage range of 3x to 4x adjusted EBITDA. 
Now switching to AFFO and dividends on Slide 10. For 2016, we're raising our as-reported AFFO to now range between $1.04 billion and $1.05 billion, a 26% year-over-year increase, the results of strong operating performance and lower-than-planned interest expense. 
Our normalized and constant currency AFFO is expected to now range between $1.159 billion and 1. [ph] -- pardon me, we'll start again. $1.159 billion and $1.169 billion or a 32% increase over the prior year. Normalizing for integration costs and the Telecity FX translation loss in Q1, our 2016 fully diluted AFFO per share is expected to increase 11% year-over-year to $16.21 using a weighted average of 71.7 million common shares outstanding as presented on Page 32 of our earnings deck. 
Also today, we announced our Q3 dividend of $1.75 a share, consistent with our Q2 quarterly dividend. Our AFFO payout ratio is estimated to be 48% for 2016. 
Now looking at capital expenditures. Please refer to Slide 11. For the quarter, CapEx [indiscernible] $250 million [ph] including a recurring CapEx of $32 million, below our guidance expectations due to timing of cash payments to our contractors. Given our high utilization rate of 82% as well as the strong development of returns across our new expansion and stabilized IBXs, we continue to invest in many of our key markets, with 19 in-progress build, dates expected to open by the end of this year. 
As a result, we expect to spend between $950 million and $1 billion of CapEx in 2016. As the new build, we've opened Sydney 4 earlier this month, our 146th data center and our fifth in the Australian market. As far as scale facility, we'll provide 3,000 cabinets of colocation space when fully built out, effectively doubling our existing capacity in Sydney. 
And finally, we've provided you a number of slides that bridge our 2016 guidance from the normalized 2015 performance, including slides for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Please refer to Slides 12 through 16. I'll now turn the call back to Steve."

And finally on Slide 16, which summarizes our updated Q3 and full year 2016 guidance, including the impact of FX changes. 
Now let me cover our updated 2016 outlook. For the full year of 2016, we're raising our revenue guidance to now range between $3.598 billion and $3.608 billion, a 32% as-reported growth organic and constant-currency growth rate of 13.8% compared to the prior year. This $8 million revenue increase includes a positive $2 million FX benefit when compared to prior guidance rates. 
Net of adjustments for Paris 2 and 3 acquisition and Bit-isle divestitures, revenue is stepping up $3 million, the result of our strong Q2 performance. For 2016, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to now range between $1.658 billion and $1.668 billion, a 31% as-reported increase for organic and constant-currency growth rate of 16.8% compared to the prior year. This $13 million adjusted EBITDA increase includes a positive $1 million FX benefit when compared to prior guidance rates. Net of adjustments for the Paris 2 and 3 acquisition and Bit-isle divestitures, adjusted EBITDA is stepping up $8 million, the result of our strong Q2 operating performance. 
And the growth of our business is driving increased adjusted funds from operations corporate cash flows and ultimately, dividend. We're now raising our AFFO to range between $1.04 billion and $1.05 billion, a 32% normalized and constant-currency growth rate compared to the prior year. This $30 million AFFO increase has negligible foreign currency benefits when compared to prior guidance. 
And finally, we are narrowing our 2016 capital expenditures to now range between $950 million and $1 billion for the year. 
So in closing, we continue to achieve above-market growth rates while reinforcing and extending our differentiated market position. We are capturing the significant shift to the cloud, executing well to capture the enterprise and continuing to invest across the business. The benefit our interconnect drive a growing business that will continue to increase our revenues, AFFO, cash flow and dividend. So let me stop here and we'll open it up for questions. I'll turn it back over to you, Sam."

And that's definitely filling up in terms of how people are adding interconnection both in terms of cross connects as well as greater leverage in our other interconnection-oriented services like Metro Connect, et cetera. So we're adding nice interconnection revenue. And then of course, we are seeing interconnection -- I'm sorry, power densities increase on average. And we have quite a unique advantage in that we have a very large number of customers across a range of power densities, which allows us to continue to extract underutilized power and use it to our economic advantage. So we see both of those factors continue to drive very healthy performance on stabilized IBXs."

So let me start by taking to revenue to the highest level. As you know, we revised our guidance up by a net $8 million. 50% of that $8 million really comes from the acquisition of the Paris 2, 3 assets that will add roughly $4 million of revenue to the second half of the year. For all intents and purposes, the FX and the divestiture that we referred to, Bit-isle they offset each other so we have a little bit of a positive currency benefit, offset by a lost of divestitures. So that really is leaving 50% of $4 million of value to the performance in our Q2 results. So to that, that gives you a 50% year-over-year growth rate on an organic basis. As we look at the acquisition so both Bit-isle and Telecity, they're performing against our expectations. As you've heard us say before, there's a lot of friction as included the Telecity transaction and then sold off a number of the assets. Were no looking forward the focus of that business and I would expect that to see the momentum of pickup in Telecity. As with the beta, us referred to, that was embedded in the business and yes we are experiencing the churn that the teams are continuing to perform well. And so in both cases, when we combine a look at the acquisitions, they are performing to our expectations. The last thing I'll say is one of the things that is probably -- let me say 2 things. One thing that is clearly evident is as we think about our booking expectations, we deliver almost exactly what we expected for the quarter-end so it is very consistent with performance relative to what we are seeing in the prior quarters from a gross and net bookings perspective. With that all said, there is been a positive increase of backlog because as we think about the complexity of the global cloud implementation, they are expanding the book to bill and to give you size our order of magnitude of the $4 million of delayed revenue associated with increased backlog primitive to our book to bill word. So that would be the second to the last comment. And the last comment I'll make is the recurring initial question, nonrecurring we saw a little bit of an uptick this quarter over and above what we originally anticipated but we still have -- our underlaying assumption is nonrecurring revenue will revert closer to 5% as we scale through the year except if there's any change on that we will certainly guide through but that is the assumption that we made in of the Q3 -- sorry, the updated revenue guidance."

All that said, you will see our utilization levels moving up. And so one of the things that I will leave with you is we see utilization level move up, there's really a need for us, there's 8 new projects that are coming online this year and there's 19 that are in about It's important for us to continue to build a that expansion initiative so that we can continue to sell that same clip with the same set of opportunities a number of markets where all else being equal, we have some constrained inventory issues and how that we have to address.

But I also would say that we're seeing that the unique strength of Equinix to become increasingly important to the targeted buyers that were going after. So the global reach, the ability to implement hybrid cloud effectively and gain access to the cloud density that we hobble, implement multicloud effectively, those are the things I think we are seeing in terms of if we look at our bookings and what we see as a critical growth vertical of cloud and ITN enterprise really the 2 sides of the cloud ecosystem, given the continued to over index.

As we really to Q3, it is a seasonably high utilities quarter. And if you go back to those you're going to see that historically, utilities move up in the market particularly in the Silicon Valley and then certainly some of our European markets. As a result, there's $7 million of incremental utilities in Q3 that was not there in Q2. And so we got the benefit of utilities, I refer to the overperformance in Q2. We're still going to see a meaningful step-up of $7 million. So that would take a quarter EBITDA growth of roughly 3.7%. So that would be the first comment. As it relates to Paris, one of the benefits that we have, as we said, there's a great opportunity as a company, as we acquire assets we could operate differently, then the landlord. And in this case, there's an opportunity as we think about the revenue we can drive from the incremental customers inside those data centers. In addition to the fact that as we think about the probably going to look that least acquisition treatment is going to look as if you take all those operating costs only as of business and then you put it onto your balance sheet and then you'll have some depreciation. So you get a benefit to our revenue and we also removed of the cost associated with how we treat those assets. And then operationally, we think we can leverage off of our existing -- but we will make some incremental word we can leverage off our existing staff so we can get that incremental revenue without that meaningful so in both cases, you get a nice top line and we also get a nice bottom line improvement and then you'll continue to see us make good strategic decisions around of those to assets and how to explore and even better return from the cost required in these assets from word."

As far as hedging, as you know, we provide effectively a softer ending for currencies as they move around to provide predictability with our results and with more focus on revenues. And then also to increase cash flows again because we are distributing a lot of our capital today back to the shareholders. So those are 2 things that are really important for us. And so when we think about how we define our hedges, number one, there's increased volatility and so what one of the things wanted to the restraint to center these hedges over we are hedging to 2018 now. We're focusing on of our European currencies because of [indiscernible] our business in Europe US dollar functional and when we hedge against weather revenues are caused cash flow hedges, we get something so those are things that we are trying to do.

We had a great first half of 2016, delivering both revenues and adjusted EBITDA above the top end of our guidance range as our global scale and reach, strength of",1889,"Okay. Thanks, Katrina, and good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. We had a great first half of 2016, delivering both revenues and adjusted EBITDA above the top end of our guidance range as our global scale and reach, strength of our digital ecosystems and service excellence continue to drive profitable growth. 
As depicted on Slide 3 of our presentation, second quarter revenues were $900.5 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 15% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant-currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $420.3 million for the quarter, up 5% over the prior quarter and up 18% year-over-year on an organic and constant-currency basis. This drove AFFO growth of 37% year-over-year on a normalized and constant-currency basis. 
We delivered strong growth in net bookings, with increasing contribution from our indirect channel. Our key operating metrics continue to be very healthy with firm MRR per cabinet, low churn and strong growth in both billable cabinet and interconnection. We continue to progress against key operational and business objectives in 2016 to grow our market position globally, centering on successful acquisition integration, sustained organic development and scaling our interconnection services. So let me provide some commentary in each of these in turn. 
Starting with acquisition. We are focusing our energy on successfully integrating Telecity and Bit-isle, scaling the business to drive even more value for our customers and enhancing our cloud and network density across EMEA and Asia. We've delivered against key integration goals and milestones and are pleased with the progress we have made in the first half. 
The Telecity business delivered solid financial performance despite normal integration challenges and complexity associated with the divestitures, and we are seeing value creation across a broad range of synergy category. Our EMEA sales force has been fully integrated, and our cross-selling program is tracking ahead of plan, with particular customer interest in the overlapping markets of London and Amsterdam and our new markets in Stockholm and Manchester. 
The financial and IT systems work is well under way, and we've defined the critical initiatives to operationally integrate our back op. We have completed the first large systems conversion with the Telecity Dutch business now operating within the Equinix corporate systems and processes and plan to migrate the remaining countries through 2017. 
In early July, we also completed the sale of 8 European assets for $882 million updated for FX, as required by the European Commission as part of its approval of our purchase of TelecityGroup. Completing this last milestone in the acquisition process paves the way for us to fully focus on selling our new combined European platform. 
We're also pleased with Bit-isle's progress, and the market reaction to the acquisition has been positive. The business is performing well, with cross-selling momentum accelerating including several wins with Japanese multinationals that are leveraging space and connectivity across existing and acquired sites. We are further optimizing this business by divesting 2 small non-core businesses, which we completed in the first half of 2016. We also expect to divest Terra Power, a collection of solar power assets, in the second half of this year. 
Turning to our organic development activity. We continue to invest in expanding globally. Allocating 95% of our expansion capital to building off-campus or existing market build for a deep knowledge of fill rate, pipeline and competitive supply leads to higher returns. We now have 19 announced expansion projects under way. In this quarter, we are moving forward with additional expansions in Ashburn, Frankfurt, Paris and Singapore, totaling over $250 million of capital expenditures. 
We are starting work on DC12, the first data center build in our Ashburn North Campus in Northern Virginia, which is on 44 acres of owned, undeveloped land next to our current Ashburn campus. Today, Ashburn is one of our major campuses with over 14,000 cabinets across 10 IBXs, and it's the largest Internet exchange point in North America. The new Ashburn North Campus, which we plan to develop over the next few years, will expand our asset ownership and effectively double our capacity in this important market. 
Turning to Frankfurt. We see continued demand in this vibrant market coming from Internet and cloud providers due to data sovereignty compliance as well as financial services growth. We are building Frankfurt 6, a new IBX located on owned land next to Frankfurt 4 and tethered to our core network hub in this market. 
These capital investments are delivering very healthy growth and strong returns as shown on Slide 4. Revenues from our 70 stabilized IBXs grew 8% year-over-year, above our historical trend line and largely driven by an increase in cross-connect and power density. We continue to find ways to optimize our asset base, putting the right customer and application into the right asset, which drives a firm yield per cabinet. These stabilized assets are generating a 32% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested, and utilization remains at a stable 86%. 
In terms of our asset ownership strategy, our goal is to produce over 50% from owned properties over time by developing land such as in Silicon Valley and Ashburn as well as purchasing additional site as it makes economic and strategic sense. Consistent with this strategy, we purchased our Paris 2 and 3 IBXs for $211 million from Digital Realty, which closed this week. 
Over 70 carriers reside in Paris 2 and 3. They're in the most densely connected data center campus in France. Ownership will enable us to achieve better operating costs, enhanced customer service and further expand this campus over time. The acquisition of Paris 2 and 3 is an example of where we can acquire assets and operate the property more efficiently for our own purpose, thereby allowing us to enjoy a higher return. With this purchase, 35% of our revenues now come from owned assets. 
Turning to interconnection. The need to build next-generation IT architectures that connect network, cloud, people and data continues to drive customer demand for interconnection. We now have 183,000 cross-connects, and interconnection revenue grew 21% year-over-year on an organic and constant-currency basis. 
Interconnection revenues represent 16% of our global recurring revenues, and this is the eighth quarter in a row where we had a greater than 5,000 cross-connects. We saw a particularly strong growth in connections to cloud providers, with accelerated additions of participants, ports and virtual circuit on our market-leading Cloud Exchange platform and strong sales of cross-connect to facilitate Direct Connect into pure-play cloud. 
Our Internet exchange continues to scale with 5.6 terabits of peak traffic, growing over 35% year-over-year as network and cloud providers upgrade their capacity and transition to 100 GB equipment. The transition to cloud continues to unfold as enterprises are re-architecting IT to drive down costs, improve performance and leverage clouds and network. 
We continue to see growth in Fortune 500 new customer and expansion wins as the explosion of data and devices are transforming how large multinationals architect their infrastructure, leveraging interconnection as a core design principle. We added 7 new Fortune 500 customers in the quarter such as Ticketmaster, an online ticket vendor, leveraging Equinix to improve digital experience and integrate cloud infrastructure. We now have over 150 of the Fortune 500 customers and over 500 of the Global 2000. 
Now let me cover quarterly highlights from our industry vertical, starting with the network. This vertical experienced strong bookings, led by strength in Asia as wireline providers including Telstra, SingTel and Softbank expanded with multi-region deployment. We saw growth with regional Internet service providers including U.S. Internet Corp., a regional ISP peering to support growing enterprise cloud demand; and GCI, a regional telecom provider adding cloud connectivity capabilities via our Cloud Exchange to augment their network service offering. 
Additionally, our strength as a global platform allows us to target strategic subsea cable projects to land within our ecosystem hub, and we are seeing pipeline and activity build in this growing segment including 2 new wins this quarter. Equinix is the biggest aggregator of digital ecosystems, making us the most logical choice for subsea cable operators to get the immediate benefit tapping into a mature ecosystem of buyers. 
The financial services vertical experienced continued expansion into our core electronic trading ecosystem as well as diversification into other subsegments. This quarter, we saw additional expansions from investment banks such as Morgan Stanley, better leveraging Equinix for critical data center, network and cloud connectivity. We are also observing the beginning of clustering of electronic payment counterparties across regions, including the addition of Merchant Customer Exchange, a leading merchant payment system that is deployed to peer traffic and connect to multiple clouds. 
In the content digital media vertical, advertisers and digital media were the growth drivers for booking. Asia delivered strong bookings this quarter, reflecting digital adoption in the region. Customer wins included Index Exchange, a premier ad tech firm, leveraging Ad-IX; and Taboola, a content discovery platform, optimizing performance at the edge to better serve the APAC region. 
The cloud and IT services vertical is the second fastest-growing vertical driven by cloud hyperscalers continue to deploy access nodes globally as well strategic wins with leading SaaS providers. Our traction in the Software-as-a-Service space is enhancing the value of our platform to enterprise clients. We are also observing a maturity cycle where many SaaS providers launched in the public cloud then transition to hybrid cloud as they scale and service a wider customer base. We had a great quarter for cloud services adoption, with over 460 enterprises, clouds, IT service providers and networks now interconnecting on our Cloud Exchange. 
Turning to the enterprise. This vertical continues to be the fastest-growing vertical, with a record number of Performance Hub deployments this quarter. Wins included a Fortune 100 manufacturer that is re-architecting by building edge node at Equinix and a U.S. federal agency providing delivery services that is deploying multiple Performance Hubs and integrating multiple clouds on our platform. 
Today, over 470 customers have deployed our Performance Hub solution, which helps enterprises optimize their network architectures, access the cloud and drive application performance. Updated for acquisition, cloud and IT services and enterprise verticals now represent 29% and 14% of our revenues, respectively, and we continue to expect these verticals to lead growth as we progress with enterprise cloud adoption. 
And finally, we are seeing solid progress in our channel and partner programs as a percentage of our bookings coming from channel has increased from high single digits 3 years ago to over 15% today. Our channel strategy leverages a range of partner types, each playing a critical role in scaling our enterprise [indiscernible]. 
Platform partners help us leverage mind share and awareness with high-value target customers committed to hybrid cloud as the IT architecture of choice. Referral partners create leverage in our lead-generation engine, and resellers magnify our sales effort and combine key value-added services with Equinix offers to deliver complete solutions that more directly address the integrated needs of enterprise customers. 
By coordinating our sales activity with key partners at the local level, we've been able to meaningfully expand our market reach and have seen our channel program as our most prolific source of new logos for the past several quarters. 
So let me stop here and turn it over to Keith to cover some of the results for the quarter."
28202,374039919,1024338,"Equinix, Inc. (REIT), Equinix, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Equinix, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone on the call. It's great to be able to update you on our second quarter performance, our 54th quarter of top line revenue growth. By almost any measure, this was another strong quarter for Equinix. For the",1795,"Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone on the call. It's great to be able to update you on our second quarter performance, our 54th quarter of top line revenue growth. By almost any measure, this was another strong quarter for Equinix. 
For the first half of 2016, we delivered results better than our expectations and created value for our investors by scaling revenues while improving margins, resulting in meaningful flow-through to adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, with an absolute dollar terms as well as on a per-share basis. 
The organic business continues to perform well, and our acquisitions are delivering against our expectations. Also the number of cross-sell successes and of the depth of the sales pipeline continues to grow. Overall, we're delighted with the progress of our integration efforts related to both Bit-isle and Telecity. 
Dell has have moved up the margin curve faster than expected despite our anticipated higher churn levels, and we've optimized the business more quickly than originally planned. As Steve noted, we now expect to sell non-core Bit-isle business lines prior to the end of the year. This allows us to focus on the higher-value colocation and interconnection offerings, along with some manual [ph] services in support of the local Tokyo market. 
With regard to Telecity, now that the divestiture process is complete, the team is highly focused on integrating the former Telecity businesses into Equinix as quickly as possible. In July, we fully integrated the Dutch business, which is now operating within our systems and processes. This will soon be followed by the U.K., Irish and Swedish businesses over the next few quarters. 
With regards to our key operating metrics, as highlighted by Steve yet worth mentioning again, our MRR per cabinet yield remains firm at just over $2,000 per cabinet, up $18 on a constant-currency basis over the prior quarter, with particular strength in the Americas region. Also, we added 3,300 net billable cabinets for the quarter, effectively returning to our normal add level. And the MRR churn was lower than expected. 
With respect to our interconnection offerings, net cross-connect addition remains very positive, adding another 6,100 in the quarter. Also, the provision capacity and traffic growth on our Internet exchanges has substantially outpaced our competitors, partially reflected by the meaningful increase in the number of 100 GB ports provisioned on our exchanges. As we measure the health and success of our exchanges, we now will report provision capacity in addition to the total port count to highlight the momentum we're seeing in the interconnection offering. 
Now I'd like to add a few comments on foreign currency movements in the quarter. The U.S. dollar weakened during the back half of Q1 through most of Q2 against many of our operating currency. This resulted in a meaningful FX benefit for the second quarter relative to Q1. However, following the Brexit announcement on June 24, the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against the British pound and the euro. Despite these FX movements, we expect no significant change in either our 2016 revenue or adjusted EBITDA guidance related to FX movement as many of the other operating currencies that we operate in strengthened against the U.S. dollar in Q2.
Now we continue to place currency hedges into our business to reduce financial volatility and protect certainty of our cash flows. Most recently, we benefited from the FX hedges put in place to protect the proceeds we expected to receive from the EMEA asset sale, which was denominated in pound sterling and euros. With these hedges in place, our U.S. dollar proceeds totaled $882 million but would have been $55 million lower without these hedges. Separately, we also hedged approximately 50% of the EMEA revenues and cash flows. As we continue to integrate Telecity into our EMEA business, we'll increase our revenue and net cash flow hedge position. 
So turning to the second quarter. As depicted on Slide 5, global Q2 revenues were $900.5 million, the first time we've achieved this milestone level. Revenues were up 3% over the prior quarter and 15% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant-currency basis. Our global platform continues to expand, with Asia Pacific and EMEA showing organic and constant-currency growth over the same quarter last year of 21% and 15%, respectively, while the Americas region produced steady growth of 12%. 
Our as-reported revenues include $144.5 million from acquisitions, consistent with our expectation. Q2 revenue, net of FX hedges, included a $15.5 million positive currency benefit when compared to the average FX rate used last quarter and a $2 million positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance range. 
Global adjusted EBITDA was $420.3 million, up 5% over the prior quarter and 18% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant-currency basis, above our expectations with a strong revenue flow-through and lower-than-expected utility and integration costs. Our as-reported adjusted EBITDA includes $64 million of contribution from our acquisition and $10 million of integration costs. 
Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46.7%, a 160 basis point increase over the prior quarter. Our Q2 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a positive $8.7 million currency benefit when compared to the average FX rate used last quarter and a $1.3 million positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance rate. 
Global AFFO was $290.5 million, a 38% increase over the prior quarter and increased 69% -- for an increase to 69% of our adjusted EBITDA. Excluding integration costs, the AFFO on a normalized and constant-currency basis increased 7% over the prior quarter largely due to a strong business performance and lower-than-expected interest expense.
AFFO per share on a fully diluted basis was $4.04 for Q2, but if you exclude integration costs, $4.18 on a per-share basis. After we posted our original earnings deck today, please note that we have reissued our earnings deck and posted a new deck that will include AFFO per-share data.
Moving to churn. Global MRR churn for Q2 was 1.8%, better than our expectations. We expect the MRR churn for the second half of 2016 to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter. And as mentioned at the Analyst Day in June, we continue to expect 2017 MRR churn to average 2% to 2.5% per quarter, which includes the elevated churn in Q1 2017 related to the final phase of LinkedIn's bifurcation strategy.
I've said before, MRR churn be lumpy and the LinkedIn churn is a perfect example of this. Although the LinkedIn churn will create an increase in both our cabinet and MRR dollar churn, we expect our MRR per cabinet yields to increase at the same point in time, reflective of LinkedIn's per cabinet yield being significantly below the Americas MRR per cabinet average. 
Now I'd like to provide a few highlights on the regions. These full results are covered on Slides 6 through 8. The Americas region had another strong revenue quarter, with particularly strength coming from the Brazilian business. The region's MRR per cabinet yield benefited from continued interconnection growth and lower-than-planned MRR churn. Also, the region had higher-than-expected adjusted EBITDA, largely due to the lower-than-expected utility expenses. 
EMEA delivered another solid quarter of revenues, with particular strength in our Dutch market. EMEA continued to execute against these key business initiatives, including the integration of the Telecity business. 
Asia Pacific remains our fastest-growing region, with strong bookings in our Tokyo- and Sydney-based markets, driven by network and cloud and IT verticals. 
Interconnection revenues continued to outpace overall growth of the business, with the Americas, APAC and EMEA interconnection revenues now at 23%, 13% and 8%, respectively, of recurring revenues. 
Now looking at the balance sheet. Please refer to Slide 9. Unrestricted cash and investments increased to over $1 billion after taking into consideration the proceeds related to the EMEA asset sale as well as funds used to purchase our Paris 2 and 3 assets. 
Again, as mentioned during the Analyst Day, although our business plan remains fully funded, including the partial drawdown of our revolving line of credit, we do expect to fully consume the cash in our balance sheet as we continue to invest in scaling our organic business with capital expansion initiatives as well as returning capital to our shareholders through our quarterly cash dividend payout. 
Finally, we settled the remaining portion of our June -- the remaining portion of our June '16 convertible debt instrument and capital with a net 1.6 million of shares issued. Our pro forma net leverage stepped down to 3.5x our Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA, largely due to cash received from the EMEA asset sales, bringing us back into our targeted net leverage range of 3 to 4x adjusted EBITDA. 
Now switching to AFFO and dividends on Slide 10. For 2016, we're raising our as-reported AFFO to now range between $1.04 billion and $1.05 billion, a 26% year-over-year increase, the results of strong operating performance and lower-than-planned interest expense. 
Our normalized and constant-currency AFFO is expected to now range between 1.15 -- sorry, $1.159 billion and 1 point -- pardon me, we'll start again. $1.159 billion and $1.169 billion or a 32% increase over the prior year. Normalizing for integration costs and the Telecity FX translation loss in Q1, our 2016 fully diluted AFFO per share is expected to increase 11% year-over-year to $16.21 using on a weighted average 71.7 million common shares outstanding as presented on Page 32 of our earnings deck. 
Also today, we announced our Q3 dividend of $1.75 a share, consistent with our Q2 quarterly dividend. Our AFFO payout ratio is estimated to be 48% for 2016. 
Now looking at CapEx. Please refer to Slide 11. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $250 million, including a recurring CapEx of $32 million, below our guidance expectations due to timing of cash payments to our contractors. Given our currently high utilization rate of 82% as well as the strong development of returns across our new expansion and stabilized IBXs, we continue to invest in many of our key markets with 19 in-progress build, 8 of which are expected to open by the end of this year. As a result, we expect to spend between $950 million and $1 billion of CapEx in 2016. 
As regard [ph] the new build, we've opened Sydney 4 earlier this month, our 146th data center and our fifth in the Australian market. This large-scale facility will provide 3,000 cabinets of colocation space when fully built out, effectively doubling our existing capacity in Sydney. 
And finally, we've provided you a number of slides that bridge our 2016 guidance from the normalized 2015 performance, including slides for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Please refer to Slides 12 through 16. 
I'll now turn the call back to Steve."

And finally, on Slide 16, which summarizes our updated Q3 and full year 2016 guidance, including the impact of FX changes. 
Now let me cover our updated 2016 outlook. For the full year of 2016, we're raising our revenue guidance to now range between $3.598 billion and $3.608 billion, a 32% as-reported growth for organic and constant-currency growth rate of 13.8% compared to the prior year. This $8 million revenue increase includes a positive $2 million FX benefit when compared to prior guidance rate.
Net of adjustments for Paris 2 and 3 acquisition and Bit-isle divestitures, revenue is stepping up $3 million, the result of our strong Q2 performance. For 2016, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to now range between $1.658 billion and $1.668 billion, a 31% as-reported increase for organic and constant-currency growth rate of 16.8% compared to the prior year. This $13 million adjusted EBITDA increase includes a positive $1 million FX benefit when compared to prior guidance rate. Net of adjustments for the Paris 2 and 3 acquisition and Bit-isle divestitures, adjusted EBITDA is stepping up $8 million, the result of our strong Q2 operating performance. 
And the growth of our business is driving increased adjusted funds from operations, which drives corporate cash flows and ultimately, dividend. We're now raising our AFFO to range between $1.04 billion and $1.05 billion, a 32% normalized and constant-currency growth rate compared to the prior year. This $30 million AFFO increase has negligible foreign currency benefits when compared to prior guidance. And finally, we are narrowing our 2016 capital expenditures to now range between $950 million and $1 billion for the year. 
So in closing, we continue to achieve above-market growth rates while reinforcing and extending our differentiated market position. We are capturing the significant shift to the cloud, executing well to capture the enterprise and continuing to invest across the business. The benefits of our interconnection strategy drive a growing and durable business that will continue to increase our revenues, AFFO, cash flow and dividend. 
So let me stop here, and we'll open it up for questions. I'll turn it back over to you, Sam."

They're typically adding both cross-connects in terms of getting direct connectivity to pure-play public cloud. And then as they expand, their commitment to hybrid cloud and the use of SaaS players, they're really looking at using easy access as a very convenient multi-cloud platform. And so we're seeing a lot of interest and uptake on those, even though it's, I think, relatively early days in the overall transformation.

Maybe the intersection of that and sort of the organic growth expectations for the year, they moved up 40 basis points.

So let me start by taking you through revenue at the highest level. As you know, we revised our guidance up by roughly a net $8 million. 50% of that $8 million really comes from the acquisition of the Paris 2, 3 assets. That will add roughly $4 million of revenue to the second half of the year. For all intents and purposes, the FX and the divestitures that we referred to from Bit-isle, they will offset each other. So we have a little bit of a positive currency benefit, offset by the lost of the divestitures. So that really is leaving roughly 50% of $4 million of value attributed to the performance in our Q2 result. So that all said, that gives you a 13.8% year-over-year growth rate on an organic basis. As we look at the acquisitions, so both Bit-isle and Telecity, they're performing against our expectations. As you've heard us say before, there's a lot of friction as we close the Telecity transaction and then sold off a number of the assets. We're now looking forward to seeing -- the focus on that business, and I would expect that, at some point, to see the momentum pick up in Telecity. As it relates to Bit-isle, as you've heard us refer to, there was a lot of churn that was embedded in the business. And yes, we're experiencing the churn, but the team is continuing to perform well. And so in both cases, when we combine and look at the acquisitions, they are performing to our expectations. The last thing I'll say is one of the things that probably is -- well, let me say 2 things. One thing's that probably not clearly evident is as we think about our booking expectations, we delivered almost exactly what we expected for the quarter end and so very consistent with performance relative to what we have seen in the prior quarters from a gross and net bookings perspective. That all said, there's been a positive increase effectively to our backlog because as we think about the complexity of the global hybrid cloud implementation, they're extending the book to bill and to [indiscernible]. And to give you a sense of a size or order of magnitude, there about $4 million of delayed revenue associated with increased backlog attributed to our book to bill and to [indiscernible]. So that would be that one -- second to the last comment. And the last comment I'd make is as we think about nonrecurring, back to your initial question, nonrecurring, we saw a little bit of an uptick this quarter over and above what we originally anticipated. But we still have the -- our underlaying assumption is nonrecurring revenue will revert closer to 5% as we scale through the year. And to the extent there's any change in that, we'll certainly guide to, but that's the assumption that we've made in the Q3 -- sorry, the updated revenue guidance."

So again, they're showing continued momentum in the business. As I said, we're still driving -- we're driving our bookings engine as we expect. And with momentum that we think they will continue to come from the channel, that gives us -- it gives us a, perhaps a greater opportunity as we look forward. All that said, you can see our utilization levels moving up. And so one of the things I would leave with you is as we see utilization levels move up, there's really a need for us -- there's 8 new projects that are coming online this year, and there's 19 that are in the offer [ph], we're -- it's important for us to continue to build out our expansion initiatives so that we can continue to sell at that same clip with the same set of opportunities.

But I also would say that we're seeing the unique strengths of Equinix begin to become increasingly important to the targeted buyers that we -- that we're going after. So the global reach, the ability to implement hybrid cloud effectively and gain access to the cloud density that we have and implement multi-cloud effectively, those are things that I think we're seeing in terms of -- and if we look at our bookings in the really, what we see as the critical growth verticals of cloud and IT and enterprise, really the 2 sides of the cloud ecosystem.

But when I look at your guidance for the third quarter, it's implying roughly an $18 million increase to revenue at the midpoint and about $2 million increase to EBITDA. So I'm just curious, is there anything in the SG&A in the second quarter that was onetime in nature that we should be mindful of when we're trying to give back to your guidance for the third quarter in our modeling? And then my second question is on Paris. The -- it looks like you're including a $4 million benefit both to revenue and to EBITDA. Obviously, you were once the customer there yourself, so that may have some impact. We're trying to understand why they're the same numbers."

As it relates to Q3, as you know, it's typically our seasonally high utilities quarter. And if you go back a dozen years, you're going to see that historically, utilities move up in that market, particularly in the -- in Silicon Valley and then certainly some of our European markets. As a result, there's $7 million of incremental utilities expensed in Q3 that was not there in Q2. And so although we got the benefit of utilities, I refer to that in our overperformance in Q2, we're still going to see a meaningful step-up of $7 million. So that would take your quarter-over-quarter EBITDA growth up to a roughly 3.7%. So that'd be the first comment. As it relates to Paris, one of the benefits that we have, as we said, there's a great opportunity as a company as we acquire asset. We can operate it differently than the landlord. And in this case, there's an opportunity as we think about the revenue we can derive from increment -- from the incremental customers inside those data centers. In addition to the fact that as we think about the lease treatment, probably going to look -- the lease treatment or the acquisition treatment is going to look as if you take all those operating costs away as a business, and then you put it on to your balance sheet, and then you'll have some depreciation. So we get the benefit attributed to revenue. So we also removed the costs associated with how we treated those assets. And then also operationally, we think we can leverage off of our existing -- that suggests we're not going to make some incremental investments. We can leverage off our existing staff, and so we get the benefit of that incremental revenue without having to meaningfully augment our staff. So in both cases, you get a nice top line and you also get a nice bottom line improvement. And then you'll continue to see us make good strategic decisions around those 2 assets and how to explore an even better return from the costs that required these assets from DLR at."

And so trying to quantify that is difficult to do at this point, but our complete focus now is globally selling into these assets and getting that sales force in Europe completely focused on selling globally, including the asset in Europe. So that will help us, obviously, with the distraction behind us now, the divestures in the preliminary integrations.

One of the benefits that we're going to have is we get to sell across a combined platform today. And understanding exactly who should be the, if you will, the true beneficiary of that booking and where the costs will go is becoming increasingly cloudy. So when we think about how we're going to perform on a go-forward basis, we're very much inclined to look at it holistically. But it's clear that, from our perspective, we're taking away substantial distraction from the business now that we've not only closed the acquisition of our Paris 2, 3 acquisitions but the divestiture of the 8 assets to Digital Realty. And so now we can really focus on scaling the business and taking away a lot of the noise in the system."

I'll take the hedging question, Mike, and Steve or Charles will jump in on the other one. First, as it relates to hedging, our philosophy is to, as you know, is to provide effectively a soft landing for currencies as they move around and certainly to provide predictability with our results and with more focus on revenues and then also to create some certainty around our cash flows, again, because we're distributing a lot of our capital today back to the shareholders. So those are 2 things that are highly important for us. And so when we think about how we deploy our hedges, number one, there's been increase of volatility. And so one of the things that we wanted to do is try and spread out these hedges over a longer period of time. And so we are hedging partially into 2018 now. We're focusing on typically the European currencies because of -- without getting overly complex, our business in Europe is run as U.S. dollar functional. And when we hedge against our -- whether revenues are costs for our cash flow hedges, we get to tweak [ph] them against the lines in which we're hedging. So those are things that we try and do. And clearly, as a result, you're seeing the benefit of us not only in our result but also on our guidance rates on how we've layered in those hedges over a period of time. So absolutely, we're benefiting from the hedges, but it'll depend on the currencies and the markets that we're talking about. But the philosophy is to continue to hedge, and then there also is our cash -- as I said, there's the cash flow hedges, then the hedges that we put in place when we're moving money around the markets. And in this case, as you know, with the pending sale of the EMEA assets, we wanted to make sure we hedge the cash flows associated with that. And as I said, absent putting that hedge in place, we would have been $55 million shorter have we not put our hedges in place because of what happened with Brexit. And so again, we're being very thoughtful about our overall hedging strategy to create that predictability with our cash flows but also make sure that there's a smooth glide path as currencies rebase in some cases, like the euro or the pound, yet at the same time, you're going to get the volatility pick up because we only hedge to 70%, 80% of the exposure."

We had a great first half of 2016, delivering both revenues and adjusted EBITDA above the top end of our guidance range as our global scale and reach, strength of",1894,"Okay. Thanks, Katrina, and good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. We had a great first half of 2016, delivering both revenues and adjusted EBITDA above the top end of our guidance range as our global scale and reach, strength of our digital ecosystems and service excellence continue to drive profitable growth. 
As depicted on Slide 3 of our presentation, second quarter revenues were $900.5 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 15% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant-currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $420.3 million for the quarter, up 5% over the prior quarter and up 18% year-over-year on an organic and constant-currency basis. This drove AFFO growth of 37% year-over-year on a normalized and constant-currency basis. 
We delivered strong growth in net bookings, with increasing contribution from our indirect channel. Our key operating metrics continue to be very healthy with firm MRR per cabinet, low churn and strong growth in both billable cabinet and interconnection. We continue to progress against key operational and business objectives in 2016 to grow our market position globally, centering on successful acquisition integration, sustained organic development and scaling our interconnection services. So let me provide some commentary in each of these in turn. 
Starting with acquisition. We are focusing our energy on successfully integrating Telecity and Bit-isle, scaling the business to drive even more value for our customers and enhancing our cloud and network density across EMEA and Asia. We've delivered against key integration goals and milestones and are pleased with the progress we have made in the first half. 
The Telecity business delivered solid financial performance despite normal integration challenges and complexity associated with the divestitures, and we are seeing value creation across a broad range of synergy category. Our EMEA sales force has been fully integrated, and our cross-selling program is tracking ahead of plan, with particular customer interest in the overlapping markets of London and Amsterdam and our new markets in Stockholm and Manchester. 
The financial and IT systems work is well under way, and we've defined the critical initiatives to operationally integrate our back op. We have completed the first large systems conversion with the Telecity Dutch business now operating within the Equinix corporate systems and processes and plan to migrate the remaining countries through 2017. 
In early July, we also completed the sale of 8 European assets for $882 million updated for FX, as required by the European Commission as part of its approval of our purchase of TelecityGroup. Completing this last milestone in the acquisition process paves the way for us to fully focus on selling our new combined European platform. 
We're also pleased with Bit-isle's progress, and the market reaction to the acquisition has been positive. The business is performing well, with cross-selling momentum accelerating including several wins with Japanese multinationals that are leveraging space and connectivity across existing and acquired sites. We are further optimizing this business by divesting 2 small non-core businesses, which we completed in the first half of 2016. We also expect to divest Terra Power, a collection of solar power assets, in the second half of this year. 
Turning to our organic development activity. We continue to invest and expand globally. Allocating 95% of our expansion capital to building out campus or existing market build for a deep knowledge of fill rate, pipeline and competitive supply leads to higher returns. We now have 19 announced expansion projects under way. In this quarter, we are moving forward with additional expansions in Ashburn, Frankfurt, Paris and Singapore, totaling over $250 million of capital expenditures. 
We are starting work on DC12, the first data center build in our Ashburn North Campus in Northern Virginia, which is on 44 acres of owned, undeveloped land next to our current Ashburn campus. Today, Ashburn is one of our major campuses with over 14,000 cabinets across 10 IBXs, and it's the largest Internet exchange point in North America. The new Ashburn North Campus, which we plan to develop over the next few years, will expand our asset ownership and effectively double our capacity in this important market. 
Turning to Frankfurt. We see continued demand in this vibrant market coming from Internet and cloud providers due to data sovereignty compliance as well as financial services growth. We are building Frankfurt 6, a new IBX located on owned land next to Frankfurt 4 and tethered to our core network hub in this market. 
These capital investments are delivering very healthy growth and strong returns as shown on Slide 4. Revenues from our 70 stabilized IBXs grew 8% year-over-year, above our historical trend line and largely driven by an increase in cross-connect and power density. We continue to find ways to optimize our asset base, putting the right customer and application into the right asset, which drives a firm yield per cabinet. These stabilized assets are generating a 32% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested, and utilization remains at a stable 86%. 
In terms of our asset ownership strategy, our goal is to produce over 50% from owned properties over time by developing land such as in Silicon Valley and Ashburn as well as purchasing additional site as it makes economic and strategic sense. Consistent with this strategy, we purchased our Paris 2 and 3 IBXs for $211 million from Digital Realty, which closed this week. 
Over 70 carriers reside in Paris 2 and 3. This stack is the most densely connected data center campus in France. Ownership will enable us to achieve better operating costs, enhanced customer service and further expand this campus over time. The acquisition of Paris 2 and 3 is an example of where we can acquire assets and operate the property more efficiently for our own purpose, thereby allowing us to enjoy a higher return. With this purchase, 35% of our revenues now come from owned assets. 
Turning to interconnection. The need to build next-generation IT architectures that connect network, cloud, people and data continues to drive customer demand for interconnection. We now have 183,000 cross-connect, and interconnection revenue grew 21% year-over-year on an organic and constant-currency basis. 
Interconnection revenues represent 16% of our global recurring revenues, and this is the eighth quarter in a row where we had a greater than 5,000 cross-connects. We saw a particularly strong growth in connections to cloud providers, with accelerated additions of participants, ports and virtual circuit on our market-leading Cloud Exchange platform and strong sales of cross-connect to facilitate Direct Connect into the pure-play cloud. 
Our Internet exchange continues to scale with 5.6 terabits of peak traffic, growing over 35% year-over-year as network and cloud providers upgrade their capacity and transition to 100 GB equipment. The transition to cloud continues to unfold as enterprises are re-architecting IT to drive down costs, improve performance and leverage clouds and network. 
We continue to see growth in Fortune 500 new customer and expansion wins as the explosion of data and devices are transforming how large multinationals architect their infrastructure, leveraging interconnection as a core design principle. We added 7 new Fortune 500 customers in the quarter such as Ticketmaster, an online ticket vendor, leveraging Equinix to improve digital experience and integrate cloud infrastructure. We now have over 150 of the Fortune 500 customers and over 500 of the Global 2000. 
Now let me cover quarterly highlights from our industry vertical, starting with the network. This vertical experienced strong bookings, led by strength in Asia as wireline providers including Telstra, SingTel and Softbank expanded with multi-region deployment. We saw growth with regional Internet service providers including U.S. Internet Corp., a regional ISP peering to support growing enterprise cloud demand; and GCI, a regional telecom provider adding cloud connectivity capabilities via our Cloud Exchange to augment their network service offering. 
Additionally, our strength as a global platform allows us to target strategic subsea cable projects to land within our ecosystem hub, and we are seeing pipeline and activity build in this growing segment including 2 new wins this quarter. Equinix is the biggest aggregator of digital ecosystems, making us the most logical choice for subsea cable operators to get the immediate benefit tapping into a mature ecosystem of buyers. 
The financial services vertical experienced continued expansion into our core electronic trading ecosystem as well as diversification into other subsegments. This quarter, we saw additional expansions from investment banks such as Morgan Stanley that are leveraging Equinix for critical data center, network and cloud connectivity. We are also observing the beginning of clustering of electronic payment counterparties across regions, including the addition of Merchant Customer Exchange, a leading merchant payment system that is deployed to peer traffic and connect to multiple clouds. 
In the content digital media vertical, advertisers and digital media were the growth drivers for booking. Asia delivered strong bookings this quarter, reflecting digital adoption in the region. Customer wins included Index Exchange, a premier ad tech firm, leveraging Ad-IX; and Taboola, a content discovery platform, optimizing performance at the edge to better serve the APAC region. 
The cloud and IT services vertical is the second fastest-growing vertical driven by cloud hyperscalers continue to deploy access nodes globally as well strategic wins with leading SaaS providers. Our traction in the Software-as-a-Service space is enhancing the value of our platform to enterprise clients. We are also observing a maturity cycle where many SaaS providers launched in the public cloud then transition to hybrid cloud as they scale and service a wider customer base. We had a great quarter for cloud services adoption, with over 460 enterprises, clouds, IT service providers and networks now interconnecting on our Cloud Exchange. 
Turning to the enterprise. This vertical continues to be the fastest-growing vertical, with a record number of Performance Hub deployments this quarter. Wins included a Fortune 100 manufacturer that is re-architecting by building edge nodes at Equinix and a U.S. federal agency providing delivery services that is deploying multiple Performance Hubs and integrating multiple clouds on our platform. 
Today, over 470 customers have deployed our Performance Hub solution, which helps enterprises optimize their network architectures, access the cloud and drive application performance. Updated for acquisition, cloud and IT services and enterprise verticals now represent 29% and 14% of our revenues, respectively, and we continue to expect these verticals to lead growth as we progress with enterprise cloud adoption. 
And finally, we are seeing solid progress in our channel and partner programs as a percentage of our bookings coming from channel has increased from high single digits 3 years ago to over 15% today. Our channel strategy leverages a range of partner types, each playing a critical role in scaling our enterprise sale sense. 
Platform partners help us leverage mind share and awareness with high-value target customers committed to hybrid cloud as the IT architecture of choice. Referral partners create leverage in our lead-generation engine, and resellers magnify our sales effort and combine key value-added services with Equinix offers to deliver complete solutions that more directly address the integrated needs of enterprise customers. 
By coordinating our sales activity with key partners at the local level, we've been able to meaningfully expand our market reach and have seen our channel program as our most prolific source of new logos for the past several quarters. 
So let me stop here and turn it over to Keith to cover some of the results for the quarter."
28202,374039919,1024411,"Equinix, Inc. (REIT), Equinix, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Equinix, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone on the call. It was great to be able to update you on our second quarter performance, our 54th quarter of top line revenue growth. By almost any measure, this was another strong quarter for Equinix. For t",1795,"Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone on the call. It was great to be able to update you on our second quarter performance, our 54th quarter of top line revenue growth. By almost any measure, this was another strong quarter for Equinix. 
For the first half of 2016, we delivered results better than our expectations and created value for our investors by scaling revenues while improving margins, resulting in meaningful flow-through to adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, both in absolute dollar terms as well as on a per-share basis. 
The organic business continues to perform well, and our acquisitions are delivering against our expectations. Also the number of cross-sell successes and the depth of the sales pipeline continues to grow. Overall, we're delighted with the progress of our integration efforts related to both Bit-isle and Telecity. 
Dell has have moved up the margin curve faster than expected despite our anticipated higher churn levels, and we've optimized the business more quickly than originally planned. As Steve noted, we now expect to sell 3 non-core Bit-isle business lines prior to the end of the year. This allows us to focus on the higher-value colocation and interconnection offerings, along with some managed services in support of the local Tokyo market. 
With regard to Telecity, now that the divestiture process is complete, the team is highly focused on integrating the former Telecity businesses into Equinix as quickly as possible. In July, we fully integrated the Dutch business, which is now operating within our systems and processes. This will soon be followed by the U.K., Irish and Swedish businesses over the next few quarters. 
With regards to our key operating metrics, as highlighted by Steve yet worth mentioning again, our MRR per cabinet yield remains firm at just over $2,000 per cabinet, up $18 on a constant-currency basis over the prior quarter, with particular strength in the Americas region. Also, we added 3,300 net billable cabinets for the quarter, effectively returning to our normal add level. And the MRR churn was lower than expected. 
With respect to our interconnection offerings, net cross-connect additions remains very positive, adding another 6,100 in the quarter. Also, the provision capacity and traffic growth on our Internet exchanges has substantially outpaced our competitors, partially reflected by the meaningful increase in the number of 100 GB ports provisioned on our exchanges. As we measure the health and success of our exchanges, we now will report provision capacity in addition to the total port count to highlight the momentum we're seeing in the interconnection offering. 
Now I'd like to add a few comments on foreign currency movements in the quarter. The U.S. dollar weakened during the back half of Q1 through most of Q2 against many of our operating currency. This resulted in a meaningful FX benefit for the second quarter relative to Q1. However, following the Brexit announcement on June 24, the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against the British pound and the euro. Despite these FX movements, we expect no significant change in either our 2016 revenue or adjusted EBITDA guidance related to FX movement as many of the other operating currencies that we operate in strengthened against the U.S. dollar in Q2.
Now we continue to place currency hedges into our business to reduce financial volatility and protect certainty of our cash flows. Most recently, we benefited from the FX hedges put in place to protect the proceeds we expected to receive from the EMEA asset sale, which was denominated in pound sterling and euros. With these hedges in place, our U.S. dollar proceeds totaled $882 million but would have been $55 million lower without these hedges. Separately, we also hedged approximately 50% of the EMEA revenues and cash flows. As we continue to integrate Telecity into our EMEA business, we'll increase our revenue and net cash flow hedge position. 
So turning to the second quarter. As depicted on Slide 5, global Q2 revenues were $900.5 million, the first time we've achieved this milestone level. Revenues were up 3% over the prior quarter and 15% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant-currency basis. Our global platform continues to expand, with Asia Pacific and EMEA showing organic and constant-currency growth over the same quarter last year of 21% and 15%, respectively, while the Americas region produced steady growth of 12%. 
Our as-reported revenues include $144.5 million from acquisitions, consistent with our expectation. Q2 revenues, net of FX hedges, included a $15.5 million positive currency benefit when compared to the average FX rate used last quarter and a $2 million positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance range. 
Global adjusted EBITDA was $420.3 million, up 5% over the prior quarter and 18% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant-currency basis, above our expectations with a strong revenue flow-through and lower-than-expected utility and integration costs. Our as-reported adjusted EBITDA includes $64 million of contribution from our acquisition and $10 million of integration costs. 
Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46.7%, a 160-basis-point increase over the prior quarter. Our Q2 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a positive $8.7 million currency benefit when compared to the average FX rate used last quarter and a $1.3 million positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance rate. 
Global AFFO was $290.5 million, a 38% increase over the prior quarter and increased 69% -- for an increase to 69% of our adjusted EBITDA. Excluding integration costs, the AFFO on a normalized and constant-currency basis increased 7% over the prior quarter largely due to a strong business performance and lower-than-expected interest expense.
AFFO per share on a fully diluted basis was $4.04 for Q2, or if you exclude integration costs, $4.18 on a per-share basis. After we posted our original earnings deck today, please note that we have reissued our earnings deck and posted a new deck that will include AFFO per-share data.
Moving to churn. Global MRR churn for Q2 was 1.8%, better than our expectations. We expect the MRR churn for the second half of 2016 to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter. And as mentioned at the Analyst Day in June, we continue to expect 2017 MRR churn to average 2% to 2.5% per quarter, which includes the elevated churn in Q1 2017 related to the final phase of LinkedIn's bifurcation strategy.
I've said before, MRR churn can be lumpy and the LinkedIn churn is a perfect example of this. Although the LinkedIn churn will create an increase in both our cabinet and MRR dollar churn, we expect our MRR per cabinet yields to increase at this same point in time, reflective of LinkedIn's per cabinet yield being significantly below the Americas MRR per cabinet average. 
Now I'd like to provide a few highlights on the regions. These full results are covered on Slides 6 through 8. The Americas region had another solid revenue quarter, with particularly strength coming from the Brazilian business. The region's MRR per cabinet yield benefited from continued interconnection growth and lower-than-planned MRR churn. Also, the region had higher-than-expected adjusted EBITDA, largely due to the lower-than-expected utility expenses. 
EMEA delivered another solid quarter of revenues, with particular strength in our Dutch market. EMEA continued to execute against these key business initiatives, including the integration of the Telecity business. 
Asia Pacific remains our fastest-growing region, with strong bookings in our Tokyo- and Sydney-based markets, driven by network and cloud and IT verticals. 
Interconnection revenues continued to outpace overall growth of the business, with the Americas, APAC and EMEA interconnection revenues now at 23%, 13% and 8%, respectively, of recurring revenue. 
Now looking at the balance sheet. Please refer to Slide 9. Unrestricted cash and investments increased to over $1 billion after taking into consideration the proceeds related to the EMEA asset sale as well as funds used to purchase our Paris 2 and 3 assets. 
Again, as mentioned during the Analyst Day, although our business plan remains fully funded, including the partial drawdown of our revolving line of credit, we do expect to fully consume the cash in our balance sheet as we continue to invest in scaling our organic business with capital expansion initiatives as well as returning capital to our shareholders through our quarterly cash dividend payout. 
Finally, we settled the remaining portion of our June -- the remaining portion of our June '16 convertible debt instrument and capital with a net 1.6 million of shares issued. Our pro forma net leverage stepped down to 3.5x our Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA, largely due to the cash received from the EMEA asset sales, bringing us back into our targeted net leverage range of 3x to 4x adjusted EBITDA. 
Now switching to AFFO and dividends on Slide 10. For 2016, we're raising our as-reported AFFO to now range between $1.04 billion and $1.05 billion, a 26% year-over-year increase, the results of strong operating performance and lower-than-planned interest expense. 
Our normalized and constant-currency AFFO is expected to now range between 1.15 -- sorry, $1.159 billion and 1 point -- pardon me, we'll start again. $1.159 billion and $1.169 billion or a 32% increase over the prior year. Normalizing for integration costs and the Telecity FX translation loss in Q1, our 2016 fully diluted AFFO per share is expected to increase 11% year-over-year to $16.21 using on a weighted average 71.7 million common shares outstanding as presented on Page 32 of our earnings deck. 
Also today, we announced our Q3 dividend of $1.75 a share, consistent with our Q2 quarterly dividend. Our AFFO payout ratio is estimated to be 48% for 2016. 
Now looking at CapEx. Please refer to Slide 11. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $250 million, including a recurring CapEx of $32 million, below our guidance expectations due to timing of cash payments to our contractors. Given our currently high utilization rate of 82% as well as the strong development of returns across our new expansion and stabilized IBXs, we continue to invest in many of our key markets with 19 in-progress build, 8 of which are expected to open by the end of this year. As a result, we expect to spend between $950 million and $1 billion of CapEx in 2016. 
With respect to the new build, we've opened Sydney 4 earlier this month, our 146th data center and our fifth in the Australian market. This large-scale facility will provide 3,000 cabinets of colocation space when fully built out, effectively doubling our existing capacity in Sydney. 
And finally, we've provided you a number of slides that bridge our 2016 guidance from the normalized 2015 performance, including slides for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Please refer to Slides 12 through 16. 
I'll now turn the call back to Steve."

And finally, on Slide 16, which summarizes our updated Q3 and full year 2016 guidance, including the impact of FX changes. 
Now let me cover our updated 2016 outlook. For the full year of 2016, we're raising our revenue guidance to now range between $3.598 billion and $3.608 billion, a 32% as-reported growth or organic and constant-currency growth rate of 13.8% compared to the prior year. This $8 million revenue increase includes a positive $2 million FX benefit when compared to prior guidance rate.
Net of adjustments for Paris 2 and 3 acquisition and Bit-isle divestitures, revenue is stepping up $3 million, the result of our strong Q2 performance. For 2016, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to now range between $1.658 billion and $1.668 billion, a 31% as-reported increase for organic and constant-currency growth rate of 16.8% compared to the prior year. This $13 million adjusted EBITDA increase includes a positive $1 million FX benefit when compared to prior guidance rate. Net of adjustments for the Paris 2 and 3 acquisition and Bit-isle divestitures, adjusted EBITDA is stepping up $8 million, the result of our strong Q2 operating performance. 
And the growth of our business is driving increased adjusted funds from operations, which drives corporate cash flows and ultimately, dividend. We're now raising our AFFO to range between $1.04 billion and $1.05 billion, a 32% normalized and constant-currency growth rate compared to the prior year. This $30 million AFFO increase has negligible foreign currency benefits when compared to prior guidance. And finally, we are narrowing our 2016 capital expenditures to now range between $950 million and $1 billion for the year. 
So in closing, we continue to achieve above-market growth rates while reinforcing and extending our differentiated market position. We are capturing the significant shift to the cloud, executing well to capture the enterprise and continuing to invest across the business. The benefits of our interconnection strategy drive a growing and durable business that will continue to increase our revenues, AFFO, cash flow and dividend. 
So let me stop here, and we'll open it up for questions. I'll turn it back over to you, Sam."

And that's definitely showing up in terms of how people are adding interconnection both in terms of cross-connects as well as greater leverage in our other interconnection-oriented services like Metro Connect, et cetera. So we're adding nice interconnection revenue. And then, of course, we are seeing interconnection -- I'm sorry, power densities increase on average. And we have quite a unique advantage in that we have a very large number of customers across a range of power densities, which allows us to continue to extract underutilized power and use it to our economic advantage. So we see both of those factors, and they continue to drive into very healthy performance on stabilized IBXs."

Maybe the intersection of that and sort of the organic growth expectations for the year, they moved up 40 basis points.

So let me start by taking you through revenue at the highest level. As you know, we revised our guidance up by roughly a net $8 million. 50% of that $8 million really comes from the acquisition of the Paris 2, 3 assets. That will add roughly $4 million of revenue to the second half of the year. For all intents and purposes, the FX and the divestitures that we referred to from Bit-isle, they will offset each other. So we have a little bit of a positive currency benefit, offset by the loss of the divestitures. So that really is leaving roughly 50% of $4 million of value attributed to the performance in our Q2 result. So that all said, that gives you a 13.8% year-over-year growth rate on an organic basis. As we look at the acquisitions, so both Bit-isle and Telecity, they're performing against our expectations. As you've heard us say before, there's a lot of friction as we close out the Telecity transaction and then sold off a number of the assets. We're now looking forward to seeing the focus on that business, and I would expect that, at some point, to see the momentum pick up in Telecity. As it relates to Bit-isle, as you've heard us refer to, there was a lot of churn that was embedded in the business. And yes, we're experiencing the churn, but the team is continuing to perform well. And so in both cases, when we combine and look at the acquisitions, they are performing to our expectations. The last thing I'll say is one of the things that probably is -- well, let me say 2 things. One of the things that's probably not clearly evident is as we think about our booking expectations, we delivered almost exactly what we expected for the quarter end and so very consistent with performance relative to what we have seen in the prior quarters from a gross and net bookings perspective. That all said, there's been a positive increase effectively to our backlog because as we think about the complexity of the global hybrid cloud implementation, they're extending the book to bill into both. And to give you a sense of a size or order of magnitude in there about $4 million of delayed revenue associated with increased backlog attributed to our book to bill into both. So that would be that one -- second to last comment. And the last comment I'd make is as we think about nonrecurring, back to your initial question, nonrecurring, we saw a little bit of an uptick this quarter over and above what we originally anticipated. But we still have the -- our underlaying assumption is nonrecurring revenue will revert closer to 5% as we scale through the year. And to the extent there's any change in that, we'll certainly guide to, but that's the assumption that we've made in the Q3 -- sorry, the updated revenue guidance."

I think overall, when you look at how we're performing, one of the things that you'll notice is the number of net cabinet add that we had this quarter, and so we're back up to 3,300 net cab add. So again, they're showing continued momentum in the business. As I said, we're still driving -- we're driving our bookings engine as we expect. And with momentum that we think that will continue to come from the channel, that gives us -- it gives us a, perhaps a greater opportunity as we look forward. All that said, you can see our utilization levels moving up. And so one of the things I would leave with you is as we see utilization levels move up, there's really a need for us -- there's 8 new projects that are coming online this year, and there's 19 that are in the hopper -- it's important for us to continue to build out our expansion initiatives so that we can continue to sell at that same clip with the same set of opportunities. Certainly, there's a number of markets where, all else being equal, we have some constrained inventory issues that we have to address.

But I also would say that we're seeing the unique strengths of Equinix begin to become increasingly important to the targeted buyers that we -- that we're going after. So the global reach, the ability to implement hybrid cloud effectively and gain access to the cloud density that we have and implement multi-cloud effectively, those are things that I think we're seeing in terms of -- and if we look at our bookings in the really, what we see as the critical growth verticals of cloud and IT and enterprise, really the 2 sides of the cloud ecosystem. Again, they continue to over-index. I think this is the ninth quarter in a row that, that's been the case.

As it relates to Q3, as you know, it's typically our seasonally high utilities quarter. And if you go back a dozen years, you're going to see that historically, utilities move up in that market, particularly in the -- in Silicon Valley and then certainly some of our European markets. As a result, there's $7 million of incremental utilities expense in Q3 that was not there in Q2. And so although we got the benefit of utilities, I refer to that in our overperformance in Q2, we're still going to see a meaningful step-up of $7 million. So that would take your quarter-over-quarter EBITDA growth up to a roughly 3.7%. So that'd be the first comment. As it relates to Paris, one of the benefits that we have, as we said, there's a great opportunity as a company as we acquire asset. We can operate it differently than the landlord. And in this case, there's an opportunity as we think about the revenue we can derive from increment -- from the incremental customers inside those data centers. In addition to the fact that as we think about the lease treatment, probably going to look -- the lease treatment or the acquisition treatment is going to look as if you take all those operating costs away as a business, and then you put it on to your balance sheet, and then you'll have some depreciation. So we get the benefit attributed to revenue. So we also remove the costs associated with how we treated those assets. And then also operationally, we think we can leverage off of our existing -- that suggests we're not going to make some incremental investments. We can leverage off our existing staff, and so we get the benefit of that incremental revenue without having to meaningfully augment our staff. So in both cases, you get a nice top line and you also get a nice bottom line improvement. And then you'll continue to see us make good strategic decisions around those 2 assets and how to explore an even better return from the costs that we acquired these assets from DLR at."

And we typically see CSC, strictly those who have global aspirations, and that tends to be the bulk of them, operating across our regions and they tend to have pretty high total IBX count. And then on the enterprise side, similarly, in order to implement these interconnection-oriented architectures and take advantage of the network density and cloud density we have, they tend to start with the, as I said earlier, with a few locations and then have a land-and-expand sort of appetite or behavior over time. So we definitely are seeing, I think, an increasing average number of IBXs for a deployment of customers. And we certainly believe that, that will continue."

So we do see a little bit of that sort of big build-out bubble as maybe taking a bit of a breather, but we're seeing, particularly for us, because of our global footprint, see strong demand from the CSPs and then, again, translating that into momentum on the buy side of the ecosystem with the enterprise."

I'll take the hedging question, Mike, and Steve or Charles will jump in on the other one. First, as it relates to hedging, our philosophy is to, as you know, is to provide effectively a soft landing for currencies as they move around, including to provide predictability with our results and with more focus on revenues and then also to create some certainty around our cash flows, again, because we're distributing a lot of our capital today back to the shareholders. So those are 2 things that are highly important for us. And so when we think about how we deploy our hedges, number one, there's been increased volatility. And so one of the things that we wanted to do is try and feather out these hedges over a longer period of time. And so we are hedging partially into 2018 now. We're focusing on typically the European currencies because of -- without getting overly complex, our business in Europe is run as U.S. dollar functional. And when we hedge against our -- whether revenues or costs for our cash flow hedges, we get to treating against the lines in which we're hedging. So those are things that we try and do. And clearly, as a result, you're seeing the benefit of us not only in our results but also on our guidance rates on how we've layered in those hedges over a period of time. So absolutely, we're benefiting from the hedges, but it'll depend on the currencies and the markets that we're talking about. But the philosophy is to continue to hedge, and then there also is our cash -- as I said, there's the cash flow hedges, then the hedges that we put in place when we're moving money around the markets. And in this case, as you know, with the pending sale of the EMEA assets, we wanted to make sure we hedge the cash flow associated with that. And as I said, absent putting that hedge in place, we would have been $55 million shorter have we not put our hedges in place because of what happened with Brexit. And so again, we're being very thoughtful about our overall hedging strategy to create that predictability with our cash flows but also make sure that there's a smooth glide path as currencies rebase in some cases, like the euro or the pound, yet at the same time, you're going to get the volatility pick up because we only hedge to 70%, 80% of the exposure."

Thanks, Katrina, and good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. We had a great first half of 2016, delivering both revenues and adjusted EBITDA above the top end of our guidance range as our global scale and reach, strength of our digital ecosystems and service excellence continue to drive profitable growth. 
As depicted on Slide 3 of our presentation, second quarter revenues were $900.5 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 15% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant-currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $420.3 million for the quarter, up 5% over the prior quarter and up 18% year-over-year on an organic and constant-currency basis. This drove AFFO growth of 37% year-over-year on a normalized and constant-currency basis. 
We delivered strong growth in net bookings, with increasing contribution from our indirect channel. Our key operating metrics continue to be very healthy with firm MRR per cabinet, low churn and strong growth in both billable cabinet and interconnection. We continue to progress against key operational and business objectives in 2016 to grow our market position globally, centering on successful acquisition integration, sustained organic development and scaling our interconnection services. So let me provide some commentary in each of these in turn. 
Starting with acquisition. We are focusing our energy on successfully integrating Telecity and Bit-isle, scaling the business to drive even more value for our customers and enhancing our cloud and network density across EMEA and Asia. We've delivered against key integration goals and milestones and are pleased with the progress we have made in the first half. 
The Telecity business delivered solid financial performance despite normal integration challenges and complexity associated with the divestitures, and we are seeing value creation across a broad range of synergy category. Our EMEA sales force has been fully integrated, and our cross-selling program is tracking ahead of plan, with particular customer interest in the overlapping markets of London and Amsterdam and our new markets in Stockholm and Manchester. 
The financial and IT systems work is well under way, and we've defined the critical initiatives to operationally integrate our back op. We have completed the first large systems conversion with the Telecity Dutch business now operating within the Equinix corporate systems and processes and plan to migrate the remaining countries through 2017. 
In early July, we also completed the sale of 8 European assets for $882 million updated for FX, as required by the European Commission as part of its approval of our purchase of TelecityGroup. Completing this last milestone in the acquisition process paves the way for us to fully focus on selling our new combined European platform. 
We're also pleased with Bit-isle's progress, and the market reaction to the acquisition has been positive. The business is performing well, with cross-selling momentum accelerating including several wins with Japanese multinationals that are leveraging space and connectivity across existing and acquired sites. We are further optimizing this business by divesting 2 small non-core businesses, which we completed in the first half of 2016. We also expect to divest Terra Power, a collection of solar power assets, in the second half of this year. 
Turning to our organic development activity. We continue to invest and expand globally. Allocating 95% of our expansion capital to building out campus or existing market build for a deep knowledge of fill rate, pipeline and competitive supply leads to higher returns. We now have 19 announced expansion projects under way. In this quarter, we are moving forward with additional expansions in Ashburn, Frankfurt, Paris and Singapore, totaling over $250 million of capital expenditures. 
We are starting work on DC12, the first data center build in our Ashburn North Campus in Northern Virginia, which is on 44 acres of owned, undeveloped land next to our current Ashburn campus. Today, Ashburn is one of our major campuses with over 14,000 cabinets across 10 IBXs, and it's the largest Internet exchange point in North America. The new Ashburn North Campus, which we plan to develop over the next few years, will expand our asset ownership and effectively double our capacity in this important market. 
Turning to Frankfurt. We see continued demand in this vibrant market coming from Internet and cloud providers due to data sovereignty compliance as well as financial services growth. We are building Frankfurt 6, a new IBX located on owned land next to Frankfurt 4 and tethered to our core network hub in this market. 
These capital investments are delivering very healthy growth and strong returns as shown on Slide 4. Revenues from our 70 stabilized IBXs grew 8% year-over-year, above our historical trend line and largely driven by an increase in cross-connect and power density. We continue to find ways to optimize our asset base, putting the right customer and application into the right asset, which drives a firm yield per cabinet. These stabilized assets are generating a 32% cash-on-cash return on the gross PP&E invested, and utilization remains at a stable 86%. 
In terms of our asset ownership strategy, our goal is to produce over 50% from owned properties over time by developing land such as in Silicon Valley and Ashburn as well as purchasing additional site as it makes economic and strategic sense. Consistent with this strategy, we purchased our Paris 2 and 3 IBXs for $211 million from Digital Realty, which closed this week. 
Over 70 carriers reside in Paris 2 and 3. This stack is the most densely connected data center campus in France. Ownership will enable us to achieve better operating costs, enhanced customer service and further expand this campus over time. The acquisition of Paris 2 and 3 is an example of where we can acquire assets and operate the property more efficiently for our own purpose, thereby allowing us to enjoy a higher return. With this purchase, 35% of our revenues now come from owned assets. 
Turning to interconnection. The need to build next-generation IT architectures that connect network, cloud, people and data continues to drive customer demand for interconnection. We now have 183,000 cross-connect, and interconnection revenue grew 21% year-over-year on an organic and constant-currency basis. 
Interconnection revenues represent 16% of our global recurring revenues, and this is the eighth quarter in a row where we had a greater than 5,000 cross-connects. We saw a particularly strong growth in connections to cloud providers, with accelerated additions of participants, ports and virtual circuit on our market-leading Cloud Exchange platform and strong sales of cross-connect to facilitate Direct Connect into the pure-play cloud. 
Our Internet exchange continues to scale with 5.6 terabits of peak traffic, growing over 35% year-over-year as network and cloud providers upgrade their capacity and transition to 100 GB equipment. The transition to cloud continues to unfold as enterprises are re-architecting IT to drive down costs, improve performance and leverage clouds and network. 
We continue to see growth in Fortune 500 new customer and expansion wins as the explosion of data and devices are transforming how large multinationals architect their infrastructure, leveraging interconnection as a core design principle. We added 7 new Fortune 500 customers in the quarter such as Ticketmaster, an online ticket vendor, leveraging Equinix to improve digital experience and integrate cloud infrastructure. We now have over 150 of the Fortune 500 customers and over 500 of the Global 2000. 
Now let me cover quarterly highlights from our industry vertical, starting with the network. This vertical experienced strong bookings, led by strength in Asia as wireline providers including Telstra, SingTel and Softbank expanded with multi-region deployment. We saw growth with regional Internet service providers including U.S. Internet Corp., a regional ISP peering to support growing enterprise cloud demand; and GCI, a regional telecom provider adding cloud connectivity capabilities via our Cloud Exchange to augment their network service offering. 
Additionally, our strength as a global platform allows us to target strategic subsea cable projects to land within our ecosystem hub, and we are seeing pipeline and activity build in this growing segment including 2 new wins this quarter. Equinix is the biggest aggregator of digital ecosystems, making us the most logical choice for subsea cable operators to get the immediate benefit tapping into a mature ecosystem of buyers. 
The financial services vertical experienced continued expansion into our core electronic trading ecosystem as well as diversification into other subsegments. This quarter, we saw additional expansions from investment banks such as Morgan Stanley that are leveraging Equinix for critical data center, network and cloud connectivity. We are also observing the beginning of clustering of electronic payment counterparties across regions, including the addition of Merchant Customer Exchange, a leading merchant payment system that is deployed to peer traffic and connect to multiple clouds. 
In the content digital media vertical, advertisers and digital media were the growth drivers for booking. Asia delivered strong bookings this quarter, reflecting digital adoption in the region. Customer wins included Index Exchange, a premier ad tech firm, leveraging Ad-IX; and Taboola, a content discovery platform, optimizing performance at the edge to better serve the APAC region. 
The cloud and IT services vertical is the second fastest-growing vertical driven by cloud hyperscalers continue to deploy access nodes globally as well strategic wins with leading SaaS providers. Our traction in the Software-as-a-Service space is enhancing the value of our platform to enterprise clients. We are also observing a maturity cycle where many SaaS providers launched in the public cloud then transition to hybrid cloud as they scale and service a wider customer base. We had a great quarter for cloud services adoption, with over 460 enterprises, clouds, IT service providers and networks now interconnecting on our Cloud Exchange. 
Turning to the enterprise. This vertical continues to be the fastest-growing vertical, with a record number of Performance Hub deployments this quarter. Wins included a Fortune 100 manufacturer that is re-architecting by building edge nodes at Equinix and a U.S. federal agency providing delivery services that is deploying multiple Performance Hubs and integrating multiple clouds on our platform. 
Today, over 470 customers have deployed our Performance Hub solution, which helps enterprises optimize their network architectures, access the cloud and drive application performance. Updated for acquisition, cloud and IT services and enterprise verticals now represent 29% and 14% of our revenues, respectively, and we continue to expect these verticals to lead growth as we progress with enterprise cloud adoption. 
And finally, we are seeing solid progress in our channel and partner programs as a percentage of our bookings coming from channel has increased from high single digits 3 years ago to over 15% today. Our channel strategy leverages a range of partner types, each playing a critical role in scaling our enterprise sale sense. 
Platform partners help us leverage mind share and awareness with high-value target customers committed to hybrid cloud as the IT architecture of choice. Referral partners create leverage in our lead-generation engine, and resellers magnify our sales effort and combine key value-added services with Equinix offers to deliver complete solutions that more directly address the integrated needs of enterprise customers. 
By coordinating our sales activity with key partners at the local level, we've been able to meaningfully expand our market reach and have seen our channel program as our most prolific source of new logos for the past several quarters. 
So let me stop here and turn it over to Keith to cover some of the results for the quarter."
28202,374039919,1025211,"Equinix, Inc. (REIT), Equinix, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Equinix, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone on the call. It was great to be able to update you on our second quarter performance, our 54th quarter of top line revenue growth. By almost any measure, this was another strong quarter for Equinix. For t",1795,"Great. Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon to everyone on the call. It was great to be able to update you on our second quarter performance, our 54th quarter of top line revenue growth. By almost any measure, this was another strong quarter for Equinix. 
For the first half of 2016, we delivered results better than our expectations and created value for our investors by scaling revenues while improving margins, resulting in meaningful flow-through to adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, both in absolute dollar terms as well as on a per-share basis. 
The organic business continues to perform well, and our acquisitions are delivering against our expectations. Also the number of cross-sell successes and the depth of the sales pipeline continues to grow. Overall, we're delighted with the progress of our integration efforts related to both Bit-isle and Telecity. 
Dell has have moved up the margin curve faster than expected despite our anticipated higher churn levels, and we've optimized the business more quickly than originally planned. As Steve noted, we now expect to sell 3 non-core Bit-isle business lines prior to the end of the year. This allows us to focus on the higher-value colocation and interconnection offerings, along with some managed services in support of the local Tokyo market. 
With regard to Telecity, now that the divestiture process is complete, the team is highly focused on integrating the former Telecity businesses into Equinix as quickly as possible. In July, we fully integrated the Dutch business, which is now operating within our systems and processes. This will soon be followed by the U.K., Irish and Swedish businesses over the next few quarters. 
With regards to our key operating metrics, as highlighted by Steve yet worth mentioning again, our MRR per cabinet yield remains firm at just over $2,000 per cabinet, up $18 on a constant-currency basis over the prior quarter, with particular strength in the Americas region. Also, we added 3,300 net billable cabinets for the quarter, effectively returning to our normal add level. And the MRR churn was lower than expected. 
With respect to our interconnection offerings, net cross-connect additions remains very positive, adding another 6,100 in the quarter. Also, the provision capacity and traffic growth on our Internet exchanges has substantially outpaced our competitors, partially reflected by the meaningful increase in the number of 100 GB ports provisioned on our exchanges. As we measure the health and success of our exchanges, we now will report provision capacity in addition to the total port count to highlight the momentum we're seeing in the interconnection offering. 
Now I'd like to add a few comments on foreign currency movements in the quarter. The U.S. dollar weakened during the back half of Q1 through most of Q2 against many of our operating currency. This resulted in a meaningful FX benefit for the second quarter relative to Q1. However, following the Brexit announcement on June 24, the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against the British pound and the euro. Despite these FX movements, we expect no significant change in either our 2016 revenue or adjusted EBITDA guidance related to FX movement as many of the other operating currencies that we operate in strengthened against the U.S. dollar in Q2.
Now we continue to place currency hedges into our business to reduce financial volatility and protect certainty of our cash flows. Most recently, we benefited from the FX hedges put in place to protect the proceeds we expected to receive from the EMEA asset sale, which was denominated in pound sterling and euros. With these hedges in place, our U.S. dollar proceeds totaled $882 million but would have been $55 million lower without these hedges. Separately, we also hedged approximately 50% of the EMEA revenues and cash flows. As we continue to integrate Telecity into our EMEA business, we'll increase our revenue and net cash flow hedge position. 
So turning to the second quarter. As depicted on Slide 5, global Q2 revenues were $900.5 million, the first time we've achieved this milestone level. Revenues were up 3% over the prior quarter and 15% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant-currency basis. Our global platform continues to expand, with Asia Pacific and EMEA showing organic and constant-currency growth over the same quarter last year of 21% and 15%, respectively, while the Americas region produced steady growth of 12%. 
Our as-reported revenues include $144.5 million from acquisitions, consistent with our expectation. Q2 revenues, net of FX hedges, included a $15.5 million positive currency benefit when compared to the average FX rate used last quarter and a $2 million positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance range. 
Global adjusted EBITDA was $420.3 million, up 5% over the prior quarter and 18% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant-currency basis, above our expectations with a strong revenue flow-through and lower-than-expected utility and integration costs. Our as-reported adjusted EBITDA includes $64 million of contribution from our acquisition and $10 million of integration costs. 
Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 46.7%, a 160-basis-point increase over the prior quarter. Our Q2 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, reflects a positive $8.7 million currency benefit when compared to the average FX rate used last quarter and a $1.3 million positive benefit when compared to our FX guidance rate. 
Global AFFO was $290.5 million, a 38% increase over the prior quarter and increased 69% -- for an increase to 69% of our adjusted EBITDA. Excluding integration costs, the AFFO on a normalized and constant-currency basis increased 7% over the prior quarter largely due to a strong business performance and lower-than-expected interest expense.
AFFO per share on a fully diluted basis was $4.04 for Q2, or if you exclude integration costs, $4.18 on a per-share basis. After we posted our original earnings deck today, please note that we have reissued our earnings deck and posted a new deck that will include AFFO per-share data.
Moving to churn. Global MRR churn for Q2 was 1.8%, better than our expectations. We expect the MRR churn for the second half of 2016 to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5% per quarter. And as mentioned at the Analyst Day in June, we continue to expect 2017 MRR churn to average 2% to 2.5% per quarter, which includes the elevated churn in Q1 2017 related to the final phase of LinkedIn's bifurcation strategy.
I've said before, MRR churn can be lumpy and the LinkedIn churn is a perfect example of this. Although the LinkedIn churn will create an increase in both our cabinet and MRR dollar churn, we expect our MRR per cabinet yields to increase at this same point in time, reflective of LinkedIn's per cabinet yield being significantly below the Americas MRR per cabinet average. 
Now I'd like to provide a few highlights on the regions. These full results are covered on Slides 6 through 8. The Americas region had another solid revenue quarter, with particularly strength coming from the Brazilian business. The region's MRR per cabinet yield benefited from continued interconnection growth and lower-than-planned MRR churn. Also, the region had higher-than-expected adjusted EBITDA, largely due to the lower-than-expected utility expenses. 
EMEA delivered another solid quarter of revenues, with particular strength in our Dutch market. EMEA continued to execute against these key business initiatives, including the integration of the Telecity business. 
Asia Pacific remains our fastest-growing region, with strong bookings in our Tokyo- and Sydney-based markets, driven by network and cloud and IT verticals. 
Interconnection revenues continued to outpace overall growth of the business, with the Americas, APAC and EMEA interconnection revenues now at 23%, 13% and 8%, respectively, of recurring revenue. 
Now looking at the balance sheet. Please refer to Slide 9. Unrestricted cash and investments increased to over $1 billion after taking into consideration the proceeds related to the EMEA asset sale as well as funds used to purchase our Paris 2 and 3 assets. 
Again, as mentioned during the Analyst Day, although our business plan remains fully funded, including the partial drawdown of our revolving line of credit, we do expect to fully consume the cash in our balance sheet as we continue to invest in scaling our organic business with capital expansion initiatives as well as returning capital to our shareholders through our quarterly cash dividend payout. 
Finally, we settled the remaining portion of our June -- the remaining portion of our June '16 convertible debt instrument and capital with a net 1.6 million of shares issued. Our pro forma net leverage stepped down to 3.5x our Q2 annualized adjusted EBITDA, largely due to the cash received from the EMEA asset sales, bringing us back into our targeted net leverage range of 3x to 4x adjusted EBITDA. 
Now switching to AFFO and dividends on Slide 10. For 2016, we're raising our as-reported AFFO to now range between $1.04 billion and $1.05 billion, a 26% year-over-year increase, the results of strong operating performance and lower-than-planned interest expense. 
Our normalized and constant-currency AFFO is expected to now range between 1.15 -- sorry, $1.159 billion and 1 point -- pardon me, we'll start again. $1.159 billion and $1.169 billion or a 32% increase over the prior year. Normalizing for integration costs and the Telecity FX translation loss in Q1, our 2016 fully diluted AFFO per share is expected to increase 11% year-over-year to $16.21 using on a weighted average 71.7 million common shares outstanding as presented on Page 32 of our earnings deck. 
Also today, we announced our Q3 dividend of $1.75 a share, consistent with our Q2 quarterly dividend. Our AFFO payout ratio is estimated to be 48% for 2016. 
Now looking at CapEx. Please refer to Slide 11. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $250 million, including a recurring CapEx of $32 million, below our guidance expectations due to timing of cash payments to our contractors. Given our currently high utilization rate of 82% as well as the strong development of returns across our new expansion and stabilized IBXs, we continue to invest in many of our key markets with 19 in-progress build, 8 of which are expected to open by the end of this year. As a result, we expect to spend between $950 million and $1 billion of CapEx in 2016. 
With respect to the new build, we've opened Sydney 4 earlier this month, our 146th data center and our fifth in the Australian market. This large-scale facility will provide 3,000 cabinets of colocation space when fully built out, effectively doubling our existing capacity in Sydney. 
And finally, we've provided you a number of slides that bridge our 2016 guidance from the normalized 2015 performance, including slides for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Please refer to Slides 12 through 16. 
I'll now turn the call back to Steve."

And finally, on Slide 16, which summarizes our updated Q3 and full year 2016 guidance, including the impact of FX changes. Now let me cover our updated 2016 outlook.

And finally, on Slide 16, which summarizes our updated Q3 and full year 2016 guidance, including the impact of FX changes. 
Now let me cover our updated 2016 outlook. For the full year of 2016, we're raising our revenue guidance to now range between $3.598 billion and $3.608 billion, a 32% as-reported growth or organic and constant-currency growth rate of 13.8% compared to the prior year. This $8 million revenue increase includes a positive $2 million FX benefit when compared to prior guidance rate.
Net of adjustments for Paris 2 and 3 acquisition and Bit-isle divestitures, revenue is stepping up $3 million, the result of our strong Q2 performance. For 2016, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to now range between $1.658 billion and $1.668 billion, a 31% as-reported increase for organic and constant-currency growth rate of 16.8% compared to the prior year. This $13 million adjusted EBITDA increase includes a positive $1 million FX benefit when compared to prior guidance rate. Net of adjustments for the Paris 2 and 3 acquisition and Bit-isle divestitures, adjusted EBITDA is stepping up $8 million, the result of our strong Q2 operating performance. 
And the growth of our business is driving increased adjusted funds from operations, which drives corporate cash flows and ultimately, dividend. We're now raising our AFFO to range between $1.04 billion and $1.05 billion, a 32% normalized and constant-currency growth rate compared to the prior year. This $30 million AFFO increase has negligible foreign currency benefits when compared to prior guidance. And finally, we are narrowing our 2016 capital expenditures to now range between $950 million and $1 billion for the year. 
So in closing, we continue to achieve above-market growth rates while reinforcing and extending our differentiated market position. We are capturing the significant shift to the cloud, executing well to capture the enterprise and continuing to invest across the business. The benefits of our interconnection strategy drive a growing and durable business that will continue to increase our revenues, AFFO, cash flow and dividend. 
So let me stop here, and we'll open it up for questions. I'll turn it back over to you, Sam."

So a lot of that's attributed to, again, power and interconnection revenue. As a result, no matter where you look across our portfolio, in all 3 cases, our MRR per cabinet has moved up and to the right. That's reflective of the performance across all 3 regions. And as a result, you're seeing that benefit really holds true in all stabilized assets at each of our markets."

And that's definitely showing up in terms of how people are adding interconnection both in terms of cross-connects as well as greater leverage in our other interconnection-oriented services like Metro Connect, et cetera. So we're adding nice interconnection revenue. And then, of course, we are seeing interconnection -- I'm sorry, power densities increase on average. And we have quite a unique advantage in that we have a very large number of customers across a range of power densities, which allows us to continue to extract underutilized power and use it to our economic advantage. So we see both of those factors, and they continue to drive into very healthy performance on stabilized IBXs."

We have targeted business development efforts that make a very concerted effort to sit down and talk about who we think the critical magnets are going to be, deploy business development resources to go out and engage with those players, optimize Cloud Exchange to enable integration with those services and really begin to see the clustering and curating of those ecosystems that we've duplicated -- that we've done in the past with others.

There's a lot of moving parts here, and I just wanted to understand a few things, and maybe you can tell me how they all fit together. The first thing I'd say is I think last quarter, you sort of said that nonrecurring revenues would take a step down, maybe $5 million and $6 million. And I don't think that really materialized this quarter, and so I'm just trying to understand what happened there. Maybe the intersection of that and sort of the organic growth expectations for the year, they moved up 40 basis points. But still when I look back over the first half of the year, you had 16% in the first quarter and 15% organic growth in the second quarter, and so just trying to figure out how that all fits together."

So let me start by taking you through revenue at the highest level. As you know, we revised our guidance up by roughly a net $8 million. 50% of that $8 million really comes from the acquisition of the Paris 2, 3 assets. That will add roughly $4 million of revenue to the second half of the year. For all intents and purposes, the FX and the divestitures that we referred to from Bit-isle, they will offset each other. So we have a little bit of a positive currency benefit, offset by the loss of the divestitures. So that really is leaving roughly 50% of $4 million of value attributed to the performance in our Q2 result. So that all said, that gives you a 13.8% year-over-year growth rate on an organic basis. As we look at the acquisitions, so both Bit-isle and Telecity, they're performing against our expectations. As you've heard us say before, there's a lot of friction as we close out the Telecity transaction and then sold off a number of the assets. We're now looking forward to seeing the focus on that business, and I would expect that, at some point, to see the momentum pick up in Telecity. As it relates to Bit-isle, as you've heard us refer to, there was a lot of churn that was embedded in the business. And yes, we're experiencing the churn, but the team is continuing to perform well. And so in both cases, when we combine and look at the acquisitions, they are performing to our expectations. The last thing I'll say is one of the things that probably is -- well, let me say 2 things. One of the things that's probably not clearly evident is as we think about our booking expectations, we delivered almost exactly what we expected for the quarter end and so very consistent with performance relative to what we have seen in the prior quarters from a gross and net bookings perspective. That all said, there's been a positive increase effectively to our backlog because as we think about the complexity of the global hybrid cloud implementation, they're extending the book to bill into both. And to give you a sense of a size or order of magnitude in there about $4 million of delayed revenue associated with increased backlog attributed to our book to bill into both. So that would be that one -- second to last comment. And the last comment I'd make is as we think about nonrecurring, back to your initial question, nonrecurring, we saw a little bit of an uptick this quarter over and above what we originally anticipated. But we still have the -- our underlying assumption is nonrecurring revenue will revert closer to 5% as we scale through the year. And to the extent there's any change in that, we'll certainly guide to, but that's the assumption that we've made in the Q3 -- sorry, the updated revenue guidance."

I think overall, when you look at how we're performing, one of the things that you'll notice is the number of net cabinet add that we had this quarter, and so we're back up to 3,300 net cab add. So again, they're showing continued momentum in the business. As I said, we're still driving -- we're driving our bookings engine as we expect. And with momentum that we think that will continue to come from the channel, that gives us -- it gives us a, perhaps a greater opportunity as we look forward. All that said, you can see our utilization levels moving up. And so one of the things I would leave with you is as we see utilization levels move up, there's really a need for us -- there's 8 new projects that are coming online this year, and there's 19 that are in the hopper -- it's important for us to continue to build out our expansion initiatives so that we can continue to sell at that same clip with the same set of opportunities. Certainly, there's a number of markets where, all else being equal, we have some constrained inventory issues that we have to address. And hence, we're really focused on making sure that we continue to develop those properties."

No meaningful change in my view, but I would say that as we look across the globe, I think we see pretty favorable supply-demand dynamics across all of our operating regions, which I think continues to mean that the overall market is operating with a pretty high level of discipline. But I also would say that we're seeing the unique strengths of Equinix begin to become increasingly important to the targeted buyers that we -- that we're going after. So the global reach, the ability to implement hybrid cloud effectively and gain access to the cloud density that we have and implement multi-cloud effectively, those are things that I think we're seeing in terms of -- and if we look at our bookings in the really, what we see as the critical growth verticals of cloud and IT and enterprise, really the 2 sides of the cloud ecosystem. Again, they continue to over-index. I think this is the ninth quarter in a row that, that's been the case. And that speaks to, I think, the competitive dynamic in terms of our ability to win really targeted implementation."

But when I look at your guidance for the third quarter, it's implying roughly an $18 million increase to revenue at the midpoint and about a $2 million increase to EBITDA.

As it relates to Q3, as you know, it's typically our seasonally high utilities quarter. And if you go back a dozen years, you're going to see that historically, utilities move up in that market, particularly in the -- in Silicon Valley and then certainly some of our European markets. As a result, there's $7 million of incremental utilities expense in Q3 that was not there in Q2. And so although we got the benefit of utilities, I refer to that in our overperformance in Q2, we're still going to see a meaningful step-up of $7 million. So that would take your quarter-over-quarter EBITDA growth up to a roughly 3.7%. So that'd be the first comment. As it relates to Paris, one of the benefits that we have, as we said, there's a great opportunity as a company as we acquire asset. We can operate it differently than the landlord. And in this case, there's an opportunity as we think about the revenue we can derive from increment -- from the incremental customers inside those data centers. In addition to the fact that as we think about the lease treatment, probably going to look -- the lease treatment or the acquisition treatment is going to look as if you take all those operating costs away as a business, and then you put it on to your balance sheet, and then you'll have some depreciation. So we get the benefit attributed to revenue. So we also remove the costs associated with how we treated those assets. And then also operationally, we think we can leverage off of our existing -- that suggests we're not going to make some incremental investments. We can leverage off our existing staff, and so we get the benefit of that incremental revenue without having to meaningfully augment our staff. So in both cases, you get a nice top line and you also get a nice bottom line improvement. And then you'll continue to see us make good strategic decisions around those 2 assets and how to explore an even better return from the costs that we acquired these assets from DLR at."

I'll take the hedging question, Mike, and Steve or Charles will jump in on the other one. First, as it relates to hedging, our philosophy is to, as you know, is to provide effectively a soft landing for currencies as they move around, including to provide predictability with our results and with more focus on revenues and then also to create some certainty around our cash flows, again, because we're distributing a lot of our capital today back to the shareholders. So those are 2 things that are highly important for us. And so when we think about how we deploy our hedges, number one, there's been increased volatility. And so one of the things that we wanted to do is try and feather out these hedges over a longer period of time. And so we are hedging partially into 2018 now. We're focusing on typically the European currencies because of -- without getting overly complex, our business in Europe is run as U.S. dollar functional. And when we hedge against our -- whether revenues or costs for our cash flow hedges, we get to treating against the lines in which we're hedging. So those are things that we try and do. And clearly, as a result, you're seeing the benefit of us not only in our results but also on our guidance rates on how we've layered in those hedges over a period of time. So absolutely, we're benefiting from the hedges, but it'll depend on the currencies and the markets that we're talking about. But the philosophy is to continue to hedge, and then there also is our cash -- as I said, there's the cash flow hedges, then the hedges that we put in place when we're moving money around the markets. And in this case, as you know, with the pending sale of the EMEA assets, we wanted to make sure we hedge the cash flow associated with that. And as I said, absent putting that hedge in place, we would have been $55 million shorter have we not put our hedges in place because of what happened with Brexit. And so again, we're being very thoughtful about our overall hedging strategy to create that predictability with our cash flows but also make sure that there's a smooth glide path as currencies rebase in some cases, like the euro or the pound, yet at the same time, you're going to get the volatility pick up because we only hedge to 70%, 80% of the exposure."

We had a great third quarter delivering record bookings, fueled by significant growth in our cloud, financial and enterprise segments. We see a robust pipeline, driven by strong global demand from cloud service providers and the broad adoption of hybrid cloud as the IT architecture of choice. 
Today, Platform Equinix offers access to more than 1,400 networks and 2,700 cloud and IT service providers, making us a critical partner for multinational enterprises seeking to rearchitect their infrastructure to reduce cost, enhance their flexibility and optimize performance in an increasingly cloud-first world. 
As depicted on Slide 3, third quarter revenues were $924.7 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 14% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis, above the top end of our guidance range. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $420 million for the quarter, flat over the prior quarter and up 18% year-over-year on an organic and constant currency basis. 
Adjusted EBITDA absorbs an incremental $5 million of cash-neutral U.S. GAAP adjustments related to Telecity and $2.5 million of integration cost accelerated into Q3. 
Absent these adjustments, our adjusted EBITDA would have been at $427.5 million, above the top end of our guidance range. AFFO grew 44% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. 
We are successfully cultivating and curating our digital ecosystems, which is driving healthy operating metrics across the board, including firm MRR per cabinet, low churn and strong interconnection growth. 
We added 10 Fortune 500 customers this quarter, including Target, a reading retailer; and Aetna, a healthcare and insurance provider, and we now have penetrated nearly 1/3 of the Fortune 500 and 1/4 of the Forbes Global 2000 companies. Our fastest growth continues to come from 3 region deployments, which now represent 55% of total recurring revenue, highlighting the importance of our global reach. 
Across all fronts, we're pleased with the volume, quality and diversity of bookings. We continue to capture critical strategic footprints and are leveraging our scaled global service delivery platform to process more deal flow than any other data center company. 
We are pressing our advantage to capture the next wave of demand, enhancing our go-to-market capabilities to win the cloud-enabled enterprise. Many new use cases are driving data center colocation for the foreseeable future, including The Internet of Things, next-generation security services, submarine cables, digital payments, wireless aggregation as well as compute storage and networking trends. 
Our differentiation as a company and then the moat around our business continues to expand as we penetrate these new markets and grow our global interconnection platform. 
I would like to next provide commentary on how our acquisitions, organic development and expanding portfolio of interconnection services are accelerating our market leadership. 
Starting with interconnection. Interconnection revenue grew 19% year-over-year on an organic and constant currency basis. We now have over 188,000 cross connects, and this is the ninth quarter in a row where we added greater than 5,000 cross connects. We saw strong growth of connections to cloud through both direct cross connects and on our Cloud Exchange. 
Our Internet exchanges also continued to scale, with provision capacity ramping up with 100-gig upgrades, which bodes well for a continued traffic growth. 
Also this quarter, we rolled out our Internet Exchange in Helsinki based on customer demand in this former Telecity site, expanding coverage of our Internet exchanges to 19 markets worldwide. 
Another interconnection driver is the submarine cable industry, which is experiencing explosive growth driven primarily by exponential increases in data traffic, consumed by the large cloud service providers and innovation in optical equipment with more cable aid in 2016 than over the past 5 years combined. As a result, we're seeing significant momentum as their strategic partner in these submarine cable projects. And we have won edge deployments for 12 projects to date, 8 of which are active and 4 which are in progress. Winning these deployments builds on our original vision of Equinix being the intersection point where all the data bits flow. And these wins will drive even more traffic to our sites following through colocation and interconnection services as network and cloud providers joined the ecosystem. 
These multi-decade cable projects will help anchor our sites as the key interconnection points around the world, and our wins include AquaComms, which runs from New York to London; Southern Cross Cable Network, which runs from California to Sydney; and FASTER, which runs from the West Coast of the United States to Japan. 
Our newest win is with Monet, a next-generation cable architecture owned by Google and 3 telecom providers, connecting the United States to Brazil, where our Miami IBX will serve as the U.S. cable landing station. The Monet deployment represents an industry-first, deploying a submarine cable architecture together with an integrated cable landing station inside Equinix's network and cloud-dense, multi-tenant data centers. This new architecture, which eliminates the need for a separate cable landing station, was developed to meet the needs of large cloud providers for speed, efficiency and open system design. 
Turning to acquisitions. We significantly extended our scale and reach with the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions in Europe and Japan, and are progressing well with integrating these 2 businesses to deliver more value to our customers. 
The Telecity business delivered solid financial performance in the quarter and we're ahead of plan with our revenue and cost synergy targets, which includes customer cross-selling while concurrently integrating our product portfolio and our pricing strategy. We are enriching the data center metro connectivity across our combined EMEA footprint, which was recently completed in London and is underway in 5 other EMEA metros. 
We're also pleased with the Bit-isle's progress and saw healthy bookings across the entire Japanese business in the third quarter. We see sustained interest in our expanded Japanese portfolio, and tethering the Equinix and Bit-isle assets together has allowed us to position all of the properties as part of a larger campus ecosystem.
Turning to our organic development activity. We continue to invest and expand globally with 18 announced expansion projects underway. This quarter, we are moving forward with additional expansions in Dallas, Dublin, Frankfurt, Helsinki and Zürich, totaling over $100 million of capital expenditures. We are also progressing with 5 major new IBX builds in Amsterdam, Ashburn, Frankfurt, São Paulo and Silicon Valley, that will give us key capacity to satisfy strong demand and will expand our data center count to over 150 by mid-2017. 
In terms of our asset ownership strategy. We continue to acquire and develop land, building major new campuses on owned land in Ashburn, Frankfurt and Silicon Valley. This quarter, we also bought 6 acres of land next to our Chicago-3 IBX, which we'll develop over time to expand our Chicago Elk Grove campus, which is see increasing demand from cloud and financial customers. 
These capital investments are delivering very healthy growth and strong returns, as shown on Slide 4. Revenues from our 70 stabilized IBXs grew 6% year-over-year, largely driven by an increase in cross connect and power density. These stabilized assets are generating 32% cash-on-cash return on their gross PP&E invested, and utilization stepped up to 87%. 
Looking beyond the numbers. Customers increasingly care about greening their supply chains, and we are working hard to reduce our environmental and carbon footprint by improving energy efficiency and sourcing of renewable energy. We are building on our position as the leader in our space and continue to make progress towards the long-term -- our long-term goal of 100% clean and renewable energy. 
Let me now shift and cover the quarterly highlights from our vertical -- and our industry verticals. And I'll start with the networks. This vertical delivered strong bookings, and a nice step up in revenues and meaningful local ads this quarter. Network service providers, cable operators and satellite providers are growing with Equinix as they shift their portfolios to address the enterprise demand for cloud, mobile and new digital services like Internet of Things. Growth this quarter was led by strength in EMEA and Asia as wireline providers augment their infrastructure to support cloud connectivity and deploy new optical technology. 
Customer expansions included Orange Business Services, a global IT and communications provider deploying a new cloud offering for enterprises; and Hawaiki Submarine Cable, a transpacific cable system between Australia and the United States. 
The financial services vertical achieved record bookings, with over indexing growth from the trading, insurance and digital payment segments as we continued to make progress in expanding our relationships far beyond electronic trading. We've seen minimal impact to date from Brexit in our financial services segment with continued traction across Europe, including near record bookings for the financial services segment in the U.K. 
This quarter, we expanded with PayPal, an important customer in the digital payments ecosystem, that is interconnecting to business partners to improve performance and latency, and helps PayPal maintain seamless transactions for on-demand shopping anywhere in the world. 
We also expanded with insurance customers, including Lloyd's, who is deploying a cloud-based risk modeling platform for the insurance industry, as well as a Fortune 100 insurance firm leveraging connectivity to AWS for big data analytics. 
In the content and digital media vertical, advertisers, CDNs and digital media were the growth drivers for booking, led by the Asia Pacific region. Customer wins included Avid Technology, a leading editing and distribution platform that is deploying Performance Hub to connect remote end users to its product suite via Azure, as well as expansion in the quarter from China Cash [ph],  Curtail, [ph] Tencent and Yahoo! as they expand their digital edges. 
The cloud and IT services vertical had its second-best bookings quarter, with growth in Software-as-a-Service and multi-region infrastructure-as-a-Service deployments. We continue to enhance our value as the home of the interconnected cloud by increasing cloud density and coverage of Software-as-a-Service providers and making it easy for enterprise to find and consume a broad range of cloud services. 
Our Cloud Exchange saw a strong adoption, with solid growth in EMEA, good port orders and ramping traffic, driven by over 540 enterprises, clouds and networks using Cloud Exchange to interconnect. We continue to add cloud service providers across our markets, deepening our strategic footprints with anchors such as AWS, Azure, IBM SoftLayer, Google and Oracle, and expanding new availability to specialized cloud services in security, unified communications and enterprise application test and development. 
And turning to enterprise. This vertical also saw its second highest bookings quarter led by the Americas and captured a record number of new customers with expanding penetration of the Fortune 500. Wins included a Fortune 250 food manufacturer embracing digital transformation, a top 3 auto manufacturer optimizing their network topology in connecting to Azure through Cloud Exchange, as well as J.B. Hunt, a Fortune 500 transportation company. 
Our Performance Hub solution continues to see strong adoption, and more than 560 customers are using this solution to rearchitect their infrastructure to directly connect their people, locations, clouds and data. 
And finally, we continue to build and enhance our go-to-market engine through both direct and indirect channels. We are improving our market awareness and lead generation capability through targeted programs and seeing strong results in creating a pipeline of highly qualified opportunities. We're seeing a steady stream of new customer adds, trending between 150 and 200 a quarter, with an increasing share coming from cloud and enterprise. 
We're also enjoying continued success in channel bookings, which account for roughly 15% of total bookings over the past several quarters, with 2/3 of this activity from resellers who are amplifying our market reach and providing our customers with end-to-end solutions. 
So let me stop there and turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter."
28202,404422832,1070980,"Equinix, Inc. (REIT), Equinix, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Equinix, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. As highlighted by Steve, Q3 was another very strong quarter across virtually all of our key operating metrics. We had record bookings with strong performance across each of the regions as well as",1481,"Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. As highlighted by Steve, Q3 was another very strong quarter across virtually all of our key operating metrics. We had record bookings with strong performance across each of the regions as well as our verticals, once again, reflecting the favorable position we enjoy across our marketplace. 
We delivered our 55th [ph] straight quarter top line growth, the results of disciplined execution, and we expect healthy margin performance resulting in strong flow-through to AFFO from the underlying business. 
Revenues and AFFO were above our expectations, while adjusted EBITDA was at the low end of our guidance range, primarily due to cash-neutral U.S. GAAP adjustments related to Telecity. Absent these adjustments, our adjusted EBITDA would have been above the top end of our guidance range, consistent with our revenues and our operating performance. 
Looking at our other operating metrics. Our MRR per cabinet yield continues to remain strong at greater than $2,000 per cabinet. We added 2,200 net billable cabinets and gross cross-connect additions were a very positive 6,400 in the quarter. Note that all metrics have been normalized for the sale of our London 2 IBX, which was sold in early July as part of our asset divesture process related to the Telecity acquisition.
With respect to our acquisitions. Telecity and Bit-isle had their best bookings quarter of the year and we're making solid progress with our integration efforts. We're already enjoying the benefits of a number of cross-sell successes while the depth of the sales pipeline continues to grow. And we're on track to achieve our target cost synergies by the end of 2017. The financial and IT system work is well underway, and we've defined the critical initiatives to operationally integrate the back offices over the next 18 months. 
Specifically, as it relates to Bit-isle, we've integrated the business faster than originally anticipated, positioning the business to accelerate revenues and increase our operating margin more quickly than planned. 
We've also been able to sell their non-core assets sooner than expected. In October, we entered into an agreement to sell Terra Power, [ph] the third non-core Bit-isle business line, for approximately $78 million at current exchange rates. These proceeds, once fully received, will effectively reduce our net investment in Bit-isle and should make this transaction one of our best performing M&A transactions from a return perspective. 
And finally, we've now replaced the temporary Bit-isle bridge facility with a permanent debt facility with an all-in cost of funds approximating 2%. 
Turning to foreign currency. Post Brexit news, we saw the weakening of the U.S. (sic) [U.K.] pound and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Since that time, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen against most of our operating currencies, largely due to a view that policymakers will increase interest rates in the U.S. by the end of the year. 
Our current FX hedges have proven to be very effective during this volatile period, and as a result, despite some level of impact, we don't anticipate this to be meaningful to our Q4 operating results, largely due to our parents winning [ph] hedges being placed at $1.54 to the pound. 
As we look into 2017, we've already hedged over 50% of the EMEA revenues and cash flows and we expect our hedge position to increase over time as we continue to integrate Telecity entities into the EMEA business. 
So turning to the third quarter. As depicted on Slide 5, global Q3 revenues were $924.7 million above the top end of our guidance range, up 3% over the prior quarter and 14% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis, reflecting positive momentum in both MRR and NRR revenue lines. Our global platform continues to expand in Asia Pacific and EMEA, showing organic and constant currency growth on the same quarter compared to last year of 19% and 15% respectively, while the Americas region produced steady growth of 11%. Our as-reported revenues include $147.1 million from our acquisitions, consistent with our expectations. 
Q3 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $1.9 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter and a $1.3 million positive currency benefit when compared to our guidance rates. 
Global adjusted EBITDA was $420 million, flat over the prior quarter and up 18% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis. Our as-reported adjusted EBITDA included $19 million of integration costs -- as a result, our adjusted EBITDA margin stepped down to 45.4%, lower than the prior quarter. 
Relative to our prior guidance, we booked an incremental $5 million of cash neutral U.S. GAAP adjustments related to Telecity as we refined our estimates during Q3. These adjustments included the conversion of certain leases from capitalized to operating classification, which had minimal net impact to our AFFO metric. Additionally, we accelerated $2.5 million of Telecity integration cost into Q3. 
Our Q3 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges was essentially flat when compared to the average FX rates last quarter and a $700,000 positive benefit when compared to our guidance rates. 
Global AFFO was $284.2 million, down slightly over the prior quarter. FFO on a normalized and constant currency basis increased 44% over the prior year. 
Moving to churn. Global Q3 churn was 2%, consistent with our expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect MRR churn to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5%. 
Turning to 2017. We continue to expect MRR churn to range [ph] average between 2% and 2.5% per quarter, which include elevated churn of approximately 3% in Q1 related to the final[ph]  bifurcation strategy. 
I'd now like to provide a few highlights in the regions with full results covered on Slides 6 through 8. 
The Americas region had the second highest bookings quarter of all time, driven by our cloud and financial services verticals with ongoing strong [ph] production and healthy yield. 
EMEA delivered our record bookings quarter, with particular strength in the Dutch and French markets. EMEA continued to execute against its key business initiatives, including the integration of the Telecity business. As a reminder, revenue loss from the London 2 asset sale approximated $3 million for the quarter. 
Asia Pacific remains our fastest growing region, with strong booking in Hong Kong and Tokyo markets, driven by cloud and IT and financial verticals. 
Interconnection revenues continued to outpace overall growth of the business with the Americas, APAC and EMEA interconnection revenues now at 23%, and 11% and 7%, respectively of recurring revenues, updated for the sale of our London 2 IBX. 
Now looking to [ph] the balance sheet. Please refer to Slide 9. Unrestricted cash and investments increased over $1 billion after taking into consideration the proceeds related to the EMEA asset sale as well as funds used to purchase our Paris 2 and 3 assets. [ph] Our outstanding debt approximates $7 billion, a slight decrease over the prior quarter, primarily due to one of our capital leases converting to an operating lease. 
 
Our debt leverage ratio net of unrestricted cash was about 3.6x our Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA. Also of note during the quarter, S&P raised our corporate credit rating to BB+. We continue to aspire to be an investment-grade rated company, yet we'll continue to balance that aspiration with our objective to invest our capital with the highest and best use mindset. 
Now switching to AFFO and dividends on Slide 10. For 2016, we're raising our as-reported AFFO to now range between $1.059 billion and $1.065 billion, a 28% year-over-year increase, the results of our strong operating performance and lower-than-expected interest and tax expenses. 
AFFO on a normalized and constant currency basis is now expected to range between $1.182 billion and $1.188 billion, a 35% increase over the prior year. 
On a fully diluted share basis using our weighted average 71.7 million common shares outstanding, AFFO per share is expected to be $16.55, a 13% increase over the prior year. 
Also today, we announced our Q4 dividend of $1.75 a share, consistent with our Q3 quarterly dividend. Our AFFO payout ratio was estimated to be approximately 47% for 2016. 
Now looking at capital expenditures. Please refer to Slide 7. For the quarter, capital [ph] expenditures were $279.5 million, including recuring CapEx of $41.6 million consistent with our guidance expectations. During the quarter, we opened 6 new projects across our regions, [ph] adding much needed capacity, particularly in EMEA, and currently have another 18 projects under way as we continue to see strong development returns across our new expansion and stabilized IBX projects. 
And finally, we provided you a number of slides that bridge our 2016 guidance from the normalized 2015 performance, including slides for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Please refer to slides 12 through 15. 
I'll now turn the call back to Steve."

This absorbs an incremental $4 million of accelerated integration costs, $10 million of primarily cash-neutral U.S. GAAP adjustments related to Telecity and minimal FX impact. We are pleased with the business's adjusted EBITDA performance and expect to continue to drive margin improvement into 2017. 
And we're raising our AFFO to range between $1.059 billion and $1.065 billion, a 35% normalized in currency growth rate compared to the prior year. This $17 million AFFO increase has negligible foreign currency benefit when compared to prior guidance and the result of strong operating performance and lower interest expense. And finally, we expect our 2016 capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion for the year. 
In closing, we are pleased with our progress this year as we continue to successfully integrate our acquisitions, grow our global platform and scale our interconnection services. Our digital ecosystems continue to thrive globally and the adoption of cloud services by enterprise is accelerating, driving new opportunities at Equinix, enhancing our operating metrics and significantly expanding our addressable market. We are focused on scaling and refining our go-to-market engine, director that capturing the significant shift to the cloud and delivering continued profitable growth. 
So let me stop here and we'll open it up for questions. I'll turn it back over to you, Sean."

I mean, there is certainly a process for accelerating demand at some level. We continue to see adoption from the top of the enterprise pyramid in terms of people adopting hybrid cloud as the architecture of choice. And really hybrid cloud, multicloud I think that's an important distinction. We're seeing them really embrace public cloud as a way to variableize their cost structure and gain flexibility. But then also implementing hybrid cloud architectures that allow them to implement certain elements of private infrastructure where they see that as necessary and important from a performance and security standpoint. So we've had great success with our Performance Hub products, which I think people are using for a number of use cases, including with WAN optimization as well as implementing the multi-cloud. And I think that we're continuing to see them really exercised that as the architecture of choice at the top of the pyramid. And I think what that's starting to do is roll down into a broader enterprise market opportunity as well, and we see that showing up in our channel in particular because our channel partners are now bringing a series of value-added services to prep smaller enterprise customers. They're also willing to adopt. So yes, we definitely see continued momentum and I think strong prospects going forward."

As it relates to the integration into our systems, we could go Monday, we actually had rolled in the U.K. business in that -- onto our operating platform. So now we have both the Dutch and the U.K. business into our eagle platform, which is basically how we continue to scale the business. Next will be Ireland and Sweden. They're already in the REIT structure. And once we get those 2 into the -- onto the operating platform, 70% of the revenues will be covered inside our platform. I think the most important thing to know is as we acquire what is Telecity or any business, the most important part is getting to the data and understanding what insight we can draw from that data. And so we're working very hard and diligently right now to not only grab the data, get it into our systems, process it, understand it then execute against it. So that's where we are from an integration perspective. Suffice it to say, when you look at the overall business, as a company we said we'll take revenues up slightly, go down Telecity on a combined basis when we look at the EBITDA, we're going to take it down roughly $5 million. But as you're aware, there's $10 million of accounting adjustments that are taking place this quarter, which are predominantly noncash U.S. GAAP adjustments confirm their results into our results. So the business is performing as we anticipate. I think the next step really is though, to leverage of what we said earlier on, which is continuing to enjoy the benefits of cross sell and execute against our platform. At the same time, make sure that we have sufficient inventory in the marketplace to support that."

We've now fully integrated them into a single unified sales team probably seeing a little more traction in terms of the Equinix team selling into the Telecity assets, but that's probably to be expected. And I think we're starting to now get the former Telecity employees really up to speed on the broad level platform and seeing a lot of energy on that.

I think what's more important is recognizing that this -- the integration process will be basically fully complete by the end of next year. We fully expect to get all of our cost synergies. We've seen some opportunities where our revenue synergies are starting to realize, which is good. And again, we've got very little dollars allocated that in fiscal year '16.

As we think about the planning for 2017 and the guidance that we'll deliver in 2017.

So we fully anticipate in 2017 and we'll give you complete guidance of all 3 entities on a go-forward basis. And given the fact that cost structures are effectively integrated now and well under way, and we'll sell off a number of noncore assets in the Japanese business.

Actually there's a number of things that are going on in the business this quarter. We're dealing with just top line as the things of course, are impacting the business. First and foremost, is the LD2 asset sale at $3 million. We get a little bit of a benefit from Paris -- the Paris acquisition. And then currency, despite my comments that our hedges are working well, you still have the currency impact. Particularly as it relates to Telecity and as you might have recalled in my comments, only 50 -- we only hedged 50% [ph]. And the reason why we hedged only 50% [ph] is until we can get from Telecity into our platform and in our structure and our REIT commissioner structure, any hedges that we place against the cash flows, [indiscernible] and above the line, and as a result, you got some deterioration as it relates to currency movement in the marketplace."

We see a very robust pipeline in our core sort of campus markets, which is why we've got builds going on in many of those markets. And as you noted, we clearly have pretty significant portion of our total interconnection portfolio residing in those markets. And so they tend to flow through with interconnection demand in a very healthy way. So hard to calibrate that precisely. But I think it would be fair to say that we're continuing to invest. I mean, that's the reason why we see such healthy returns in those markets and that's why we're trying to really allocate a larger percentage of our total CapEx portfolio to those markets."

There's a few other conforming areas where we've taken Telecity operating policies and procedures and comparing it to Equinix standards such as bad debt and sales allowance, deferred installation and the like. And so for all the reasons, as we come to the closing out period of the Telecity acquisition and finalizing their results into us. It's important to recognize that these small adjustments that take place during that period the lion's share of them of course us you would expect around leases -- lease accounting. And hence, why there's really no meaningful impact to AFFO. It's really just moving costs from one bucket to the other, if you will, and therefore, it doesn't affect AFFO -- the AFFO neutral."

And as a result, it's premature to tell you what the cross connects our. Suffice it to say though, it would be meaningfully higher than what we are seeing here. Telecity historically had given some numbers in the -- if we step away from those numbers. But knowing that they are -- there's a meaningful step up in cross connects if we take the inventory that we see today and apply it to our unit count. That's all said, I also want you to understand though that Telecity didn't -- they didn't really monetize their assets in a way that would be consistent with Equinix. And hence, I think that is the opportunity that we all see in front of us as an opportunity over some period in time the cross connects add more value to the assets by tethering them together and then be able to monetize that with our customers over some period of time. But rest assured, it's a number that you want to give you. We're just not at the point where we can at this stage. But over the not-too-distant future, we will be getting some input on that number."

And so right now, the overall project is consistent -- the overall is consistent from a dollar perspective. As it relates to the acquisition of other property both raw land, if you will, and then also a land underneath the IBX that we operate today. We're always looking to acquire those property. Charles alluded to a number of acquisition that we -- we've made as of late whether it's Silicon Valley land, D.C. land and Chicago or Stratford. Some of the land lease arrangements were made in Amsterdam and London. We are actively as a company trying to acquire more property where we can to enhance our campus but at the same time, control more of our revenue from our own perspective.

We had a great third quarter delivering record bookings, fueled by significant growth in our cloud, financial and enterprise segments. We see a robust pipeline, driven by strong global demand from cloud service providers and the broad adoption of hybrid cloud as the IT architecture of choice. 
Today, Platform Equinix offers access to more than 1,400 networks and 2,700 cloud and IT service providers, making us a critical partner for multinational enterprises seeking to rearchitect their infrastructure to reduce cost, enhance their flexibility and optimize performance in an increasingly cloud-first world. 
As depicted on Slide 3, third quarter revenues were $924.7 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 14% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis, above the top end of our guidance range. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $420 million for the quarter, flat over the prior quarter and up 18% year-over-year on an organic and constant currency basis. 
Adjusted EBITDA absorbs an incremental $5 million of cash-neutral U.S. GAAP adjustments related to Telecity and $2.5 million of integration cost accelerated into Q3. 
Absent these adjustments, our adjusted EBITDA would have been at $427.5 million, above the top end of our guidance range. AFFO grew 44% year-over-year on a normalized and constant currency basis. 
We are successfully cultivating and curating our digital ecosystems, which is driving healthy operating metrics across the board, including firm MRR per cabinet, low churn and strong interconnection growth. 
We added 10 Fortune 500 customers this quarter, including Target, a reading retailer; and Aetna, a healthcare and insurance provider, and we now have penetrated nearly 1/3 of the Fortune 500 and 1/4 of the Forbes Global 2000 companies. Our fastest growth continues to come from 3 region deployments, which now represent 55% of total recurring revenue, highlighting the importance of our global reach. 
Across all fronts, we're pleased with the volume, quality and diversity of bookings. We continue to capture critical strategic footprints and are leveraging our scaled global service delivery platform to process more deal flow than any other data center company. 
We are pressing our advantage to capture the next wave of demand, enhancing our go-to-market capabilities to win the cloud-enabled enterprise. Many new use cases are driving data center colocation for the foreseeable future, including The Internet of Things, next-generation security services, submarine cables, digital payments, wireless aggregation as well as compute storage and networking trends. 
Our differentiation as a company and then the moat around our business continues to expand as we penetrate these new markets and grow our global interconnection platform. 
I would like to next provide commentary on how our acquisitions, organic development and expanding portfolio of interconnection services are accelerating our market leadership. 
Starting with interconnection. Interconnection revenue grew 19% year-over-year on an organic and constant currency basis. We now have over 188,000 cross connects, and this is the ninth quarter in a row where we added greater than 5,000 cross connects. We saw strong growth of connections to cloud through both direct cross connects and on our Cloud Exchange. 
Our Internet exchanges also continued to scale, with provision capacity ramping up with 100-gig upgrades, which bodes well for a continued traffic growth. 
Also this quarter, we rolled out our Internet Exchange in Helsinki based on customer demand in this former Telecity site, expanding coverage of our Internet exchanges to 19 markets worldwide. 
Another interconnection driver is the submarine cable industry, which is experiencing explosive growth driven primarily by exponential increases in data traffic, consumed by the large cloud service providers and innovation in optical equipment with more cable aid in 2016 than over the past 5 years combined. As a result, we're seeing significant momentum as their strategic partner in these submarine cable projects. And we have won edge deployments for 12 projects to date, 8 of which are active and 4 which are in progress. Winning these deployments builds on our original vision of Equinix being the intersection point where all the data bits flow. And these wins will drive even more traffic to our sites following through colocation and interconnection services as network and cloud providers joined the ecosystem. 
These multi-decade cable projects will help anchor our sites as the key interconnection points around the world, and our wins include AquaComms, which runs from New York to London; Southern Cross Cable Network, which runs from California to Sydney; and FASTER, which runs from the West Coast of the United States to Japan. 
Our newest win is with Monet, a next-generation cable architecture owned by Google and 3 telecom providers, connecting the United States to Brazil, where our Miami IBX will serve as the U.S. cable landing station. The Monet deployment represents an industry-first, deploying a submarine cable architecture together with an integrated cable landing station inside Equinix's network and cloud-dense, multi-tenant data centers. This new architecture, which eliminates the need for a separate cable landing station, was developed to meet the needs of large cloud providers for speed, efficiency and open system design. 
Turning to acquisitions. We significantly extended our scale and reach with the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions in Europe and Japan, and are progressing well with integrating these 2 businesses to deliver more value to our customers. 
The Telecity business delivered solid financial performance in the quarter and we're ahead of plan with our revenue and cost synergy targets, which includes customer cross-selling while concurrently integrating our product portfolio and our pricing strategy. We are enriching the data center metro connectivity across our combined EMEA footprint, which was recently completed in London and is underway in 5 other EMEA metros. 
We're also pleased with the Bit-isle's progress and saw healthy bookings across the entire Japanese business in the third quarter. We see sustained interest in our expanded Japanese portfolio, and tethering the Equinix and Bit-isle assets together has allowed us to position all of the properties as part of a larger campus ecosystem.
Turning to our organic development activity. We continue to invest and expand globally with 18 announced expansion projects underway. This quarter, we are moving forward with additional expansions in Dallas, Dublin, Frankfurt, Helsinki and Zürich, totaling over $100 million of capital expenditures. We are also progressing with 5 major new IBX builds in Amsterdam, Ashburn, Frankfurt, São Paulo and Silicon Valley, that will give us key capacity to satisfy strong demand and will expand our data center count to over 150 by mid-2017. 
In terms of our asset ownership strategy. We continue to acquire and develop land, building major new campuses on owned land in Ashburn, Frankfurt and Silicon Valley. This quarter, we also bought 6 acres of land next to our Chicago-3 IBX, which we'll develop over time to expand our Chicago Elk Grove campus, which is see increasing demand from cloud and financial customers. 
These capital investments are delivering very healthy growth and strong returns, as shown on Slide 4. Revenues from our 70 stabilized IBXs grew 6% year-over-year, largely driven by an increase in cross connect and power density. These stabilized assets are generating 32% cash-on-cash return on their gross PP&E invested, and utilization stepped up to 87%. 
Looking beyond the numbers. Customers increasingly care about greening their supply chains, and we are working hard to reduce our environmental and carbon footprint by improving energy efficiency and sourcing of renewable energy. We are building on our position as the leader in our space and continue to make progress towards the long-term -- our long-term goal of 100% clean and renewable energy. 
Let me now shift and cover the quarterly highlights from our vertical -- and our industry verticals. And I'll start with the networks. This vertical delivered strong bookings, and a nice step up in revenues and meaningful local ads this quarter. Network service providers, cable operators and satellite providers are growing with Equinix as they shift their portfolios to address the enterprise demand for cloud, mobile and new digital services like Internet of Things. Growth this quarter was led by strength in EMEA and Asia as wireline providers augment their infrastructure to support cloud connectivity and deploy new optical technology. 
Customer expansions included Orange Business Services, a global IT and communications provider deploying a new cloud offering for enterprises; and Hawaiki Submarine Cable, a transpacific cable system between Australia and the United States. 
The financial services vertical achieved record bookings, with over indexing growth from the trading, insurance and digital payment segments as we continued to make progress in expanding our relationships far beyond electronic trading. We've seen minimal impact to date from Brexit in our financial services segment with continued traction across Europe, including near record bookings for the financial services segment in the U.K. 
This quarter, we expanded with PayPal, an important customer in the digital payments ecosystem, that is interconnecting to business partners to improve performance and latency, and helps PayPal maintain seamless transactions for on-demand shopping anywhere in the world. 
We also expanded with insurance customers, including Lloyd's, who is deploying a cloud-based risk modeling platform for the insurance industry, as well as a Fortune 100 insurance firm leveraging connectivity to AWS for big data analytics. 
In the content and digital media vertical, advertisers, CDNs and digital media were the growth drivers for booking, led by the Asia Pacific region. Customer wins included Avid Technology, a leading editing and distribution platform that is deploying Performance Hub to connect remote end users to its product suite via Azure, as well as expansion in the quarter from China Cash [ph], [indiscernible], Tencent and Yahoo! as they expand their digital edges. 
The cloud and IT services vertical had its second-best bookings quarter, with growth in Software-as-a-Service and multi-region infrastructure-as-a-Service deployments. We continue to enhance our value as the home of the interconnected cloud by increasing cloud density and coverage of Software-as-a-Service providers and making it easy for enterprise to find and consume a broad range of cloud services. 
Our Cloud Exchange saw a strong adoption, with solid growth in EMEA, good port orders and ramping traffic, driven by over 540 enterprises, clouds and networks using Cloud Exchange to interconnect. We continue to add cloud service providers across our markets, deepening our strategic footprints with anchors such as AWS, Azure, IBM SoftLayer, Google and Oracle, and expanding new availability to specialized cloud services in security, unified communications and enterprise application test and development. 
And turning to enterprise. This vertical also saw its second highest bookings quarter led by the Americas and captured a record number of new customers with expanding penetration of the Fortune 500. Wins included a Fortune 250 food manufacturer embracing digital transformation, a top 3 auto manufacturer optimizing their network topology in connecting to Azure through Cloud Exchange, as well as J.B. Hunt, a Fortune 500 transportation company. 
Our Performance Hub solution continues to see strong adoption, and more than 560 customers are using this solution to rearchitect their infrastructure to directly connect their people, locations, clouds and data. 
And finally, we continue to build and enhance our go-to-market engine through both direct and indirect channels. We are improving our market awareness and lead generation capability through targeted programs and seeing strong results in creating a pipeline of highly qualified opportunities. We're seeing a steady stream of new customer adds, trending between 150 and 200 a quarter, with an increasing share coming from cloud and enterprise. 
We're also enjoying continued success in channel bookings, which account for roughly 15% of total bookings over the past several quarters, with 2/3 of this activity from resellers who are amplifying our market reach and providing our customers with end-to-end solutions. 
So let me stop there and turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter."
28202,404422832,1071210,"Equinix, Inc. (REIT), Equinix, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Equinix, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. As highlighted by Steve, Q3 was another very strong quarter across virtually all of our key operating metrics. We had record bookings with strong performance across each of the regions as well as",1475,"Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. As highlighted by Steve, Q3 was another very strong quarter across virtually all of our key operating metrics. We had record bookings with strong performance across each of the regions as well as our verticals, once again, reflecting the favorable position we enjoy across our marketplace. 
We delivered our 55th straight quarter top line growth, the results of disciplined execution, and we expect healthy margin performance resulting in strong flow-through to AFFO from the underlying business. 
Revenues and AFFO were above our expectations, while adjusted EBITDA was at the low end of our guidance range, primarily due to cash-neutral U.S. GAAP adjustments related to Telecity. Absent these adjustments, our adjusted EBITDA would have been above the top end of our guidance range, consistent with our revenues and our operating performance. 
Looking at our other operating metrics. Our MRR per cabinet yield continues to remain strong at greater than $2,000 per cabinet. We added 2,200 net billable cabinets and gross cross-connect additions were a very positive 6,400 in the quarter. Note that all metrics have been normalized for the sale of our London 2 IBX, which was sold in early July as part of our asset divesture process related to the Telecity acquisition.
With respect to our acquisitions. Telecity and Bit-isle had their best bookings quarter of the year and we're making solid progress with our integration efforts. We're already enjoying the benefits of a number of cross-sell successes while the depth of the sales pipeline continues to grow. And we're on track to achieve our target cost synergies by the end of 2017. The financial and IT system work is well underway, and we've defined the critical initiatives to operationally integrate the back offices over the next 18 months. 
Specifically, as it relates to Bit-isle, we've integrated the business faster than originally anticipated, positioning the business to accelerate revenues and increase our operating margin more quickly than planned. 
We've also been able to sell their non-core assets sooner than expected. In October, we entered into an agreement to sell Terra Power, the third non-core Bit-isle business line, for approximately $78 million at current exchange rates. These proceeds, once fully received, will effectively reduce our net investment in Bit-isle and should make this transaction one of our best performing M&A transactions from a return perspective. 
And finally, we've now replaced the temporary Bit-isle bridge facility with a permanent debt facility with an all-in cost of funds approximating 2%. 
Turning to foreign currency. Post Brexit news, we saw the weakening of the U.S. (sic) [U.K.] pound and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Since that time, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen against most of our operating currencies, largely due to a view that policymakers will increase interest rates in the U.S. by the end of the year. 
Our current FX hedges have proven to be very effective during this volatile period, and as a result, despite some level of impact, we don't anticipate this to be meaningful to our Q4 operating results, largely due to our pound's turning hedges being placed at $1.54 to the pound. 
As we look into 2017, we've already hedged over 50% of the EMEA revenues and cash flows and we expect our hedge position to increase over time as we continue to integrate Telecity entities into the EMEA business. 
So turning to the third quarter. As depicted on Slide 5, global Q3 revenues were $924.7 million above the top end of our guidance range, up 3% over the prior quarter and 14% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis, reflecting positive momentum in both MRR and NRR revenue lines. Our global platform continues to expand in Asia Pacific and EMEA, showing organic and constant currency growth on the same quarter compared to last year of 19% and 15% respectively, while the Americas region produced steady growth of 11%. Our as-reported revenues include $147.1 million from our acquisitions, consistent with our expectations. 
Q3 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $1.9 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter and a $1.3 million positive currency benefit when compared to our guidance rates. 
Global adjusted EBITDA was $420 million, flat over the prior quarter and up 18% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant currency basis. Our as-reported adjusted EBITDA included $19 million of integration costs -- as a result, our adjusted EBITDA margin stepped down to 45.4%, lower than the prior quarter. 
Relative to our prior guidance, we booked an incremental $5 million of cash neutral U.S. GAAP adjustments related to Telecity as we refined our estimates during Q3. These adjustments included the conversion of certain leases from capitalized to operating classification, which had minimal net impact to our AFFO metric. Additionally, we accelerated $2.5 million of Telecity integration cost into Q3. 
Our Q3 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges was essentially flat when compared to the average FX rates last quarter and a $700,000 positive benefit when compared to our guidance rates. 
Global AFFO was $284.2 million, down slightly over the prior quarter. FFO on a normalized and constant currency basis increased 44% over the prior year. 
Moving to churn. Global Q3 churn was 2%, consistent with our expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect MRR churn to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5%. 
Turning to 2017. We continue to expect MRR churn to range average between 2% and 2.5% per quarter, which include elevated churn of approximately 3% in Q1 related to the final [indiscernible] bifurcation strategy. 
I'd now like to provide a few highlights in the regions with full results covered on Slides 6 through 8. 
The Americas region had the second highest bookings quarter of all time, driven by our cloud and financial services verticals, with ongoing strong outflow in production and healthy yield. 
EMEA delivered our record bookings quarter, with particular strength in the Dutch and French markets. EMEA continued to execute against its key business initiatives, including the integration of the Telecity business. As a reminder, revenue loss from the London 2 asset sale approximated $3 million for the quarter. 
Asia Pacific remains our fastest growing region, with strong booking in Hong Kong and Tokyo markets, driven by cloud and IT and financial verticals. 
Interconnection revenues continued to outpace overall growth of the business with the Americas, APAC and EMEA interconnection revenues now at 23%, and 11% and 7%, respectively of recurring revenues, updated for the sale of our London 2 IBX. 
Now looking to the balance sheet. Please refer to Slide 9. Unrestricted cash and investments increased over $1 billion after taking into consideration the proceeds related to the EMEA asset sale as well as funds used to purchase our Paris 2 and 3 assets. Our outstanding debt approximates $7 billion, a slight decrease over the prior quarter, primarily due to one of our capital leases converting to an operating lease. 
 
Our debt leverage ratio net of unrestricted cash was about 3.6x our Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA. Also of note during the quarter, S&P raised our corporate credit rating to BB+. We continue to aspire to be an investment-grade rated company, yet we'll continue to balance that aspiration with our objective to invest our capital with the highest and best use mindset. 
Now switching to AFFO and dividends on Slide 10. For 2016, we're raising our as-reported AFFO to now range between $1.059 billion and $1.065 billion, a 28% year-over-year increase, the results of our strong operating performance and lower-than-expected interest and tax expenses. 
AFFO on a normalized and constant currency basis is now expected to range between $1.182 billion and $1.188 billion, a 35% increase over the prior year. 
On a fully diluted share basis using our weighted average 71.7 million common shares outstanding, AFFO per share is expected to be $16.55, a 13% increase over the prior year. 
Also today, we announced our Q4 dividend of $1.75 a share, consistent with our Q3 quarterly dividend. Our AFFO payout ratio was estimated to be approximately 47% for 2016. 
Now looking at capital expenditures. Please refer to Slide 7. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $279.5 million, including recurring CapEx of $41.6 million consistent with our guidance expectations. During the quarter, we opened 6 new projects across our regions, adding much needed capacity, particularly in EMEA, and currently have another 18 projects under way as we continue to see strong development returns across our new expansion and stabilized IBX projects. 
And finally, we provided you a number of slides that bridge our 2016 guidance from the normalized 2015 performance, including slides for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Please refer to slides 12 through 15. 
I'll now turn the call back to Steve."

It summarizes our updated Q4 and full year 2016 guidance, including the impact of FX changes. Now let me cover our updated 2016 outlook. 
For the full year of 2016, we're raising our revenue guidance to now range between $3.609 billion and $3.615 billion, a 33% as-reported growth or organic and constant currency growth of 14.1% compared to the prior year. This updated guidance includes a negative $1 million FX impact when compared to prior guidance rates. Net of FX, revenue is stepping up $10 million, the results of our strong Q3 operating performance. 
For 2016, we are updating our adjusted EBITDA guidance to now range between $1.65 billion and $1.656 billion and organic and constant currency growth of 17% compared to the prior year. This absorbs an incremental $4 million of accelerated integration costs, $10 million of primarily cash-neutral U.S. GAAP adjustments related to Telecity and minimal FX impact. We are pleased with the business's adjusted EBITDA performance and expect to continue to drive margin improvement into 2017. 
And we're raising our AFFO to range between $1.059 billion and $1.065 billion, a 35% normalized and constant currency growth rate compared to the prior year. This $17 million AFFO increase has negligible foreign currency benefit when compared to prior guidance and the result of strong operating performance and lower interest expense. 
And finally, we expect our 2016 capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion for the year. 
In closing, we are pleased with our progress this year as we continue to successfully integrate our acquisitions, grow our global platform and scale our interconnection services. Our digital ecosystems continue to thrive globally and the adoption of cloud services by enterprises is accelerating, driving new opportunities at Equinix, enhancing our operating metrics and significantly expanding our addressable market. We are focused on scaling and refining our go-to-market engine, directed at capturing the significant shift to the cloud and delivering continued profitable growth. 
So let me stop here, and we'll open it up for questions. I'll turn it back over to you, Sean."

I think there is definitely a prospect for accelerating demand at some level. We continue to see adoption from the top of the enterprise pyramid in terms of people adopting hybrid cloud as the IT architecture of choice, and really hybrid cloud, multi-cloud. I think that's an important distinction. We're seeing them really embrace public cloud as a way to variablize their cost structure and gain flexibility. But then also implementing hybrid cloud architectures that allow them to implement certain elements of private infrastructure where they see that as necessary and important from a performance and security standpoint. So we've had great success with our Performance Hub products, which I think people are using for a number of use cases, including WAN optimization as well as implementing the multi-cloud. And I think that we're continuing to see them really exercise that as the architecture of choice at the top of the pyramid. And I think what that's starting to do is roll down into a broader enterprise market opportunity as well, and we see that showing up in our channel in particular because our channel partners are now bringing a series of value-added services to perhaps smaller enterprise customers. They're also willing to adopt. So yes, we definitely see continued momentum and I think strong prospects going forward."

As it relates to the integration into our systems, a week ago, Monday, we actually had [indiscernible] rolled in the U.K. business in -- onto our operating platform. So now we have both the Dutch and the U.K. business into our ECO platform, which is basically how we continue to scale the business. Next will be Ireland and Sweden. They're already in the REIT structure. And once we get those 2 into the -- onto the operating platform, 70% of the revenues will be covered inside our platform. I think the most important thing to note is as we acquire what is Telecity or any business, the most important part is getting to the data and understanding what insight we can draw from that data. And so we're working very hard and diligently right now to not only grab the data, get it into our systems, process it, understand it then execute against it. So that's where we are from an integration perspective. Suffice it to say, when you look at the overall business, as a company, we said, look, we'll take revenues up slightly when we look at Bit-isle and Telecity on a combined basis. When we look at EBITDA, we're going to take it down roughly $5 million. But as you're aware, there's $10 million of accounting adjustments that are taking place this quarter, which are predominantly noncash U.S. GAAP adjustments conform their results into our results. So the business is performing as we anticipate. I think the next step really is, though, to leverage off what we said earlier on, which is continuing to enjoy the benefits of cross-sell and execute against our platform, yet at the same time, make sure that we have sufficient inventory in the marketplace to support that."

Probably seeing a little more traction in terms of the Equinix team selling into the Telecity assets, but that's probably to be expected. And I think we're starting to now get the former Telecity employees really fully up to speed on the broad-level platform and seeing a lot of energy on that. And so that's another really critical litmus test, I think, and one that we've learned from our previous acquisitions that it really requires a lot of attention and I feel good about how that's proceeding as well."

So it's hard to say specifically what Telecity as an entity, when will it get back to its historical growth because ultimately what we're doing now is selling across our platform. I think what's most important is recognizing that this -- the integration process will be basically fully complete by the end of next year. We fully expect to get all of our cost synergies. We've seen some opportunities where our revenue synergies are starting to realize, which is good. And again, we've got very little dollars allocated to that in fiscal year '16. But we're seeing many green shoots of opportunity. And then I think just overall, the scaling of our platform across Europe not only as we take what assets we have today but we invest in the platform on a go-forward basis with some of these 18 projects that are underway, that I think will really make a difference. And you combine that with what Charles said earlier on or what Steve has talked about from the enterprise perspective, we're really excited about certainly seeing more momentum coming out of those -- that specific entity, but it's really more about the collective business that we're looking forward to executing against."

First and foremost, as it relates to an AFFO per share of $18 a share for 2017. We continue to expect to deliver that or better, consistent with what we said on the -- at our Analyst Day, despite what transpired this specific quarter. As we think about the planning for 2017 and the guidance that we'll deliver in 2017, no surprise to you as we continue to integrate the platform, it really becomes one entity and less about organic versus inorganic. And so we fully anticipate in 2017 that we'll give you complete guidance that includes all 3 entities on a go-forward basis. And given the fact that cost structures are effectively integrated now, are well under way, and we sold off a number of our non-core assets in the Japanese business, I think it makes best sense to give you one holistic number on a go-forward basis that you will measure us against. And then as it relates to EMEA, absolutely there was a number of things that were going on in the business this quarter. If we're dealing with just top line, the things that, of course, are impacting the business, first and foremost is the LD2 asset sale at $3 million. We get a little bit of a benefit from Paris -- the Paris acquisition. And then currency, despite my comments that our hedges are working well, you still have the currency impact. Particularly as it relates to Telecity, and as you might have recalled in my comments, only -- we only hedged 50%. And the reason why we hedged 50% is until we can get the European entities from Telecity into our platform and in our structure, our REIT and commissioner structure, any hedges that we place against the cash flows go below the line and not above the line. And as a result, you've got some deterioration as it relates to currency movements in the marketplace."

But suffice it to say, we are looking at a number of different investment opportunities. As you've heard me say before and I think others have certainly said the same thing, is a lot of times when we look at how we invest in incremental projects or initiatives, it's really about how do we find our highest and best use of our cost. And so sometimes, it means that we reallocate certain cost to areas where we think it's a higher and better use of that capital. And so as we look into 2017, the team is working really hard not only to bend our cost curve but also the squeeze out more opportunity to fund many of the initiatives that we're looking at, as Steve spoke about and Charles has alluded to."

And then on Asia, I was just interested in China. You've talked about the opportunity there, with plans to maybe enter Beijing. It doesn't appear on your tracking sheet at this point.

I think Steve and Charles will take the second one. As it relates to the cross connects, certainly as we -- one of the main things that we have to do when we integrate one company into our platform is get a good handle on the data bits and understanding exactly what their inventory is, whether it's a cabinet, whether it's a cross connect or power circuit. That's an evolving exercise, as you can appreciate. So we moved both the Dutch business and the U.K. business on to the platform, but we're still in the process of making sure that we have clearly understood what basically the unit of measures are. And as a result, it's premature to tell you what the cross connects are. Suffice it to say, though, it would be meaningfully higher than what we're seeing here. Telecity historically had set some -- has given some numbers in the marketplace. We want to step away from those numbers, knowing that they are -- there's a meaningful step-up in cross connects if we take the inventory that we see today and apply it to our unit count. That all said, I also want you to understand, though, that Telecity didn't -- they didn't really monetize those assets in a way that would be consistent with Equinix. And hence, I think that's the opportunity that we all see in front of us, is there's an opportunity to over some period of time take the cross connects, add more value to the assets by tethering them together and then being able to monetize that with our customers over some period of time. But rest assured, it's a number that we want to give you. We're just not at a point that we can at this stage. But over the not-too-distant future, you will be getting some input on that number."

So theoretically, there could be some adjustments in Q4. We are not guiding to them. We don't see any. But I just wanted you to know that, that could take place.

So in our bridging -- in our bridge pages, which you will -- eventually, I'm sure you'll digest them, you'll see that we earmarked roughly $17 million of integration costs for Q4. That will bring the total year up to $59 million. That's $4 million higher than we originally anticipated for the year. But at this point in time, because we also have our cost earmarked for 2017, we think that we're actually not going to increase that in 2017. And in fact, as we stand here today, I think we would reduce it by $4 million, all else being equal. And so right now, the overall project is consistent -- the overall integration plan, I should say, is consistent from a dollar perspective. As it relates to the acquisition of other property, both raw land, if you will, and then also land underneath the IBXs that we operate today, we're always looking to acquire those property. Charles alluded to a number of acquisitions that we've made as of late, whether it's a Silicon Valley land, a D.C. land, a Chicago or a Stratford, some of the land lease arrangements we made in Amsterdam and London. We are actively as a company trying to acquire more property where we can to enhance our campus but at the same time control more of our revenue from an owned perspective. And right now, our revenue, at least on an organic basis with the owned assets is 39%. On a consolidated basis, it's roughly 35%. We want to see that number up. And our stated objective, we'd love to see it around 50%. I don't know if we can get there -- when we can get there. But certainly, that's our objective is to own more and more of our properties."

We had a great third quarter delivering record bookings, fueled by significant growth in our cloud, financial and enterprise segments. We see a robust pipeline, driven by strong global demand from cloud service providers and the broad adoption of hybrid cloud as the IT architecture of choice. 
Today, Platform Equinix offers access to more than 1,400 networks and 2,700 cloud and IT service providers, making us a critical partner for multinational enterprises seeking to rearchitect their infrastructure to reduce cost, enhance their flexibility and optimize performance in an increasingly cloud-first world. 
As depicted on Slide 3, third quarter revenues were $924.7 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 14% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant-currency basis, above the top end of our guidance range. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $420 million for the quarter, flat over the prior quarter and up 18% year-over-year on an organic and constant-currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA absorbs an incremental $5 million of cash-neutral U.S. GAAP adjustments related to Telecity and $2.5 million of integration cost accelerated into Q3. Absent these adjustments, our adjusted EBITDA would have been at $427.5 million, above the top end of our guidance range. 
AFFO grew 44% year-over-year on a normalized and constant-currency basis. 
We are successfully cultivating and curating our digital ecosystems, which is driving healthy operating metrics across the board, including firm MRR per cabinet, low churn and strong interconnection growth. 
We added 10 Fortune 500 customers this quarter, including Target, a reading retailer; and Aetna, a healthcare and insurance provider, and we now have penetrated nearly 1/3 of the Fortune 500 and 1/4 of the Forbes Global 2000 companies. Our fastest growth continues to come from 3 region deployments, which now represent 55% of total recurring revenue, highlighting the importance of our global reach. 
Across all fronts, we're pleased with the volume, quality and diversity of bookings. We continue to capture critical strategic footprints and are leveraging our scaled global service delivery platform to process more deal flow than any other data center company. 
We are pressing our advantage to capture the next wave of demand, enhancing our go-to-market capabilities to win the cloud-enabled enterprise. Many new use cases are driving data center colocation for the foreseeable future, including the Internet of Things, next-generation security services, submarine cables, digital payments, wireless aggregation as well as compute storage and networking trends. 
Our differentiation as a company and the moat around our business continues to expand as we penetrate these new markets and grow our global interconnection platform. 
I would like to next provide commentary on how our acquisitions, organic development and expanding portfolio of interconnection services are accelerating our market leadership. 
Starting with interconnection. Interconnection revenue grew 19% year-over-year on an organic and constant-currency basis. We now have over 188,000 cross connects, and this is the ninth quarter in a row where we added greater than 5,000 cross connects. We saw strong growth of connections to cloud through both direct cross connects and on our Cloud Exchange. 
Our Internet exchanges also continued to scale, with provision capacity ramping up with 100-gig upgrades, which bodes well for a continued traffic growth. 
Also this quarter, we rolled out our Internet Exchange in Helsinki based on customer demand in this former Telecity site, expanding coverage of our Internet exchanges to 19 markets worldwide. 
Another interconnection driver is the submarine cable industry, which is experiencing explosive growth driven primarily by exponential increases in data traffic, consumed by the large cloud service providers and innovations in optical equipment with more cable laid in 2016 than over the past 5 years combined. As a result, we're seeing significant momentum as their strategic partner in these submarine cable projects. And we have won edge deployments for 12 projects to date, 8 of which are active and 4 which are in progress. Winning these deployments builds on our original vision of Equinix being the intersection point where all the data bits flow. And these wins will drive even more traffic to our sites following through colocation and interconnection services as network and cloud providers join the ecosystem. 
These multi-decade cable projects will help anchor our sites as the key interconnection points around the world, and our wins include AquaComms, which runs from New York to London; Southern Cross Cable Network, which runs from California to Sydney; and FASTER, which runs from the West Coast of the United States to Japan. 
Our newest win is with Monet, a next-generation cable architecture owned by Google and 3 telecom providers, connecting the United States to Brazil, where our Miami IBX will serve as the U.S. cable landing station. The Monet deployment represents an industry-first, deploying a submarine cable architecture together with an integrated cable landing station inside Equinix's network and cloud-dense, multi-tenant data centers. This new architecture, which eliminates the need for a separate cable landing station, was developed to meet the needs of large cloud providers for speed, efficiency and open system design. 
Turning to acquisitions. We significantly extended our scale and reach with the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions in Europe and Japan, and are progressing well with integrating these 2 businesses to deliver more value to our customers. 
The Telecity business delivered solid financial performance in the quarter and we're ahead of plan with our revenue and cost synergy targets, which includes customer cross-selling while concurrently integrating our product portfolio and our pricing strategy. We are enriching the data center metro connectivity across our combined EMEA footprint, which was recently completed in London and is underway in 5 other EMEA metros. 
We're also pleased with the Bit-isle's progress and saw healthy bookings across the entire Japanese business in the third quarter. We see sustained interest in our expanded Japanese portfolio, and tethering the Equinix and Bit-isle assets together has allowed us to position all of the properties as part of a larger campus ecosystem.
Turning to our organic development activity. We continue to invest and expand globally with 18 announced expansion projects underway. This quarter, we are moving forward with additional expansions in Dallas, Dublin, Frankfurt, Helsinki and Zürich, totaling over $100 million of capital expenditures. We are also progressing with 5 major new IBX builds in Amsterdam, Ashburn, Frankfurt, São Paulo and Silicon Valley, that will give us key capacity to satisfy strong demand and will expand our data center count to over 150 by mid-2017. 
In terms of our asset ownership strategy. We continue to acquire and develop land, building major new campuses on owned land at Ashburn, Frankfurt and Silicon Valley. This quarter, we also bought 6 acres of land next to our Chicago-3 IBX, which we'll develop over time to expand our Chicago Elk Grove campus, which is seeing increasing demand from cloud and financial customers. 
These capital investments are delivering very healthy growth and strong returns, as shown on Slide 4. Revenues from our 70 stabilized IBXs grew 6% year-over-year, largely driven by an increase in cross connect and power density. These stabilized assets are generating 32% cash-on-cash return on their gross PP&E invested, and utilization stepped up to 87%. 
Looking beyond the numbers. Customers increasingly care about greening their supply chains, and we are working hard to reduce our environmental and carbon footprint by improving energy efficiency and sourcing of renewable energy. We are building on our position as the leader in our space and continue to make progress towards the long-term -- our long-term goal of 100% clean and renewable energy. 
Let me now shift and cover the quarterly highlights from our vertical -- and our industry verticals. And I'll start with the networks. This vertical delivered strong bookings, a nice step up in revenues and meaningful logo ads this quarter. Network service providers, cable operators and satellite providers are growing with Equinix as they shift their portfolios to address the enterprise demand for cloud, mobile and new digital services like the Internet of Things. Growth this quarter was led by strength in EMEA and Asia as wireline providers augment their infrastructure to support cloud connectivity and deploy new optical technology. 
Customer expansions included Orange Business Services, a global IT and communications provider deploying a new cloud offering for enterprises; and Hawaiki submarine cable, a transpacific cable system between Australia and the United States. 
The financial services vertical achieved record bookings, with over-indexing growth from the trading, insurance and digital payment segments as we continued to make progress in expanding our relationships far beyond electronic trading. We've seen minimal impact to date from Brexit in our financial services segment, with continued traction across Europe, including near record bookings for the financial services segment in the U.K. 
This quarter, we expanded with PayPal, an important customer in the digital payments ecosystem, that is interconnecting to business partners to improve performance and latency, and helps PayPal maintain seamless transactions for on-demand shopping anywhere in the world. 
We also expanded with insurance customers, including Lloyd's, who is deploying a cloud-based risk modeling platform for the insurance industry, as well as a Fortune 100 insurance firm leveraging connectivity to AWS for big data analytics. 
In the content and digital media vertical, advertisers, CDNs and digital media were the growth drivers for bookings, led by the Asia Pacific region. Customer wins included Avid Technology, a leading editing and distribution platform that is deploying Performance Hub to connect remote end users to its product suite via Azure, as well as expansion in the quarter from ChinaCache, Porteyo [ph], Tencent and Yahoo! as they expand their digital edges. 
The cloud and IT services vertical had its second-best bookings quarter, with growth in Software-as-a-Service and multi-region infrastructure-as-a-Service deployments. We continue to enhance our value as the home of the interconnected cloud by increasing cloud density and coverage of Software-as-a-Service providers and making it easy for enterprises to find and consume a broad range of cloud services. 
Our Cloud Exchange saw a strong adoption, with solid growth in EMEA, good port orders and ramping traffic, driven by over 540 enterprises, clouds and networks using Cloud Exchange to interconnect. We continue to add cloud service providers across our markets, deepening our strategic footprints with anchors such as AWS, Azure, IBM SoftLayer, Google and Oracle, and expanding new availability to specialized cloud services in security, unified communications and enterprise application test and development. 
And turning to enterprise. This vertical also saw its second highest bookings quarter led by the Americas and captured a record number of new customers with expanding penetration of the Fortune 500. Wins included a Fortune 250 food manufacturer embracing digital transformation, a top 3 auto manufacturer optimizing their network topology in connecting to Azure through Cloud Exchange, as well as J.B. Hunt, a Fortune 500 transportation company. 
Our Performance Hub solution continues to see strong adoption, and more than 560 customers are using this solution to rearchitect their infrastructure to directly connect their people, locations, clouds and data. 
And finally, we continue to build and enhance our go-to-market engine through both direct and indirect channels. We are improving our market awareness and lead-generation capability through targeted programs and seeing strong results in creating a pipeline of highly qualified opportunities. We're seeing a steady stream of new customer adds, trending between 150 and 200 a quarter, with an increasing share coming from cloud and enterprise. 
We're also enjoying continued success in channel bookings, which account for roughly 15% of total bookings over the past several quarters, with 2/3 of this activity from resellers who are amplifying our market reach and providing our customers with end-to-end solutions. 
So let me stop there and turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter."

As highlighted by Steve, Q3 was another very strong quarter across virtually all of our key operating metrics.

As highlighted by Steve, Q3 was another very strong quarter across virtually all of our key operating metrics. We had record bookings with strong performance across each of the regions as well as our verticals, once again, reflecting the favorable position we enjoy across our marketplace. 
We delivered our 55th straight quarter of top line growth, the results of disciplined execution, and we experienced another quarter of healthy margin performance resulting in strong flow-through to AFFO from the underlying business. 
Revenues and AFFO were above our expectations, while adjusted EBITDA was at the low end of our guidance range, primarily due to cash-neutral U.S. GAAP adjustments related to Telecity. Absent these adjustments, our adjusted EBITDA would have been above the top end of our guidance range, consistent with our revenues and our operating performance. 
Looking at our other operating metrics. Our MRR per cabinet yield continues to remain strong at greater than $2,000 per cabinet. We added 2,200 net billable cabinets and gross cross-connect additions were a very positive 6,400 in the quarter. Note that all metrics have been normalized for the sale of our London 2 IBX, which was sold in early July as part of our asset divesture process related to the Telecity acquisition.
With respect to our acquisitions. Telecity and Bit-isle had their best bookings quarter of the year and we're making solid progress with our integration efforts. We're already enjoying the benefits of a number of cross-sell successes while the depth of the sales pipeline continues to grow. And we're on track to achieve our target cost synergies by the end of 2017. The financial and IT system work is well underway, and we've defined the critical initiatives to operationally integrate the back offices over the next 18 months. 
Specifically, as it relates to Bit-isle, we've integrated the business faster than originally anticipated, positioning the business to accelerate revenues and increase their operating margin more quickly than planned. 
We've also been able to sell their noncore assets sooner than expected. In October, we entered into an agreement to sell Terra Power, the third non-core Bit-isle business line, for approximately $78 million at current exchange rates. These proceeds, once fully received, will effectively reduce our net investment in Bit-isle and should make this transaction one of our best-performing M&A transactions from a return perspective. 
And finally, we've now replaced the temporary Bit-isle bridge facility with a permanent debt facility with an all-in cost of funds approximating 2%. 
Turning to foreign currency. Post Brexit news, we saw the weakening of the U.S. (sic) [U.K.] pound and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Since that time, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen against most of our operating currencies, largely due to a view that policymakers will increase interest rates in the U.S. by the end of the year. 
Our current FX hedges have proven to be very effective during this volatile period, and as a result, despite some level of impact, we don't anticipate this to be meaningful to our Q4 operating results, largely due to our pound sterling hedges being placed at $1.54 to the pound. 
As we look into 2017, we've already hedged over 50% of the EMEA revenues and cash flows and we expect our hedge position to increase over time as we continue to integrate Telecity entities into the EMEA business. 
So turning to the third quarter. As depicted on Slide 5, global Q3 revenues were $924.7 million above the top end of our guidance range, up 3% over the prior quarter and 14% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant-currency basis, reflecting positive momentum in both MRR and NRR revenue lines. Our global platform continues to expand in Asia Pacific and EMEA, showing organic and constant-currency growth on the same quarter compared to last year of 19% and 15% respectively, while the Americas region produced steady growth of 11%. Our as-reported revenues include $147.1 million from our acquisitions, consistent with our expectations. 
Q3 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $1.9 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter and a $1.3 million positive currency benefit when compared to our guidance rates. 
Global adjusted EBITDA was $420 million, flat over the prior quarter and up 18% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant-currency basis. Our as-reported adjusted EBITDA included $19 million of integration costs. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA margin stepped down to 45.4%, lower than the prior quarter. 
Relative to our prior guidance, we booked an incremental $5 million of cash neutral U.S. GAAP adjustments related to Telecity as we refined our estimates during Q3. These adjustments included the conversion of certain leases from capitalized to operating classification, which had minimal net impact to our AFFO metric. Additionally, we accelerated $2.5 million of Telecity integration cost into Q3. 
Our Q3 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, was essentially flat when compared to the average FX rates last quarter and a $700,000 positive benefit when compared to our guidance rates. 
Global AFFO was $284.2 million, down slightly over the prior quarter. FFO on a normalized and constant-currency basis increased 44% over the prior year. 
Moving to churn. Global Q3 churn was 2%, consistent with our expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect MRR churn to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5%. 
Turning to 2017. We continue to expect MRR churn to range average between 2% and 2.5% per quarter, which includes elevated churn of approximately 3% in Q1 related to the final phase of LinkedIn's bifurcation strategy. 
I'd now like to provide a few highlights in the regions with full results covered on Slides 6 through 8. The Americas region had the second highest bookings quarter of all time, driven by our cloud and financial services verticals, with ongoing strong outflow in production and healthy yield. 
EMEA delivered a record bookings quarter, with particular strength in the Dutch and French markets. EMEA continued to execute against its key business initiatives, including the integration of the Telecity business. As a reminder, revenue loss from the London 2 asset sale approximated $3 million for the quarter. 
Asia Pacific remains our fastest-growing region, with strong bookings in Hong Kong and Tokyo markets, driven by cloud and IT and financial verticals. 
Interconnection revenues continued to outpace overall growth of the business with the Americas, APAC and EMEA interconnection revenues now at 23%, 11% and 7%, respectively of recurring revenues, updated for the sale of our London 2 IBX. 
Now looking to the balance sheet. Please refer to Slide 9. Unrestricted cash and investments increased over $1 billion after taking into consideration the proceeds related to the EMEA asset sale as well as funds used to purchase our Paris 2 and 3 assets. Our outstanding debt approximates $7 billion, a slight decrease over the prior quarter, primarily due to one of our capital leases converting to an operating lease. 
 
Our debt leverage ratio net of unrestricted cash was about 3.6x our Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA. Also of note during the quarter, S&P raised our corporate credit rating to BB+. We continue to aspire to be an investment-grade rated company, yet we'll continue to balance that aspiration with our objective to invest our capital with the highest and best use mindset. 
Now switching to AFFO and dividends on Slide 10. For 2016, we're raising our as-reported AFFO to now range between $1.059 billion and $1.065 billion, a 28% year-over-year increase, the results of our strong operating performance and lower-than-expected interest and tax expenses. 
AFFO on a normalized and constant-currency basis is now expected to range between $1.182 billion and $1.188 billion, a 35% increase over the prior year. 
On a fully diluted share basis using our weighted average 71.7 million common shares outstanding, AFFO per share is expected to be $16.55, a 13% increase over the prior year. 
Also today, we announced our Q4 dividend of $1.75 a share, consistent with our Q3 quarterly dividend. Our AFFO payout ratio was estimated to be approximately 47% for 2016. 
Now looking at capital expenditures. Please refer to Slide 7. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $279.5 million, including recurring CapEx of $41.6 million, consistent with our guidance expectations. During the quarter, we opened 6 new projects across our regions, adding much needed capacity, particularly in EMEA, and currently have another 18 projects under way as we continue to see strong development returns across our new expansion and stabilized IBX projects. 
And finally, we've provided you a number of slides that bridge our 2016 guidance from the normalized 2015 performance, including slides for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Please refer to slides 12 through 15. 
I'll now turn the call back to Steve."

And finally, on Slide 16, it summarizes our updated Q4 and full year 2016 guidance, including the impact of FX changes. Now let me cover our updated 2016 outlook. 
For the full year of 2016, we're raising our revenue guidance to now range between $3.609 billion and $3.615 billion, a 33% as-reported growth or organic and constant-currency growth of 14.1% compared to the prior year. This updated guidance includes a negative $1 million FX impact when compared to prior guidance rates. Net of FX, revenue is stepping up $10 million, the result of our strong Q3 operating performance. 
For 2016, we are updating our adjusted EBITDA guidance to now range between $1.65 billion and $1.656 billion and organic and constant-currency growth of 17% compared to the prior year. This absorbs an incremental $4 million of accelerated integration costs, $10 million of primarily cash-neutral U.S. GAAP adjustments related to Telecity and minimal FX impact. We are pleased with the business's adjusted EBITDA performance and expect to continue to drive margin improvement into 2017. 
And we're raising our AFFO to range between $1.059 billion and $1.065 billion, a 35% normalized and constant-currency growth rate compared to the prior year. This $17 million AFFO increase has negligible foreign currency benefit when compared to prior guidance and the result of strong operating performance and lower interest expense. 
And finally, we expect our 2016 capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion for the year. 
In closing, we are pleased with our progress this year as we continue to successfully integrate our acquisitions, grow our global platform and scale our interconnection services. Our digital ecosystems continue to thrive globally and the adoption of cloud services by enterprises is accelerating, driving new opportunities at Equinix, enhancing our operating metrics and significantly expanding our addressable market. We are focused on scaling and refining our go-to-market engine, directed at capturing the significant shift to the cloud and delivering continued profitable growth. 
So let me stop here, and we'll open it up for questions. I'll turn it back over to you, Sean."

I think there is definitely a prospect for accelerating demand at some level. We continue to see adoption from the top of the enterprise pyramid in terms of people adopting hybrid cloud as the IT architecture of choice, and really hybrid cloud, multi-cloud. I think that's an important distinction. We're seeing them really embrace public cloud as a way to variablize their cost structure and gain flexibility. But then also implementing hybrid cloud architectures that allow them to implement certain elements of private infrastructure where they see that as necessary and important from a performance and security standpoint. So we've had great success with our Performance Hub products, which I think people are using for a number of use cases, including WAN optimization as well as implementing the multi-cloud. And I think that we're continuing to see them really exercise that as the architecture of choice at the top of the pyramid. And I think what that's starting to do is roll down into the broader enterprise market opportunity as well, and we see that showing up in our channel in particular because our channel partners are now bringing a series of value-added services to perhaps smaller enterprise customers they're also beginning to adopt. So yes, we definitely see continued momentum and I think strong prospects going forward."

As it relates to the integration into our systems, a week ago, Monday, we actually had finally rolled in the U.K. business in -- onto our operating platform. So now we have both the Dutch and the U.K. business into our ECO platform, which is basically how we continue to scale the business. Next will be Ireland and Sweden. They're already in the REIT structure. And once we get those 2 into the -- onto the operating platform, 70% of the revenues will be covered inside our platform. I think the most important thing to note is as we acquire, whether it's Telecity or any business, the most important part is getting to the data and understanding what insight we can draw from that data. And so we're working very hard and diligently right now to not only grab the data, get it into our systems, process it, understand it, then execute against it. So that's where we are from an integration perspective. Suffice it to say, when you look at the overall business, as a company, we said, look, we'll take revenues up slightly when we look at Bit-isle and Telecity on a combined basis. When we look at EBITDA, we're going to take it down roughly $5 million. But as you're aware, there's $10 million of accounting adjustments that are taking place this quarter, which are predominantly noncash U.S. GAAP adjustments conform their results into our results. So the business is performing as we anticipate. I think the next step really is, though, to leverage off what we said earlier on, which is continuing to enjoy the benefits of cross-sell and execute against our platform, yet at the same time, make sure that we have sufficient inventory in the marketplace to support that."

We've now fully integrated them into a single unified sales team. Probably seeing a little more traction in terms of the Equinix team selling into the Telecity assets, but that's probably to be expected. And I think we're starting to now get the former Telecity employees really fully up to speed on the broad-level platform and seeing a lot of energy on that. And so that's another really critical litmus test, I think, and one that we've learned from previous acquisitions that it really requires a lot of attention and feel good about how that's proceeding as well."

I think what's most important is recognizing that this -- the integration process will be basically fully complete by the end of next year. We fully expect to get all of our cost synergies. We've seen some opportunities where our revenue synergies are starting to realize, which is good. And again, we've got very little, if you will, dollars allocated to that in fiscal year '16. But we're seeing many green shoots of opportunity. And then I think just overall, it's the scaling of our platform across Europe not only as we take what assets we have today but we invest in the platform on a go-forward basis with some of these 18 projects that are underway, that I think will really make a difference.

We continue to expect to deliver that or better, consistent with what we said on the -- at our Analyst Day, despite what transpired this specific quarter. As we think about the planning for 2017 and the guidance that we'll deliver in 2017, no surprise to you, as we continue to integrate the platform, it really becomes one entity and less about organic versus inorganic. And so we fully anticipate in 2017 that we'll give you complete guidance that includes all 3 entities on a go-forward basis. And given the fact that cost structures are effectively integrated now, are well on their way and we sold off a number of our non-core assets in the Japanese business, I think it makes best sense to give you one holistic number on a go-forward basis that you will measure us against. And then as it relates to EMEA, absolutely there was a number of things that were going on in the business this quarter. If we're dealing with just top line, the things that, of course, are impacting the business, first and foremost is the LD2 asset sale that's $3 million. We get a little bit of a benefit from Paris -- the Paris acquisition. And then currency, despite my comments that our hedges are working well, you still have the currency impact. Particularly as it relates to Telecity, and as you might have recalled in my comments, only 15 -- we're only hedged 50%. And the reason we're only hedged 50% is until we can get the European entities from Telecity into our platform and in our structure, our REIT and commissioner structure, any hedges that we place against the cash flows go below the line and not above the line.

And so where we think that we can make an investment that we think is going to create an enhanced ability for us to tap into what we think is a huge addressable market opportunity in front of us, then we're going to make a balanced decision to do that. And so as Keith said, we're in the midst of making some of those assessments now as to what that'll look like for how we'll guide for the year ahead. But we do -- we still have work to do. We're very pleased with our progress in terms of the evolution of our sales team to be a more capable, solution-selling enterprise sales team. We're really happy with how our channel continues to scale but are continuing to look at investments there that are necessary. We feel like we're going to need to continue to evolve our service portfolio to really be responsive to the enterprise market opportunity. All those things are things that we'll look to make some balanced investments in. So we definitely think there's build to the scale and other reasons -- opportunities for us to expand margins going forward, and we continue to be committed to that. But we'll balance that really against long-term value creation."

I don't think in my entire career that somebody has not selected us because of our credit rating.

And so I'm not particularly worried about it, but again, I think it is important for us to aspire to that and eventually get there because as interest rates move one way or the other over some period of time, whether that is over a year or over the next 5 years, we certainly want to enjoy that lower cost of fund relative to some of our peer companies and the like. And so our goal is to become investment-grade at some point, but we're not going to compromise our desire to grow the business on an organic basis and invest in our capital."

And so for all those reasons, as we come to the closing out period of the Telecity acquisition and finalizing their results into us, it's important to recognize that these small adjustments that take place during that period, the lion's share of them, of course, as you would expect, are around leases or lease accounting. And hence, why there's really no meaningful impact to AFFO.

So we're working with the suppliers of the cable. We're partnering with them. We're working with the funders of these big cable projects, and we're treating it as -- like we would any other pursuit.

I think Steve or Charles will take the second one. As it relates to the cross connects, certainly as we -- one of the main things that we have to do when we integrate one company into our platform is get a good handle on the data bits and understanding exactly what their inventory is, whether it's a cabinet, whether it's a cross connect or power circuit. That's an evolving exercise, as you can appreciate. So we moved both the Dutch business and the U.K. business on to the platform, but we're still in the process of making sure that we have clearly understood what basically the unit of measures are. And as a result, it's premature to tell you what the cross connects are. Suffice it to say, though, it would be meaningfully higher than what we're seeing here. Telecity historically had set some -- had given some numbers in the marketplace. We want to step away from those numbers, but knowing that they are -- there's a meaningful step-up in cross connects if we take the inventory that we see today and apply it to our unit count. That all said, I also want you to understand, though, that Telecity didn't -- they didn't really monetize those assets in a way that would be consistent with Equinix. And hence, I think that's the opportunity that we all see in front of us, is there's an opportunity to over some period of time take the cross connects, add more value to the assets by tethering them together and then being able to monetize that with our customers over some period of time. But rest assured, it's a number that we want to give you. We're just not at a point that we can at this stage. But over the not-too-distant future, you will be getting some input on that number."

Charles alluded to a number of acquisitions that we've made as of late, whether it's the Silicon Valley land, the D.C. land, Chicago, the Stratford, some of the land lease arrangements we made in Amsterdam and London, we are actively as a company trying to acquire more property where we can to enhance our campus but at the same time control more of our revenue from an owned perspective.

And then, of course, we're seeing continued strength in enterprise demand. So again, we had records in several of our verticals and near records in the others, so really good strength across the verticals. I would say that we're continuing -- we're really hitting our stride in terms of being able to generate higher numbers of sort of sweet spot deals and really accelerating the amount of business we can do in each quarter. From a rate perspective, I think we're seeing solid pricing trends across our geographies and really hitting the sweet spot in terms of some of these enterprise use cases around Performance Hub, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, et cetera. And I think that's a lot of what's driving the bookings momentum at this point."

We had a great third quarter delivering record bookings, fueled by significant growth in our cloud, financial and enterprise segments. We see a robust pipeline, driven by strong global demand from cloud service providers and the broad adoption of hybrid cloud as the IT architecture of choice. 
Today, Platform Equinix offers access to more than 1,400 networks and 2,700 cloud and IT service providers, making us a critical partner for multinational enterprises seeking to rearchitect their infrastructure to reduce cost, enhance their flexibility and optimize performance in an increasingly cloud-first world. 
As depicted on Slide 3, third quarter revenues were $924.7 million, up 3% quarter-over-quarter and up 14% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant-currency basis, above the top end of our guidance range. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $420 million for the quarter, flat over the prior quarter and up 18% year-over-year on an organic and constant-currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA absorbs an incremental $5 million of cash-neutral U.S. GAAP adjustments related to Telecity and $2.5 million of integration cost accelerated into Q3. Absent these adjustments, our adjusted EBITDA would have been at $427.5 million, above the top end of our guidance range. 
AFFO grew 44% year-over-year on a normalized and constant-currency basis. 
We are successfully cultivating and curating our digital ecosystems, which is driving healthy operating metrics across the board, including firm MRR per cabinet, low churn and strong interconnection growth. 
We added 10 Fortune 500 customers this quarter, including Target, a reading retailer; and Aetna, a healthcare and insurance provider, and we now have penetrated nearly 1/3 of the Fortune 500 and 1/4 of the Forbes Global 2000 companies. Our fastest growth continues to come from 3 region deployments, which now represent 55% of total recurring revenue, highlighting the importance of our global reach. 
Across all fronts, we're pleased with the volume, quality and diversity of bookings. We continue to capture critical strategic footprints and are leveraging our scaled global service delivery platform to process more deal flow than any other data center company. 
We are pressing our advantage to capture the next wave of demand, enhancing our go-to-market capabilities to win the cloud-enabled enterprise. Many new use cases are driving data center colocation for the foreseeable future, including the Internet of Things, next-generation security services, submarine cables, digital payments, wireless aggregation as well as compute storage and networking trends. 
Our differentiation as a company and the moat around our business continues to expand as we penetrate these new markets and grow our global interconnection platform. 
I would like to next provide commentary on how our acquisitions, organic development and expanding portfolio of interconnection services are accelerating our market leadership. 
Starting with interconnection. Interconnection revenue grew 19% year-over-year on an organic and constant-currency basis. We now have over 188,000 cross connects, and this is the ninth quarter in a row where we added greater than 5,000 cross connects. We saw strong growth of connections to cloud through both direct cross connects and on our Cloud Exchange. 
Our Internet exchanges also continued to scale, with provision capacity ramping up with 100-gig upgrades, which bodes well for a continued traffic growth. 
Also this quarter, we rolled out our Internet Exchange in Helsinki based on customer demand in this former Telecity site, expanding coverage of our Internet exchanges to 19 markets worldwide. 
Another interconnection driver is the submarine cable industry, which is experiencing explosive growth driven primarily by exponential increases in data traffic, consumed by the large cloud service providers and innovations in optical equipment with more cable laid in 2016 than over the past 5 years combined. As a result, we're seeing significant momentum as their strategic partner in these submarine cable projects. And we have won edge deployments for 12 projects to date, 8 of which are active and 4 which are in progress. Winning these deployments builds on our original vision of Equinix being the intersection point where all the data bits flow. And these wins will drive even more traffic to our sites following through colocation and interconnection services as network and cloud providers join the ecosystem. 
These multi-decade cable projects will help anchor our sites as the key interconnection points around the world, and our wins include AquaComms, which runs from New York to London; Southern Cross Cable Network, which runs from California to Sydney; and FASTER, which runs from the West Coast of the United States to Japan. 
Our newest win is with Monet, a next-generation cable architecture owned by Google and 3 telecom providers, connecting the United States to Brazil, where our Miami IBX will serve as the U.S. cable landing station. The Monet deployment represents an industry-first, deploying a submarine cable architecture together with an integrated cable landing station inside Equinix's network and cloud-dense, multi-tenant data centers. This new architecture, which eliminates the need for a separate cable landing station, was developed to meet the needs of large cloud providers for speed, efficiency and open system design. 
Turning to acquisitions. We significantly extended our scale and reach with the Telecity and Bit-isle acquisitions in Europe and Japan, and are progressing well with integrating these 2 businesses to deliver more value to our customers. 
The Telecity business delivered solid financial performance in the quarter and we're ahead of plan with our revenue and cost synergy targets, which includes customer cross-selling while concurrently integrating our product portfolio and our pricing strategy. We are enriching the data center metro connectivity across our combined EMEA footprint, which was recently completed in London and is underway in 5 other EMEA metros. 
We're also pleased with the Bit-isle's progress and saw healthy bookings across the entire Japanese business in the third quarter. We see sustained interest in our expanded Japanese portfolio, and tethering the Equinix and Bit-isle assets together has allowed us to position all of the properties as part of a larger campus ecosystem.
Turning to our organic development activity. We continue to invest and expand globally with 18 announced expansion projects underway. This quarter, we are moving forward with additional expansions in Dallas, Dublin, Frankfurt, Helsinki and Zürich, totaling over $100 million of capital expenditures. We are also progressing with 5 major new IBX builds in Amsterdam, Ashburn, Frankfurt, São Paulo and Silicon Valley, that will give us key capacity to satisfy strong demand and will expand our data center count to over 150 by mid-2017. 
In terms of our asset ownership strategy. We continue to acquire and develop land, building major new campuses on owned land at Ashburn, Frankfurt and Silicon Valley. This quarter, we also bought 6 acres of land next to our Chicago-3 IBX, which we'll develop over time to expand our Chicago Elk Grove campus, which is seeing increasing demand from cloud and financial customers. 
These capital investments are delivering very healthy growth and strong returns, as shown on Slide 4. Revenues from our 70 stabilized IBXs grew 6% year-over-year, largely driven by an increase in cross connect and power density. These stabilized assets are generating 32% cash-on-cash return on their gross PP&E invested, and utilization stepped up to 87%. 
Looking beyond the numbers. Customers increasingly care about greening their supply chains, and we are working hard to reduce our environmental and carbon footprint by improving energy efficiency and sourcing of renewable energy. We are building on our position as the leader in our space and continue to make progress towards the long-term -- our long-term goal of 100% clean and renewable energy. 
Let me now shift and cover the quarterly highlights from our vertical -- and our industry verticals. And I'll start with the networks. This vertical delivered strong bookings, a nice step up in revenues and meaningful logo ads this quarter. Network service providers, cable operators and satellite providers are growing with Equinix as they shift their portfolios to address the enterprise demand for cloud, mobile and new digital services like the Internet of Things. Growth this quarter was led by strength in EMEA and Asia as wireline providers augment their infrastructure to support cloud connectivity and deploy new optical technology. 
Customer expansions included Orange Business Services, a global IT and communications provider deploying a new cloud offering for enterprises; and Hawaiki submarine cable, a transpacific cable system between Australia and the United States. 
The financial services vertical achieved record bookings, with over-indexing growth from the trading, insurance and digital payment segments as we continued to make progress in expanding our relationships far beyond electronic trading. We've seen minimal impact to date from Brexit in our financial services segment, with continued traction across Europe, including near record bookings for the financial services segment in the U.K. 
This quarter, we expanded with PayPal, an important customer in the digital payments ecosystem, that is interconnecting to business partners to improve performance and latency, and helps PayPal maintain seamless transactions for on-demand shopping anywhere in the world. 
We also expanded with insurance customers, including Lloyd's, who is deploying a cloud-based risk modeling platform for the insurance industry, as well as a Fortune 100 insurance firm leveraging connectivity to AWS for big data analytics. 
In the content and digital media vertical, advertisers, CDNs and digital media were the growth drivers for bookings, led by the Asia Pacific region. Customer wins included Avid Technology, a leading editing and distribution platform that is deploying Performance Hub to connect remote end users to its product suite via Azure, as well as expansion in the quarter from ChinaCache, Porteyo [ph], Tencent and Yahoo! as they expand their digital edges. 
The cloud and IT services vertical had its second-best bookings quarter, with growth in Software-as-a-Service and multi-region infrastructure-as-a-Service deployments. We continue to enhance our value as the home of the interconnected cloud by increasing cloud density and coverage of Software-as-a-Service providers and making it easy for enterprises to find and consume a broad range of cloud services. 
Our Cloud Exchange saw a strong adoption, with solid growth in EMEA, good port orders and ramping traffic, driven by over 540 enterprises, clouds and networks using Cloud Exchange to interconnect. We continue to add cloud service providers across our markets, deepening our strategic footprints with anchors such as AWS, Azure, IBM SoftLayer, Google and Oracle, and expanding new availability to specialized cloud services in security, unified communications and enterprise application test and development. 
And turning to enterprise. This vertical also saw its second highest bookings quarter led by the Americas and captured a record number of new customers with expanding penetration of the Fortune 500. Wins included a Fortune 250 food manufacturer embracing digital transformation, a top 3 auto manufacturer optimizing their network topology in connecting to Azure through Cloud Exchange, as well as J.B. Hunt, a Fortune 500 transportation company. 
Our Performance Hub solution continues to see strong adoption, and more than 560 customers are using this solution to rearchitect their infrastructure to directly connect their people, locations, clouds and data. 
And finally, we continue to build and enhance our go-to-market engine through both direct and indirect channels. We are improving our market awareness and lead-generation capability through targeted programs and seeing strong results in creating a pipeline of highly qualified opportunities. We're seeing a steady stream of new customer adds, trending between 150 and 200 a quarter, with an increasing share coming from cloud and enterprise. 
We're also enjoying continued success in channel bookings, which account for roughly 15% of total bookings over the past several quarters, with 2/3 of this activity from resellers who are amplifying our market reach and providing our customers with end-to-end solutions. 
So let me stop there and turn the call over to Keith to cover the results for the quarter."
28202,404422832,1073351,"Equinix, Inc. (REIT), Equinix, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Equinix, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. As highlighted by Steve, Q3 was another very strong quarter across virtually all of our key operating metrics. We had record bookings with strong performance across each of the regions as well as",1472,"Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. As highlighted by Steve, Q3 was another very strong quarter across virtually all of our key operating metrics. We had record bookings with strong performance across each of the regions as well as our verticals, once again, reflecting the favorable position we enjoy across our marketplace. 
We delivered our 55th straight quarter of top line growth, the results of disciplined execution, and we experienced another quarter of healthy margin performance resulting in strong flow-through to AFFO from the underlying business. 
Revenues and AFFO were above our expectations, while adjusted EBITDA was at the low end of our guidance range, primarily due to cash-neutral U.S. GAAP adjustments related to Telecity. Absent these adjustments, our adjusted EBITDA would have been above the top end of our guidance range, consistent with our revenues and our operating performance. 
Looking at our other operating metrics. Our MRR per cabinet yield continues to remain strong at greater than $2,000 per cabinet. We added 2,200 net billable cabinets and gross cross-connect additions were a very positive 6,400 in the quarter. Note that all metrics have been normalized for the sale of our London 2 IBX, which was sold in early July as part of our asset divesture process related to the Telecity acquisition.
With respect to our acquisitions. Telecity and Bit-isle had their best bookings quarter of the year and we're making solid progress with our integration efforts. We're already enjoying the benefits of a number of cross-sell successes while the depth of the sales pipeline continues to grow. And we're on track to achieve our target cost synergies by the end of 2017. The financial and IT system work is well underway, and we've defined the critical initiatives to operationally integrate the back offices over the next 18 months. 
Specifically, as it relates to Bit-isle, we've integrated the business faster than originally anticipated, positioning the business to accelerate revenues and increase their operating margin more quickly than planned. 
We've also been able to sell their noncore assets sooner than expected. In October, we entered into an agreement to sell Terra Power, the third non-core Bit-isle business line, for approximately $78 million at current exchange rates. These proceeds, once fully received, will effectively reduce our net investment in Bit-isle and should make this transaction one of our best-performing M&A transactions from a return perspective. 
And finally, we've now replaced the temporary Bit-isle bridge facility with a permanent debt facility with an all-in cost of funds approximating 2%. 
Turning to foreign currency. Post Brexit news, we saw the weakening of the U.S. (sic) [U.K.] pound and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Since that time, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen against most of our operating currencies, largely due to a view that policymakers will increase interest rates in the U.S. by the end of the year. 
Our current FX hedges have proven to be very effective during this volatile period, and as a result, despite some level of impact, we don't anticipate this to be meaningful to our Q4 operating results, largely due to our pound sterling hedges being placed at $1.54 to the pound. 
As we look into 2017, we've already hedged over 50% of the EMEA revenues and cash flows and we expect our hedge position to increase over time as we continue to integrate Telecity entities into the EMEA business. 
So turning to the third quarter. As depicted on Slide 5, global Q3 revenues were $924.7 million above the top end of our guidance range, up 3% over the prior quarter and 14% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant-currency basis, reflecting positive momentum in both MRR and NRR revenue lines. Our global platform continues to expand in Asia Pacific and EMEA, showing organic and constant-currency growth on the same quarter compared to last year of 19% and 15% respectively, while the Americas region produced steady growth of 11%. Our as-reported revenues include $147.1 million from our acquisitions, consistent with our expectations. 
Q3 revenues net of our FX hedges included a $1.9 million negative currency impact when compared to the average FX rates used last quarter and a $1.3 million positive currency benefit when compared to our guidance rates. 
Global adjusted EBITDA was $420 million, flat over the prior quarter and up 18% over the same quarter last year on an organic and constant-currency basis. Our as-reported adjusted EBITDA included $19 million of integration costs. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA margin stepped down to 45.4%, lower than the prior quarter. 
Relative to our prior guidance, we booked an incremental $5 million of cash neutral U.S. GAAP adjustments related to Telecity as we refined our estimates during Q3. These adjustments included the conversion of certain leases from capitalized to operating classification, which had minimal net impact to our AFFO metric. Additionally, we accelerated $2.5 million of Telecity integration cost into Q3. 
Our Q3 adjusted EBITDA performance, net of our FX hedges, was essentially flat when compared to the average FX rates last quarter and a $700,000 positive benefit when compared to our guidance rates. 
Global AFFO was $284.2 million, down slightly over the prior quarter. FFO on a normalized and constant-currency basis increased 44% over the prior year. 
Moving to churn. Global Q3 churn was 2%, consistent with our expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect MRR churn to remain in our targeted range of 2% to 2.5%. 
Turning to 2017. We continue to expect MRR churn to range average between 2% and 2.5% per quarter, which includes elevated churn of approximately 3% in Q1 related to the final phase of LinkedIn's bifurcation strategy. 
I'd now like to provide a few highlights in the regions with full results covered on Slides 6 through 8. The Americas region had the second highest bookings quarter of all time, driven by our cloud and financial services verticals, with ongoing strong outflow in production and healthy yield. 
EMEA delivered a record bookings quarter, with particular strength in the Dutch and French markets. EMEA continued to execute against its key business initiatives, including the integration of the Telecity business. As a reminder, revenue loss from the London 2 asset sale approximated $3 million for the quarter. 
Asia Pacific remains our fastest-growing region, with strong bookings in Hong Kong and Tokyo markets, driven by cloud and IT and financial verticals. 
Interconnection revenues continued to outpace overall growth of the business with the Americas, APAC and EMEA interconnection revenues now at 23%, 11% and 7%, respectively of recurring revenues, updated for the sale of our London 2 IBX. 
Now looking to the balance sheet. Please refer to Slide 9. Unrestricted cash and investments increased over $1 billion after taking into consideration the proceeds related to the EMEA asset sale as well as funds used to purchase our Paris 2 and 3 assets. Our outstanding debt approximates $7 billion, a slight decrease over the prior quarter, primarily due to one of our capital leases converting to an operating lease. 
 
Our debt leverage ratio net of unrestricted cash was about 3.6x our Q3 annualized adjusted EBITDA. Also of note during the quarter, S&P raised our corporate credit rating to BB+. We continue to aspire to be an investment-grade rated company, yet we'll continue to balance that aspiration with our objective to invest our capital with the highest and best use mindset. 
Now switching to AFFO and dividends on Slide 10. For 2016, we're raising our as-reported AFFO to now range between $1.059 billion and $1.065 billion, a 28% year-over-year increase, the results of our strong operating performance and lower-than-expected interest and tax expenses. 
AFFO on a normalized and constant-currency basis is now expected to range between $1.182 billion and $1.188 billion, a 35% increase over the prior year. 
On a fully diluted share basis using our weighted average 71.7 million common shares outstanding, AFFO per share is expected to be $16.55, a 13% increase over the prior year. 
Also today, we announced our Q4 dividend of $1.75 a share, consistent with our Q3 quarterly dividend. Our AFFO payout ratio was estimated to be approximately 47% for 2016. 
Now looking at capital expenditures. Please refer to Slide 7. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $279.5 million, including recurring CapEx of $41.6 million, consistent with our guidance expectations. During the quarter, we opened 6 new projects across our regions, adding much needed capacity, particularly in EMEA, and currently have another 18 projects under way as we continue to see strong development returns across our new expansion and stabilized IBX projects. 
And finally, we've provided you a number of slides that bridge our 2016 guidance from the normalized 2015 performance, including slides for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. Please refer to slides 12 through 15. 
I'll now turn the call back to Steve."

And finally, on Slide 16, it summarizes our updated Q4 and full year 2016 guidance, including the impact of FX changes. Now let me cover our updated 2016 outlook. 
For the full year of 2016, we're raising our revenue guidance to now range between $3.609 billion and $3.615 billion, a 33% as-reported growth or organic and constant-currency growth of 14.1% compared to the prior year. This updated guidance includes a negative $1 million FX impact when compared to prior guidance rates. Net of FX, revenue is stepping up $10 million, the result of our strong Q3 operating performance. 
For 2016, we are updating our adjusted EBITDA guidance to now range between $1.65 billion and $1.656 billion and organic and constant-currency growth of 17% compared to the prior year. This absorbs an incremental $4 million of accelerated integration costs, $10 million of primarily cash-neutral U.S. GAAP adjustments related to Telecity and minimal FX impact. We are pleased with the business's adjusted EBITDA performance and expect to continue to drive margin improvement into 2017. 
And we're raising our AFFO to range between $1.059 billion and $1.065 billion, a 35% normalized and constant-currency growth rate compared to the prior year. This $17 million AFFO increase has negligible foreign currency benefit when compared to prior guidance and the result of strong operating performance and lower interest expense. 
And finally, we expect our 2016 capital expenditures to be approximately $1 billion for the year. 
In closing, we are pleased with our progress this year as we continue to successfully integrate our acquisitions, grow our global platform and scale our interconnection services. Our digital ecosystems continue to thrive globally and the adoption of cloud services by enterprises is accelerating, driving new opportunities at Equinix, enhancing our operating metrics and significantly expanding our addressable market. We are focused on scaling and refining our go-to-market engine, directed at capturing the significant shift to the cloud and delivering continued profitable growth.

I think there is definitely a prospect for accelerating demand at some level. We continue to see adoption from the top of the enterprise pyramid in terms of people adopting hybrid cloud as the IT architecture of choice, and really hybrid cloud, multi-cloud. I think that's an important distinction. We're seeing them really embrace public cloud as a way to variablize their cost structure and gain flexibility. But then also implementing hybrid cloud architectures that allow them to implement certain elements of private infrastructure where they see that as necessary and important from a performance and security standpoint. So we've had great success with our Performance Hub products, which I think people are using for a number of use cases, including WAN optimization as well as implementing the multi-cloud. And I think that we're continuing to see them really exercise that as the architecture of choice at the top of the pyramid. And I think what that's starting to do is roll down into the broader enterprise market opportunity as well, and we see that showing up in our channel in particular because our channel partners are now bringing a series of value-added services to perhaps smaller enterprise customers they're also beginning to adopt. So yes, we definitely see continued momentum and I think strong prospects going forward."

As it relates to the integration into our systems, a week ago, Monday, we actually had finally rolled in the U.K. business in -- onto our operating platform. So now we have both the Dutch and the U.K. business into our ECO platform, which is basically how we continue to scale the business. Next will be Ireland and Sweden. They're already in the REIT structure. And once we get those 2 into the -- onto the operating platform, 70% of the revenues will be covered inside our platform. I think the most important thing to note is as we acquire, whether it's Telecity or any business, the most important part is getting to the data and understanding what insight we can draw from that data. And so we're working very hard and diligently right now to not only grab the data, get it into our systems, process it, understand it, then execute against it. So that's where we are from an integration perspective. Suffice it to say, when you look at the overall business, as a company, we said, look, we'll take revenues up slightly when we look at Bit-isle and Telecity on a combined basis. When we look at EBITDA, we're going to take it down roughly $5 million. But as you're aware, there's $10 million of accounting adjustments that are taking place this quarter, which are predominantly noncash U.S. GAAP adjustments conform their results into our results. So the business is performing as we anticipate. I think the next step really is, though, to leverage off what we said earlier on, which is continuing to enjoy the benefits of cross-sell and execute against our platform, yet at the same time, make sure that we have sufficient inventory in the marketplace to support that."

And I think we're actually well ahead of plan in terms of what we're seeing there. We're seeing a lot of energy from both sales teams. We've now fully integrated them into a single unified sales team. Probably seeing a little more traction in terms of the Equinix team selling into the Telecity assets, but that's probably to be expected. And I think we're starting to now get the former Telecity employees really fully up to speed on the broad-level platform and seeing a lot of energy on that. And so that's another really critical litmus test, I think, and one that we've learned from previous acquisitions that it really requires a lot of attention and feel good about how that's proceeding as well."

So it's hard to say specifically what Telecity as an entity, when will it get back to its historical growth because ultimately, what we're doing now is selling across our platform. I think what's most important is recognizing that this -- the integration process will be basically fully complete by the end of next year. We fully expect to get all of our cost synergies. We've seen some opportunities where our revenue synergies are starting to realize, which is good. And again, we've got very little, if you will, dollars allocated to that in fiscal year '16. But we're seeing many green shoots of opportunity. And then I think just overall, it's the scaling of our platform across Europe not only as we take what assets we have today but we invest in the platform on a go-forward basis with some of these 18 projects that are underway, that I think will really make a difference. And you combine that with what Charles said earlier on and what Steve's talked about from the enterprise perspective, we're really excited about certainly seeing more momentum coming out of those -- that specific entity, but it's really more about the collective business that we're looking forward to executing against."

First and foremost, as it relates to an AFFO per share of $18 a share for 2017. We continue to expect to deliver that or better, consistent with what we said on the -- at our Analyst Day, despite what transpired this specific quarter. As we think about the planning for 2017 and the guidance that we'll deliver in 2017, no surprise to you, as we continue to integrate the platform, it really becomes one entity and less about organic versus inorganic. And so we fully anticipate in 2017 that we'll give you complete guidance that includes all 3 entities on a go-forward basis. And given the fact that cost structures are effectively integrated now, are well on their way and we sold off a number of our non-core assets in the Japanese business, I think it makes best sense to give you one holistic number on a go-forward basis that you will measure us against. And then as it relates to EMEA, absolutely there was a number of things that were going on in the business this quarter. If we're dealing with just top line, the things that, of course, are impacting the business, first and foremost is the LD2 asset sale that's $3 million. We get a little bit of a benefit from Paris -- the Paris acquisition. And then currency, despite my comments that our hedges are working well, you still have the currency impact. Particularly as it relates to Telecity, and as you might have recalled in my comments, only 15 -- we're only hedged 50%. And the reason we're only hedged 50% is until we can get the European entities from Telecity into our platform and in our structure, our REIT and commissioner structure, any hedges that we place against the cash flows go below the line and not above the line. And as a result, you've got some deterioration as it relates to currency movements in the marketplace."

And as you've heard me say before and I think others have certainly said the same thing, is a lot of times when we look at how we invest in incremental projects or initiatives, it's really about how do we find our highest and best use of our cost. And so sometimes, it means that we reallocate certain cost to areas where we think it's a higher and better use of that capital.

And then there's a number of other of what I call acquisition-related adjustments. Those are -- that's the biggest area. But there's another -- a few other what we call conforming areas, where we've taken Telecity's operating policies and procedures and conforming it to Equinix's standards, such as bad debt and sales allowance, deferred installation and the like. And so for all those reasons, as we come to the closing out period of the Telecity acquisition and finalizing their results into us, it's important to recognize that these small adjustments that take place during that period, the lion's share of them, of course, as you would expect, are around leases or lease accounting. And hence, why there's really no meaningful impact to AFFO. It's really just moving costs from one bucket to the other, if you will, and therefore, it doesn't affect the AFFO -- or the AFFO neutral."

And these are all around the world, and these are, as we've stated in the past, where the technologies advanced to the point where our data centers are located in so many locations that are accessible to these cable landing that the regeneration points that they used to have to do when they hit land, they can take them straight inland now to an Equinix facility. So we're working with the suppliers of the cable. We're partnering with them. We're working with the funders of these big cable projects, and we're treating it as -- like we would any other pursuit. And we want more of that traffic. And it's being -- these things used to be funded by the big networks years ago. Now they're being funded by the big cloud providers because they are getting ready for all the cloud traffic that's going to traverse the world. And as we said today, we want -- the premise of this company is to get more bits of traffic flowing through these data centers. And we will -- it will pull colo. It will pull interconnection.

But again, as you know, we're really focusing on cash-on-cash delivery in the business. And so there's no impact to AFFO at this juncture, but it is a slight deterioration in the margin. And as we look forward to the fourth quarter, clearly, we want to continue to drive continued margin into the business. If you take out the acquisition-related costs and integration, we're close to 48%. And again, that's a great position to just sort of end the year at as we think about fiscal year '17."

I think Steve or Charles will take the second one. As it relates to the cross connects, certainly as we -- one of the main things that we have to do when we integrate one company into our platform is get a good handle on the data bits and understanding exactly what their inventory is, whether it's a cabinet, whether it's a cross connect or power circuit. That's an evolving exercise, as you can appreciate. So we moved both the Dutch business and the U.K. business on to the platform, but we're still in the process of making sure that we have clearly understood what basically the unit of measures are. And as a result, it's premature to tell you what the cross connects are. Suffice it to say, though, it would be meaningfully higher than what we're seeing here. Telecity historically had set some -- had given some numbers in the marketplace. We want to step away from those numbers, but knowing that they are -- there's a meaningful step-up in cross connects if we take the inventory that we see today and apply it to our unit count. That all said, I also want you to understand, though, that Telecity didn't -- they didn't really monetize those assets in a way that would be consistent with Equinix. And hence, I think that's the opportunity that we all see in front of us, is there's an opportunity to over some period of time take the cross connects, add more value to the assets by tethering them together and then being able to monetize that with our customers over some period of time. But rest assured, it's a number that we want to give you. We're just not at a point that we can at this stage. But over the not-too-distant future, you will be getting some input on that number."

That would bring the total year up to $59 million. That is $4 million higher than we originally anticipated for the year.

And in fact, as we stand here today, I think we would reduce it by $4 million, all else being equal. And so right now, the overall project is consistent -- the overall integration plan, I should say, is consistent from a dollar perspective. As it relates to the acquisition of other property, both raw land, if you will, and then also land underneath the IBXs that we operate today, we're always looking to acquire those property. Charles alluded to a number of acquisitions that we've made as of late, whether it's the Silicon Valley land, the D.C. land, Chicago, the Stratford, some of the land lease arrangements we made in Amsterdam and London, we are actively as a company trying to acquire more property where we can to enhance our campus but at the same time control more of our revenue from an owned perspective. And right now, our revenue, at least on an organic basis with the owned assets, is 39%. On a consolidated basis, it's roughly 35%. We want to see that number up. And our stated objective, we'd love to see it around 50%. I don't know if we can get there and when we can get there. But certainly, that's our objective is to own more and more of our properties."
