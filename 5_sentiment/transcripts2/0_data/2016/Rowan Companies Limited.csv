Good morning, and welcome to our earnings call. We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investment in Rowan.

We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investment in Rowan. 
Following my prepared comments, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market, and then Stephen will walk you through our financial performance and future guidance. After that, we'll open up the call for your questions. 
As you see from our press release, we had a strong fourth quarter despite challenging market conditions. Our earnings, normalized for certain items, which Stephen will address shortly, were $0.95 per share, up from $0.89 per share in the third quarter on a normalized basis. Our solid performance was attributed to all 4 of our newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships being on rate and our continued focus on offshore and onshore cost control, underpinned by excellent operational execution throughout our fleet.
Earnings and cost focus resulted in robust free cash flow in the quarter, ending the year with over $418 million of cash, even after retiring nearly $100 million of our debt. We sold off Rowan Louisiana, our last slot-type rig, as we continue to make steady progress toward high-grading our fleet. Although we are fortunate to have some of our older rigs working under profitable contracts, we do have 3 other older assets that are now cold-stacked and unlikely to return to service as they may not fit our future fleet profile.
After the full year, it was certainly a challenging one but also full of accomplishments, large and small. At the onset of 2015, we were focused on successfully delivering our last 2 drillships. I'm pleased that we have been successful in leveraging our long-standing reputation for operational excellence, with jack-ups into a position at the upper end of the ultra-deepwater market. We've received positive feedback from our customers on both the quality of our assets and the level of our performance. This significant strategic step will serve Rowan for years to come. Given that we already have a relatively young and high-specification fleet, I believe continued strong operational efficiency will be the key to maximizing profitability when the industry begins its eventual recovery.
We also focused on further strengthening our balance sheet in 2015. We prioritized reducing our costs and preserving liquidity and was successful on both fronts. Our 2015 operating costs were relatively flat with the 2014 level even while adding over 2.5 years of additional ultra-deepwater days, which added $145 million of costs during the year. I consider this an impressive performance. 
Our current cash balance and availability under our undrawn revolver provide access to nearly $2 billion of liquidity. I'm proud of our finance team's efforts in 2015, as they were able to upsize our revolving credit facility to $1.5 billion and extend the maturity to 2021. 
I feel confident in our liquidity position, given our robust expected free cash flow from our high-quality backlog, continued focus on cost and capital spend and savings follow the elimination of our dividend. We feel quite prepared to handle an extended downturn and, should attractive opportunities become available, invest countercyclically for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. 
I'd also like to thanks our crews for their continued focus on safety. I'm extremely proud to report that we had the best safety performance on record in the company's history with a 30% improvement in total reportable incident rates over the prior year. This is especially impressive considering we commenced operations on 2 new drillships during this period. This achievement served to reinforce what I've stated repeatedly in the last few quarters. We believe our cost-cutting efforts are measured and thoughtful, reducing costs where possible while maintaining a focus on safety, reliability and protecting the environment.
Lastly, although we are disappointed in our absolute shareholder return, given the challenging market for our industry, we are pleased that we led our peer group in relative total shareholder returns, both the 1- and a 3-year period ending December 31, 2015. This is obviously a feedback we will be striving to repeat many times in the coming years.
With respect to market conditions, I wish I had more positive news, but the current environment is relatively poor. Most of our customers are focused on preserving liquidity and cutting short-term spending. We are seeing a few bright spots, which Mark will discuss shortly, there seems to be more jack-up opportunity deepwater at the moment, but we do not see a recovery in either markets in the near term.
Finally before I turn the call over to Mark, as many of you are already aware, Matt Rolls will retire as Executive Chairman of the Board at this year's Annual Shareholders Meeting in April. Matt leaves behind a legacy of transforming Rowan into a pure-play offshore driller with a tremendously successful entry into the ultra-deepwater markets, all while focusing on safe and reliable operations.
On behalf of our employees and the Board of Directors, we would like to send our heartfelt thanks to Matt and wish him the best in retirement. Now for a look at the markets where Rowan competes, I'll hand call over to Mark."
300794,323472958,942242,"Rowan Companies plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2016",2016-02-26,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. The unstable commodity price environment, further decreases in operator spending and the overall lack of confidence in near-term market recovery have combined for a rough start to 2016.

The unstable commodity price environment, further decreases in operator spending and the overall lack of confidence in near-term market recovery have combined for a rough start to 2016. Rigs continue to roll-off contract and add to the existing industry oversupply. And competition is fierce for the few contracting opportunities currently in discussion. 
Our global marketing team is aggressively and creatively approaching every opportunity as we focus on blend-and-extend discussions and contract backlog additions for our ultra-deepwater drillships, our available jack-ups and those rolling off contract in 2016.
So all 4 of our ultra-deepwater drillships are contracted into 2017 or beyond. We realized the benefits for both our customers and Rowan to consider amending the current contracts to potentially lower the day rates in the near term in exchange for additional term to bridge the current trough cycle.
As we mentioned on our last call, these are difficult negotiations that take time to refine and reach mutually acceptable terms. 
In our jack-up fleet, we are pleased to announce the recently signed contract with EOG in Trinidad for the Ralph Coffman. The rig will mobilize from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and is estimated to commence operations in the third quarter of this year for 5 wells, with an estimated duration of 1 year at a rate of 135,000 a day, inclusive of amortized lump sum fees. The Ralph Coffman will join the EXL II and the Joe Douglas currently operating in Trinidad. 
In our last fleet status, we announced the addition of the BP contract for the Joe Douglas, which will commence in direct continuation following the completion of required surveys and inspections after its current project with BHP. Rowan has a lot of history of operations in Trinidad, and it continues to be in each market for our high-spec jack-up fleet.
Turning to the Middle East. We have 10 jack-ups operating, and the J.P. Bussell is currently warm-stacked in Bahrain. Demand in the Middle East is forecast to remain relatively steady through 2016, as this is one of the few areas of the world where meaningful tender prospects exist. 
Discussions are ongoing with Saudi Aramco regarding day rates for our jack-ups during 2016, so I won't comment further on that topic. 
Taking a look at the North Sea. 5 of our 6 jack-ups are contracted, and 2 of those units have backlog in 2017 and beyond. We're talking with our customers about the opportunity for continued operations, and there are several projects that we're considering for our units rolling off-contract well both in and out of the region.
We believe our harsh environment, high-spec units will reman attractive to the marketplace, and we're hopeful to contain above market utilization levels but expect rates to be under pressure.
The U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia remain weak, and we continue to review opportunities to position our jack-ups in alternative regions where demand may be stronger.
I won't go into detail, given the competitive nature of the current environment, but we are actively pursuing bright spots in the global market that we believe will yield long-term contracts.
During a downturn, our customers can have their pick of contractors and drilling units. They value the tradition of excellence that Rowan has established in its more than 90-year history. They value our commitment to safe and reliable operations and our young, high-spec fleet. They value our financial conservatism and the visibility and stability it provides through these turbulent times. 
2016 will be brewing, but Rowan remains focused on our core values that will deliver a high level of performance to our customers, which translates into higher shareholder value. 
Thank you for your time this morning. I'll now turn the call over to Steven."

On the call today, I will review our fourth quarter 2015 operating results compared to the prior quarter and provide you with an update to our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers. 
For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $124 million or $0.99 per share versus a net loss of $239 million or $1.92 per share in the third quarter.
The fourth quarter results included a gain on the sale of the Rowan Louisiana of $6 million and a $1 million loss on the early distinguishment of debt, while the third quarter results included a noncash asset impairment charge of $274 million, a $75 million income tax charge related to a valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets and a $1.7 million legal settlement charge.
Excluding the aforementioned items, our net income was $119 million or $0.95 per share in the fourth quarter versus $111 million or $0.89 per share in the third quarter on the same normalized basis.
The increase is primarily attributable to our cost-reduction efforts, which more than offset the reduction in the contribution from our jack-up fleet. 
During the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $528 million, excluding rebillable items, which is approximately 1% lower than third quarter revenue. Our jack-up fleet generated 165 fewer operating days, primarily due to the cold-stacking of the Rowan Gorilla II, Gorilla III and the Cecil Provine, while our 4 drillships contributed similar revenue during both the third and fourth quarters.
Our average jack-up day rate increased by 7% due to higher levels of idle time on certain rigs with lower rates. While the average rate on our drillships was relatively flat, it's all in our long-term contract.
Our operational performance is very strong during the fourth quarter. Our out-of-service time was less than 3% of available rig days, which was in line with our expectations. Our downtime, which is unbillable time when a rig is operating, represented less than 1% of in-service days for jack-ups and less than 2% in total during the quarter.
Our idle time, which reflects periods when a rig is not contracted but is available to work, increased slightly to 14% of available days from 13% in the prior quarter. However, we have continued our swift response to the weaker market conditions and have reduced the operating costs of our 5 idle jack-ups to mitigate this impact.
All in all, we achieved the marketed utilization rate for our fleet of 80% in the fourth quarter, slightly lower than the 82% achieved in the prior quarter. 
Moving on to expenses. Our fourth quarter operating expenses were $228 million, excluding rebuilds, a reduction of 3% from $236 million in the third quarter, which was driven largely by cost reductions on our idle rigs and, to a lesser extent, continued cost-control efforts throughout the rest of the fleet and our shorebase location.
Our full year 2015 operating expenses were $950 million, which is nearly $200 million lower than our original guidance provided in November of 2014, and $160 million lower than our guidance provided in February of 2015. This meaningful reduction demonstrates our ability to quickly and appropriately respond to the cyclical environment. The decrease is due largely to reduce personnel-related expenses, repair and maintenance, rig insurance and favorable foreign exchange rates in certain areas.
Again, this excludes rebillable items, which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenue.
Our fourth quarter SG&A expense totaled $27 million, which was slightly lower than our guidance and the third quarter level due to the impact of cost-control measures. Our fourth quarter depreciation expense totaled $102 million, which was in line with our guidance and slightly lower than the third quarter level due to the third quarter impairment charge.
Interest expense, which was $40 million during the fourth quarter, was slightly lower than previous guidance and prior quarter level, as we retired approximately $100 million of debt during the quarter. As we announced last month, we retired outstanding senior notes, which would have come due over the next 4 years, eliminating over $21 million of interest expense over the same period.
Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was approximately 10%, which was in line with our previous guidance.
Moving on to our cash flow and balance sheet. Property and equipment additions totaled $44 million during the fourth quarter and nearly all of our related and maintenance CapEx, upgrades and spares. Our full year 2015 property additions totaled $706 million, including the delivery of the Rowan Relentless. 
Demonstrating our strong focus on capital discipline, this total is approximately $170 million lower than our original guidance provided in November of 2014 and $150 million lower than our guidance provided in February of 2015.
Our free cash flow generation was strong during the quarter, resulting in our cash balance increasing by nearly $200 million despite our early retirement of approximately $100 million of senior notes. At quarter end, we had nearly $485 million in cash, and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility remains undrawn.
Further, as Tom mentioned, we were pleased to recently amend our credit agreement to extend the maturity date to January 2021. Availability under the facility is $1.5 billion through January 2019, declining to $1.44 billion through January 2020 and approximately $1.29 billion through maturity.
We are grateful for the relationships we have with our lenders, and I want to reiterate our gratitude for their strong support of our recent extension. We believe our current cash balance, $3.6 billion revenue backlog and our 5-year revolving credit facility will provide a comfortable level of liquidity and flexibility to both weather the cyclical downturn and invest countercyclically at the appropriate time.
Moving on to 2016. I will now provide an update to the preliminary guidance discussed in our previous quarterly call. As reflected in our latest fleet status report, we have all 4 of our ultra-deepwater ships contracted into 2017 or early 2018. We also have 12 jack-ups already contracted beyond 2016, with 8 of those into 2018 or beyond.
Although this backlog provides us a strong visibility, we are also mindful that we have 12 marketed jack-ups, which have availability in 2016. We expect to continue experiencing elevated levels of idle time between contracts until the industry works through its excess capacity. 
Our 2016 operating expenses, excluding rebillable items, are expected to range from $865 million to $885 million, which is 7% or $65 million below our previous guidance and a 7% to 9% reduction from the 2015 level despite an increase of approximately $35 million due to the full year impact of 2 drillships that commenced operations last year.
Excluding that impact, operating expenses are expected to decline by approximately $100 million to $120 million or 11% to 13% year-over-year as a result of reduced costs associated with idle jack-ups, the full year impact of cost-control measures instituted during 2015 and the impact of incremental initiatives already identified for 2016.
First quarter 2016 operating expenses are expected to approximate $220 million. Our 2016 SG&A expenses are expected to decline by approximately 5% to 10% and range from $105 million to $110 million, with approximately $28 million in the first quarter. Our 2016 depreciation expense is expected to increase to $400 million to $410 million, as we incur a full year impact of depreciation from the last 2 drillships, which will more than offset the reduction from the third quarter 2015 impairment charge. First quarter 2016 depreciation expense is expected to be approximately $100 million. We expect 2016 interest expense to approximate $157 million, which reflects an increase over the 2015 level we do not expect to capitalize any interest in 2016, and also reflects the early retirement of debt during the fourth quarter of 2015. First quarter 2016 interest expense is expected to approximate $39 million. 
Our 2016 effective tax rate is expected to range from 10% to 15%, but this rate could fluctuate if our jurisdictional mix of earnings changes throughout the year. We expect our 2016 maintenance capital expenditures to range from $180 million to $190 million, excluding any contractual modifications that may arise due to our securing additional work. 
As we review 2015, we are very pleased with our record safety results and financial performance in an extremely challenging environment. However, we are managing the business with the expectation that these market conditions, which began nearly 18 months ago, will continue for the next few years as our customers reposition for a lower oil price environment. We have strategically positioned Rowan to weather this difficult business climate through our solid liquidity, attractive debt maturity profile, low level of capital commitments, substantial backlog and high-specification and modern fleet.
As we continue to navigate through this down cycle, we will remain focused on revenue efficiency and reducing our cost structure to further enhance our competitive position. 
With that, we are now prepared to open the call for questions. Operator?"

And I think that's probably your question. So we're thinking through that ourselves. When we actually look back at our downtime and, I guess, specifically, subsea downtime, the reason actually in our limited deepwater operating industry much where this model would have helped us financially because some of the other -- some of the issues we had on something, which should be limited.

And so there's just a lot of intricacies and detail in what we do versus what you do right. But I would say that generally, the Chinese shipyards we're a lot less familiar with. And so therefore, we're a little bit wary of them because we never bought anything from Chinese shipyards, although a lot of us [indiscernible]. But we're really a bit more wary of them, but we do think the Singaporean shipyards and the Middle East shipyards have very good quality on the jack-up side. So we're less worried about them. And the rigs are in operation. You can go back and look at this operating history. So I think it's a little bit of a mixed bag, but it's something that leaving about all the time. And it's very surprising very massively by between shipyards as to who's willing to do what. It's a complex that's sort answer of that, but looking at what really hard."

And we've worked for them before, and we tried to do a good job and we'll try to bury hard to do a job for them in this new contract in Trinidad because they've been a good customer to us. I guess, one thing about my comment I would say is that given that we have 27 jack-ups active, 10 [indiscernible] jack-ups, we have 27 jack-ups, I should say, and we have 4 deepwater drillships, it's probably fairly likely that we will see more jack-up tenders that we see floating tenders, right? If you would perhaps one of the other drilling contractors a lot more emphasis and floaters, you might think of it a bit differently.  But we see a lot more activity on the jack-up side. But it might've be sort of a bias given what our fleet is in the conversations we are having with customers. So -- and it obviously varies a lot by region. Regarding the breakeven oil price on jack-ups work, I think it's -- it's a really good question. And I think a number of analysts really kind of dig into this between it's an open water type where we're drilling and we put a platform in place after -- if we find something or delineating a part of the field reached by our current platform or we're working over a platform or we're putting a new well in our unused slot on the current platform, just massively different economics of when you would basically call out a rig to do work.

Good morning, and welcome to our earnings call. We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investment in Rowan.

We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investment in Rowan. 
Following my prepared comments, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market, and then Stephen will walk you through our financial performance and future guidance. After that, we'll open up the call for your questions. 
As you see from our press release, we had a strong fourth quarter despite challenging market conditions. Our earnings, normalized for certain items, which Stephen will address shortly, were $0.95 per share, up from $0.89 per share in the third quarter on a normalized basis. Our solid performance was attributed to all 4 of our new-build ultra-deepwater drillships being on rate and our continued focus on offshore and onshore cost control, underpinned by excellent operational execution throughout our fleet.
Our earnings and cost focus resulted in robust free cash flow in the quarter, ending the year with over $418 million of cash even after retiring nearly $100 million of our debt. We sold off Rowan Louisiana, our last slot-type rig as we continue to make steady progress toward high grading our fleet. Although we are fortunate to have some of our older rigs working under profitable contracts, we do have 3 other older assets that are now cold-stacked and unlikely to return to service as they may not fit our future fleet profile.
After the full year, it was certainly a challenging one but also full of accomplishments, large and small. At the onset of 2015, we were focused on successfully delivering our last 2 drillships. I'm pleased that we have been successful in leveraging our long-standing reputation for operational excellence with jack-up into a position at the upper end of the ultra-deepwater market. We've received positive feedback from our customers on both the quality of our assets and our level of performance. This significant strategic step will serve Rowan for years to come. Given that we already have a relatively young and high-specification fleet, I believe continued strong operational efficiency will be the key to maximizing profitability when the industry begins its eventual recovery.
We also focused on further strengthening our balance sheet in 2015. We prioritized reducing our costs and preserving liquidity and were successful on both fronts. Our 2015 operating costs were relatively flat with the 2014 level even while adding over 2.5 years of additional ultra-deepwater days, which added $145 million of costs during the year. I consider this an impressive performance. 
Our current cash balance and availability under our undrawn revolver provide access to nearly $2 billion of liquidity. I'm proud of our finance team's efforts in 2015, as they were able to upsize our revolving credit facility to $1.5 billion and extend the maturity to 2021. 
I feel confident in our liquidity position, given our robust expected free cash flow from our high-quality backlog, continued focus on cost and capital spend and savings follow the elimination of our dividend. We feel quite prepared to handle an extended downturn, and should attractive opportunities become available, invest countercyclically for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. 
I'd also like to thank our crews for their continued focus on safety. I'm extremely proud to report that we had the best safety performance on record in the company's history with a 30% improvement in total reportable incident rates over the prior year. This is especially impressive, considering when we commenced operations on 2 new drillships during this period. This achievement served to reinforce what I've stated repeatedly in the last few quarters. We believe our cost-cutting efforts are measured and thoughtful, reducing costs where possible while maintaining our focus on safety, reliability and protecting the environment.
Lastly, although we are disappointed in our absolute shareholder return, given the challenging market for our industry, we are pleased that we led our peer group in relative total shareholder return for both the 1 and a 3-year period ending December 31, 2015. This is obviously a feedback we will be striving to repeat many times in the coming years.
With respect to market conditions, I wish I had more positive news, but the current environment is relatively poor. Most of our customers are focused on preserving liquidity and cutting short-term spending. We are seeing a few bright spots, which Mark will discuss shortly. There seems to be more jack-up opportunity in deepwater at the moment, but we do not see recoveries in either markets in the near term.
Finally before I turn the call over to Mark, as many of you are already aware, Matt Ralls will retire as Executive Chairman of the Board at this year's Annual Shareholders Meeting in April. Matt leaves behind a legacy of transforming Rowan into a pure played offshore driller with a tremendously successful entry into the ultra-deepwater markets, all while focusing on safe and reliable operations.
On behalf of our employees and the Board of Directors, we would like to send our heartfelt thanks to Matt and wish him the best in retirement. Now for a look at the markets where Rowan competes, I'll hand the call over to Mark."
300794,323472958,942446,"Rowan Companies plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2016",2016-02-26,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone.

The unstable commodity price environment further decreases in operator spending and the overall lack of confidence in near-term market recovery have combined for a rough start to 2016. Rigs continue to roll-off contract and add to the existing industry oversupply. And competition is fierce for the few contracting opportunities currently in discussion. 
Our global marketing team is aggressively and creatively approaching every opportunity as we focus on blend-and-extend discussions and contract backlog additions for our ultra-deepwater drillships, our available jack-ups and those rolling off contract in 2016.
So all 4 of our ultra-deepwater drillships are contracted into 2017 or beyond. We realize the benefits for both our customers and Rowan to consider amending the current contracts to potentially lower the day rates in the near term in exchange for additional term to bridge the current trough cycle.
As we mentioned on our last call, these are difficult negotiations that take time to refine and reach mutually acceptable terms. 
In our jack-up fleet, we are pleased to announce a recently signed contract with EOG in Trinidad for the Ralph Coffman. The rig will mobilize from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and is estimated to commence operations in the third quarter of this year for 5 wells, with an estimated duration of 1 year at a rate of 135,000 a day, inclusive of amortized lump sum fees. The Ralph Coffman will join the EXL II and the Joe Douglas currently operating in Trinidad. 
In our last fleet status, we announced the addition of the BP contract for the Joe Douglas, which will commence in direct continuation following the completion of required surveys and inspections after its current project with BHP. Rowan has a lot of history of operations in Trinidad, and it continues to be in each market for our high-spec jack-up fleet. 
Turning to the Middle East. We have 10 jack-ups operating, and the J.P. Bussell is currently warm-stacked in Bahrain. Demand in the Middle East is forecast to remain relatively steady through 2016, as this is one of the few areas of the world where meaningful tender prospects exist. 
Discussions are ongoing with Saudi Aramco regarding day rates for our jack-ups during 2016, so I won't comment further on that topic. 
Taking a look at the North Sea. 5 of our 6 jack-ups are contracted, and 2 of those units have backlog in 2017 and beyond. We're talking with our customers about the opportunity for continued operations, and there are several projects that we're considering for our units rolling off-contract both in and out of the region.
We believe our harsh environment, high-spec units will reman attractive to the marketplace, and we're hopeful to maintain above market utilization levels, but expect rates to be under pressure.
The U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia remain weak, and we continue to review opportunities to position our jack-ups in alternative regions where demand may be stronger.
I won't go into detail given the competitive nature of the current environment, but we are actively pursuing bright spots in the global market that we believe will yield long-term contracts.
During a downturn, our customers can have their pick of contractors and drilling units. They value the tradition of excellence that Rowan has established in its more than 90-year history. They value our commitment to safe and reliable operations and our young, high-spec fleet. They value our financial conservatism and the visibility and stability it provides through these turbulent times. 
2016 will be growing, but Rowan remains focused on our core values that will deliver a high level of performance to our customers, which translates into higher shareholder value. 
Thank you for your time this morning. I'll now turn the call over to Stephen."

On the call today, I will review our fourth quarter 2015 operating results compared to the prior quarter and provide you with an update to our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers. 
For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $124 million or $0.99 per share versus a net loss of $239 million or $1.92 per share in the third quarter.
The fourth quarter results included a gain on the sale of the Rowan Louisiana of $6 million and a $1 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt, while the third quarter results included a noncash asset impairment charge of $274 million, a $75 million income tax charge related to a valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets and a $1.7 million legal settlement charge.
Excluding the aforementioned items, our net income was $119 million or $0.95 per share in the fourth quarter versus $111 million or $0.89 per share in the third quarter on the same normalized basis.
The increase is primarily attributable to our cost-reduction efforts, which more than offset the reduction in the contribution from our jack-up fleet. 
During the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $528 million, excluding rebillable items, which is approximately 1% lower than third quarter revenue. Our jack-up fleet generated 165 fewer operating days, primarily due to the cold-stacking of the Rowan Gorilla II, Gorilla III and the Cecil Provine, while our 4 drillships contributed similar revenue during both the third and fourth quarters.
Our average jack-up day rate increased by 7% due to higher levels of idle time on certain rigs with lower rates. While the average rate on our drillships was relatively flat, it's all around long-term contracts.
Our operational performance is very strong during the fourth quarter. Our out-of-service time was less than 3% of available rig days, which was in line with our expectations. Our downtime, which is unbillable time when a rig is operating, represented less than 1% of in-service days for jack-ups and less than 2% in total during the quarter.
Our idle time, which reflects periods when a rig is not contracted but is available to work, increased slightly to 14% of available days from 13% in the prior quarter. However, we have continued our swift response to the weaker market conditions and have reduced the operating costs of our 5 idle jack-ups to mitigate this impact.
All in all, we achieved a marketed utilization rate for our fleet of 80% in the fourth quarter, slightly lower than the 82% achieved in the prior quarter. 
Moving on to expenses. Our fourth quarter operating expenses were $228 million, excluding rebuilds, a reduction of 3% from $236 million in the third quarter, which was driven largely by cost reductions on our idle rigs and, to a lesser extent, continued cost-control efforts throughout the rest of the fleet and our shorebase locations.
Our full year 2015 operating expenses were $950 million, which is nearly $200 million lower than our original guidance provided in November of 2014, and $160 million lower than our guidance provided in February of 2015. This meaningful reduction demonstrates our ability to quickly and appropriately respond to the cyclical environment. The decrease is due largely to reduce personnel-related expenses, repair and maintenance, rig insurance and favorable foreign exchange rates in certain areas.
Again, this excludes rebillable items, which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenue.
Our fourth quarter SG&A expense totaled $27 million, which was slightly lower than our guidance and the third quarter level due to the impact of cost-control measures. Our fourth quarter depreciation expense totaled $102 million, which was in line with our guidance and slightly lower than the third quarter level due to the third quarter impairment charge.
Interest expense, which was $40 million during the fourth quarter, was slightly lower than previous guidance and prior quarter level, as we retired approximately $100 million of debt during the quarter. As we announced last month, we retired outstanding senior notes, which would have come due over the next 4 years, eliminating over $21 million of interest expense over the same period.
Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was approximately 10%, which was in line with our previous guidance.
Moving on to our cash flow and balance sheet. Property and equipment additions totaled $44 million during the fourth quarter and nearly all of our related, the maintenance CapEx, upgrades and spares. Our full year 2015 property additions totaled $706 million, including the delivery of the Rowan Relentless. 
Demonstrating our strong focus on capital discipline, this total is approximately $170 million lower than our original guidance provided in November of 2014 and $150 million lower than our guidance provided in February of 2015.
Our free cash flow generation was strong during the quarter, resulting in our cash balance increasing by nearly $200 million despite our early retirement of approximately $100 million of senior notes. At quarter end, we had nearly $485 million in cash, and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility remains undrawn.
Further, as Tom mentioned, we were pleased to recently amend our credit agreement to extend the maturity date to January 2021. Availability under the facility is $1.5 billion through January 2019, declining to $1.44 billion through January 2020 and approximately $1.29 billion through maturity.
We are grateful for the relationships we have with our lenders, and I want to reiterate our gratitude for their strong support of our recent extension. We believe our current cash balance, $3.6 billion revenue backlog and our 5-year revolving credit facility will provide a comfortable level of liquidity and flexibility to both weather the cyclical downturn and invest countercyclically at the appropriate time.
Moving on to 2016. I will now provide an update to the preliminary guidance discussed in our previous quarterly call. As reflected in our latest fleet status report, we have all 4 of our ultra-deepwater drill ships contracted into 2017 or early 2018. We also have 12 jack-ups already contracted beyond 2016, with 8 of those into 2018 or beyond.
Although this backlog provides us with strong visibility, we are also mindful that we have 12 marketed jack-ups which have availability in 2016. We expect to continue experiencing elevated levels of idle time between contracts until the industry works through its excess capacity. 
Our 2016 operating expenses, excluding rebillable items, are expected to range from $865 million to $885 million, which is 7% or $65 million below our previous guidance and a 7% to 9% reduction from the 2015 level despite an increase of approximately $35 million due to the full year impact of 2 drillships that commenced operations last year.
Excluding that impact, operating expenses are expected to decline by approximately $100 million to $120 million or 11% to 13% year-over-year as a result of reduced costs associated with idle jack-ups, the full year impact of cost-control measures instituted during 2015 and the impact of incremental initiatives already identified for 2016.
First quarter 2016 operating expenses are expected to approximate $220 million. Our 2016 SG&A expenses are expected to decline by approximately 5% to 10% and range from $105 million to $110 million, with approximately $28 million in the first quarter. Our 2016 depreciation expense is expected to increase to $400 million to $410 million, as we incur a full year impact of depreciation from the last 2 drillships, which will more than offset the reduction from the third quarter 2015 impairment charge. First quarter 2016 depreciation expense is expected to be approximately $100 million. We expect 2016 interest expense to approximate $157 million, which reflects an increase over the 2015 level, we did not expect to capitalize any interest in 2016, and also reflects the early retirement of debt during the fourth quarter of 2015. First quarter 2016 interest expense is expected to approximate $39 million. 
Our 2016 effective tax rate is expected to range from 10% to 15%, but this rate could fluctuate if our jurisdictional mix of earnings changes throughout the year. We expect our 2016 maintenance capital expenditures to range from $180 million to $190 million, excluding any contractual modifications that may arrive due to our securing additional work. 
As we review 2015, we are very pleased with our record safety results and financial performance in an extremely challenging environment. However, we are managing the business with the expectation that these market conditions, which began nearly 18 months ago, will continue for the next few years as our customers reposition for a lower oil price environment. We have strategically positioned Rowan to weather this difficult business climate through our solid liquidity, attractive debt maturity profile, low level of capital commitments, substantial backlog and high-specification and modern fleet.
As we continue to navigate through this down cycle, we will remain focused on revenue efficiency and reducing our cost structure to further enhance our competitive position.

And I think that's part of your question. So we're sort of thinking through that ourselves. When we actually look back at our downtime and, I guess, specifically, subsea downtime, the reason actually in our limited deepwater operating history much where this model would have helped us financially because some of the other -- some of the issues we've had on something, which should be limited.

So with respect to our cost differences between cold and stacked, I think that was the first part of your question, our costs on our cold-stacked rigs are very low. And really, right now, we have the cold-stacked rigs are the Gorilla II, the Gorilla III and the Cecil Provine. The cost stacks on -- the cost on those today is very low. And it's really just insurance and occasions any -- some of the rigs turnover engines, et cetera. Or do you need to change -- check some of the equipment on it. The other rigs that cold -- the sort of the cost on them varies between having a fairly large crew, because we think we're about to go to work, which we had on the Ralph Coffman, because we thought we were going to get a contract, and that's the reason we moved it from Molter, if you remember, to the Gulf of Mexico because we worked out, when we did the economics, we knew we needed to leg it up for the work in Trinidad. So we actually kept more crew on that, even though it was warm-stacked. And we look -- when we ran all the economics between flying people to Mediterranean and legging it up in Molter versus doing it in Pascagoula, we kind of basically came out ahead by making that move handicap to the fact that we thought we were going to get the job in Trinidad. So that would be a rig where we had a good feeling that we get a contract. So we kept more of the crew on the rig and didn't scale back so much. But with respect to the Stavanger, I mean it's a good question. I mean, it's a very capable rig. It's one of the most capable rigs in our fleet. We are disappointing. We haven't managed to find be for it. What rates would we take versus when would we keep it stacked? We absolutely wouldn't tell you that because that would be -- that's kind of like the key information, right? But it is something that we wanted to do that rig go back to work and it's -- but that's sort of a decision on which contracts we would take and not is we just sweep comment on that."

And again, it's a bit of a wait-and-see with some of the other rigs that are available. And the pricing is all over the place.

And that's just sort of a -- we're like oh that's interesting, we wouldn't buy it for $210 million, because we could all want for less than that. I do think it's a little bit of a hard -- it's a good comparison that you make between the shipyards and the rigs that are already working. I mean if a rig is already working, it has some operating history and so therefore, we can understand its quality more than if it's the shipyard that's being built by a -- in a highly speculative nature. And so there's just a lot of -- I mean there's a lot of intricacies and detail in what we do versus what you do right. But I would say that generally, the Chinese shipyards we're a lot less familiar with. And so therefore, we're a little bit more wary of them, because we never bought anything from a Chinese shipyard, although a lot of us have spend time in them. But we're really a bit more wary of them, but we do think the Singaporean shipyards and the Middle East shipyards have very good quality on the jack-ups side. So we're less worried about them. And the rigs are in operation. You can go back and look at it's operating history. So I think it's a little bit of a mixed bag there, but it's something that we think about all the time. And it's varies the pricing, varies massively by between shipyards of who's willing to do what. In fact it's a complex -- there isn't sort answer of that, but we're looking at it really hard."

We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investment in Rowan. 
Following my prepared comments, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market, and then Stephen will walk you through our financial performance and future guidance. After that, we'll open up the call for your questions. 
As you see from our press release, we had a strong fourth quarter despite challenging market conditions. Our earnings, normalized for certain items, which Stephen will address shortly, were $0.95 per share, up from $0.89 per share in the third quarter on a normalized basis. Our solid performance was attributed to all 4 of our newbuild ultra-deepwater drillships being on rate and our continued focus on offshore and onshore cost control, underpinned by excellent operational execution throughout our fleet.
Our earnings and cost focus resulted in robust free cash flow in the quarter, ending the year with over $480 million of cash even after retiring nearly $100 million of our debt. We sold the Rowan Louisiana, our last slot-type rig as we continue to make steady progress toward high grading our fleet. Although we are fortunate to have some of our older rigs working under profitable contracts, we do have 3 other older assets that are now cold-stacked and unlikely to return to service as they may not fit our future fleet profile.
As for the full year, it was certainly a challenging one but also full of accomplishments, large and small. At the onset of 2015, we were focused on successfully delivering our last 2 drillships. I'm pleased that we have been successful in leveraging our long-standing reputation for operational excellence with jack-ups into a position at the upper end of the ultra-deepwater market. We've received positive feedback from our customers on both the quality of our assets and our level of performance. This significant strategic step will serve Rowan for years to come. Given that we already have a relatively young and high-specification fleet, I believe continued strong operational efficiency will be the key to maximizing profitability when the industry begins its eventual recovery.
We also focused on further strengthening our balance sheet in 2015. We prioritized reducing our costs and preserving liquidity and were successful on both fronts. Our 2015 operating costs were relatively flat with the 2014 level even while adding over 2.5 years of additional ultra-deepwater days, which added $145 million of costs during the year. I consider this an impressive performance. 
Our current cash balance and availability under our undrawn revolver provide access to nearly $2 billion of liquidity. I'm proud of our finance team's efforts in 2015, as they were able to upsize our revolving credit facility to $1.5 billion and extend the maturity to 2021. 
I feel confident in our liquidity position, given our robust expected free cash flow from our high-quality backlog, continued focus on cost and capital spend and savings follow the elimination of our dividend. We feel quite prepared to handle an extended downturn, and should attractive opportunities become available, invest counter cyclically for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. 
I'd also like to thank our crews for their continued focus on safety. I'm extremely proud to report that we had the best safety performance on record in the company's history with a 30% improvement in total reportable incident rates over the prior year. This is especially impressive, considering we commenced operations on 2 new drillships during this period. This achievement served to reinforce what I've stated repeatedly in the last few quarters. We believe our cost-cutting efforts are measured and thoughtful, reducing costs where possible while maintaining our focus on safety, reliability and protecting the environment.
Lastly, although we are disappointed in our absolute shareholder return, given the challenging market for our industry, we are pleased that we led our peer group in relative total shareholder return for both the 1- and the 3-year periods ending December 31, 2015. This is obviously a feat that we will be striving to repeat many times in the coming years.
With respect to market conditions, I wish I had more positive news, but the current environment is relatively poor. Most of our customers are focused on preserving liquidity and cutting short-term spending. We are seeing a few bright spots, which Mark will discuss shortly. There seems to be more jack-up opportunity than deepwater at the moment, but we do not see recoveries in either market in the near term.
Finally before I turn the call over to Mark, as many of you are already aware, Matt Ralls will retire as Executive Chairman of the Board at this year's Annual Shareholders Meeting in April. Matt leaves behind a legacy of transforming Rowan into a pure play offshore driller with a tremendously successful entry into the ultra-deepwater market, all while focusing on safe and reliable operations.
On behalf of our employees and the Board of Directors, we would like to send our heartfelt thanks to Matt and wish him the best in retirement. Now for a look at the markets where Rowan competes, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

The unstable commodity price environment, further decreases in operator spending, and the overall lack of confidence in near-term market recovery have combined for a rough start to 2016. Rigs continue to roll-off contract and add to the existing industry oversupply. And competition is fierce for the few contracting opportunities currently in discussion. 
Our global marketing team is aggressively and creatively approaching every opportunity as we focus on blend-and-extend discussions and contract backlog additions for our ultra-deepwater drillships, our available jack-ups and those rolling off contract in 2016.
Though all 4 of our ultra-deepwater drillships are contracted into 2017 or beyond, we realize the benefits for both our customers and Rowan to consider amending the current contracts to potentially lower the day rates in the near term in exchange for additional term to bridge the current trough cycle.
As we mentioned on our last call, these are difficult negotiations that take time to refine and reach mutually acceptable terms. 
In our jack-up fleet, we are pleased to announce a recently signed contract with EOG in Trinidad for the Ralph Coffman. The rig will mobilize from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and is estimated to commence operations in the third quarter of this year for 5 wells, with an estimated duration of 1 year at a rate of $135,000 a day, inclusive of amortized lump sum fees. The Ralph Coffman will join the EXL II and the Joe Douglas currently operating in Trinidad. 
In our last fleet status, we announced the addition of the BP contract for the Joe Douglas, which will commence in direct continuation following the completion of required surveys and inspections after its current project with BHP. Rowan has a long history of operations in Trinidad, and it continues to be a niche market for our high-spec jack-up fleet. 
Turning to the Middle East. We have 10 jack-ups operating, and the J.P. Bussell is currently warm-stacked in Bahrain. Demand in the Middle East is forecast to remain relatively steady through 2016, as this is one of the few areas of the world where meaningful tender prospects exist. 
Discussions are ongoing with Saudi Aramco regarding day rates for our jack-ups during 2016, so I won't comment further on that topic. 
Taking a look at the North Sea. Five of our 6 jack-ups are contracted, and 2 of those units have backlog into 2017 and beyond. We're talking with our customers about the opportunity for continued operations, and there are several projects that we're considering for our units rolling off contract both in and out of the region.
We believe our harsh-environment, high-spec units will remain attractive to the marketplace, and we're hopeful to maintain above-market utilization levels, but expect rates to be under pressure.
The U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia remain weak, and we continue to review opportunities to position our jack-ups in alternative regions where demand may be stronger.
I won't go into detail given the competitive nature of the current environment, but we are actively pursuing bright spots in the global market that we believe will yield long-term contracts.
During a downturn, our customers can have their pick of contractors and drilling units. They value the tradition of excellence that Rowan has established in its more than 90-year history. They value our commitment to safe and reliable operations and our young, high-spec fleet. They value our financial conservatism and the visibility and stability it provides through these turbulent times. 
2016 will be grueling, but Rowan remains focused on our core values that will deliver a high level of performance to our customers, which translates into higher shareholder value. 
Thank you for your time this morning. I'll now turn the call over to Stephen."
300794,323472958,943009,"Rowan Companies plc, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 26, 2016",2016-02-26,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. On the call today, I will review our fourth quarter 2015 operating results compared to the prior quarter and provide you with an update to our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for ques",1496,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. On the call today, I will review our fourth quarter 2015 operating results compared to the prior quarter and provide you with an update to our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers. 
For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $124 million or $0.99 per share versus a net loss of $239 million or $1.92 per share in the third quarter.
The fourth quarter results included a gain on the sale of the Rowan Louisiana of $6 million and a $1 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt, while the third quarter results included a noncash asset impairment charge of $274 million, a $75 million income tax charge related to a valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets and a $1.7 million legal settlement charge.
Excluding the aforementioned items, our net income was $119 million or $0.95 per share in the fourth quarter versus $111 million or $0.89 per share in the third quarter on the same normalized basis.
The increase is primarily attributable to our cost-reduction efforts, which more than offset the reduction in the contribution from our jack-up fleet. 
During the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $528 million, excluding rebillable items, which is approximately 1% lower than third quarter revenue. Our jack-up fleet generated 165 fewer operating days, primarily due to the cold-stacking of the Rowan Gorilla II, Gorilla III and the Cecil Provine, while our 4 drillships contributed similar revenue during both the third and fourth quarters.
Our average jack-up day rate increased by 7% due to higher levels of idle time on certain rigs with lower rates. While the average rate on our drillships was relatively flat, all are on long-term contracts.
Our operational performance was very strong during the fourth quarter. Our out-of-service time was less than 3% of available rig days, which was in line with our expectations. Our downtime, which is unbillable time when a rig is operating, represented less than 1% of in-service days for jack-ups and less than 2% in total during the quarter.
Our idle time, which reflects periods when a rig is not contracted but is available to work, increased slightly to 14% of available days from 13% in the prior quarter. However, we have continued our swift response to the weaker market conditions and have reduced the operating costs of our 5 idle jack-ups to mitigate this impact.
All in all, we achieved a marketed utilization rate for our fleet of 80% in the fourth quarter, slightly lower than the 82% achieved in the prior quarter. 
Moving on to expenses. Our fourth quarter operating expenses were $228 million, excluding rebuilds, a reduction of 3% from $236 million in the third quarter, which was driven largely by cost reductions on our idle rigs and, to a lesser extent, continued cost-control efforts throughout the rest of the fleet and our shore-based locations.
Our full year 2015 operating expenses were $950 million, which is nearly $200 million lower than our original guidance provided in November of 2014, and $160 million lower than our guidance provided in February of 2015. This meaningful reduction demonstrates our ability to quickly and appropriately respond to the cyclical environment. The decrease is due largely to reduced personnel-related expenses, repair and maintenance, rig insurance and favorable foreign exchange rates in certain areas.
Again, this excludes rebillable items, which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenue.
Our fourth quarter SG&A expense totaled $27 million, which was slightly lower than our guidance and the third quarter level due to the impact of cost-control measures. Our fourth quarter depreciation expense totaled $102 million, which was in line with our guidance and slightly lower than the third quarter level due to the third quarter impairment charge.
Interest expense, which was $40 million during the fourth quarter, was slightly lower than previous guidance and prior quarter level, as we retired approximately $100 million of debt during the quarter. As we announced last month, we retired outstanding senior notes which would have come due over the next 4 years, eliminating over $21 million of interest expense over the same period.
Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was approximately 10%, which was in line with our previous guidance.
Moving on to our cash flow and balance sheet. Property and equipment additions totaled $44 million during the fourth quarter and nearly all were related to maintenance CapEx, upgrades and spares. Our full year 2015 property additions totaled $706 million, including the delivery of the Rowan Relentless. 
Demonstrating our strong focus on capital discipline, this total is approximately $170 million lower than our original guidance provided in November of 2014 and $150 million lower than our guidance provided in February of 2015.
Our free cash flow generation was strong during the quarter, resulting in our cash balance increasing by nearly $200 million despite our early retirement of approximately $100 million of senior notes. At quarter end, we had nearly $485 million in cash, and our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility remains undrawn.
Further, as Tom mentioned, we were pleased to recently amend our credit agreement to extend the maturity date to January 2021. Availability under the facility is $1.5 billion through January 2019, declining to $1.44 billion through January 2020 and approximately $1.29 billion through maturity.
We are grateful for the relationships we have with our lenders, and I want to reiterate our gratitude for their strong support of our recent extension. We believe our current cash balance, $3.6 billion revenue backlog and our 5-year revolving credit facility will provide a comfortable level of liquidity and flexibility to both weather the cyclical downturn and invest counter cyclically at the appropriate time.
Moving on to 2016. I will now provide an update to the preliminary guidance discussed in our previous quarterly call. As reflected in our latest fleet status report, we have all 4 of our ultra-deepwater drillships contracted into 2017 or early 2018. We also have 12 jack-ups already contracted beyond 2016, with 8 of those into 2018 or beyond.
Although this backlog provides us with strong visibility, we are also mindful that we have 12 marketed jack-ups which have availability in 2016. We expect to continue experiencing elevated levels of idle time between contracts until the industry works through its excess capacity. 
Our 2016 operating expenses, excluding rebillable items, are expected to range from $865 million to $885 million, which is 7% or $65 million below our previous guidance and a 7% to 9% reduction from the 2015 level despite an increase of approximately $35 million due to the full year impact of 2 drillships that commenced operations last year.
Excluding that impact, operating expenses are expected to decline by approximately $100 million to $120 million or 11% to 13% year-over-year as a result of reduced costs associated with idle jack-ups, the full year impact of cost-control measures instituted during 2015 and the impact of incremental initiatives already identified for 2016.
First quarter 2016 operating expenses are expected to approximate $220 million. Our 2016 SG&A expenses are expected to decline by approximately 5% to 10% and range from $105 million to $110 million, with approximately $28 million in the first quarter. Our 2016 depreciation expense is expected to increase to $400 million to $410 million, as we incur a full year impact of depreciation from the last 2 drillships, which will more than offset the reduction from the third quarter 2015 impairment charge. First quarter 2016 depreciation expense is expected to be approximately $100 million. We expect 2016 interest expense to approximate $157 million, which reflects an increase over the 2015 level, we did not expect to capitalize any interest in 2016, and also reflects the early retirement of debt during the fourth quarter of 2015. First quarter 2016 interest expense is expected to approximate $39 million. 
Our 2016 effective tax rate is expected to range from 10% to 15%, but this rate could fluctuate if our jurisdictional mix of earnings changes throughout the year. We expect our 2016 maintenance capital expenditures to range from $180 million to $190 million, excluding any contractual modifications that may arise due to our securing additional work. 
As we review 2015, we are very pleased with our record safety results and financial performance in an extremely challenging environment. However, we are managing the business with the expectation that these market conditions, which began nearly 18 months ago, will continue for the next few years as our customers reposition for a lower oil price environment. We have strategically positioned Rowan to weather this difficult business climate through our solid liquidity, attractive debt maturity profile, low level of capital commitments, substantial backlog, and high-specification and modern fleet.
As we continue to navigate through this down cycle, we will remain focused on revenue efficiency and reducing our cost structure to further enhance our competitive position. 
With that, we are now prepared to open the call for questions. Operator?"

But we have been working real hard with the other OEMs to understand the economics, to understand what the impact could be and the pros and cons. Some of the other drillers have made comments that you have to decide what you want to in-source and what you want to outsource. And I think that's a fair comment, really. And I think that's partly your question. So we're sort of thinking through that ourselves. When we actually look back at our downtime and, I guess, specifically, subsea downtime, there isn't actually in our limited deepwater operating history much where this model would have helped us financially because some of the other -- some of the issues we've had on subsea, which have been limited. But so far we would have not been covered by such an arrangement. So I think it's somewhat limited, but [indiscernible] limited impact to date, but it may be more useful going forward. So in summary, we are reviewing it, but I wouldn't expect any kind of change in our operating methodology anytime soon."

We -- I think it varies a lot by operators, how focused they are on that. And clearly, they are more focused. And as companies get into distress, what we've heard or what we've seen is that, if they're going to restructure, customers tend to be a little bit more -- would tend to be more reticent about handing out drilling contracts to someone that is in restructuring, because they don't know exactly what is going to happen. And I think that's been fairly well carried out by the restructurings that we've seen. So yes, it is there. And customers, particularly who are focused on their own balance sheets are also focused on the balance sheets of their vendors, as we are focused on the balance sheet of our vendors, not wanting to obviously have a vendor disappear on us, and have that as a key part of our supply chain. So I think it has become more important. And we are seeing more questions around it. That doesn't mean necessarily, though that companies with weak balance sheets or weaker balance sheets, I should say, won't get contracts, it's just -- it wouldn't work like that. But I think it obviously is the concern with some customers, but it just varies a lot by their focus on their own balance sheets and others [ph].

And it's really just insurance and occasionally sending someone to the rig to turn over engines, et cetera. Or change -- check some of the equipment on it. The other rigs that cold -- the sort of the cost on them varies between having a fairly large crew, because we think we're about to go to work, which we had on the Ralph Coffman, because we thought we were going to get a contract, and that's the reason we moved it from Malta, if you remember, to the Gulf of Mexico because we worked out, when we did the economics, we knew we needed to leg it up for the work in Trinidad. So we actually kept more crew on that, even though it was warm-stacked. And when we ran all the economics between flying people to the Mediterranean and legging it up in Malta versus doing it in Pascagoula, we kind of basically came out ahead by making that move -- handicapped to the fact that we thought we were going to get the job in Trinidad. So that would be a rig where we had a good feeling that we'd get a contract. So we kept more of the crew on the rig and didn't scale back so much.

And that's just sort of a -- we're like, oh, that's interesting, we wouldn't buy it for $210 million, because we could all have one for less than that. I do think it's a little bit of a hard -- it's a good comparison that you make between the shipyards and the rigs that are already working. I mean if a rig is already working, it has some operating history and so therefore, we can understand its quality more than if it's the shipyard that's being built by a -- in a highly speculative nature. And so there's just a lot of -- I mean there's a lot of intricacies and detail in what we do versus what you do why. But I would say that generally, the Chinese shipyards we're a lot less familiar with. And so therefore, we're a little bit more wary of them, because we never bought anything from a Chinese shipyard, although a lot of us have spent time in them. But we're really a bit more wary of them, but we do think the Singaporean shipyards and the Middle East shipyards have very good quality on the jack-up side. So we're less worried about them. And the rigs that are in operation, you can go back and look at its operating history. So I think it's a little bit of a mixed bag there, but it's something that we think about all the time. And it varies -- the pricing varies massively by -- between shipyards of who's willing to do what.

And if you were perhaps one of the other drilling contractors with a lot more emphasis of floaters, you might think of it a bit differently. But we see a lot more activity on the jack-up side. But it might just be sort of a bias given what our fleet is and the conversations we are having with customers. So -- and obviously, it varies a lot by region. Regarding the breakeven oil price on jack-ups work, I mean I think it's a really good question. And I think a number of the analysts sort of -- you make yourselves [ph] really kind of dig into this between if it's an open-water site where we're drilling and we go put a platform in place after -- if we find something, or we're delineating a part of the field that can't reached by a current platform or we're working over a platform or we're putting a new well in a unused slot on a current platform, it's just massively different economics of when you would basically call out a rig to do work. I mean, it varies massively, and it varies from places all over the work. I don't have any real good additional insights to give you beyond that. Mark, do you have anything to add?"

We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investments in Rowan. 
Following my prepared comments, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market, and Stephen will discuss our financial performance and guidance. After that, we'll open up the call for your questions. 
We had an outstanding first quarter by challenging market conditions. Our earnings were $0.98 per share, up from normalized results of $0.95 per share last quarter and $0.27 per share above consensus.
This performance was mostly due to higher-than-expected revenues, lower drilling and SG&A expenses and a lower effective tax rate. 
Specifically, we had outstanding operational downtime of less than 1% across our fleet and solid safety and cost performance due to the record work by our operations and operations support team.
We made some hard decisions in the quarter, including significant reductions in-force in our shore-based operations. Since the beginning the downturn, we cut off support headcount by 30%. At the same time, we strengthened our management team with the addition of 2 new hires, a Chief Accounting Officer and a Vice President of Sales and Marketing, both strong and experienced executives.
I am pleased with our 3 new Americas jack-up contracts and our blend-and-extend option agreement on the Rowan Viking. Our Saudi operations also remains strong, and we continue to work with our customers to achieve mutually satisfactory blend-and-extend agreements on our drillships and jack-ups, which Mark will discuss in more detail.
I'd like to briefly mention that the well control was released in April. Our operations team is evaluating the details of this extensive document. But after initial review being several of the concerns of offshore contract drillers regarding well control equipment in the initially proposed rules were addressed.
Given the modern design of the Geo 7 RAM subsea stacks on our ultra-deepwater drillships, we believe we will be able to comply with the immediate requirements without significant additional capital. However, the wider implications of the rule are still under review.
As you are already aware, market conditions remain challenging. Our customers are focused on preserving liquidity and are cutting short-term spending. While there are more jack-up opportunities than deepwater, we do not see a recovery or by the market. 
While we we have warm-stacked our younger idle jack-ups to enable them to work on short notice, our older idle jack-ups have been cold-stacked. We remain focused on safe and reliable operations. We will not reduce necessary spending on training or maintenance. Throughout this downturn, we are improving our operational system to ensure we come out of this trough with better tools for our crews to work safely, reliably and efficiency to  deliver value to our customers.
For example, we're upgrading our maintenance procurement business, which I believe will be an industry-leading system. This one of the many initiatives we have underway to ensure we remain strong and continue to be a driller of choice for our customers.
Finally, as you might expect, capital allocation remains a focus of our board and management. We further improved our balance sheet during the quarter. Today we have over $600 million of cash, and our $1.5 billion revolver remains undrawn. We have and will continue to review our capital allocation options to best position us to weather this downturn and for the eventual recovery.
To that end, as Stephen will detail shortly, we have retired additional debt this year. 
Now for a look at the markets where Rowan competes, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

Today, I'll visit with you about the jack-up market and recent notable contract announcements for our fleet. Then I'll briefly discuss the ultra-deepwater market and updates on our 4 drillships.
Despite the continuation of a challenging 2016, Rowan has consistently been able to deliver contract commitments through this trough cycle. As announced on our last fleet status, we added a project [indiscernible] for the Ralph Coffman with Petronas before it mobilizes the Trinidad to work with EOG. These projects combine for approximately $55 million of backlog. 
Our niche presence in this region of the world is an important part of our global operations. 
We also announced the option with [indiscernible] to blend and extend the rate on the Rowan Viking for an additional 270 days of term. Our goal is to creatively approach opportunities with our customers to reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial, and we are glad to have this option in place with [indiscernible].
The Middle East, we are pleased with the flat rate adjustments on 4 of our jack-ups with Saudi Aramco through the end of the year. And we've recently signed a short-term extension on the Gilbert Rowe until June 30, 2016 at the current rate.
Our last notable jack-up fleet announcement was the mobilization of the XL 1 and XL IV from Southeast Asia into the Middle East. This decision was both opportunistic and strategic. Given that we were not on our set mobilization schedule and there was an available heavy lift vessel in Southeast Asia, we were able to realize a highly discounted rate to move both rigs. 
Additionally there's some cost savings to warm-stacking in the Middle East with the J.P. Bussell. As I've mentioned on previous calls, this Southeast Asia market remains weak, and we believe there are better marketing opportunities for our EXL rigs in the Middle East, one of the few regions of the world that has tender activity planned for 2016.
In general market, jack-up utilization has hovered around 74% since January 2016. While we don't expect an improvement for the remainder of the year, it appears the decline in demand has leveled. Nonjack-ups have been removed from the worldwide fleet so far in 2016, and an additional 68 units are rather cold-stacked or out-of-service. We believe very few of these rigs will return to the active fleet.
We are ever mindful of the current oversupply and entry of new build jack-ups. However, as proven by our track record, Rowan continues to relentlessly pursue opportunities and attain contract awards for our high-spec jack-up fleet.
Now turning to the ultra-deepwater market. All 4 of our drillships are on contract into 2017 or beyond. Currently, the Rowan Renaissance and the Rowan Relentless are on standby rate, which is 98% of the operating rate. 
As you know, Freeport-McMoRan recently announced that they are exiting the oil and gas business. We are in discussions with our senior management team to determine the next apps and appropriate measures regarding the contract in place, which concludes in June 2017.
Meetings are ongoing for blend-and-extend opportunities for some of our drillships contracts. These negotiations, multifaceted, and it is challenging to reach mutually acceptable terms for both parties. That being said, we are actively working towards an agreement as we realize the benefits of extending some contracts beyond our current term.
We remain confident in the marketability of our drillships. Less than 40 of the more than 220 ultra-deepwater vessels in the world have the dual-stacked 1,250-ton capability of our fleet. Competition for future projects will be grueling, but we believe that with our design, our exceptional operations team and the Rowan brand, we can bridge this trough cycle to better times in the industry.
This concludes my remarks this morning. I will now turn the call over to Steven."
300794,330038832,972239,"Rowan Companies plc, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.

On the call today, I will review our first quarter 2016 operating results compared to the prior quarter and provide you with an update to our costs and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers.
Despite the extremely challenging environment, our first quarter profitability was exceptional. While a general lack of spot work for our idle jack-up rigs led to a somewhat steep 7% decline in revenue versus the prior quarter, we generated similar levels of EBITDA and net income on a 12% or $32 million reduction in operating expenses and G&A.
In fact, our EBITDA margin of 53% is the highest in the company's recent history and a testament to the strong performance of our operations leadership and personnel to deliver on our backlog and their continued response to rightsize the cost structure to the environment.
Yet, while we are pleased with the financial results and our ability to improve our strong financial position, we are also mindful of the fact that as we continue to work through our backlog, most of which was secured in the higher oil price environment, the cost reductions will become more and more challenging, and our financial results will weaken.
Now allow me to walk you through the results. We generated net income of $123 million or $0.98 per share, essentially in line with our fourth quarter income of $124 million for $0.99 per share. Fourth quarter results included a gain on the sale of the Rowan Louisiana of $6 million and a $1 million loss on early retirement of debt, both net of tax.
Excluding these items, our net income slightly exceeded fourth quarter net income of $119 million or $0.95 per share. Again, this strong performance is primarily attributable to the high levels of uptime on our contracted units and our continued cost-reduction efforts, which were only partially offset by an increase in idle time on our jack-up fleet.
During the first quarter, we generated revenue of nearly $500 million, excluding rebillable items. The sequential decline of $33 million resulted from our jack-up fleet generating 261 fewer operating days, primarily due to increased idle time in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia and out-of-service time in the Middle East.
Our 4 drillships contributed slightly more revenue during the quarter, as their unbillable downtime was less than 1% of the in-service days, an exceptional result.
Our jack-up day -- our average jack-up day rate increased by 3% due to higher levels of operating time on certain rigs with lower rates and strong utilization on our higher-earning rigs. The average day rate on our drillships was relatively flat, as all remain on term contracts. 
Our out-of-service time was approximately 5% of our available rig days, in line with our expectations. Our idle time, which reflects periods when a rig is not contracted but is available to work, not surprisingly increased to 19% of available days from 14% in the prior quarter, as operators continued to reduce capital spending. 
All in all, we achieved a marketed utilization rate for our fleet of 73% in the first quarter compared to the 80% achieved in the prior quarter.
Moving on to expenses. Our first quarter operating expenses totaled $200 million, excluding rebuilds, a reduction of 12% from $228 million in the fourth quarter, which was driven by cost reductions on our idle and cold-stacked rigs and continued strong cost control efforts throughout the rest of the fleet.
As a result of the substantial cost reductions in the quarter, we are once again reducing our cost guidance for the full year by another 5% or $45 million. We now believe our 2016 operating expenses will range from $825 million to $835 million. This reduction is largely the result of widespread cost control measures, including reduction of various support costs; increased efficiency in certain activities; and centralization of a number of functions, which are not customer-facing.
These items account for approximately 75% of the reduction, while the remainder stems from items related to decreased activity.
Second quarter 2016 operating expenses are expected to approximate $205 million, slightly higher than the first quarter level, primarily due to the timing of repair and maintenance activities. Again, this excludes rebillable items, which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenue.
Our first quarter SG&A expense totaled $27 million, which was slightly lower than our guidance and in line with the fourth quarter level, despite $1 million of incremental severance expense.
We continue to estimate that our full year SG&A expense will range from $105 million to $110 million, in line with our previous guidance, and 5% to 10% below the 2015 levels. We expect second quarter SG&A expense to approximate $28 million.
Our first quarter depreciation expense totaled $99 million, in line with our guidance and slightly lower than the prior quarter. Our full year depreciation expense guidance remains within the $400 million to $410 million range, with approximately $101 million in the second quarter.
Interest expense, which was $39 million during the first quarter, was also in line with our guidance and slightly lower than the prior quarter, as we realized the full quarter benefit of our fourth quarter debt reduction totaling nearly $100 million and achieved higher levels of interest income. We now expect to incur interest expense of approximately $154 million during 2016, slightly below our previous guidance, due to the additional retirement of nearly $50 million in debt thus far in 2016. Second quarter interest expense is expected to approximate $38 million. 
Our first quarter effective tax rate was only 3%, which was lower than our previous guidance, due to changes in our jurisdictional mix of earnings. We estimate that our second quarter and full year effective tax rate will be in the upper single digits. This rate could fluctuate if our jurisdictional mix of earnings differs from that currently projected. 
Moving on to our cash flow and balance sheet. Much like on the cost front, discipline with respect to capital spending was also strong in the first quarter, as we only incurred CapEx of $33 million. While we are reducing our full year CapEx guidance by $10 million to a new range of $170 million to $180 million, the reduction is somewhat muted, as some of the spending within the plan for the first quarter has been deferred but not eliminated. 
We generated $110 million of cash during the quarter despite the debt retirement and a build in working capital. And at quarter's end, we had nearly $600 million in cash. Our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, which doesn't mature until January of 2021, remains undrawn.
As I mentioned during my opening, we couldn't more pleased that we have been able to stave off a decline in financial performance quarter-after-quarter since the downturn commenced nearly 1.5 years ago. The additional cash that we have generated continues to extend our runway as far as just about anyone in the industry. Yet, given the poor macro backdrop, declines in our average day rate over the next 2 years are highly visible. And as cost-reduction measures get tougher and tougher, our cash generation will undoubtedly flow. 
Nonetheless, we will remain highly focused on the things that are under our control, delivering our $3.1 billion backlog through safe and efficient operations, achieving the highest levels of customer satisfaction and maintaining a competitive cost structure.

So -- and also we got a lot of more deeper oversight. We have home management team in the Middle East when Southeast Asia, our operation is pretty thin right now, so we have no working rigs. So having them in those rigs, which is in Bari, which is basically very close to our operations in Saudi, literally driving systems in the short drive, we can have a lot of oversight in those rigs and also use the crews in our Saudi operation and mix things up and keep the crews rotating between working rigs, where possible, and off working rigs, which is very pretty important because it can be a little tedious if you're just doing the same thing everyday on a stacked rig. And as far as testing the rigs come absolutely. Having the next to each other, we can cut down a number of employees on those rigs. But we are keeping those rigs warm. As far as the opportunity in the Middle East, yes, there's more opportunity in the Middle East. And there's opportunities in Southeast Asia there's a lot of competition. But the EXL, particularly with the 1 16 [ph] footprint, is a desirable rig in the Middle East. So I think one of the other reasons we moved there, besides the cost savings and imagine oversight, is that there are some opportunities in the Middle East."

We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investments in Rowan. 
Following my prepared comments, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market, and Stephen will discuss our financial performance and guidance. After that, we'll open up the call for your questions. 
We had an outstanding first quarter by challenging market conditions. Our earnings were $0.98 per share, up from normalized results of $0.95 per share last quarter and $0.27 per share above consensus.
This performance was mostly due to higher-than-expected revenues, lower drilling and SG&A expenses and a lower effective tax rate. 
Specifically, we had outstanding operational downtime of less than 1% across our fleet and solid safety and cost performance due to the record work by our operations and operations support team.
We made some hard decisions in the quarter, including significant reductions in-force in our shore-based operations. Since the beginning the downturn, we cut off support headcount by 30%. At the same time, we strengthened our management team with the addition of 2 new hires, a Chief Accounting Officer and a Vice President of Sales and Marketing, both strong and experienced executives.
I am pleased with our 3 new Americas jack-up contracts and our blend-and-extend option agreement on the Rowan Viking. Our Saudi operations also remains strong, and we continue to work with our customers to achieve mutually satisfactory blend-and-extend agreements on our drillships and jack-ups, which Mark will discuss in more detail.
I'd like to briefly mention that the well control was released in April. Our operations team is evaluating the details of this extensive document. But after initial review being several of the concerns of offshore contract drillers regarding well control equipment in the initially proposed rules were addressed.
Given the modern design of the Geo 7 RAM subsea stacks on our ultra-deepwater drillships, we believe we will be able to comply with the immediate requirements without significant additional capital. However, the wider implications of the rule are still under review.
As you are already aware, market conditions remain challenging. Our customers are focused on preserving liquidity and are cutting short-term spending. While there are more jack-up opportunities than deepwater, we do not see a recovery or by the market. 
While we we have warm-stacked our younger idle jack-ups to enable them to work on short notice, our older idle jack-ups have been cold-stacked. We remain focused on safe and reliable operations. We will not reduce necessary spending on training or maintenance. Throughout this downturn, we are improving our operational system to ensure we come out of this trough with better tools for our crews to work safely, reliably and efficiency to  deliver value to our customers.
For example, we're upgrading our maintenance procurement business, which I believe will be an industry-leading system. This one of the many initiatives we have underway to ensure we remain strong and continue to be a driller of choice for our customers.
Finally, as you might expect, capital allocation remains a focus of our board and management. We further improved our balance sheet during the quarter. Today we have over $600 million of cash, and our $1.5 billion revolver remains undrawn. We have and will continue to review our capital allocation options to best position us to weather this downturn and for the eventual recovery.
To that end, as Stephen will detail shortly, we have retired additional debt this year. 
Now for a look at the markets where Rowan competes, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

Today, I'll visit with you about the jack-up market and recent notable contract announcements for our fleet. Then I'll briefly discuss the ultra-deepwater market and updates on our 4 drillships.
Despite the continuation of a challenging 2016, Rowan has consistently been able to deliver contract commitments through this trough cycle. As announced on our last fleet status, we added a project [indiscernible] for the Ralph Coffman with Petronas before it mobilizes the Trinidad to work with EOG. These projects combine for approximately $55 million of backlog. 
Our niche presence in this region of the world is an important part of our global operations. 
We also announced the option with [indiscernible] to blend and extend the rate on the Rowan Viking for an additional 270 days of term. Our goal is to creatively approach opportunities with our customers to reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial, and we are glad to have this option in place with [indiscernible].
The Middle East, we are pleased with the flat rate adjustments on 4 of our jack-ups with Saudi Aramco through the end of the year. And we've recently signed a short-term extension on the Gilbert Rowe until June 30, 2016 at the current rate.
Our last notable jack-up fleet announcement was the mobilization of the XL 1 and XL IV from Southeast Asia into the Middle East. This decision was both opportunistic and strategic. Given that we were not on our set mobilization schedule and there was an available heavy lift vessel in Southeast Asia, we were able to realize a highly discounted rate to move both rigs. 
Additionally there's some cost savings to warm-stacking in the Middle East with the J.P. Bussell. As I've mentioned on previous calls, this Southeast Asia market remains weak, and we believe there are better marketing opportunities for our EXL rigs in the Middle East, one of the few regions of the world that has tender activity planned for 2016.
In general market, jack-up utilization has hovered around 74% since January 2016. While we don't expect an improvement for the remainder of the year, it appears the decline in demand has leveled. Nonjack-ups have been removed from the worldwide fleet so far in 2016, and an additional 68 units are rather cold-stacked or out-of-service. We believe very few of these rigs will return to the active fleet.
We are ever mindful of the current oversupply and entry of new build jack-ups. However, as proven by our track record, Rowan continues to relentlessly pursue opportunities and attain contract awards for our high-spec jack-up fleet.
Now turning to the ultra-deepwater market. All 4 of our drillships are on contract into 2017 or beyond. Currently, the Rowan Renaissance and the Rowan Relentless are on standby rate, which is 98% of the operating rate. 
As you know, Freeport-McMoRan recently announced that they are exiting the oil and gas business. We are in discussions with our senior management team to determine the next apps and appropriate measures regarding the contract in place, which concludes in June 2017.
Meetings are ongoing for blend-and-extend opportunities for some of our drillships contracts. These negotiations, multifaceted, and it is challenging to reach mutually acceptable terms for both parties. That being said, we are actively working towards an agreement as we realize the benefits of extending some contracts beyond our current term.
We remain confident in the marketability of our drillships. Less than 40 of the more than 220 ultra-deepwater vessels in the world have the dual-stacked 1,250-ton capability of our fleet. Competition for future projects will be grueling, but we believe that with our design, our exceptional operations team and the Rowan brand, we can bridge this trough cycle to better times in the industry.
This concludes my remarks this morning. I will now turn the call over to Steven."
300794,330038832,972242,"Rowan Companies plc, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.

On the call today, I will review our first quarter 2016 operating results compared to the prior quarter and provide you with an update to our costs and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers.
Despite the extremely challenging environment, our first quarter profitability was exceptional. While a general lack of spot work for our idle jack-up rigs led to a somewhat steep 7% decline in revenue versus the prior quarter, we generated similar levels of EBITDA and net income on a 12% or $32 million reduction in operating expenses and G&A.
In fact, our EBITDA margin of 53% is the highest in the company's recent history and a testament to the strong performance of our operations leadership and personnel to deliver on our backlog and their continued response to rightsize the cost structure to the environment.
Yet, while we are pleased with the financial results and our ability to improve our strong financial position, we are also mindful of the fact that as we continue to work through our backlog, most of which was secured in the higher oil price environment, the cost reductions will become more and more challenging, and our financial results will weaken.
Now allow me to walk you through the results. We generated net income of $123 million or $0.98 per share, essentially in line with our fourth quarter income of $124 million for $0.99 per share. Fourth quarter results included a gain on the sale of the Rowan Louisiana of $6 million and a $1 million loss on early retirement of debt, both net of tax.
Excluding these items, our net income slightly exceeded fourth quarter net income of $119 million or $0.95 per share. Again, this strong performance is primarily attributable to the high levels of uptime on our contracted units and our continued cost-reduction efforts, which were only partially offset by an increase in idle time on our jack-up fleet.
During the first quarter, we generated revenue of nearly $500 million, excluding rebillable items. The sequential decline of $33 million resulted from our jack-up fleet generating 261 fewer operating days, primarily due to increased idle time in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia and out-of-service time in the Middle East.
Our 4 drillships contributed slightly more revenue during the quarter, as their unbillable downtime was less than 1% of the in-service days, an exceptional result.
Our jack-up day -- our average jack-up day rate increased by 3% due to higher levels of operating time on certain rigs with lower rates and strong utilization on our higher-earning rigs. The average day rate on our drillships was relatively flat, as all remain on term contracts. 
Our out-of-service time was approximately 5% of our available rig days, in line with our expectations. Our idle time, which reflects periods when a rig is not contracted but is available to work, not surprisingly increased to 19% of available days from 14% in the prior quarter, as operators continued to reduce capital spending. 
All in all, we achieved a marketed utilization rate for our fleet of 73% in the first quarter compared to the 80% achieved in the prior quarter.
Moving on to expenses. Our first quarter operating expenses totaled $200 million, excluding rebuilds, a reduction of 12% from $228 million in the fourth quarter, which was driven by cost reductions on our idle and cold-stacked rigs and continued strong cost control efforts throughout the rest of the fleet.
As a result of the substantial cost reductions in the quarter, we are once again reducing our cost guidance for the full year by another 5% or $45 million. We now believe our 2016 operating expenses will range from $825 million to $835 million. This reduction is largely the result of widespread cost control measures, including reduction of various support costs; increased efficiency in certain activities; and centralization of a number of functions, which are not customer-facing.
These items account for approximately 75% of the reduction, while the remainder stems from items related to decreased activity.
Second quarter 2016 operating expenses are expected to approximate $205 million, slightly higher than the first quarter level, primarily due to the timing of repair and maintenance activities. Again, this excludes rebillable items, which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenue.
Our first quarter SG&A expense totaled $27 million, which was slightly lower than our guidance and in line with the fourth quarter level, despite $1 million of incremental severance expense.
We continue to estimate that our full year SG&A expense will range from $105 million to $110 million, in line with our previous guidance, and 5% to 10% below the 2015 levels. We expect second quarter SG&A expense to approximate $28 million.
Our first quarter depreciation expense totaled $99 million, in line with our guidance and slightly lower than the prior quarter. Our full year depreciation expense guidance remains within the $400 million to $410 million range, with approximately $101 million in the second quarter.
Interest expense, which was $39 million during the first quarter, was also in line with our guidance and slightly lower than the prior quarter, as we realized the full quarter benefit of our fourth quarter debt reduction totaling nearly $100 million and achieved higher levels of interest income. We now expect to incur interest expense of approximately $154 million during 2016, slightly below our previous guidance, due to the additional retirement of nearly $50 million in debt thus far in 2016. Second quarter interest expense is expected to approximate $38 million. 
Our first quarter effective tax rate was only 3%, which was lower than our previous guidance, due to changes in our jurisdictional mix of earnings. We estimate that our second quarter and full year effective tax rate will be in the upper single digits. This rate could fluctuate if our jurisdictional mix of earnings differs from that currently projected. 
Moving on to our cash flow and balance sheet. Much like on the cost front, discipline with respect to capital spending was also strong in the first quarter, as we only incurred CapEx of $33 million. While we are reducing our full year CapEx guidance by $10 million to a new range of $170 million to $180 million, the reduction is somewhat muted, as some of the spending within the plan for the first quarter has been deferred but not eliminated. 
We generated $110 million of cash during the quarter despite the debt retirement and a build in working capital. And at quarter's end, we had nearly $600 million in cash. Our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, which doesn't mature until January of 2021, remains undrawn.
As I mentioned during my opening, we couldn't more pleased that we have been able to stave off a decline in financial performance quarter-after-quarter since the downturn commenced nearly 1.5 years ago. The additional cash that we have generated continues to extend our runway as far as just about anyone in the industry. Yet, given the poor macro backdrop, declines in our average day rate over the next 2 years are highly visible. And as cost-reduction measures get tougher and tougher, our cash generation will undoubtedly flow. 
Nonetheless, we will remain highly focused on the things that are under our control, delivering our $3.1 billion backlog through safe and efficient operations, achieving the highest levels of customer satisfaction and maintaining a competitive cost structure.

We've moved each of those rigs for about $1.5 million [ph] each. They went on the same heavy lift. We do have a pretty large operation in Saudi and in the Middle East. We have 10 rigs running. And so 10 rigs running is about 40 crews of employees. And so it is useful to have those assets locally so that the crews that are on those rigs can also supplement the workforce there that when we have an issue, somebody can't make a hitch, et cetera. So -- and also we got a lot of more deeper oversight. We have home management team in the Middle East when Southeast Asia, our operation is pretty thin right now, so we have no working rigs. So having them in those rigs, which is in Bari, which is basically very close to our operations in Saudi, literally driving systems in the short drive, we can have a lot of oversight in those rigs and also use the crews in our Saudi operation and mix things up and keep the crews rotating between working rigs, where possible, and off working rigs, which is very pretty important because it can be a little tedious if you're just doing the same thing everyday on a stacked rig. And as far as testing the rigs come absolutely. Having the next to each other, we can cut down a number of employees on those rigs. But we are keeping those rigs warm. As far as the opportunity in the Middle East, yes, there's more opportunity in the Middle East. And there's opportunities in Southeast Asia there's a lot of competition. But the EXL, particularly with the 1 16 [ph] footprint, is a desirable rig in the Middle East. So I think one of the other reasons we moved there, besides the cost savings and imagine oversight, is that there are some opportunities in the Middle East."

We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investments in Rowan. 
Following my prepared comments, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market, and Stephen will discuss our financial performance and guidance. After that, we'll open up the call for your questions. 
We had an outstanding first quarter despite challenging market conditions. Our earnings were $0.98 per share, up from normalized results of $0.95 per share last quarter and $0.27 per share above consensus.
This performance was mostly due to higher-than-expected revenues, lower drilling and SG&A expenses and a lower effective tax rate. 
Specifically, we had outstanding operational downtime of less than 1% across our fleet and solid safety and cost performance due to terrific work by our operations and operations support team.
We made some hard decisions in the quarter, including significant reductions in force in our shore-based operations. Since the beginning of the downturn, we've cut off support headcount by 30%. At the same time, we strengthened our management team with the addition of 2 new hires, a Chief Accounting Officer and a Vice President of Sales and Marketing, both strong and experienced executives.
I am pleased with our 3 new Americas jack-up contracts and our blend-and-extend option agreement on the Rowan Viking. Our Saudi operations also remains strong, and we continue to work with our customers to achieve mutually satisfactory blend-and-extend agreements on our drillships and jack-ups, which Mark will discuss in more detail.
I'd like to briefly mention BSEE well control rule was released in April. Our operations team is evaluating the details of this extensive document. But after initial review, seeing several of the concerns of offshore contract drillers regarding well control equipment in the initially proposed rule were addressed.
Given the modern design of the 2 seven-ram subsea stacks on our ultra-deepwater drillships, we believe we will be able to comply with the immediate requirements without significant additional capital. However, the wider implications of the rule are still under review.
As you are already aware, market conditions remain challenging. Our customers are focused on preserving liquidity and are cutting short-term spending. While there are more jack-up opportunities than deepwater, we do not see a recovery on either markets. 
While we have warm-stacked our younger idle jack-ups to enable them to work on short notice, our older idle jack-ups have been cold-stacked. We remain focused on safe and reliable operations. We will not reduce necessary spending on training or maintenance. Throughout this downturn, we are improving our operational system to ensure we come out of this trough with better tools for our crews to work safely, reliably and efficiently to deliver value to our customers.
For example, we're upgrading our maintenance procurement business, which I believe will be an industry-leading system. This is one of the many initiatives we have underway to ensure we remain strong and continue to be a driller of choice for our customers.
Finally, as you might expect, capital allocation remains a focus of our board and management. We further improved our balance sheet during the quarter. Today we have over $600 million of cash, and our $1.5 billion revolver remains undrawn. We have and will continue to review our capital allocation options to best position us to weather this downturn and for the eventual recovery.
To that end, as Stephen will detail shortly, we have retired additional debt this year. 
Now for a look at the markets where Rowan competes, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

Today, I'll visit with you about the jack-up market and recent notable contract announcements for our fleet. Then I'll briefly discuss the ultra-deepwater market and updates on our 4 drillships.
Despite the continuation of a challenging 2016, Rowan has consistently been able to deliver contract commitments through this trough cycle. As announced on our last fleet status, we added a project in Suriname for the Ralph Coffman with Petronas before it mobilizes the Trinidad for work with EOG. These projects combine for approximately $55 million of backlog. 
Our niche presence in this region of the world is an important part of our global operations. 
We also announced the option with Lundin to blend and extend the rate on the Rowan Viking for an additional 270 days of term. Our goal is to creatively approach opportunities with our customers to reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial, and we are glad to have this option in place with Lundin.
In the Middle East, we are pleased with the flat rate adjustments on 4 of our jack-ups with Saudi Aramco through the end of the year. And we've recently signed a short-term extension on the Gilbert Rowe until June 30, 2016 at the current rate.
Our last notable jack-up fleet announcement was the mobilization of the EXL I and EXL IV from Southeast Asia into the Middle East. This decision was both opportunistic and strategic. Given that we were not on a set mobilization schedule and there was an available heavy-lift vessel in Southeast Asia, we were able to realize a highly discounted rate to move both rigs. 
Additionally, there's some cost savings to warm-stacking in the Middle East with the J.P. Bussell. 
As I've mentioned on previous calls, this Southeast Asia market remains weak, and we believe there are better marketing opportunities for our EXL rigs in the Middle East, one of the few regions of the world that has tender activity planned for 2016.
In general, marketed jack-up utilization has hovered around 74% since January 2016. While we don't expect an improvement for the remainder of the year, it appears the decline in demand has leveled. Non-jack-ups have been removed from the worldwide fleet so far in 2016, and an additional 68 units are either cold-stacked or out of service. We believe very few of these rigs will return to the active fleet.
We are ever mindful of the current oversupply and looming entry of new build jack-ups. However, as proven by our track record, Rowan continues to relentlessly pursue opportunities and attain contract awards for our high-spec jack-up fleet.
Now turning to the ultra-deepwater market. All 4 of our drillships are on contract into 2017 or beyond. Currently, the Rowan Renaissance and the Rowan Relentless are on standby rate, which is 98% of the operating rate. 
As you know, Freeport-McMoRan recently announced that they are exiting the oil and gas business. We are in discussions with their senior management team to determine the next steps and appropriate measures regarding the contract in place, which concludes in June 2017.
Meetings are ongoing for blend-and-extend opportunities for some of our drillship contracts. These negotiations are multifaceted, and it is challenging to reach mutually acceptable terms for both parties. That being said, we are actively working towards an agreement as we realize the benefits of extending some contracts beyond their current term.
We remain confident in the marketability of our drillships. Less than 40 of the more than 220 ultra-deepwater vessels in the world have the dual-stacked 1,250-ton capability of our fleet. Competition for future projects will be grueling, but we believe that with our design, our exceptional operations team and the Rowan brand, we can bridge this trough cycle to better times in the industry.
This concludes my remarks this morning. I will now turn the call over to Stephen."
300794,330038832,972552,"Rowan Companies plc, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.

On the call today, I will review our first quarter 2016 operating results compared to the prior quarter and provide you with an update to our costs and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers.
Despite the extremely challenging environment, our first quarter profitability was exceptional. While a general lack of spot work for our idle jack-up rigs led to a somewhat steep 7% decline in revenue versus the prior quarter, we generated similar levels of EBITDA and net income on a 12% or $32 million reduction in operating expenses and G&A.
In fact, our EBITDA margin of 53% is the highest in the company's recent history and a testament to the strong performance of our operations leadership and personnel to deliver on our backlog and their continued response to rightsize the cost structure to the environment.
Yet, while we are pleased with the financial results and our ability to improve our strong financial position, we are also mindful of the fact that as we continue to work through our backlog, most of which was secured in the higher oil price environment, the cost reductions will become more and more challenging and our financial results will weaken.
Now allow me to walk you through the results. We generated net income of $123 million or $0.98 per share, essentially in line with our fourth quarter income of $124 million or $0.99 per share. Fourth quarter results included a gain on the sale of the Rowan Louisiana of $6 million and a $1 million loss on early retirement of debt, both net of tax.
Excluding these items, our net income slightly exceeded fourth quarter net income of $119 million or $0.95 per share. Again, this strong performance is primarily attributable to the high levels of uptime on our contracted units and our continued cost-reduction efforts, which were only partially offset by an increase in idle time on our jack-up fleet.
During the first quarter, we generated revenue of nearly $500 million, excluding rebillable items. The sequential decline of $33 million resulted from our jack-up fleet generating 261 fewer operating days, primarily due to increased idle time in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia and out-of-service time in the Middle East.
Our 4 drillships contributed slightly more revenue during the quarter, as their unbillable downtime was less than 1% of in-service days, an exceptional result.
Our jack-up day -- our average jack-up day rate increased by 3% due to higher levels of operating time on certain rigs with lower rates and strong utilization on our higher-earning rigs. The average day rate on our drillships was relatively flat, as all remained on term contracts. 
Our out-of-service time was approximately 5% of our available rig days, in line with our expectations. Our idle time, which reflects periods when a rig is not contracted but is available to work, not surprisingly increased to 19% of available days from 14% in the prior quarter, as operators continued to reduce capital spending. 
All in all, we achieved a marketed utilization rate for our fleet of 73% in the first quarter compared to the 80% achieved in the prior quarter.
Moving on to expenses. Our first quarter operating expenses totaled $200 million, excluding rebuilds, a reduction of 12% from $228 million in the fourth quarter, which was driven by cost reductions on our idle and cold-stacked rigs and continued strong cost control efforts throughout the rest of the fleet.
As a result of the substantial cost reductions in the quarter, we are once again reducing our cost guidance for the full year by another 5% or $45 million. We now believe our 2016 operating expenses will range from $825 million to $835 million. This reduction is largely the result of widespread cost control measures, including reduction of various support costs; increased efficiency in certain activities; and centralization of a number of functions, which are not customer-facing.
These items account for approximately 75% of the reduction, while the remainder stems from items related to decreased activity.
Second quarter 2016 operating expenses are expected to approximate $205 million, slightly higher than the first quarter level, primarily due to the timing of repair and maintenance activities. Again, this excludes rebillable items, which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenues.
Our first quarter SG&A expense totaled $27 million, which was slightly lower than our guidance and in line with the fourth quarter level, despite $1 million of incremental severance expense.
We continue to estimate that our full year SG&A expense will range from $105 million to $110 million, in line with our previous guidance, and 5% to 10% below the 2015 levels. We expect second quarter SG&A expense to approximate $28 million.
Our first quarter depreciation expense totaled $99 million, in line with our guidance and slightly lower than the prior quarter. Our full year depreciation expense guidance remains within the $400 million to $410 million range, with approximately $101 million in the second quarter.
Interest expense, which was $39 million during the first quarter, was also in line with our guidance and slightly lower than the prior quarter, as we realized the full quarter benefit of our fourth quarter debt reduction totaling nearly $100 million and achieved higher levels of interest income. We now expect to incur interest expense of approximately $154 million during 2016, slightly below our previous guidance, due to the additional retirement of nearly $50 million in debt thus far in 2016. Second quarter interest expense is expected to approximate $38 million. 
Our first quarter effective tax rate was only 3%, which was lower than our previous guidance, due to changes in our jurisdictional mix of earnings. We estimate that our second quarter and full year effective tax rate will be in the upper single digits. This rate could fluctuate if our jurisdictional mix of earnings differs from that currently projected. 
Moving on to our cash flow and balance sheet. Much like on the cost front, discipline with respect to capital spending was also strong in the first quarter, as we only incurred CapEx of $33 million. While we are reducing our full year CapEx guidance by $10 million to a new range of $170 million to $180 million, the reduction is somewhat muted, as some of the spending we didn't plan for the first quarter has been deferred but not eliminated. 
We generated $110 million of cash during the quarter despite the debt retirement and a build in working capital. And at quarter's end, we had nearly $600 million in cash. Our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, which doesn't mature until January of 2021, remains undrawn.
As I mentioned during my opening, we couldn't more pleased that we have been able to stave off a decline in financial performance quarter-after-quarter since the downturn commenced nearly 1.5 years ago. The additional cash that we have generated continues to extend our runway as far as just about anyone in the industry. Yet, given the poor macro backdrop, declines in our average day rate over the next 2 years are highly visible. And as cost-reduction measures get tougher and tougher, our cash generation will undoubtedly flow. 
Nonetheless, we will remain highly focused on the things that are under our control, delivering our $3.1 billion backlog through safe and efficient operations, achieving the highest levels of customer satisfaction and maintaining a competitive cost structure.

We've moved each of those rigs for about $1.5 million each. They went on the same heavy lift. We do have a pretty large operation in Saudi and in the Middle East. We have 10 rigs running. And so 10 rigs running is about 40 crews of employees. And so it is useful to have those assets locally so that the crews that are on those rigs can also supplement the workforce there when we have an issue, somebody can't make a hitch, et cetera. So -- and also, we got a lot of more deeper oversight. We have a whole management team in the Middle East, where in Southeast Asia, our operation is pretty thin right now as we have no working rigs. So having them in those rigs [indiscernible] which is in Bahrain, which is basically very close to our operations in Saudi, I mean, literally driving distance, and a short drive, we can have a lot of oversight in those rigs and also use the crews in our Saudi operation and mix things up and keep the crews rotating between working rigs where possible, and off working rigs, which is very important because it can be a little tedious if you're just doing the same thing everyday on a stacked rig. And as far as nesting the rigs come, absolutely. Having them next to each other, we can cut down a number of employees on those rigs. But we are keeping those rigs warm. As far as the opportunity in the Middle East, yes, there's more opportunities in the Middle East. And then, there's opportunities in Southeast Asia, there's a lot of competition. But the EXLs, particularly with the 1 16 footprint, it's a desirable rig in the Middle East. So I think, one of the other reasons we moved it there, besides the cost savings and the management oversight, is that there are some opportunities in the Middle East."

We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investments in Rowan. 
Following my prepared comments, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market, and Stephen will discuss our financial performance and guidance. After that, we'll open up the call for your questions. 
We had an outstanding first quarter despite challenging market conditions. Our earnings were $0.98 per share, up from normalized results of $0.95 per share last quarter and $0.27 per share above consensus.
This performance was mostly due to higher-than-expected revenues, lower drilling and SG&A expenses and a lower effective tax rate. 
Specifically, we had outstanding operational downtime of less than 1% across our fleet and solid safety and cost performance due to terrific work by our operations and operations support team.
We made some hard decisions in the quarter, including significant reductions in force in our shore-based operations. Since the beginning of the downturn, we've cut off support headcount by 30%. At the same time, we strengthened our management team with the addition of 2 new hires, a Chief Accounting Officer and a Vice President of Sales and Marketing, both strong and experienced executives.
I am pleased with our 3 new Americas jack-up contracts and our blend-and-extend option agreement on the Rowan Viking. Our Saudi operations also remains strong, and we continue to work with our customers to achieve mutually satisfactory blend-and-extend agreements on our drillships and jack-ups, which Mark will discuss in more detail.
I'd like to briefly mention BSEE well control rule that was released in April. Our operations team is evaluating the details of this extensive document. But after initial review, seeing several of the concerns of offshore contract drillers regarding well control equipment in the initially proposed rule were addressed.
Given the modern design of the dual 7-ram subsea stacks on our ultra-deepwater drillships, we believe we will be able to comply with the immediate requirements without significant additional capital. However, the wider implications of the rule are still under review.
As you are already aware, market conditions remain challenging. Our customers are focused on preserving liquidity and are cutting short-term spending. While there are more jack-up opportunities than deepwater, we do not see a recovery for either market. 
While we have warm-stacked our younger idle jack-ups to enable them to work on short notice, our older idle jack-ups have been cold-stacked. We remain focused on safe and reliable operations. We will not reduce necessary spending on training or maintenance. Throughout this downturn, we are improving our operational system to ensure we come out of this trough with better tools for our crews to work safely, reliably and efficiently to deliver value to our customers.
For example, we're upgrading our maintenance procurement business, which I believe will be an industry-leading system. This is one of the many initiatives we have underway to ensure we remain strong and continue to be a driller of choice for our customers.
Finally, as you might expect, capital allocation remains a focus of our board and management. We further improved our balance sheet during the quarter. Today we have over $600 million of cash, and our $1.5 billion revolver remains undrawn. We have and will continue to review our capital allocation options to best position us to weather this downturn and for the eventual recovery.
To that end, as Stephen will detail shortly, we have retired additional debt this year. 
Now for a look at the markets where Rowan competes, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

Today, I'll visit with you about the jack-up market and recent notable contract announcements for our fleet. Then I'll briefly discuss the ultra-deepwater market and updates on our 4 drillships.
Despite the continuation of a challenging 2016, Rowan has consistently been able to deliver contract commitments through this trough cycle. As announced on our last fleet status, we added a project in Suriname for the Ralph Coffman with Petronas before it mobilizes to Trinidad for work with EOG. These projects combine for approximately $55 million of backlog. 
Our niche presence in this region of the world is an important part of our global operations. 
We also announced the option with Lundin to blend and extend the rate on the Rowan Viking for an additional 270 days of term. Our goal is to creatively approach opportunities with our customers to reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial, and we are glad to have this option in place with Lundin.
In the Middle East, we are pleased with the flat rate adjustments on 4 of our jack-ups with Saudi Aramco through the end of the year. And we've recently signed a short-term extension on the Gilbert Rowe until June 30, 2016 at the current rate.
Our last notable jack-up fleet announcement was the mobilization of the EXL I and EXL IV from Southeast Asia into the Middle East. This decision was both opportunistic and strategic. Given that we were not on a set mobilization schedule and there was an available heavy-lift vessel in Southeast Asia, we were able to realize a highly discounted rate to move both rigs. 
Additionally, there's some cost savings to warm-stacking in the Middle East with the J.P. Bussell. 
As I've mentioned on previous calls, the Southeast Asia market remains weak, and we believe there are better marketing opportunities for our EXL rigs in the Middle East, one of the few regions of the world that has tender activity planned for 2016.
In general, marketed jack-up utilization has hovered around 74% since January 2016. While we don't expect an improvement for the remainder of the year, it appears the decline in demand has leveled. Non-jack-ups have been removed from the worldwide fleet so far in 2016, and an additional 68 units are either cold-stacked or out of service. We believe very few of these rigs will return to the active fleet.
We are ever mindful of the current oversupply and looming entry of new build jack-ups. However, as proven by our track record, Rowan continues to relentlessly pursue opportunities and attain contract awards for our high-spec jack-up fleet.
Now turning to the ultra-deepwater market. All 4 of our drillships are on contract into 2017 or beyond. Currently, the Rowan Renaissance and the Rowan Relentless are on standby rate, which is 98% of the operating rate. 
As you know, Freeport-McMoRan recently announced that they are exiting the oil and gas business. We are in discussions with their senior management team to determine the next steps and appropriate measures regarding the contract in place, which concludes in June 2017.
Meetings are ongoing for blend-and-extend opportunities for some of our drillship contracts. These negotiations are multifaceted, and it is challenging to reach mutually acceptable terms for both parties. That being said, we are actively working towards an agreement as we realize the benefits of extending some contracts beyond their current term.
We remain confident in the marketability of our drillships. Less than 40 of the more than 220 ultra-deepwater vessels in the world have the dual-stacked 1,250-ton capability of our fleet. Competition for future projects will be grueling, but we believe that with our design, our exceptional operations team and the Rowan brand, we can bridge this trough cycle to better times in the industry.
This concludes my remarks this morning. I will now turn the call over to Stephen."

On the call today, I will review our first quarter 2016 operating results compared to the prior quarter and provide you with an update to our costs and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers.
Despite the extremely challenging environment, our first quarter profitability was exceptional. While a general lack of spot work for our idle jack-up rigs led to a somewhat steep 7% decline in revenue versus the prior quarter, we generated similar levels of EBITDA and net income on a 12% or $32 million reduction in operating expenses and G&A.
In fact, our EBITDA margin of 53% is the highest in the company's recent history and a testament to the strong performance of our operations leadership and personnel to deliver on our backlog and their continued response to rightsize the cost structure to the environment.
Yet, while we are pleased with the financial results and our ability to improve our strong financial position, we are also mindful of the fact that as we continue to work through our backlog, most of which was secured in the higher oil price environment, the cost reductions will become more and more challenging and our financial results will weaken.
Now allow me to walk you through the results. We generated net income of $123 million or $0.98 per share, essentially in line with our fourth quarter income of $124 million or $0.99 per share. Fourth quarter results included a gain on the sale of the Rowan Louisiana of $6 million and a $1 million loss on early retirement of debt, both net of tax.
Excluding these items, our net income slightly exceeded fourth quarter net income of $119 million or $0.95 per share. Again, this strong performance is primarily attributable to the high levels of uptime on our contracted units and our continued cost-reduction efforts, which were only partially offset by an increase in idle time on our jack-up fleet.
During the first quarter, we generated revenue of nearly $500 million, excluding rebillable items. The sequential decline of $33 million resulted from our jack-up fleet generating 261 fewer operating days, primarily due to increased idle time in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia and out-of-service time in the Middle East.
Our 4 drillships contributed slightly more revenue during the quarter, as their unbillable downtime was less than 1% of in-service days, an exceptional result.
Our jack-up day -- our average jack-up day rate increased by 3% due to higher levels of off-rate time on certain rigs with lower rates and strong utilization on our higher-earning rigs. The average day rate on our drillships was relatively flat, as all remain on term contracts. 
Our out-of-service time was approximately 5% of our available rig days, in line with our expectations. Our idle time, which reflects periods when a rig is not contracted but is available to work, not surprisingly increased to 19% of available days from 14% in the prior quarter, as operators continued to reduce capital spending. 
All in all, we achieved a marketed utilization rate for our fleet of 73% in the first quarter compared to the 80% achieved in the prior quarter.
Moving on to expenses. Our first quarter operating expenses totaled $200 million, excluding rebuilds, a reduction of 12% from $228 million in the fourth quarter, which was driven by cost reductions on our idle and cold-stacked rigs and continued strong cost control efforts throughout the rest of the fleet.
As a result of the substantial cost reductions in the quarter, we are once again reducing our cost guidance for the full year by another 5% or $45 million. We now believe our 2016 operating expenses will range from $825 million to $835 million. This reduction is largely the result of widespread cost control measures, including reduction of various support costs; increased efficiency in certain activities; and centralization of a number of functions which are not customer-facing.
These items account for approximately 75% of the reduction, while the remainder stems from items related to decreased activity.
Second quarter 2016 operating expenses are expected to approximate $205 million, slightly higher than the first quarter level, primarily due to the timing of repair and maintenance activities. Again, this excludes rebillable items, which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenues.
Our first quarter SG&A expense totaled $27 million, which was slightly lower than our guidance and in line with the fourth quarter level, despite $1 million of incremental severance expense.
We continue to estimate that our full year SG&A expense will range from $105 million to $110 million, in line with our previous guidance, and 5% to 10% below the 2015 levels. We expect second quarter SG&A expense to approximate $28 million.
Our first quarter depreciation expense totaled $99 million, in line with our guidance and slightly lower than the prior quarter. Our full year depreciation expense guidance remains within the $400 million to $410 million range, with approximately $101 million in the second quarter.
Interest expense, which was $39 million during the first quarter, was also in line with our guidance and slightly lower than the prior quarter, as we realized the full quarter benefit of our fourth quarter debt reduction totaling nearly $100 million and achieved higher levels of interest income. We now expect to incur interest expense of approximately $154 million during 2016, slightly below our previous guidance, due to the additional retirement of nearly $50 million in debt thus far in 2016. Second quarter interest expense is expected to approximate $38 million. 
Our first quarter effective tax rate was only 3%, which was lower than our previous guidance, due to changes in our jurisdictional mix of earnings. We estimate that our second quarter and full year effective tax rate will be in the upper single digits. This rate could fluctuate if our jurisdictional mix of earnings differs from that currently projected. 
Moving on to our cash flow and balance sheet. Much like on the cost front, discipline with respect to capital spending was also strong in the first quarter, as we only incurred CapEx of $33 million. While we are reducing our full year CapEx guidance by $10 million to a new range of $170 million to $180 million, the reduction is somewhat muted, as some of the spending we didn't plan for the first quarter has been deferred but not eliminated. 
We generated $110 million of cash during the quarter despite the debt retirement and a build in working capital. And at quarter's end, we had nearly $600 million in cash. Our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, which doesn't mature until January of 2021, remains undrawn.
As I mentioned during my opening, we couldn't be more pleased that we have been able to stave off a decline in financial performance quarter-after-quarter since the downturn commenced nearly 1.5 years ago. The additional cash that we have generated continues to extend our runway as far as just about anyone in the industry. Yet, given the poor macro backdrop, declines in our average day rate over the next 2 years are highly visible. And as cost-reduction measures get tougher and tougher, our cash generation will undoubtedly slow. 
Nonetheless, we will remain highly focused on the things that are under our control, delivering our $3.1 billion backlog through safe and efficient operations, achieving the highest levels of customer satisfaction and maintaining a competitive cost structure.

And so everybody is super focused on making sure that we're cutting costs at all levels. So I think, we've got a good momentum going on by the company. But we -- and it's really just -- Rowan's always had a pretty tenured workforce, perhaps slightly longer than our competitors.

We've moved each of those rigs for about $1.5 million each. They went on the same heavy lift. We do have a pretty large operation in Saudi and in the Middle East. We have 10 rigs running. And so 10 rigs running is about 40 crews of employees. And so it is useful to have those assets locally so that the crews that are on those rigs can also supplement the workforce there when we have an issue, somebody can't make a hitch, et cetera. So -- and also, we got a lot of more deeper oversight. We have a whole management team in the Middle East, where in Southeast Asia, our operation is pretty thin right now as we have no working rigs. So having them in those rigs in [indiscernible] which is in Bahrain, which is basically very close to our operations in Saudi, I mean, literally driving distance, and a short drive, we can have a lot of oversight in those rigs and also use the crews in our Saudi operation and mix things up and keep the crews rotating between working rigs where possible, and off working rigs, which is very important because it can be a little tedious if you're just doing the same thing everyday on a stacked rig. And as far as nesting the rigs, absolutely. Having them next to each other, we can cut down a number of employees on those rigs. But we are keeping those rigs warm. As far as the opportunity in the Middle East, yes, there's more opportunities in the Middle East. And then there's opportunities in Southeast Asia; there's a lot of competition. But the EXLs, particularly with the 1 16 footprint, it's a desirable rig in the Middle East. So I think one of the other reasons we moved it there, besides the cost savings and the management oversight, is that there are some opportunities in the Middle East."

We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investments in Rowan. 
Following my prepared comments, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market, and Stephen will discuss our financial performance and guidance. After that, we'll open up the call for your questions. 
We had an outstanding first quarter despite challenging market conditions. Our earnings were $0.98 per share, up from normalized results of $0.95 per share last quarter and $0.27 per share above consensus.
This performance was mostly due to higher-than-expected revenues, lower drilling and SG&A expenses and a lower effective tax rate. 
Specifically, we had outstanding operational downtime of less than 1% across our fleet and solid safety and cost performance due to terrific work by our operations and operations support team.
We made some hard decisions in the quarter, including significant reductions in force in our shore-based operations. Since the beginning of the downturn, we've cut off support headcount by 30%. At the same time, we strengthened our management team with the addition of 2 new hires, a Chief Accounting Officer and a Vice President of Sales and Marketing, both strong and experienced executives.
I am pleased with our 3 new Americas jack-up contracts and our blend-and-extend option agreement on the Rowan Viking. Our Saudi operations also remains strong, and we continue to work with our customers to achieve mutually satisfactory blend-and-extend agreements on our drillships and jack-ups, which Mark will discuss in more detail.
I'd like to briefly mention BSEE well control rule that was released in April. Our operations team is evaluating the details of this extensive document. But after initial review, seeing several of the concerns of offshore contract drillers regarding well control equipment in the initially proposed rule were addressed.
Given the modern design of the dual 7-ram subsea stacks on our ultra-deepwater drillships, we believe we will be able to comply with the immediate requirements without significant additional capital. However, the wider implications of the rule are still under review.
As you are already aware, market conditions remain challenging. Our customers are focused on preserving liquidity and are cutting short-term spending. While there are more jack-up opportunities than deepwater, we do not see a recovery for either market. 
While we have warm-stacked our younger idle jack-ups to enable them to work on short notice, our older idle jack-ups have been cold-stacked. We remain focused on safe and reliable operations. We will not reduce necessary spending on training or maintenance. Throughout this downturn, we are improving our operational system to ensure we come out of this trough with better tools for our crews to work safely, reliably and efficiently to deliver value to our customers.
For example, we're upgrading our maintenance procurement business, which I believe will be an industry-leading system. This is one of the many initiatives we have underway to ensure we remain strong and continue to be a driller of choice for our customers.
Finally, as you might expect, capital allocation remains a focus of our board and management. We further improved our balance sheet during the quarter. Today we have over $600 million of cash, and our $1.5 billion revolver remains undrawn. We have and will continue to review our capital allocation options to best position us to weather this downturn and for the eventual recovery.
To that end, as Stephen will detail shortly, we have retired additional debt this year. 
Now for a look at the markets where Rowan competes, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

Today, I'll visit with you about the jack-up market and recent notable contract announcements for our fleet. Then I'll briefly discuss the ultra-deepwater market and updates on our 4 drillships.
Despite the continuation of a challenging 2016, Rowan has consistently been able to deliver contract commitments through this trough cycle. As announced on our last fleet status, we added a project in Suriname for the Ralph Coffman with Petronas before it mobilizes to Trinidad for work with EOG. These projects combine for approximately $55 million of backlog. 
Our niche presence in this region of the world is an important part of our global operations. 
We also announced the option with Lundin to blend and extend the rate on the Rowan Viking for an additional 270 days of term. Our goal is to creatively approach opportunities with our customers to reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial, and we are glad to have this option in place with Lundin.
In the Middle East, we are pleased with the flat rate adjustments on 4 of our jack-ups with Saudi Aramco through the end of the year. And we've recently signed a short-term extension on the Gilbert Rowe until June 30, 2016 at the current rate.
Our last notable jack-up fleet announcement was the mobilization of the EXL I and EXL IV from Southeast Asia into the Middle East. This decision was both opportunistic and strategic. Given that we were not on a set mobilization schedule and there was an available heavy-lift vessel in Southeast Asia, we were able to realize a highly discounted rate to move both rigs. 
Additionally, there's some cost savings to warm-stacking in the Middle East with the J.P. Bussell. 
As I've mentioned on previous calls, the Southeast Asia market remains weak, and we believe there are better marketing opportunities for our EXL rigs in the Middle East, one of the few regions of the world that has tender activity planned for 2016.
In general, marketed jack-up utilization has hovered around 74% since January 2016. While we don't expect an improvement for the remainder of the year, it appears the decline in demand has leveled. Non-jack-ups have been removed from the worldwide fleet so far in 2016, and an additional 68 units are either cold-stacked or out of service. We believe very few of these rigs will return to the active fleet.
We are ever mindful of the current oversupply and looming entry of new build jack-ups. However, as proven by our track record, Rowan continues to relentlessly pursue opportunities and attain contract awards for our high-spec jack-up fleet.
Now turning to the ultra-deepwater market. All 4 of our drillships are on contract into 2017 or beyond. Currently, the Rowan Renaissance and the Rowan Relentless are on standby rate, which is 98% of the operating rate. 
As you know, Freeport-McMoRan recently announced that they are exiting the oil and gas business. We are in discussions with their senior management team to determine the next steps and appropriate measures regarding the contract in place, which concludes in June 2017.
Meetings are ongoing for blend-and-extend opportunities for some of our drillship contracts. These negotiations are multifaceted, and it is challenging to reach mutually acceptable terms for both parties. That being said, we are actively working towards an agreement as we realize the benefits of extending some contracts beyond their current term.
We remain confident in the marketability of our drillships. Less than 40 of the more than 220 ultra-deepwater vessels in the world have the dual-stacked 1,250-ton capability of our fleet. Competition for future projects will be grueling, but we believe that with our design, our exceptional operations team and the Rowan brand, we can bridge this trough cycle to better times in the industry.
This concludes my remarks this morning. I will now turn the call over to Stephen."

On the call today, I will review our first quarter 2016 operating results compared to the prior quarter and provide you with an update to our costs and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers.
Despite the extremely challenging environment, our first quarter profitability was exceptional. While a general lack of spot work for our idle jack-up rigs led to a somewhat steep 7% decline in revenue versus the prior quarter, we generated similar levels of EBITDA and net income on a 12% or $32 million reduction in operating expenses and G&A.
In fact, our EBITDA margin of 53% is the highest in the company's recent history and a testament to the strong performance of our operations leadership and personnel to deliver on our backlog and their continued response to rightsize the cost structure to the environment.
Yet, while we are pleased with the financial results and our ability to improve our strong financial position, we are also mindful of the fact that as we continue to work through our backlog, most of which was secured in the higher oil price environment, the cost reductions will become more and more challenging and our financial results will weaken.
Now allow me to walk you through the results. We generated net income of $123 million or $0.98 per share, essentially in line with our fourth quarter income of $124 million or $0.99 per share. Fourth quarter results included a gain on the sale of the Rowan Louisiana of $6 million and a $1 million loss on early retirement of debt, both net of tax.
Excluding these items, our net income slightly exceeded fourth quarter net income of $119 million or $0.95 per share. Again, this strong performance is primarily attributable to the high levels of uptime on our contracted units and our continued cost-reduction efforts, which were only partially offset by an increase in idle time on our jack-up fleet.
During the first quarter, we generated revenue of nearly $500 million, excluding rebillable items. The sequential decline of $33 million resulted from our jack-up fleet generating 261 fewer operating days, primarily due to increased idle time in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia and out-of-service time in the Middle East.
Our 4 drillships contributed slightly more revenue during the quarter, as their unbillable downtime was less than 1% of in-service days, an exceptional result.
Our jack-up day -- our average jack-up day rate increased by 3% due to higher levels of off-rate time on certain rigs with lower rates and strong utilization on our higher-earning rigs. The average day rate on our drillships was relatively flat, as all remain on term contracts. 
Our out-of-service time was approximately 5% of our available rig days, in line with our expectations. Our idle time, which reflects periods when a rig is not contracted but is available to work, not surprisingly increased to 19% of available days from 14% in the prior quarter, as operators continued to reduce capital spending. 
All in all, we achieved a marketed utilization rate for our fleet of 73% in the first quarter compared to the 80% achieved in the prior quarter.
Moving on to expenses. Our first quarter operating expenses totaled $200 million, excluding rebuilds, a reduction of 12% from $228 million in the fourth quarter, which was driven by cost reductions on our idle and cold-stacked rigs and continued strong cost control efforts throughout the rest of the fleet.
As a result of the substantial cost reductions in the quarter, we are once again reducing our cost guidance for the full year by another 5% or $45 million. We now believe our 2016 operating expenses will range from $825 million to $835 million. This reduction is largely the result of widespread cost control measures, including reduction of various support costs; increased efficiency in certain activities; and centralization of a number of functions which are not customer-facing.
These items account for approximately 75% of the reduction, while the remainder stems from items related to decreased activity.
Second quarter 2016 operating expenses are expected to approximate $205 million, slightly higher than the first quarter level, primarily due to the timing of repair and maintenance activities. Again, this excludes rebillable items, which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenues.
Our first quarter SG&A expense totaled $27 million, which was slightly lower than our guidance and in line with the fourth quarter level, despite $1 million of incremental severance expense.
We continue to estimate that our full year SG&A expense will range from $105 million to $110 million, in line with our previous guidance, and 5% to 10% below the 2015 levels. We expect second quarter SG&A expense to approximate $28 million.
Our first quarter depreciation expense totaled $99 million, in line with our guidance and slightly lower than the prior quarter. Our full year depreciation expense guidance remains within the $400 million to $410 million range, with approximately $101 million in the second quarter.
Interest expense, which was $39 million during the first quarter, was also in line with our guidance and slightly lower than the prior quarter, as we realized the full quarter benefit of our fourth quarter debt reduction totaling nearly $100 million and achieved higher levels of interest income. We now expect to incur interest expense of approximately $154 million during 2016, slightly below our previous guidance, due to the additional retirement of nearly $50 million in debt thus far in 2016. Second quarter interest expense is expected to approximate $38 million. 
Our first quarter effective tax rate was only 3%, which was lower than our previous guidance, due to changes in our jurisdictional mix of earnings. We estimate that our second quarter and full year effective tax rate will be in the upper single digits. This rate could fluctuate if our jurisdictional mix of earnings differs from that currently projected. 
Moving on to our cash flow and balance sheet. Much like on the cost front, discipline with respect to capital spending was also strong in the first quarter, as we only incurred CapEx of $33 million. While we are reducing our full year CapEx guidance by $10 million to a new range of $170 million to $180 million, the reduction is somewhat muted, as some of the spending we didn't plan for the first quarter has been deferred but not eliminated. 
We generated $110 million of cash during the quarter despite the debt retirement and a build in working capital. And at quarter's end, we had nearly $600 million in cash. Our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, which doesn't mature until January of 2021, remains undrawn.
As I mentioned during my opening, we couldn't be more pleased that we have been able to stave off a decline in financial performance quarter-after-quarter since the downturn commenced nearly 1.5 years ago. The additional cash that we have generated continues to extend our runway as far as just about anyone in the industry. Yet, given the poor macro backdrop, declines in our average day rate over the next 2 years are highly visible. And as cost-reduction measures get tougher and tougher, our cash generation will undoubtedly slow. 
Nonetheless, we will remain highly focused on the things that are under our control, delivering our $3.1 billion backlog through safe and efficient operations, achieving the highest levels of customer satisfaction and maintaining a competitive cost structure.

Given where our drillships are and the fact that we haven't blended and extended yet and that we have 5 newer jack-ups, at least 5 newer jack-ups, which don't have contracts, adding another drillship to market on top of that or adding more jack-ups is something which fundamentally we'd do if the price is really good and we really like the asset, but also probably a little bit early for us, but we certainly think about it a lot."

So I think, the company knows we're in a good position, but they also know that we're going into a tough trough.

We've moved each of those rigs for about $1.5 million each. They went on the same heavy lift. We do have a pretty large operation in Saudi and in the Middle East. We have 10 rigs running. And so 10 rigs running is about 40 crews of employees. And so it is useful to have those assets locally so that the crews that are on those rigs can also supplement the workforce there when we have an issue, somebody can't make a hitch, et cetera. So -- and also, we got a lot of more deeper oversight. We have a whole management team in the Middle East, where in Southeast Asia, our operation is pretty thin right now as we have no working rigs. So having them in those rigs in [indiscernible] which is in Bahrain, which is basically very close to our operations in Saudi, I mean, literally driving distance, and a short drive, we can have a lot of oversight in those rigs and also use the crews in our Saudi operation and mix things up and keep the crews rotating between working rigs where possible, and off working rigs, which is very important because it can be a little tedious if you're just doing the same thing everyday on a stacked rig. And as far as nesting the rigs, absolutely. Having them next to each other, we can cut down a number of employees on those rigs. But we are keeping those rigs warm. As far as the opportunity in the Middle East, yes, there's more opportunities in the Middle East. And then there's opportunities in Southeast Asia; there's a lot of competition. But the EXLs, particularly with the 1 16 footprint, it's a desirable rig in the Middle East. So I think one of the other reasons we moved it there, besides the cost savings and the management oversight, is that there are some opportunities in the Middle East."

We appreciate your participation today and your continued interest and investments in Rowan. 
Following my prepared comments, Mark will give you an update on the offshore drilling market, and Stephen will discuss our financial performance and guidance. After that, we'll open up the call for your questions. 
We had an outstanding first quarter despite challenging market conditions. Our earnings were $0.98 per share, up from normalized results of $0.95 per share last quarter and $0.27 per share above consensus.
This performance was mostly due to higher-than-expected revenues, lower drilling and SG&A expenses and a lower effective tax rate. 
Specifically, we had outstanding operational downtime of less than 1% across our fleet and solid safety and cost performance due to terrific work by our operations and operations support team.
We made some hard decisions in the quarter, including significant reductions in force in our shore-based operations. Since the beginning of the downturn, we've cut off support headcount by 30%. At the same time, we strengthened our management team with the addition of 2 new hires, a Chief Accounting Officer and a Vice President of Sales and Marketing, both strong and experienced executives.
I am pleased with our 3 new Americas jack-up contracts and our blend-and-extend option agreement on the Rowan Viking. Our Saudi operations also remains strong, and we continue to work with our customers to achieve mutually satisfactory blend-and-extend agreements on our drillships and jack-ups, which Mark will discuss in more detail.
I'd like to briefly mention BSEE well control rule that was released in April. Our operations team is evaluating the details of this extensive document. But after initial review, seeing several of the concerns of offshore contract drillers regarding well control equipment in the initially proposed rule were addressed.
Given the modern design of the dual 7-ram subsea stacks on our ultra-deepwater drillships, we believe we will be able to comply with the immediate requirements without significant additional capital. However, the wider implications of the rule are still under review.
As you are already aware, market conditions remain challenging. Our customers are focused on preserving liquidity and are cutting short-term spending. While there are more jack-up opportunities than deepwater, we do not see a recovery for either market. 
While we have warm-stacked our younger idle jack-ups to enable them to work on short notice, our older idle jack-ups have been cold-stacked. We remain focused on safe and reliable operations. We will not reduce necessary spending on training or maintenance. Throughout this downturn, we are improving our operational system to ensure we come out of this trough with better tools for our crews to work safely, reliably and efficiently to deliver value to our customers.
For example, we're upgrading our maintenance procurement business, which I believe will be an industry-leading system. This is one of the many initiatives we have underway to ensure we remain strong and continue to be a driller of choice for our customers.
Finally, as you might expect, capital allocation remains a focus of our board and management. We further improved our balance sheet during the quarter. Today we have over $600 million of cash, and our $1.5 billion revolver remains undrawn. We have and will continue to review our capital allocation options to best position us to weather this downturn and for the eventual recovery.
To that end, as Stephen will detail shortly, we have retired additional debt this year. 
Now for a look at the markets where Rowan competes, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

Today, I'll visit with you about the jack-up market and recent notable contract announcements for our fleet. Then I'll briefly discuss the ultra-deepwater market and updates on our 4 drillships.
Despite the continuation of a challenging 2016, Rowan has consistently been able to deliver contract commitments through this trough cycle. As announced on our last fleet status, we added a project in Suriname for the Ralph Coffman with Petronas before it mobilizes to Trinidad for work with EOG. These projects combine for approximately $55 million of backlog. 
Our niche presence in this region of the world is an important part of our global operations. 
We also announced the option with Lundin to blend and extend the rate on the Rowan Viking for an additional 270 days of term. Our goal is to creatively approach opportunities with our customers to reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial, and we are glad to have this option in place with Lundin.
In the Middle East, we are pleased with the flat rate adjustments on 4 of our jack-ups with Saudi Aramco through the end of the year. And we've recently signed a short-term extension on the Gilbert Rowe until June 30, 2016 at the current rate.
Our last notable jack-up fleet announcement was the mobilization of the EXL I and EXL IV from Southeast Asia into the Middle East. This decision was both opportunistic and strategic. Given that we were not on a set mobilization schedule and there was an available heavy-lift vessel in Southeast Asia, we were able to realize a highly discounted rate to move both rigs. 
Additionally, there's some cost savings to warm-stacking in the Middle East with the J.P. Bussell. 
As I've mentioned on previous calls, the Southeast Asia market remains weak, and we believe there are better marketing opportunities for our EXL rigs in the Middle East, one of the few regions of the world that has tender activity planned for 2016.
In general, marketed jack-up utilization has hovered around 74% since January 2016. While we don't expect an improvement for the remainder of the year, it appears the decline in demand has leveled. Non-jack-ups have been removed from the worldwide fleet so far in 2016, and an additional 68 units are either cold-stacked or out of service. We believe very few of these rigs will return to the active fleet.
We are ever mindful of the current oversupply and looming entry of new build jack-ups. However, as proven by our track record, Rowan continues to relentlessly pursue opportunities and attain contract awards for our high-spec jack-up fleet.
Now turning to the ultra-deepwater market. All 4 of our drillships are on contract into 2017 or beyond. Currently, the Rowan Renaissance and the Rowan Relentless are on standby rate, which is 98% of the operating rate. 
As you know, Freeport-McMoRan recently announced that they are exiting the oil and gas business. We are in discussions with their senior management team to determine the next steps and appropriate measures regarding the contract in place, which concludes in June 2017.
Meetings are ongoing for blend-and-extend opportunities for some of our drillship contracts. These negotiations are multifaceted, and it is challenging to reach mutually acceptable terms for both parties. That being said, we are actively working towards an agreement as we realize the benefits of extending some contracts beyond their current term.
We remain confident in the marketability of our drillships. Less than 40 of the more than 220 ultra-deepwater vessels in the world have the dual-stacked 1,250-ton capability of our fleet. Competition for future projects will be grueling, but we believe that with our design, our exceptional operations team and the Rowan brand, we can bridge this trough cycle to better times in the industry.
This concludes my remarks this morning. I will now turn the call over to Stephen."

On the call today, I will review our first quarter 2016 operating results compared to the prior quarter and provide you with an update to our costs and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers.
Despite the extremely challenging environment, our first quarter profitability was exceptional. While a general lack of spot work for our idle jack-up rigs led to a somewhat steep 7% decline in revenue versus the prior quarter, we generated similar levels of EBITDA and net income on a 12% or $32 million reduction in operating expenses and G&A.
In fact, our EBITDA margin of 53% is the highest in the company's recent history and a testament to the strong performance of our operations leadership and personnel to deliver on our backlog and their continued response to rightsize the cost structure to the environment.
Yet, while we are pleased with the financial results and our ability to improve our strong financial position, we are also mindful of the fact that as we continue to work through our backlog, most of which was secured in the higher oil price environment, the cost reductions will become more and more challenging and our financial results will weaken.
Now allow me to walk you through the results. We generated net income of $123 million or $0.98 per share, essentially in line with our fourth quarter income of $124 million or $0.99 per share. Fourth quarter results included a gain on the sale of the Rowan Louisiana of $6 million and a $1 million loss on early retirement of debt, both net of tax.
Excluding these items, our net income slightly exceeded fourth quarter net income of $119 million or $0.95 per share. Again, this strong performance is primarily attributable to the high levels of uptime on our contracted units and our continued cost-reduction efforts, which were only partially offset by an increase in idle time on our jack-up fleet.
During the first quarter, we generated revenue of nearly $500 million, excluding rebillable items. The sequential decline of $33 million resulted from our jack-up fleet generating 261 fewer operating days, primarily due to increased idle time in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia and out-of-service time in the Middle East.
Our 4 drillships contributed slightly more revenue during the quarter, as their unbillable downtime was less than 1% of in-service days, an exceptional result.
Our jack-up day -- our average jack-up day rate increased by 3% due to higher levels of off-rate time on certain rigs with lower rates and strong utilization on our higher-earning rigs. The average day rate on our drillships was relatively flat, as all remain on term contracts. 
Our out-of-service time was approximately 5% of our available rig days, in line with our expectations. Our idle time, which reflects periods when a rig is not contracted but is available to work, not surprisingly increased to 19% of available days from 14% in the prior quarter, as operators continued to reduce capital spending. 
All in all, we achieved a marketed utilization rate for our fleet of 73% in the first quarter compared to the 80% achieved in the prior quarter.
Moving on to expenses. Our first quarter operating expenses totaled $200 million, excluding rebuilds, a reduction of 12% from $228 million in the fourth quarter, which was driven by cost reductions on our idle and cold-stacked rigs and continued strong cost control efforts throughout the rest of the fleet.
As a result of the substantial cost reductions in the quarter, we are once again reducing our cost guidance for the full year by another 5% or $45 million. We now believe our 2016 operating expenses will range from $825 million to $835 million. This reduction is largely the result of widespread cost control measures, including reduction of various support costs; increased efficiency in certain activities; and centralization of a number of functions which are not customer-facing.
These items account for approximately 75% of the reduction, while the remainder stems from items related to decreased activity.
Second quarter 2016 operating expenses are expected to approximate $205 million, slightly higher than the first quarter level, primarily due to the timing of repair and maintenance activities. Again, this excludes rebillable items, which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenues.
Our first quarter SG&A expense totaled $27 million, which was slightly lower than our guidance and in line with the fourth quarter level, despite $1 million of incremental severance expense.
We continue to estimate that our full year SG&A expense will range from $105 million to $110 million, in line with our previous guidance, and 5% to 10% below the 2015 levels. We expect second quarter SG&A expense to approximate $28 million.
Our first quarter depreciation expense totaled $99 million, in line with our guidance and slightly lower than the prior quarter. Our full year depreciation expense guidance remains within the $400 million to $410 million range, with approximately $101 million in the second quarter.
Interest expense, which was $39 million during the first quarter, was also in line with our guidance and slightly lower than the prior quarter, as we realized the full quarter benefit of our fourth quarter debt reduction totaling nearly $100 million and achieved higher levels of interest income. We now expect to incur interest expense of approximately $154 million during 2016, slightly below our previous guidance, due to the additional retirement of nearly $50 million in debt thus far in 2016. Second quarter interest expense is expected to approximate $38 million. 
Our first quarter effective tax rate was only 3%, which was lower than our previous guidance, due to changes in our jurisdictional mix of earnings. We estimate that our second quarter and full year effective tax rate will be in the upper single digits. This rate could fluctuate if our jurisdictional mix of earnings differs from that currently projected. 
Moving on to our cash flow and balance sheet. Much like on the cost front, discipline with respect to capital spending was also strong in the first quarter, as we only incurred CapEx of $33 million. While we are reducing our full year CapEx guidance by $10 million to a new range of $170 million to $180 million, the reduction is somewhat muted, as some of the spending we didn't plan for the first quarter has been deferred but not eliminated. 
We generated $110 million of cash during the quarter despite the debt retirement and a build in working capital. And at quarter's end, we had nearly $600 million in cash. Our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, which doesn't mature until January of 2021, remains undrawn.
As I mentioned during my opening, we couldn't be more pleased that we have been able to stave off a decline in financial performance quarter-after-quarter since the downturn commenced nearly 1.5 years ago. The additional cash that we have generated continues to extend our runway as far as just about anyone in the industry. Yet, given the poor macro backdrop, declines in our average day rate over the next 2 years are highly visible. And as cost-reduction measures get tougher and tougher, our cash generation will undoubtedly slow. 
Nonetheless, we will remain highly focused on the things that are under our control, delivering our $3.1 billion backlog through safe and efficient operations, achieving the highest levels of customer satisfaction and maintaining a competitive cost structure.

Some of that is activity-related, but some is just, as we mentioned, related to efficiency and trying to do this the harder way, particularly in the back office where we've been able to centralize certain functions. And we're going to continue to focus on those sorts of initiatives probably to identify additional savings as we move forward. But of course, it will get tougher and tougher over time."

We've moved each of those rigs for about $1.5 million each. They went on the same heavy lift. We do have a pretty large operation in Saudi and in the Middle East. We have 10 rigs running. And so 10 rigs running is about 40 crews of employees. And so it is useful to have those assets locally so that the crews that are on those rigs can also supplement the workforce there when we have an issue, somebody can't make a hitch, et cetera. So -- and also, we got a lot of more deeper oversight. We have a whole management team in the Middle East, where in Southeast Asia, our operation is pretty thin right now as we have no working rigs. So having them in those rigs in [indiscernible] which is in Bahrain, which is basically very close to our operations in Saudi, I mean, literally driving distance, and a short drive, we can have a lot of oversight in those rigs and also use the crews in our Saudi operation and mix things up and keep the crews rotating between working rigs where possible, and off working rigs, which is very important because it can be a little tedious if you're just doing the same thing every day on a stacked rig. And as far as nesting the rigs, absolutely. Having them next to each other, we can cut down a number of employees on those rigs. But we are keeping those rigs warm. As far as the opportunity in the Middle East, yes, there's more opportunities in the Middle East. And then there's opportunities in Southeast Asia; there's a lot of competition. But the EXLs, particularly with the 1 16 footprint, it's a desirable rig in the Middle East. So I think one of the other reasons we moved it there, besides the cost savings and the management oversight, is that there are some opportunities in the Middle East."

We had a great second quarter of 2016 in the face of difficult industry conditions. We had earnings of $1.72 per share in the quarter. Excluding the effects of the Rowan Relentless' contract termination and our early retirement of debt, our earnings would've been $0.75 per share, still above consensus estimates of $0.72 per share. Our estimated EBITDA was $256 million versus consensus EBITDA of just under $240 million. This performance was mostly due to better-than-expected utilization and lower-than-expected drilling and overhead expenses. Stephen will go into greater detail on each of these items later in the call. 
We had our best safety performance to date in the quarter, which continues our trend of improved safety performance over the last 3 years. I'd like to take this opportunity to both thank and congratulate all of our employees and especially all our offshore crews on this fantastic achievement. Our uptime performance was also impressive with an approximately 1% operational downtime for our entire fleet, including nearly 0 downtime for our drillships. We believe our focus on safety, reliability and efficiency are key to securing incremental backlog. 
We remain focused on cost control. Compared to the same quarter last year, we have systematically lowered our direct operating costs by 18%. As a backdrop to that reduction, during the same period our revenue producing days increased by about 29% with deepwater and decreased about 19% for our jack-up fleet. This means that less than half of the cost savings are attributable to idling or cold stacking of rigs. In the same manner, comparing the second quarter of 2015 to the latest quarter, SG&A cost decreased [ph] by approximately 16% due to lower labor costs largely due to labor force reductions and lower share-based compensation.
During the quarter, Rowan's executive management team and Board of Directors agreed to reduce executive compensation by 10% for at least a year. We took the step to show visible leadership through our workforce and further reduce costs in these tough times.
While we are pleased with our ability to reduce costs, we remained absolutely focused on safe and reliable and efficient operations. We will not reduce necessary spending on training or maintenance and we continuously communicate this message to our crews and rig management. 
Turning to our marketing effort. Mark will go into greater detail but I'd like to comment on a few highlights for the quarter. As mentioned in previous quarters, we have been in blend-and-extend conversations with numerous customers and executed our first blend-and-extend contract extension for the Rowan Resolute this quarter. We also extended a jack-up contract in Norway and added significant new contract term to another jack-up in the United Kingdom. While I'm mindful of the challenges ahead to secure a new contract for the Rowan Relentless, I'm quite pleased of our ability to add this crucial backlog at this point in the cycle.
As you are already aware, in echoing remarks made last quarter, the offshore drilling market continues to be severely challenged with uncertain timing of the recovery. Until a more substantial and sustained recovery in commodity prices occurs, we expect our customers to continue delaying their drilling plans. Even after healthy drilling demand levels return, the industry will likely still have significant rig oversupply. The market will need attrition of older rigs before we see improved utilization and pricing. Nevertheless, Rowan is prepared to weather the tough times ahead however long they last. 
Finally, as you might expect, optimal capital allocation remains a primary focus for us. We further improved our balance sheet during the quarter by the early retirement of some of our long-term debt while continuing to grow our cash balance to over $760 million. With a $1.5 billion revolver that remains undrawn, our liquidity position is robust and is expected to remain so.  We continue to look for opportunities to improve our fleet while asset prices are at low levels. 
Now if we look at the market where Rowan competes, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

As we reached midyear 2016, we appreciate the improvements in commodity price from the beginning of the year, but our focus turns the anticipation of where those process will range during the budget season, which will heavily impact drilling activity levels for 2017. While we are encouraged by our customers ability to sanction programs at lower commodity price levels and the resulting possibility of improved utilization, we remain prepared for an extended downturn. 
Exhibiting that preparedness and willingness to partner with our customers through this trough cycle, we are pleased to announce our blend and extend agreement with Anadarko on the Rowan Resolute. Starting July 1, the day rate was lower to 180,000 per day for an estimated 210 days. In exchange for the day rate reduction, Anadarko agreed to extend the contract past the primary term by 1.3 days for everyday of reduced rate. Firmly, we estimate an extension to August, 2018 or 273 days at 580,000 a day. This is a win-win agreement for Anadarko and Rowan as we were able to help them with short-term cost savings while adding additional term that helpfully bridges us to a more favorable market environment. 
The Rowan Renaissance and Rowan Reliance continued their contracts with Repsol and Cobalt, respectively. And we are actively tendering the Rowan Relentless, which is currently warm stacked at Curacao following a contract cancellation from Freeport-McMoRan earlier this quarter. 
Now turning to the jack-up market. We continue to deliver contract commitments despite the arduous environment our industry is currently facing. In the second quarter we added approximately 800 days of backlog to the jack-up fleet, with Ralph Coughlin work in Suriname, the long-deemed blend and extend option on the Rowan Viking and the Gilbert Row contract extension with Saudi Aramco through the end of 2016. Additionally, we're pleased to announce we have extended the contract on the Gorilla V with Total in the North Sea for approximately 8 months plus an option period. We appreciate our long-standing relationship with Total and look forward to continue our operations. 
We are relentlessly pursuing contracts for idled jack-ups by actively tendering worldwide and creatively approaching all opportunities with projects with operations commencing in 2016 are scarce. Market utilization has slipped to 72% and jack-up contract roll-off appears greater than tender activity for the next 6 months. We believe our [indiscernible] jack-ups are well-positioned to secure contracts when work is available albeit at pressure day rates. Historically, the more capable rigs are able to maintain higher utilization through downturns and we expect similar outcomes in this trough cycle.
Jack-up demand remains weak worldwide with the exception of the Middle East, the only region where they currently forecast demand increase over the next 2 years. As a reminder, we have the J.P. Bussell, the Excel I and the Excel IV currently positioned and available for work in the region. 
Competition for future projects, both in the jack-up and ultra-deepwater markets is fierce, but we are steadfast in our efforts, confident in our fleet and backed by an outstanding workforce that delivers safe and reliable operations. We will survive this downturn and we are poised to emerge a stronger company that will continue its more than 93-year history of excellence. 
This concludes my remarks this morning and I will now turn the call over to Stephen."

On the call today I will review our second quarter 2016 operating results compared to the prior quarter and provide you with an update to our cost and capital spending guidance before opening the call for questions and answers. 
Our exceptional financial performance continued in the second quarter despite strong market-related headwinds. Even when excluding the positive impact of the contract termination for the Relentless on our second quarter results, our adjusted EBITDA margin of 52% was nearly on par with the record margin that we generated in the first quarter. We further strengthened our balance sheet by generating $166 million of cash even after retiring $31 million of debt. 
Despite these strong results and further reductions in our cost guidance which we will outline on this call, we expect our second half results will weaken significantly as the cost reductions will no longer keep pace with the expected decline in revenue in the third and fourth quarters. 
Turning to our financial results. We generated earnings of $1.72 per share or $0.75 per share when excluding the positive impact of the contract termination settlement for the Relentless and a small gain on debt retirement, which together added about $0.96 to our earnings per share. As previously announced, our customer agreed to pay us $215 million to settle all outstanding receivable balances and terminate the contract, which resulted in our recognition of $120 million of incremental revenues during the quarter. Separately, we also recognized the gain of $1.8 million on early extinguishment of long-term debt. Excluding these items, our adjusted EBITDA of $256 million was only $10 million less than the first quarter level. However, second quarter adjusted earnings per share declined to $0.75 from $0.98 in the first quarter primarily due to increased income tax expense. 
Our ability to post strong results in the face of declining average jack-up day rates stemmed from reduced idle time for the jack-up fleet, buy uptime for rigs under contract and sustained cost control measures. Second quarter revenue was $485 million, excluding rebillable items and the effect of the Relentless contract settlement. The $10 million decline from the first quarter level primarily resulted from the impact of a blend and extend agreement related to the Rowan Viking, which we believe will benefit the company in future quarters, partially offset by 108 additional operating days for the jack-up fleet primarily in the Middle East and Suriname. These same factors caused the 10% reduction in average jack-up day rates. The average day rate on our drillships remained within 1% of first quarter levels. 
For the jack-up fleet, our out-of-service time was exceptional at only 3% of available rig days. Our idle time, which reflects periods when a rig is not contracted but is available to work improved to 22% of available days versus 24% in the prior quarter.
Moving on to expenses. Second quarter operating expenses, excluding rebuilds, were essentially flat at $200 million. We are reducing our full year cost guidance by $30 million to $795 million to $805 million. Reductions in operating cost on the Relentless are expected to account for about half these savings. Operating cost in the third quarter of 2016 are expected to approximate $205 million, slightly higher than the second quarter level, due primarily to the timing of repair and maintenance activities for the jack-up fleet. As a reminder, this excludes rebillable items, which are offset by an equal increase in revenue. 
Our guidance reflects the continued valorization of widespread cost control measures, including the reduction of various support costs, increased efficiency in certain activities and the centralization of a number of functions.
Our second quarter SG&A expense was approximately $26 million, which was lower than our guidance and slightly lower than the expense incurred in the first quarter. We are holding our full year SG&A expense estimate flat at $105 million to $110 million, but still 5% to 10% below the 2015 level. We expect third quarter SG&A expense to approximate $29 million. 
Our second quarter depreciation expense totaled $100 million, in line with our guidance and slightly higher than the prior quarter. We are narrowing our range for full year depreciation expense guidance to the low end of our previous range at $400 million to $405 million, with approximately $102 million expected in the third quarter. 
Gross interest expense, which was $38 million during the second quarter, was also in line with our guidance and slightly lower than the prior quarter as we realized the benefit of our debt retirement during the first half of 2016, which totaled nearly $50 million.
We expect to incur growth interest expense of approximately $155 million for the full year. 
Our second quarter effective tax rate was 9.5% at the high end of our previous guidance of upper single digits. We still estimate that our full year effective tax rate will be in the mid-single digits. However, since we operate numerous jurisdictions around the world, including some with profit regimes where taxes are based on revenues and as our results deteriorate toward breakeven or even to a loss, we will likely see overall quarterly income tax rates, which are volatile and not meaningful, as the expensive benefit may still be a very small dollar amount.
With respect to our balance sheet and cash flow, we have continued to exercise discipline as reflected in our capital spend of only $31 million, essentially in line with our first quarter spend of $33 million. We are reducing our full year CapEx guidance by $25 million to a new range of $145 million to $155 million. 
Cash generated during the second quarter was $166 million, exceeding the first quarter level of $111 million despite the aforementioned debt retirement and a build on working capital. The working capital increase is largely due to the remaining Freeport-McMoRan receivable of $130 million at June 30, $15 million of which has already been received with the remaining amount payable in late August.
As was the case last quarter, our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, which doesn't mature until January 2021, remains undrawn but available.
In closing, once again our operations personnel continued to deliver exceptional performance for our customers while marketing group yet again secured meaningful work for both our jack-ups and drillships, and the company operated in an efficient and cost-effective manner, which reflected in our solid second quarter financial results. 
However, as good as we feel about the company's performance, the recent pullback in crude oil prices remains us an industry we're not out of the woods in relation to the severe downturn. While we have strong conviction that offshore demand will recover as it remains a vital and meaningful source of oil and gas supply, we remain concerned about the timing of the recovery in deepwater drillings and the supply overhang of offshore rigs in general, which further dampens our outlook. 
Looking forward at the tough road ahead, we should expect our strong capital discipline to continue, our cost reduction efforts to remain as focused as ever and our commitment to our shareholders and to maintain a strong credit profile to continue unabated. 
With that, we're now prepared to open the call for questions. Operator?"

We had a great second quarter of 2016 in the face of difficult industry conditions. We had earnings of $1.72 per share in the quarter. Excluding the effects of the Rowan Relentless contract termination and our early retirement of debt, our earnings would have been $0.75 per share, still above consensus estimates of $0.72 per share. Our estimated EBITDA was $256 million versus consensus EBITDA of just under $240 million. This performance was mostly due to better-than-expected utilization and lower-than-expected drilling and overhead expenses. Stephen will go into greater detail on each of these items later in the call.
We had our best safety performance to date in the quarter, which continues our trend of improved safety performance over the last 3 years. I'd like to take this opportunity to both thank and congratulate all of our employees and especially our offshore crews on this fantastic achievement. Our uptime performance was also impressive with approximately 1% operational downtime for our entire fleet, including nearly 0 downtime for our drillships. We believe our focus on safety, reliability and efficiency are key to securing incremental backlog.
We remain focused on cost control. Compared to the same quarter last year, we have systematically lowered our direct operating costs by 18%. As a backdrop to that reduction, during the same period our revenue producing days increased by about 29% with deepwater and decreased about 19% for our jack-up fleet. This means that less than half of the cost savings are attributable to idling or cold stacking of rigs. In the same manner, comparing the second quarter of 2015 to the latest quarter, SG&A cost decreased by approximately 16% due to lower labor costs, largely due to labor force reductions and lower share-based compensation.
During the quarter, Rowan's executive management team and Board of Directors agreed to reduce executive compensation by 10% for at least a year. We took this step to show visible leadership to our workforce and further reduce costs in these tough times.
While we are pleased with our ability to reduce costs, we remain absolutely focused on safe, reliable and efficient operations. We will not reduce necessary spending on training or maintenance, and we continuously communicate this message to our crews and rig management.
Turning to our marketing effort. Mark will go into greater detail, but I'd like to comment on a few highlights for the quarter. As mentioned in previous quarters, we have been in blend-and-extend conversations with numerous customers and executed our first blend-and-extend contract extension for the Rowan Resolute this quarter. We also extended a jack-up contract in Norway and added significant new contract term to another jack-up in the United Kingdom. While I'm mindful of the challenges ahead to secure a new contract for the Rowan Relentless, I'm quite pleased of our ability to add this crucial backlog at this point in the cycle.
As you are already aware and echoing remarks made last quarter, the offshore drilling market continues to be severely challenged with uncertain timing of a recovery. Until a more substantial and sustained recovery in commodity prices occurs, we expect our customers to continue delaying their drilling plans. Even after healthy drilling demand levels return, the industry will likely still have significant rig oversupply. The market will need attrition of older rigs before we see improved utilization and pricing. Nevertheless, Rowan is prepared to weather the tough times ahead however long they last.
Finally, as you might expect, optimal capital allocation remains a primary focus for us. We further improved our balance sheet during the quarter by the early retirement of some of our long-term debt while continuing to grow our cash balance to over $760 million. With a $1.5 billion revolver that remains undrawn, our liquidity position is robust and is expected to remain so. We continue to look for opportunities to improve our fleet while asset prices are at low levels.
Now for a look at the market where Rowan competes, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

As we reach midyear 2016, we appreciate the improvements in commodity price from the beginning of the year, but our focus turns to the anticipation of where those prices will range during the budget season, which will heavily impact drilling activity levels for 2017. While we are encouraged by our customers' ability to sanction programs at lower commodity price levels and the resulting possibility of improved utilization, we remain prepared for an extended downturn.
Exhibiting that preparedness and willingness to partner with our customers through this trough cycle, we are pleased to announce our blend-and-extend agreement with Anadarko on the Rowan Resolute. Starting July 1, the day rate was lowered to $180,000 per day for an estimated 210 days. In exchange for the day rate reduction, Anadarko agreed to extend the contract past the primary term by 1.3 days for every day of reduced rate. Currently, we estimate an extension to August 2018 or 273 days at $580,000 a day. This is a win-win agreement for Anadarko and Rowan as we were able to help them with short-term cost savings while adding additional term that helpfully bridges us to a more favorable market environment.
The Rowan Renaissance and Rowan Reliance continue their contracts with Repsol and Cobalt, respectively. And we are actively tendering the Rowan Relentless, which is currently warm stacked in Curacao following the contract cancellation from Freeport-McMoRan earlier this quarter.
Now turning to the jack-up market. We continue to deliver contract commitments despite the arduous environment our industry is currently facing. In the second quarter, we added approximately 800 days of backlog to the jack-up fleet with the Ralph Coffman work in Suriname, the Lundin blend-and-extend option on the Rowan Viking and the Gilbert Rowe contract extension with Saudi Aramco through the end of 2016. Additionally, we are pleased to announce that we have extended the contract on the Gorilla V with Total in the North Sea for approximately 8 months plus an option period. We appreciate our long-standing relationship with Total and look forward to our continued operations.
We are relentlessly pursuing contracts for idle jack-ups by actively tendering worldwide and creatively approaching all opportunities though projects with operations commencing in 2016 are scarce. Market utilization has slipped to 72% and jack-up contract roll-off appears greater than tender activity for the next 6 months. We believe our high-spec jack-ups are well positioned to secure contracts when work is available, albeit at pressured day rates. Historically, the more capable rigs are able to maintain higher utilization through downturns, and we expect similar outcomes in this trough cycle.
Jack-up demand remains weak worldwide with the exception of the Middle East, the only region with a currently forecasted demand increase over the next 2 years. As a reminder, we have the J.P. Bussell, the EXL I and the EXL IV currently positioned and available for work in the region.
Competition for future projects, both in the jack-up and ultra-deepwater markets is fierce, but we are steadfast in our efforts, confident in our fleet and backed by an outstanding workforce that delivers safe and reliable operations. We will survive this downturn, and we are poised to emerge a stronger company that will continue its more than 93-year history of excellence.
This concludes my remarks this morning, and I will now turn the call over to Stephen."

Our exceptional financial performance continued in the second quarter despite strong market-related headwinds. Even when excluding the positive impact of the contract termination for the Relentless on our second quarter results, our adjusted EBITDA margin of 52% was nearly on par with the record margin that we generated in the first quarter. We further strengthened our balance sheet by generating $166 million of cash even after retiring $31 million of debt.
Despite these strong results and further reductions in our cost guidance, which we will outline on this call, we expect our second half results will weaken significantly as the cost reductions will no longer keep pace with the expected decline in revenue in the third and fourth quarters.
Turning to our financial results. We generated earnings of $1.72 per share or $0.75 per share when excluding the positive impact of the contract termination settlement for the Relentless and a small gain on debt retirement, which together added about $0.96 to our earnings per share. As previously announced, our customer agreed to pay us $215 million to settle all outstanding receivable balances and terminate the contract, which resulted in our recognition of $120 million of incremental revenues during the quarter. Separately, we also recognized a gain of $1.8 million on the early extinguishment of long-term debt. Excluding these items, our adjusted EBITDA of $256 million was only $10 million less than the first quarter level. However, second quarter adjusted earnings per share declined to $0.75 from $0.98 in the first quarter primarily due to increased income tax expense.
Our ability to post strong results in the face of declining average jack-up day rates stem from reduced idle time for the jack-up fleet, high uptime for rigs under contract and sustained cost control measures. Second quarter revenue was $485 million, excluding rebillable items and the effect of the Relentless contract settlement. The $10 million decline from the first quarter level primarily resulted from the impact of a blend-and-extend agreement related to the Rowan Viking, which we believe will benefit the company in future quarters, partially offset by 108 additional operating days for the jack-up fleet primarily in the Middle East and Suriname. These same factors caused a 10% reduction in average jack-up day rates. The average day rate on our drillships remained within 1% of first quarter levels.
For the jack-up fleet, our out-of-service time was exceptional at only 3% of available rig days. Our idle time, which reflects periods when a rig is not contracted but is available to work, improved to 22% of available days versus 24% in the prior quarter.
Moving on to expenses. Second quarter operating expenses, excluding rebills, were essentially flat at $200 million. We are reducing our full year cost guidance by $30 million to $795 million to $805 million. Reductions in operating cost on the Relentless are expected to account for about half these savings. Operating cost in the third quarter of 2016 are expected to approximate $205 million, slightly higher than the second quarter level, due primarily to the timing of repair and maintenance activities for the jack-up fleet. As a reminder, this excludes rebillable items, which are offset by an equal increase in revenue.
Our guidance reflects the continued realization of widespread cost control measures, including the reduction of various support costs, increased efficiency in certain activities and the centralization of a number of functions.
Our second quarter SG&A expense was approximately $26 million, which was lower than our guidance and slightly lower than the expense incurred in the first quarter. We are holding our full year SG&A expense estimate flat at $105 million to $110 million, but still 5% to 10% below the 2015 level. We expect third quarter SG&A expense to approximate $29 million.
Our second quarter depreciation expense totaled $100 million, in line with our guidance and slightly higher than the prior quarter. We are narrowing our range for full year depreciation expense guidance to the low end of our previous range at $400 million to $405 million, with approximately $102 million expected in the third quarter.
Gross interest expense, which was $38 million during the second quarter, was also in line with our guidance and slightly lower than the prior quarter as we realize the benefit of our debt retirement during the first half of 2016, which totaled nearly $50 million. We expect to incur gross interest expense of approximately $155 million for the full year.
Our second quarter effective tax rate was 9.5%, at the high end of our previous guidance of upper single digits. We still estimate that our full year effective tax rate will be in the mid-single digits. However, since we operate in numerous jurisdictions around the world, including some with deemed profit regimes, where taxes are based on revenue, and as our results deteriorate toward breakeven or even to a loss, we will likely see overall quarterly income tax rates which are volatile and are not meaningful as the expense or benefit may still be a very small dollar amount.
With respect to our balance sheet and cash flow, we have continued to exercise discipline as reflected in our capital spend of only $31 million, essentially in line with our first quarter spend of $33 million. We are reducing our full year CapEx guidance by $25 million to a new range of $145 million to $155 million.
Cash generated during the second quarter was $166 million, exceeding the first quarter level of $111 million despite the aforementioned debt retirement and a build in working capital. The working capital increase is largely due to the remaining Freeport-McMoRan receivable of $130 million at June 30, $15 million of which has already been received, with the remaining amount payable in late August.
As was the case last quarter, our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, which doesn't mature until January 2021, remains undrawn but available.
In closing, once again our operations personnel continued to deliver exceptional performance for our customers, our marketing group yet again secured meaningful new work for both our jack-ups and drillships, and the company operated in an efficient and cost-effective manner, which is reflected in our solid second quarter financial results.
However, as good as we feel about the company's performance, the recent pullback in crude oil prices reminds us all that as an industry we are not out of the woods in relation to the severe downturn. While we have strong conviction that offshore demand will recover as it remains a vital and meaningful source of oil and gas supply, we remain concerned about the timing of a recovery in deepwater drilling and the supply overhang of offshore rigs in general, which further dampens our outlook.
Looking forward at the tough road ahead, you should expect our strong capital discipline to continue, our cost reduction efforts to remain as focused as ever and our commitment to our shareholders and to maintain a strong credit profile to continue unabated.
With that, we're now prepared to open the call for questions. Operator?"

Obviously, they're not happy with the recent pullback in oil prices. But right now, as I mentioned, we're seeing some demand in '17 for drillships. A lot of the companies haven't really had an exploration program until -- since the first half of '14. So I think a lot of the operators in deepwater are focused on some of that. There are some lease situations on an operator-by-operator basis that they have some demand there. But for the most part, it's kind of a mixed bag, Jud. Some of the operators that have a lot of backlog to run on deepwater rigs are going to remain flat. Other operators that were looking out into the future, what they have in '17 and '18 are showing an increase in demand. So it's -- there's no really set answer. It's kind of on a regional basis and also on a customer-by-customer basis. On the jack-up side, as I mentioned, we are seeing some demand for -- in some areas for multiyear contracts, Jud. West Africa and the Middle East, South America, we're seeing some early demand in Mexico there from U.S. companies. But we're following everything. We believe we'll get some extensions in the North Sea. If we don't, we'll pull those rigs out of the North Sea and get creative there. But to your question, I do think there's some demand out there. It's just a question of where oil prices are going to wind up in that critical window of October through December of fourth quarter when these management teams go and try to get their budgets approved with their boards."

We had a great second quarter of 2016 in the face of difficult industry conditions. We had earnings of $1.72 per share in the quarter. Excluding the effects of the Rowan Relentless contract termination and our early retirement of debt, our earnings would have been $0.75 per share, still above consensus estimates of $0.72 per share. Our estimated EBITDA was $256 million versus consensus EBITDA of just under $240 million. This performance was mostly due to better-than-expected utilization and lower-than-expected drilling and overhead expenses. Stephen will go into greater detail on each of these items later in the call.
We had our best safety performance to date in the quarter, which continues our trend of improved safety performance over the last 3 years. I'd like to take this opportunity to both thank and congratulate all of our employees and especially our offshore crews on this fantastic achievement. Our uptime performance was also impressive with approximately 1% operational downtime for our entire fleet, including nearly 0 downtime for our drillships. We believe our focus on safety, reliability and efficiency are key to securing incremental backlog.
We remain focused on cost control. Compared to the same quarter last year, we have systematically lowered our direct operating costs by 18%. As a backdrop to that reduction, during the same period our revenue producing days increased by about 29% for deepwater and decreased about 19% for our jack-up fleet. This means that less than half of the cost savings are attributable to idling or cold stacking of rigs. In the same manner, comparing the second quarter of 2015 to the latest quarter, SG&A cost decreased by approximately 16% due to lower labor costs, largely due to labor force reductions and lower share-based compensation.
During the quarter, Rowan's executive management team and Board of Directors agreed to reduce executive compensation by 10% for at least a year. We took this step to show visible leadership to our workforce and further reduce costs in these tough times.
While we are pleased with our ability to reduce costs, we remain absolutely focused on safe, reliable and efficient operations. We will not reduce necessary spending on training or maintenance, and we continuously communicate this message to our crews and rig management.
Turning to our marketing efforts. Mark will go into greater detail, but I'd like to comment on a few highlights for the quarter. As mentioned in previous quarters, we have been in blend-and-extend conversations with numerous customers and executed our first blend-and-extend contract extension for the Rowan Resolute this quarter. We also extended a jack-up contract in Norway and added significant new contract term to another jack-up in the United Kingdom. While I'm mindful of the challenges ahead to secure a new contract for the Rowan Relentless, I'm quite pleased of our ability to add this crucial backlog at this point in the cycle.
As you are already aware, and echoing remarks made last quarter, the offshore drilling market continues to be severely challenged with uncertain timing of a recovery. Until a more substantial and sustained recovery in commodity prices occurs, we expect our customers to continue delaying their drilling plans. Even after healthy drilling demand levels return, the industry will likely still have significant rig oversupply. The market will need attrition of older rigs before we see improved utilization and pricing. Nevertheless, Rowan is prepared to weather the tough times ahead however long they last.
Finally, as you might expect, optimum capital allocation remains a primary focus for us. We further improved our balance sheet during the quarter by the early retirement of some of our long-term debt while continuing to grow our cash balance to over $760 million. With a $1.5 billion revolver that remains undrawn, our liquidity position is robust and is expected to remain so. We continue to look for opportunities to improve our fleet while asset prices are at low levels.
Now for a look at the market where Rowan competes, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

As we reach midyear 2016, we appreciate the improvements in commodity price from the beginning of the year, but our focus turns to the anticipation of where those prices will range during the budget season, which will heavily impact drilling activity levels for 2017. While we are encouraged by our customers' ability to sanction programs at lower commodity price levels and the resulting possibility of improved utilization, we remain prepared for an extended downturn.
Exhibiting that preparedness and willingness to partner with our customers through this trough cycle, we are pleased to announce our blend-and-extend agreement with Anadarko on the Rowan Resolute. Starting July 1, the day rate was lowered to $180,000 per day for an estimated 210 days. In exchange for the day rate reduction, Anadarko agreed to extend the contract past the primary term by 1.3 days for every day of reduced rate. Currently, we estimate an extension to August 2018 or 273 days at $580,000 a day. This is a win-win agreement for Anadarko and Rowan as we were able to help them with short-term cost savings while adding additional term that helpfully bridges us to a more favorable market environment.
The Rowan Renaissance and Rowan Reliance continue their contracts with Repsol and Cobalt, respectively. And we are actively tendering the Rowan Relentless, which is currently warm stacked in Curacao following the contract cancellation from Freeport-McMoRan earlier this quarter.
Now turning to the jack-up market. We continue to deliver contract commitments despite the arduous environment our industry is currently facing. In the second quarter, we added approximately 800 days of backlog to the jack-up fleet with the Ralph Coffman work in Suriname, the Lundin blend-and-extend option on the Rowan Viking and the Gilbert Rowe contract extension with Saudi Aramco through the end of 2016. Additionally, we are pleased to announce that we have extended the contract on the Gorilla V with Total in the North Sea for approximately 8 months plus an option period. We appreciate our long-standing relationship with Total and look forward to our continued operations.
We are relentlessly pursuing contracts for idle jack-ups by actively tendering worldwide and creatively approaching all opportunities, but projects with operations commencing in 2016 are scarce. Market utilization has slipped to 72% and jack-up contract roll-off appears greater than tender activity for the next 6 months. We believe our high-spec jack-ups are well positioned to secure contracts when work is available, albeit at pressured day rates. Historically, the more capable rigs are able to maintain higher utilization through downturns, and we expect similar outcomes in this trough cycle.
Jack-up demand remains weak worldwide with the exception of the Middle East, the only region with a currently forecasted demand increase over the next 2 years. As a reminder, we have the J.P. Bussell, EXL I and EXL IV currently positioned and available for work in the region.
Competition for future projects, both in the jack-up and ultra-deepwater markets is fierce, but we are steadfast in our efforts, confident in our fleet and backed by an outstanding workforce that delivers safe and reliable operations. We will survive this downturn, and we are poised to emerge a stronger company that will continue its more than 93-year history of excellence.
This concludes my remarks this morning, and I will now turn the call over to Stephen."

Our exceptional financial performance continued in the second quarter despite strong market-related headwinds. Even when excluding the positive impact of the contract termination for the Relentless on our second quarter results, our adjusted EBITDA margin of 52% was nearly on par with the record margin that we generated in the first quarter. We further strengthened our balance sheet by generating $166 million of cash even after retiring $31 million of debt.
Despite these strong results and further reductions in our cost guidance, which we will outline on this call, we expect our second half results will weaken significantly as the cost reductions will no longer keep pace with the expected decline in revenue in the third and fourth quarters.
Turning to our financial results. We generated earnings of $1.72 per share or $0.75 per share when excluding the positive impact of the contract termination settlement for the Relentless and a small gain on debt retirement, which together added about $0.96 to our earnings per share. As previously announced, our customer agreed to pay us $215 million to settle all outstanding receivable balances and terminate the contract, which resulted in our recognition of $120 million of incremental revenues during the quarter. Separately, we also recognized a gain of $1.8 million on the early extinguishment of long-term debt. Excluding these items, our adjusted EBITDA of $256 million was only $10 million less than the first quarter level. However, second quarter adjusted earnings per share declined to $0.75 from $0.98 in the first quarter primarily due to increased income tax expense.
Our ability to post strong results in the face of declining average jack-up day rates stemmed from reduced idle time for the jack-up fleet, high uptime for rigs under contract and sustained cost control measures. Second quarter revenue was $485 million, excluding rebillable items and the effect of the Relentless contract settlement. The $10 million decline from the first quarter level primarily resulted from the impact of a blend-and-extend agreement related to the Rowan Viking, which we believe will benefit the company in future quarters, partially offset by 108 additional operating days for the jack-up fleet primarily in the Middle East and Suriname. These same factors caused a 10% reduction in average jack-up day rates. The average day rate on our drillships remained within 1% of first quarter levels.
For the jack-up fleet, our out-of-service time was exceptional at only 3% of available rig days. Our idle time, which reflects periods when a rig is not contracted but is available to work, improved to 22% of available days versus 24% in the prior quarter.
Moving on to expenses. Second quarter operating expenses, excluding rebills, were essentially flat at $200 million. We are reducing our full year cost guidance by $30 million to $795 million to $805 million. Reductions in operating cost on the Relentless are expected to account for about half these savings. Operating costs in the third quarter of 2016 are expected to approximate $205 million, slightly higher than the second quarter level, due primarily to the timing of repair and maintenance activities for the jack-up fleet. As a reminder, this excludes rebillable items, which are offset by an equal increase in revenue.
Our guidance reflects the continued realization of widespread cost control measures, including the reduction of various support costs, increased efficiency in certain activities and the centralization of a number of functions.
Our second quarter SG&A expense was approximately $26 million, which was lower than our guidance and slightly lower than the expense incurred in the first quarter. We are holding our full year SG&A expense estimate flat at $105 million to $110 million, but still 5% to 10% below the 2015 level. We expect third quarter SG&A expense to approximate $29 million.
Our second quarter depreciation expense totaled $100 million, in line with our guidance and slightly higher than the prior quarter. We are narrowing our range for full year depreciation expense guidance to the low end of our previous range at $400 million to $405 million, with approximately $102 million expected in the third quarter.
Gross interest expense, which was $38 million during the second quarter, was also in line with our guidance and slightly lower than the prior quarter as we realize the benefit of our debt retirement during the first half of 2016, which totaled nearly $50 million. We expect to incur gross interest expense of approximately $155 million for the full year.
Our second quarter effective tax rate was 9.5%, at the high end of our previous guidance of upper single digits. We still estimate that our full year effective tax rate will be in the mid-single digits. However, as we operate in numerous jurisdictions around the world, including some with deemed profit regimes, where taxes are based on revenue, and as our results deteriorate toward breakeven or even to a loss, we will likely see overall quarterly income tax rates which are volatile and are not meaningful as the expense or benefit may still be a very small dollar amount.
With respect to our balance sheet and cash flow, we have continued to exercise discipline as reflected in our capital spend of only $31 million, essentially in line with our first quarter spend of $33 million. We are reducing our full year CapEx guidance by $25 million to a new range of $145 million to $155 million.
Cash generated during the second quarter was $166 million, exceeding the first quarter level of $111 million despite the aforementioned debt retirement and a build in working capital. The working capital increase is largely due to the remaining Freeport-McMoRan receivable of $130 million at June 30, $15 million of which has already been received, with the remaining amount payable in late August.
As was the case last quarter, our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, which doesn't mature until January 2021, remains undrawn but available.
In closing, once again our operations personnel continued to deliver exceptional performance for our customers, our marketing group yet again secured meaningful new work for both our jack-ups and drillships, and the company operated in an efficient and cost-effective manner, which is reflected in our solid second quarter financial results.
However, as good as we feel about the company's performance, the recent pullback in crude oil prices reminds us all that as an industry we are not out of the woods in relation to this severe downturn. While we have strong conviction that offshore demand will recover as it remains a vital and meaningful source of oil and gas supply, we remain concerned about the timing of a recovery in deepwater drilling and the supply overhang of offshore rigs in general, which further dampens our outlook.
Looking forward at the tough road ahead, you should expect our strong capital discipline to continue, our cost reduction efforts to remain as focused as ever and our commitment to our shareholders and to maintain a strong credit profile to continue unabated.

August is always a very slow -- is a slower month generally. And then in September, we have the Eid holiday.

So I do believe -- and obviously, there's been a lot of changes over time with tax rates, Robin, as you know as you talked about in your question, but I do believe there is a real desire there from the industry and from the regulation -- the regulator, the Oil and Gas Authority to really try and drive improvement in the activity there. So there's a will for sure. And I also think on the other side of the North Sea in the Norwegian continental shelf, there's a lot of work there and a lot of demand over time.

We had a great second quarter of 2016 in the face of difficult industry conditions. We had earnings of $1.72 per share in the quarter. Excluding the effects of the Rowan Relentless contract termination and our early retirement of debt, our earnings would have been $0.75 per share, still above consensus estimates of $0.72 per share. Our estimated EBITDA was $256 million versus consensus EBITDA of just under $240 million. This performance was mostly due to better-than-expected utilization and lower-than-expected drilling and overhead expenses. Stephen will go into greater detail on each of these items later in the call.
We had our best safety performance to date in the quarter, which continues our trend of improved safety performance over the last 3 years. I'd like to take this opportunity to both thank and congratulate all of our employees and especially our offshore crews on this fantastic achievement. Our uptime performance was also impressive with approximately 1% operational downtime for our entire fleet, including nearly 0 downtime for our drillships. We believe our focus on safety, reliability and efficiency are key to securing incremental backlog.
We remain focused on cost control. Compared to the same quarter last year, we have systematically lowered our direct operating costs by 18%. As a backdrop to that reduction, during the same period our revenue producing days increased by about 29% for deepwater and decreased about 19% for our jack-up fleet. This means that less than half of the cost savings are attributable to idling or cold stacking of rigs. In the same manner, comparing the second quarter of 2015 to the latest quarter, SG&A cost decreased by approximately 16% due to lower labor costs, largely due to labor force reductions and lower share-based compensation.
During the quarter, Rowan's executive management team and Board of Directors agreed to reduce executive compensation by 10% for at least a year. We took this step to show visible leadership to our workforce and further reduce costs in these tough times.
While we are pleased with our ability to reduce costs, we remain absolutely focused on safe, reliable and efficient operations. We will not reduce necessary spending on training or maintenance, and we continuously communicate this message to our crews and rig management.
Turning to our marketing efforts. Mark will go into greater detail, but I'd like to comment on a few highlights for the quarter. As mentioned in previous quarters, we have been in blend-and-extend conversations with numerous customers and executed our first blend-and-extend contract extension for the Rowan Resolute this quarter. We also extended a jack-up contract in Norway and added significant new contract term to another jack-up in the United Kingdom. While I'm mindful of the challenges ahead to secure a new contract for the Rowan Relentless, I'm quite pleased of our ability to add this crucial backlog at this point in the cycle.
As you are already aware, and echoing remarks made last quarter, the offshore drilling market continues to be severely challenged with uncertain timing of a recovery. Until a more substantial and sustained recovery in commodity prices occurs, we expect our customers to continue delaying their drilling plans. Even after healthy drilling demand levels return, the industry will likely still have significant rig oversupply. The market will need attrition of older rigs before we see improved utilization and pricing. Nevertheless, Rowan is prepared to weather the tough times ahead however long they last.
Finally, as you might expect, optimum capital allocation remains a primary focus for us. We further improved our balance sheet during the quarter by the early retirement of some of our long-term debt while continuing to grow our cash balance to over $760 million. With a $1.5 billion revolver that remains undrawn, our liquidity position is robust and is expected to remain so. We continue to look for opportunities to improve our fleet while asset prices are at low levels.
Now for a look at the market where Rowan competes, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

As we reach midyear 2016, we appreciate the improvements in commodity price from the beginning of the year, but our focus turns to the anticipation of where those prices will range during the budget season, which will heavily impact drilling activity levels for 2017. While we are encouraged by our customers' ability to sanction programs at lower commodity price levels and the resulting possibility of improved utilization, we remain prepared for an extended downturn.
Exhibiting that preparedness and willingness to partner with our customers through this trough cycle, we are pleased to announce our blend-and-extend agreement with Anadarko on the Rowan Resolute. Starting July 1, the day rate was lowered to $180,000 per day for an estimated 210 days. In exchange for the day rate reduction, Anadarko agreed to extend the contract past the primary term by 1.3 days for every day of reduced rate. Currently, we estimate an extension to August 2018 or 273 days at $580,000 a day. This is a win-win agreement for Anadarko and Rowan as we were able to help them with short-term cost savings while adding additional term that helpfully bridges us to a more favorable market environment.
The Rowan Renaissance and Rowan Reliance continue their contracts with Repsol and Cobalt, respectively. And we are actively tendering the Rowan Relentless, which is currently warm stacked in Curacao following the contract cancellation from Freeport-McMoRan earlier this quarter.
Now turning to the jack-up market. We continue to deliver contract commitments despite the arduous environment our industry is currently facing. In the second quarter, we added approximately 800 days of backlog to the jack-up fleet with the Ralph Coffman work in Suriname, the Lundin blend-and-extend option on the Rowan Viking and the Gilbert Rowe contract extension with Saudi Aramco through the end of 2016. Additionally, we are pleased to announce that we have extended the contract on the Gorilla V with Total in the North Sea for approximately 8 months plus an option period. We appreciate our long-standing relationship with Total and look forward to our continued operations.
We are relentlessly pursuing contracts for idle jack-ups by actively tendering worldwide and creatively approaching all opportunities, but projects with operations commencing in 2016 are scarce. Market utilization has slipped to 72% and jack-up contract roll-off appears greater than tender activity for the next 6 months. We believe our high-spec jack-ups are well positioned to secure contracts when work is available, albeit at pressured day rates. Historically, the more capable rigs are able to maintain higher utilization through downturns, and we expect similar outcomes in this trough cycle.
Jack-up demand remains weak worldwide with the exception of the Middle East, the only region with a currently forecasted demand increase over the next 2 years. As a reminder, we have the J.P. Bussell, EXL I and EXL IV currently positioned and available for work in the region.
Competition for future projects, both in the jack-up and ultra-deepwater markets is fierce, but we are steadfast in our efforts, confident in our fleet and backed by an outstanding workforce that delivers safe and reliable operations. We will survive this downturn, and we are poised to emerge a stronger company that will continue its more than 93-year history of excellence.
This concludes my remarks this morning, and I will now turn the call over to Stephen."

Our exceptional financial performance continued in the second quarter despite strong market-related headwinds. Even when excluding the positive impact of the contract termination for the Relentless on our second quarter results, our adjusted EBITDA margin of 52% was nearly on par with the record margin that we generated in the first quarter. We further strengthened our balance sheet by generating $166 million of cash even after retiring $31 million of debt.
Despite these strong results and further reductions in our cost guidance, which we will outline on this call, we expect our second half results will weaken significantly as the cost reductions will no longer keep pace with the expected decline in revenue in the third and fourth quarters.
Turning to our financial results. We generated earnings of $1.72 per share or $0.75 per share when excluding the positive impact of the contract termination settlement for the Relentless and a small gain on debt retirement, which together added about $0.96 to our earnings per share. As previously announced, our customer agreed to pay us $215 million to settle all outstanding receivable balances and terminate the contract, which resulted in our recognition of $120 million of incremental revenues during the quarter. Separately, we also recognized a gain of $1.8 million on the early extinguishment of long-term debt. Excluding these items, our adjusted EBITDA of $256 million was only $10 million less than the first quarter level. However, second quarter adjusted earnings per share declined to $0.75 from $0.98 in the first quarter primarily due to increased income tax expense.
Our ability to post strong results in the face of declining average jack-up day rates stemmed from reduced idle time for the jack-up fleet, high uptime for rigs under contract and sustained cost control measures. Second quarter revenue was $485 million, excluding rebillable items and the effect of the Relentless contract settlement. The $10 million decline from the first quarter level primarily resulted from the impact of a blend-and-extend agreement related to the Rowan Viking, which we believe will benefit the company in future quarters, partially offset by 108 additional operating days for the jack-up fleet primarily in the Middle East and Suriname. These same factors caused a 10% reduction in average jack-up day rates. The average day rate on our drillships remained within 1% of first quarter levels.
For the jack-up fleet, our out-of-service time was exceptional at only 3% of available rig days. Our idle time, which reflects periods when a rig is not contracted but is available to work, improved to 22% of available days versus 24% in the prior quarter.
Moving on to expenses. Second quarter operating expenses, excluding rebills, were essentially flat at $200 million. We are reducing our full year cost guidance by $30 million to $795 million to $805 million. Reductions in operating cost on the Relentless are expected to account for about half these savings. Operating costs in the third quarter of 2016 are expected to approximate $205 million, slightly higher than the second quarter level, due primarily to the timing of repair and maintenance activities for the jack-up fleet. As a reminder, this excludes rebillable items, which are offset by an equal increase in revenue.
Our guidance reflects the continued realization of widespread cost control measures, including the reduction of various support costs, increased efficiency in certain activities and the centralization of a number of functions.
Our second quarter SG&A expense was approximately $26 million, which was lower than our guidance and slightly lower than the expense incurred in the first quarter. We are holding our full year SG&A expense estimate flat at $105 million to $110 million, but still 5% to 10% below the 2015 level. We expect third quarter SG&A expense to approximate $29 million.
Our second quarter depreciation expense totaled $100 million, in line with our guidance and slightly higher than the prior quarter. We are narrowing our range for full year depreciation expense guidance to the low end of our previous range at $400 million to $405 million, with approximately $102 million expected in the third quarter.
Gross interest expense, which was $38 million during the second quarter, was also in line with our guidance and slightly lower than the prior quarter as we realize the benefit of our debt retirement during the first half of 2016, which totaled nearly $50 million. We expect to incur gross interest expense of approximately $155 million for the full year.
Our second quarter effective tax rate was 9.5%, at the high end of our previous guidance of upper single digits. We still estimate that our full year effective tax rate will be in the mid-single digits. However, as we operate in numerous jurisdictions around the world, including some with deemed profit regimes, where taxes are based on revenue, and as our results deteriorate toward breakeven or even to a loss, we will likely see overall quarterly income tax rates which are volatile and are not meaningful as the expense or benefit may still be a very small dollar amount.
With respect to our balance sheet and cash flow, we have continued to exercise discipline as reflected in our capital spend of only $31 million, essentially in line with our first quarter spend of $33 million. We are reducing our full year CapEx guidance by $25 million to a new range of $145 million to $155 million.
Cash generated during the second quarter was $166 million, exceeding the first quarter level of $111 million despite the aforementioned debt retirement and a build in working capital. The working capital increase is largely due to the remaining Freeport-McMoRan receivable of $130 million at June 30, $15 million of which has already been received, with the remaining amount payable in late August.
As was the case last quarter, our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, which doesn't mature until January 2021, remains undrawn but available.
In closing, once again our operations personnel continued to deliver exceptional performance for our customers, our marketing group yet again secured meaningful new work for both our jack-ups and drillships, and the company operated in an efficient and cost-effective manner, which is reflected in our solid second quarter financial results.
However, as good as we feel about the company's performance, the recent pullback in crude oil prices reminds us all that as an industry we are not out of the woods in relation to this severe downturn. While we have strong conviction that offshore demand will recover as it remains a vital and meaningful source of oil and gas supply, we remain concerned about the timing of a recovery in deepwater drilling and the supply overhang of offshore rigs in general, which further dampens our outlook.
Looking forward at the tough road ahead, you should expect our strong capital discipline to continue, our cost reduction efforts to remain as focused as ever and our commitment to our shareholders and to maintain a strong credit profile to continue unabated.

Welcome to our call, and thank you for your continued interest and investment in Rowan.In the face of continued difficult industry conditions, our third quarter 2016 exceeded our expectations with net income",686,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our call, and thank you for your continued interest and investment in Rowan.
In the face of continued difficult industry conditions, our third quarter 2016 exceeded our expectations with net income of $5.5 million or $0.04 per diluted share. Excluding the effects of a noncash asset impairment charge and a credit from a litigation-related matter, our adjusted net income was $38.4 million or $0.30 per diluted share. Our adjusted EBITDA was $168.7 million versus consensus of approximately $131 million. While revenues from both Deepwater and jack-up segments declined quarter-over-quarter, we had significantly lower-than-projected drilling and overhead expenses. Stephen will go into greater detail on each of these items later in the call.
As you are aware from our previous announcements, the Rowan Gorilla VI contract was terminated during the quarter, and we reached a settlement with Cobalt allowing for an early termination option of the Rowan Reliance. Although we are disappointed that these contracts will likely terminate early, we are pleased with the economic value that will be realized, especially given the difficult current market conditions. 
Moving on to our operational highlights. As you may have read in our press release this morning, our focus on continuous improvement resulted in another quarter of impressive safety and downtime performance. We had one of our safest quarters, and we achieved operational downtime of less than 2%. This trend of improved safety and reliability over last 3 [ph] years is reason to pause and congratulate our offshore crews. Our focus on operational execution will be paramount to securing future backlog additions. 
I'm also pleased with our cost-control efforts that have had a significant effect on our financial results. Though certain of our decreased operating expenses were attributable to decreased drilling activity, our SG&A expenses decreased approximately 10% quarter-over-quarter and approximately 21% compared to the third quarter of 2015. We have achieved these cost reductions while remaining focused on training of our crews and maintenance of our rigs. I have continuously reinforced to our management that while we must have strong control of our costs, we will not take shortcuts that reduce our operational integrity. Mark will go into greater detail, but I'd like to briefly comment on the market environment. 
Although premature to forecast a definitive rebound in the market, we are certainly encouraged by the positive recent upward direction of crude oil prices. This year marks the first time since the beginning of the downturn that commodity prices seem to be supported during our customers' budget cycle. However, 2017 still looks to be a conservative investment year for our customers, with many of the contract awards focused on projects near existing infrastructure. As approximately 2/3 of offshore production worldwide comes from shallow water, we hope that this bodes well for our high-specification jack-up fleet. 
Also, during the quarter, we agreed to sell the Rowan Gorilla II, which will be converted into a mobile offshore production unit. The offshore drilling market continues to be severely challenged with uncertain timing of a recovery. However, as previously noted, we are [indiscernible] by recent commodity price strengthening and encouraged by the continued retirements of less competitive drilling rigs. However, we believe that the full utilization and pricing can improve to healthy levels, additional rig retirements are required as well as a constructed and relatively stable commodity price environment. Though this may take some time, we are confident we will remain highly competitive, thanks to the strength of our balance sheet and our robust operational performance.
We will continue to focus on optimal capital allocation with over $1.2 billion in cash today and an unpacked revolver of $1.5 billion. This strong $2.7 billion liquidity exceeds our total outstanding debt. Our financial discipline continues to support our operational efforts even during this challenging period when our backlog is shrinking. This depressed market does provide significant opportunity, and we are reviewing all of our alternatives for strong returns on invested capital over the course of the eventual market recovery.
Now for a look at the markets where Rowan competes, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

It has been 2 years since the dramatic decline in commodity prices and the harsh realities of the current down cycle began to emerge. Now we are battling back toward recovery, and as Tom mentioned, we are hopeful that the recent stabilization of commodity prices will provide a sense of security for our customers. 
Although there is a large number of idle units and newbuilds that require contracts before utilization can turn around, we believe that drilling activity will increase both for jack-ups and floaters in the coming 12 to 18 months.
Based on tender activity and our discussions with customers, we believe that the overall jack-up market will improve at a faster rate than the floater market. As evidence of this progress, I am pleased to report 2 contract awards in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico since our last group status report. The Gorilla IV will be extended with [indiscernible] energy for 300 days at a day rate of $65,000 beginning in mid-December. This project will carry the contract out to October of 2017. 
Additionally, we signed a 90-day contract with EXL III at $55,000 per day, also estimated to commence in mid-December. These agreements will add approximately $25 million to our backlog.
We sincerely appreciate the ongoing business for Marina and look forward to the continuation of our long-standing relationship. 
Worldwide market of jack-up utilization is 72% [ph] since our last call down to 70%. While we anticipate that utilization numbers will fall into the 60s before rebounding, we are encouraged by our ongoing dialogue with customers and the recent uptick in tender activity for 2017. 
Even if the NP spending remains flat year-over-year, overall drilling costs are down, and many higher-priced contracts signed at the peak of the market are rolling off, resulting in an increase in the amount of available cash.
Jack-up programs are less expensive and quicker to initiate than Deepwater projects, which supports our belief that jack-up activity will strengthen in the coming months, especially in mature basins not requiring investment in new infrastructure.
Currently, we see several promising opportunities for jack-ups in the next 12 to 18 months. These opportunities are well-suited for our fleet and ultimately will result in an increase in demand of approximately 15 to 18 jack-ups. The Middle East continues to be one of the few regions where the forecasted increase in demand, and we're also seeing prospects in the North Sea, West Africa and Central and South America.
The recent reforms in Mexico have piqued the interest of international companies, and we are monitoring these developments for opportunities for Rowan's fleet. We are actively marketing our idle jack-ups and strategically and creatively tendering worldwide. We continue to believe that our high-spec jack-ups will be at the front of the line for available contracts.
Turning to the ultra-deepwater market. Currently 3 of our 4 drillships are contracted. However, as previously reported, we recently signed an amendment with Cobalt allowing for an early termination option at March 31, 2017, in exchange for $96 million. The Rowan Relentless is warm-stacked in U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and the Rowan Renaissance contract with Repsol will conclude in the second quarter of 2017.
We are aggressively marketing all 3 of these units, and there are 5 to 7 programs with commencement Windows in mid-2017 through the first half of 2018.
We are encouraged by the recent legislative reforms in Brazil and hope to see an improvement in deepwater opportunities there over the next 12 to 18 months. 
The Rowan Resolute remains on contract with Anadarko until at least September of 2018. Worldwide marketed ultra-deepwater utilization has sliped to 75%, and similar to our jack-up assumptions, we believe that utilization will decline prior before showing signs of improvement.
As customers begin to increase activity, we believe they will look to companies like Rowan who have a proven workforce, delivering outstanding operations, a solid financial position and a high-spec fleet of jack-ups and drillships ready to meet their demanding drilling requirements. The road to recovery will be strenuous, but we are well positioned for the remaining months of the trough of and poised for recovery of our industry.
This concludes my remarks this morning. I will now turn the call over to Stephen."
300794,403645731,1068346,"Rowan Companies plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. In addition to reviewing our third quarter 2016 operating results today, I'll provide you with updates on our costs and capital spending guidance for the remainder of 2016 and offer preliminary guidance for 201",1333,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. In addition to reviewing our third quarter 2016 operating results today, I'll provide you with updates on our costs and capital spending guidance for the remainder of 2016 and offer preliminary guidance for 2017. Following my comments, I'll open the call for questions and answers. 
Despite the arduous market environment, we have continued to improve our solid liquidity position and reduced costs at a greater rate than our expectations, further strengthening our competitive position within the industry.
With a current cash balance in excess of $1.2 billion and a $1.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility that extends into 2021, we remain well positioned to withstand the trough cycle. While we take some comfort in our runway, we are mindful of our eroding backlog and the challenges that lie ahead. 
Now for our financial results. Excluding $34 million in noncash asset impairment charges and a $1.4 million credit from a litigation-related matter, we generated earnings of $0.30 per share. Ongoing cost control, better-than-expected jack-up and drillship utilization levels and favorable drillship revenue per day contributed to our solid earnings as compared to expectations. However, earnings per share declined by $0.45 from the second quarter non-GAAP adjusted earnings, primarily due to declining Deepwater revenues. 
The Cobalt contract termination settlement had no impact on third quarter revenue, and the $96 million settlement will be recognized as revenue over multiple periods starting in the second quarter of 2017 as reported in our fleet status.
During the third quarter, we generated revenue of $375 million, excluding rebillable items, down approximately 23% from second quarter levels when adjusted for the Freeport-McMoRan settlement. The decline was driven by the Rowan Relentless being idle and the Rowan Resolute receiving a lower day rate as part of the blend-and-extend agreement with Anadarko, which should yield positive results in 2018. Additionally, our jack-up revenues declined by $25 million sequentially, primarily as a result of the Rowan Norway contract completion. 
We are pleased with our low level of operational downtime, which was less than 2% fleet-wide for the fifth consecutive quarter, below both our guidance of 2.5% for the jack-ups and 5% for our drillships. Notably, our drillships did not incur any downtime during the quarter. However, our idle days increased to nearly 27% of available days during the third quarter. Our out-of-service time for the jack-up fleet was approximately 4% of available rig days, slightly higher than the previous quarter, primarily due to planned repairs and inspections on the Bob Palmer, Gorilla VII and Joe Douglas, but it was lower than our expectations as the survey on the Bob Palmer commenced later than expected and will now have a larger impact on the fourth quarter.
Moving on to expenses. Third quarter operating expenses were $182 million, excluding rebills, an improvement of approximately $19 million from the second quarter level, due primarily to cost reductions on idle rigs and lower mobilization expenses. Continued cost-control efforts throughout the company also contributed to the improvement, though to a lesser extent. 
As a result of continued cost-control measures and increased efficiency, we now estimate our full year 2016 operating costs will approximate $775 million, a reduction of $20 million from our guidance provided last quarter.
Fourth quarter expenses are expected to approximate $190 million. As a reminder, this excludes rebillable items, which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenue. This modest increase from the third quarter level is primarily driven by our expectation of higher repair and maintenance expense on a number of our rigs, which are incurring out-of-service time during the fourth quarter.
SG&A expenses totaled $24 million for the third quarter, which was lower than the second quarter and our guidance as a result of favorable mark-to-market adjustment on incentive compensation, deferral of certain costs into the fourth quarter and widespread cost-control measures. We are reducing our full year SG&A guidance to slightly below $105 million with estimated fourth quarter expenses of approximately $26 million.
As we announced in September, we completed an asset impairment evaluation in the third quarter. As a result, we recorded a $34 million pretax charge related to 5 of our older jack-ups.
Our third quarter depreciation expense totaled $102 million, and we are refining our full year 2016 guidance to be slightly above $400 million. Interest expense was $39 million for the third quarter, and our full year guidance remains at approximately $155 million.
With respect to the income tax provision, we recognize a tax benefit of $12 million as the result of a change in our tax asset valuation allowance due to the gain reported in other comprehensive income on the change to our postretirement benefit plan. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the low to mid-single digits, but I will reiterate that our effective income tax rate may fluctuate significantly at low levels of nominal profit or loss, given the number of jurisdictions in which we operate. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Capital expenditures for the third quarter totaled less than $25 million, approximately $7 million below second quarter expenditures. We are reducing our full year CapEx guidance to $125 million to $130 million from $140 million to $150 million previously.
We generated $276 million in cash during the third quarter, which included the final payment by McMoRan and also the first payment by Cobalt of $45 million related to its early termination option as outlined in the 8-K in September. 
As I mentioned earlier, our liquidity is solid with an up cash on hand today to repay debt maturities through 2021 and the flexibility to participate in distressed asset purchases as we aim to improve our return on capital.
Although we have not yet completed our 2017 budget, I will now provide an update to the preliminary full year guidance that we provided in September. 
Our $2.2 billion backlog provides good visibility in the coming years. However, we realize the challenges that 2017 will bring with one drillship currently idle and 2 additional vessels approaching the end of their contracts.
While we anticipate reaching a bottom in demand for both jack-ups and floaters during 2017, we are aware of the excess capacity that the industry must work through before an increase in day rates will be achieved. 
Our 2017 operating expenses, excluding rebillable items, are expected to range from $650 million to $750 million. As part of these expenses, we anticipate our drillship warm-stacking costs will approximate $45,000 per day, following a ramp-down period of approximately 3 months from the time the ship goes idle. This warm-stacking cost represents a slight reduction from our previous guidance in excess of $50,000 per day. 
SG&A for 2017 is estimated to range from $90 million to $100 million, a 5% to 14% decrease from the expected 2016 range. Depreciation expense is expected to vary from $385 million to $395 million, and interest expense is expected to range from $145 million to $150 million in 2017. 
And finally, we estimate our maintenance capital expenditures will be less than $100 million, a reduction of more than 20% from current year levels, reflecting our strong ongoing focus on capital discipline. We will refine this 2017 guidance in our next earnings call after we have completed our annual budget. 
In closing, we are pleased with our performance across the organization during this cyclical downturn. We are cautiously optimistic that demand for offshore drilling services will reach a bottom during 2017 and begin to climb back for an improved supply and demand balance, but we recognize that it will take some time to reach that balance. In the meantime, we will continue to focus on areas that are within our control such as safety, operational performance, customer satisfaction and our cost structure. We continue to believe that we are well positioned to endure the challenges ahead as well as capitalize on the opportunities that may arise.
With that, we are now prepared to open the call for questions. Operator?"

I do think we will see some awards before the first half of '17, but how many, it's a little unclear right now. But I do think there's a lot of demand that will come out of that region. Certainly, with Total forming a joint venture with QP and Qatar, that's going to be a 3- to 5-rig tender. So there's a lot of things in the region that are multiple rigs.

So although those rigs are -- 2 of those rigs stacked right now, they are an asset, which are unique, and they are an asset, which is finished. And thankfully, a niche, which is heavy-duty ultra harsh environment. And so any market in the world that requires a big jack-up that can work all year around and a harsh environment in the world, there are very few rigs that can do that.

If you look at that market, if you look at the requirements, obviously, price comes more into play than if they actually require dual-stacked 1,250-ton rig. Operation performance in that market plays a much bigger role than it does maybe in a jack-up market, given the spread costs and the exposure that the operators have. Some of these contracts, they vary in term from a year plus. But I would always think that price is going to have some bearing. Certainly, the relationship with that operators that carry a lot of weight. As far as startups, yes, I would say that a lot of these, because there hasn't been much activity, a lot of things have already been worked internally from the oil companies. So you could possibly see a little quicker start in 6 months, but I would be [indiscernible] -- we've seen that historically probably. But with virtually no exploration programs since 2014, if you look at the ultra-deepwater market, a lot of the oil companies have maintained their staffs, and they've been working on these prospects. So I think it's possible to see some quicker startup than that. As far as award and commencement, like I said, I think you will see some of it mid-'17 onward. It's going to vary according to how they implement their budgets and how their final budgets come out. But just in discussions that we have had now, that's what we see.

I can give you some thoughts that you probably talk about that spreads as well. I would say that we are -- have a real focus on while maintaining safe, reliable and efficient operations, we have a real focus on trying to improve our returns on invested capital. And so we think about that and think about it a lot. And so we are -- when we think about capital allocation, Steven and I spent a bunch of time working through it together. And we look at everything, and we run multiple scenarios and we present those to the Board. And we have a very fulsome conversation every board meeting lasting several hours about capital allocation whatever choices are and how we improve our returns over the long term. So it's very important for us. And distressed assets is one way to do that, M&and A is one way to do that. I think Stephen provided during this not just last others but long enough to understand that when approaching M&A have to do it very carefully because a lot of value can be destroyed if you don't do it right. So we do distressed asset side, we do look at distressed assets a lot, and Chris Pitre, who heads up the IR, also has to do looking at corporate development. And he spends a lot of time thinking through the scenario about what distressed assets may look for us. I think what makes sense really 3 things. One is big jack-ups. We like the larger jack-ups. We're pointing less focus on smaller jack-ups, but the jack-ups, new jack-ups, big new jack-ups is of interest to us. Not only price but any means, but that is an area we're focused on. As we retire rigs like the Gorilla II, we want to replace those rigs. We don't feel like we have to get to 60 rigs or a number like that. What we need to do is improve our return on capital with small purchases. The second areas ultra-deepwater. And we think seventh generation assets are the way to go. We might consider an early sixth generation asset but will have to make absolute sense from within return on capital perspective. And that's why we passed on to read back, we know the reserve quite was. We sat and determined that we couldn't make the necessary affirm on that asset versus our other opportunities. The third area, which we're interested is partially environment floating rigs, complementing our focus on new jack-ups with the high-spec jack-up rigs. We like the harsh environment market. They're all obviously a lot less of those assets in the world. But we also think that the niche, which is something we compete in, but it's not obvious at this point how to get in that without paying over the odds for it. Those are the 3 that we're looking at. We spend a bunch of time think about this. And frankly, at this point, we haven't moved because the price keeps coming down. Now distressed assets is one way, including our returns, and we do look at others, particularly just one of several choices. Stephen, you want to comment on the debt?"

If it's a Super Gorilla work in a difficult area, obviously, they're going to be able to be more premium. And it depends on if it's going to drilling HPHT wells or just drilling some very benign wells in deepwater. So there are a lot of variables that go into day rate. But at the end of the day, I think the market is going to be very competitive from a pricing standpoint. I do think there are some -- there is some visible demand.

So our other shore-based cost is on top of that. Now of course, all that's included in our overall comp guidance. But in terms of the other levels by region, I'll just, I guess, highlight some of them briefly. The drillships are now in the high $130,000 range, which that stands significantly from where we were at the start of the downturn in the $170,000 range. Our costs in Trinidad are really pretty much in line with where they were previously in the mid-60s, mid-70s on a per-day basis. Norway, our costs are down significantly there in the mid- to high $100,000 range. That's down from about $160,000 at the peak. U.K., nice reduction in costs there as well, in the high-50s to low 60s. And those previously were in the mid- to high 80s. In the Middle East, really runs the game at something that's very small all the rigs in the region as well as one of our largest jack-up rigs, the Bob Palmer. So it's got a broader range there but it's really high 30s to low 60s today. And those are down quite a bit as well."

Welcome to our call, and thank you for your continued interest and investment in Rowan.
In the face of continued difficult industry conditions, our third quarter 2016 exceeded our expectations, with net income of $5.5 million or $0.04 per diluted share. Excluding the effects of a noncash asset impairment charge and a credit from the litigation-related matter, our adjusted net income was $38.4 million or $0.30 per diluted share. Our adjusted EBITDA was $168.7 million versus consensus of approximately $131 million. While revenues from both deepwater and jack-up segments declined quarter-over-quarter, we had significantly lower-than-projected drilling and overhead expenses. Stephen will go into greater detail on each of these items later in the call.
As you are aware from our previous announcements, the Rowan Gorilla VI contract was terminated during the quarter, and we reached a settlement with Cobalt allowing for an early termination option of the Rowan Reliance. Although we are disappointed that these contracts will likely terminate early, we are pleased with the economic value that will be realized, especially given the difficult current market conditions. 
Moving on to our operational highlights. As you may have read in our press release this morning, our focus on continuous improvement resulted in another quarter of impressive safety and downtime performance. We had one of our safest quarters, and we achieved operational downtime of less than 2%. This trend of improved safety and reliability over last few years is the reason to pause and congratulate our offshore crews. Our focus on operational execution will be paramount for securing future backlog additions. 
I'm also pleased with our cost-control efforts that have had a significant effect on our financial results. Though certain of our decreased operating expenses were attributable to decreased drilling activity, our SG&A expenses decreased approximately 10% quarter-over-quarter and approximately 21% compared to the third quarter of 2015. We have achieved these cost reductions while remaining focused on training of our crews and maintenance of our rigs. I have continuously reinforced to our management that while we must have strong control of our costs, we will not take shortcuts that reduce our operational integrity. Mark will go into greater detail, but I'd like to briefly comment on the market environment. 
Although premature to forecast a definitive rebound in the market, we are certainly encouraged by the positive recent upward direction of crude oil prices. This year marks the first time since the beginning of the downturn that commodity prices seem to be supported during our customers' budget cycle. However, 2017 still looks to be a conservative investment year for our customers, with many of the contract awards focused on projects near existing infrastructure. As approximately 2/3 of offshore production worldwide comes from shallow water, we hope that this bodes well for our high-specification jack-up fleet. 
Also, during the quarter, we agreed to sell the Rowan Gorilla II, which will be converted into a mobile offshore production unit. The offshore drilling market continues to be severely challenged with uncertain timing of a recovery. However, as previously noted, we are heartened by recent commodity price strengthening and encouraged by the continued retirements of less competitive drilling rigs. However, we believe that the full utilization on pricing can improve to healthy levels, additional rig retirements are required as well as a constructed and relatively stable commodity price environment. Though this may take some time, we are confident we will remain highly competitive, thanks to the strength of our balance sheet and our robust operational performance.
We will continue to focus on optimal capital allocation, with over $1.2 billion in cash today and an unpacked revolver of $1.5 billion. This strong $2.7 billion liquidity exceeds our total outstanding debt. Our financial discipline continues to support our operational efforts even during this challenging period when our backlog is shrinking. This depressed market does provide significant opportunity, and we are reviewing all of our alternatives for strong returns on invested capital over the course of the eventual market recovery.
Now for a look at the markets where Rowan competes, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

It has been 2 years since the dramatic decline in commodity prices and the harsh realities of the current down cycle began to emerge. Now, we are battling back towards recovery, and as Tom mentioned, we are hopeful that the recent stabilization of commodity prices will provide a sense of security for our customers. 
Although there is a large number of idle units and rebills that require contracts before utilization can turn around, we believe that drilling activity will increase, both for jack-ups and floaters in the coming 12 to 18 months.
Based on tender activity and our discussions with customers, we believe that the overall jack-up market will improve at a faster rate than the floater market. As evidence of this progress, I am pleased to report 2 contract awards in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico since our last fleet status report. The Gorilla IV will be extended with Arena Energy for 300 days, at a day rate of $65,000 beginning in mid-December. This project will carry the contract out to October of 2017. 
Additionally, Arena signed a 90-day contract with EXL III at $55,000 per day, also estimated to commence in mid-December. These agreements will add approximately $25 million to our backlog.
We sincerely appreciate the ongoing business from Arena and look forward to the continuation of our long-standing relationship. 
Worldwide market of jack-up utilization is 72% since our last call down to 70%. While we anticipate the utilization numbers will fall into the 60s before rebounding, we are encouraged by our ongoing dialogue with customers and the recent uptick in tender activity for 2017. 
Even if the NP spending remains flat year-over-year, overall drilling costs are down, and many higher-priced contracts signed at the peak of the market are rolling off, resulting in an increase in the amount of available cash.
Jack-up programs are less expensive and quicker to initiate than deepwater projects, which supports our belief that jack-up activity will strengthen in the coming months, especially in mature basins not requiring investment and new infrastructure.
Currently, we see several promising opportunities for jack-ups in the next 12 to 18 months. These opportunities are well suited for our fleet and ultimately, will result in an increase in demand of approximately 15 to 18 jack-ups. The Middle East continues to be one of the few regions, where the forecasted increase in demand, and we're also seeing prospects in the North Sea, West Africa and Central and South America.
The recent reforms in Mexico have piqued the interest of international companies, and we're monitoring these developments for opportunities for Rowan's fleet. We are actively marketing our idle jack-ups and strategically and creatively tendering worldwide. We continue to believe that our high-spec jack-ups will be at the front of the line for available contracts.
Turning to the ultra-deepwater market. Currently, 3 of our 4 drillships are contracted. However, as previously reported, we recently signed an amendment with Cobalt, allowing for an early termination option at March 31, 2017, in exchange for $96 million. The Rowan Relentless is warm stacked in U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and the Rowan Renaissance contract with Repsol will conclude in the second quarter of 2017.
We are aggressively marketing all 3 of these units, and there are 5 to 7 promising programs, with commencement windows in mid-2017 through the first half of 2018.
We are encouraged by the recent legislative reforms in Brazil and hope to see an improvement in deepwater opportunities there over the next 12 to 18 months. 
The Rowan Resolute remains on contract with Anadarko until at least September of 2018. Worldwide marketed ultra-deepwater utilization has slipped to 75% and similar to our jack-up assumptions, we believe that utilization will decline further before showing signs of improvement.
As customers begin to increase activity, we believe they will look to companies like Rowan, who have a proven workforce, delivering outstanding operations, a solid financial position and a high-spec fleet of jack-ups and drillships ready to meet their demanding drilling requirements. The road to recovery will be strenuous, but we are well positioned for the remaining months of the trough of and poised for the recovery of our industry.
This concludes my remarks this morning. I will now turn the call over to Stephen."

In addition to reviewing our third quarter 2016 operating results today, I'll provide you with updates on our costs and capital spending guidance for the remainder of 2016 and offer preliminary guidance for 201",1332,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. In addition to reviewing our third quarter 2016 operating results today, I'll provide you with updates on our costs and capital spending guidance for the remainder of 2016 and offer preliminary guidance for 2017. Following my comments, I'll open the call for questions and answers. 
Despite the arduous market environment, we have continued to improve our solid liquidity position and reduced costs at a greater rate than our expectations, further strengthening our competitive position within the industry.
With a current cash balance in excess of $1.2 billion and a $1.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility that extends into 2021, we remain well positioned to withstand the trough cycle. While we take some comfort in our runway, we are mindful of our eroding backlog and the challenges that lie ahead. 
Now for our financial results. Excluding $34 million in noncash asset impairment charges and a $1.4 million credit from a litigation-related matter, we generated earnings of $0.30 per share. Ongoing cost control, better-than-expected jack-up and drillship utilization levels and favorable drillship revenue per day contributed to our solid earnings as compared to expectations. However, earnings per share declined by $0.45 from the second quarter non-GAAP adjusted earnings, primarily due to declining deepwater revenues. 
The Cobalt contract termination settlement had no impact on third quarter revenue, and the $96 million settlement will be recognized as revenue over multiple periods, starting in the second quarter of 2017 as reported in our fleet status.
During the third quarter, we generated revenue of $375 million, excluding rebillable items, down approximately 23% from second quarter levels, when adjusted for the Freeport-McMoRan settlement. The decline was driven by the Rowan Relentless being idle and the Rowan Resolute receiving a lower day rate as part of the blend-and-extend agreement with Anadarko, which should yield positive results in 2018. Additionally, our jack-up revenues declined by $25 million sequentially, primarily as a result of the Rowan Norway contract completion. 
We are pleased with our low level of operational downtime, which was less than 2% fleet-wide for the fifth consecutive quarter, below both our guidance of 2.5% for the jack-ups and 5% for our drillships. Notably, our drillships did not incur any downtime during the quarter. However, our idle days increased to nearly 27% of available days during the third quarter. Our out-of-service time for the jack-up fleet was approximately 4% of available rig days, slightly higher than the previous quarter, primarily due to planned repairs and inspections on the Bob Palmer, Gorilla VII and Joe Douglas, but it was slower than our expectations as the survey on the Bob Palmer commenced later than expected and will now have a larger impact on the fourth quarter.
Moving on to expenses. Third quarter operating expenses were $182 million, excluding rebills, an improvement of approximately $19 million from the second quarter level, due primarily to cost reductions on idle rigs and lower mobilization expenses. Continued cost-control efforts throughout the company also contributed to the improvement, though to a lesser extent. 
As a result of continued cost-control measures and increased efficiency, we now estimate our full year 2016 operating costs will approximate $775 million, a reduction of $20 million from our guidance provided last quarter.
Fourth quarter expenses are expected to approximate $190 million. As a reminder, this excludes rebillable items, which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenue. This modest increase from the third quarter level is primarily driven by our expectation of higher repair and maintenance expense on a number of our rigs, which are incurring out-of-service time during the fourth quarter.
SG&A expenses totaled $24 million for the third quarter, which was lower than the second quarter and our guidance as a result of favorable mark-to-market adjustment on incentive compensations, deferral of certain costs into the fourth quarter and widespread cost-control measures. We are reducing our full year SG&A guidance to slightly below $105 million, with estimated fourth quarter expenses of approximately $26 million.
As we announced in September, we completed an asset impairment evaluation in the third quarter. As a result, we recorded a $34 million pretax charge related to 5 of our older jack-ups.
Our third quarter depreciation expense totaled $102 million, and we are refining our full year 2016 guidance to be slightly above $400 million. Interest expense was $39 million for the third quarter, and our full year guidance remains at approximately $155 million.
With respect to the income tax provision, we recognized a tax benefit of $12 million as the result of a change in our tax asset valuation allowance due to the gain reported in other comprehensive income on a change to our post-retirement benefit plan. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the low to mid-single digits, but I will reiterate that our effective income tax rate may fluctuate significantly at low levels of nominal profit or loss, given the number of jurisdictions in which we operate. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Capital expenditures for the third quarter totaled less than $25 million, approximately $7 million below second quarter expenditures. We are reducing our full year CapEx guidance to $125 million to $130 million from $140 million to $150 million previously.
We generated $276 million in cash during the third quarter, which included the final payment by McMoRan and also the first payment by Cobalt of $45 million related to its early termination option as outlined in the 8-K in September. 
As I mentioned earlier, our liquidity is solid, with enough cash on hand today, to repay debt maturities through 2021 and the flexibility to participate in distressed asset purchases as we aim to improve our return on capital.
Although we have not yet completed our 2017 budget, I will now provide an update to the preliminary full year guidance that we provided in September. 
Our $2.2 billion backlog provides good visibility in the coming years. However, we realized the challenges that 2017 will bring, with one drillship currently idle and 2 additional vessels approaching the end of their contracts.
While we anticipate reaching a bottom in demand for both jack-ups and floaters during 2017, we are aware of the excess capacity that the industry must work through before an increase in day rates will be achieved. 
Our 2017 operating expenses, excluding rebillable items, are expected to range from $650 million to $750 million. As part of these expenses, we anticipate our drillship warm-stacking costs will approximate $45,000 per day, following a ramp-down period of approximately 3 months from the time the ship goes idle. This warm-stacking costs represents a slight reduction from our previous guidance in excess of $50,000 per day. 
SG&A for 2017 is estimated to range from $90 million to $100 million, a 5% to 14% decrease from the expected 2016 range. Depreciation expense is expected to vary from $385 million to $395 million and interest expense is expected to range from $145 million to $150 million in 2017. 
And finally, we estimate our maintenance capital expenditures will be less than $100 million, a reduction of more than 20% from current year levels, reflecting our strong ongoing focus on capital discipline. We will refine this 2017 guidance in our next earnings call after we have completed our annual budget. 
In closing, we are pleased with our performance across the organization during this cyclical downturn. We are cautiously optimistic that demand for offshore drilling services will reach a bottom during 2017 and begin the climb back toward an improved supply and demand balance, but we recognize that it will take some time to reach that balance. In the meantime, we will continue to focus on areas that are within our control such as safety, operational performance, customer satisfaction and our cost structure. We continue to believe that we are well positioned to endure the challenges ahead as well as capitalize on the opportunities that may arise.
With that, we are now prepared to open the call for questions. Operator?"

First, we believe that the customers will take working rigs, warmer-stacked rigs, reorders and then cold-stack new rigs that are about to deliver and then cold-stack rigs in that order. So moving the rig into cold stack will basically guarantee, again, to take part later on in the cycle, which given that we have some of the best drillships in the world, it will be really, definitely make any sense to the cold-stacked that if they will be a month as things would have picked up then operators start taking up drillships. And secondly, it's very common that we want to remain -- obtain our capabilities, indeed, we only have 4 rigs. They are, as I said, again, some of the best in the world.

And so it is a market, which of all the jack-ups in the world, there are just a handful, as you know, a small percentage of that can operate in essentially North Sea through year round and also work in the Norwegian sector. So although those rigs are -- we have 2 of those rigs stacked in Dundee, right now, they are an asset, which are unique, and then they are an asset, which is position in the niche. And then frankly, a niche, which is the heavy-duty ultra-harsh environment. And so any market in the world that requires a big jack-up that can work all year round and any harsh environment in the world, there are very few rigs that can do that. So like Mark said, we are marking them in the North Sea. They're particularly well suited for Norway, but also they can work in any of the deeper shelf harsh environments worldwide."

There's one, possibly 2 that wouldn't require dual-stacked 1,250-ton ships, but we're obviously in discussions with that -- with those operators to try to convince them to use them. If you look at that market, if you look at the requirements, obviously, price comes more into play than if they actually require dual-stacked 1,250-ton rig. Operation performance in that market plays a much bigger role than it does maybe in a jack-up market, given the spread costs and the exposure that the operators have. Some of these contracts, they vary in term from a year plus. But I would always think that price is going to have some bearing. Certainly, the relationship with that operator is going to carry a lot of weight. As far as start-up, yes, I would say that a lot of these -- because there hasn't been much activity, a lot of things have already been worked internally from the oil companies. So you could possibly see a little quicker start in 6 months, but I would use that as a -- we've seen that historically probably. But with virtually, no exploration programs since 2014, if you look at the ultra-deepwater market, a lot of the oil companies have maintained a lot of their staffs, and they've been working on these prospects. So I think it's possible to see some quicker start-up than that. As far as award and commencement, like I said, I think you would see some of it mid-'17 onward. It's going to vary according to how they implement their budgets and how their final budgets come out. But just in discussions that we have had now, that's what we see.

I can give some thoughts and Stephen, you can probably talk about debt spreads as well. I would say that we are -- have a real focus on -- while maintaining safe, reliable and efficient operations, we have a real focus of trying to improve our returns on invested capital. And so we think about that and think about it a lot. And so we are -- when we think about capital allocation, Stephen and I spent a bunch of time working through it together. And we look at everything, and we run multiple scenarios, and we present those to the Board. And we have a very fulsome conversation, every board meeting, lasting several hours about capital allocation and what our choices are and how we improve our returns over the long term. So it is very important for us. And distressed assets is one way to do that and M&A is one way to do that. I think we -- Stephen provide the -- during this not as long as others done, but they're long enough to understand that when approaching M&A have to do it very carefully because a lot of value can be destroyed if you don't do it right. So we do -- on the distressed asset side, we do look at distressed assets a lot, and Chris Pitre, who heads up the IR, also has a dual role, looking at corporate developments. And he spends a lot of time thinking through different scenarios about what distressed assets make sense for us. I think and what makes sense, really 3 things. One is big jack-ups. We like the larger jack-ups. We are probably less focused on smaller jack-ups, but big jack-ups, new jack-ups -- big, new jack-ups is of interest to us. Not only price but any means, but that is an area where we're focused on. As we retire rigs like the Gorilla II, we want to replace those rigs. We don't feel like we have to get to 60 rigs or a number like that. What we need to do is improve our return on capital with small purchases. The second area is ultra-deepwater. And we think seventh-generation assets are the way to go. We might consider an early sixth-generation asset, but would have to make absolute sense from return on capital perspective. And that's why didn't -- we passed on the Cerrada. We knew what the reserve price was. And we sat in a room and determined that we couldn't make the necessary return on that asset versus our other opportunities. And the third area, which we're interested in is harsh environment floating rigs, complementing our focus on new jack-ups with a high-spec jack-up rig. We like the harsh environment market. They're all obviously a lot less of those assets in the world. But we also think that it's a niche, which we probably compete in, but it's not obvious at this point how to get in that without paying over the odds for it. So those are the 3 that we're looking at. We spend a bunch of time thinking about this. And frankly, at this point, we haven't moved because the prices keep coming down. Now distressed assets is one way of improving our returns, and we do look at others, particularly, just one of several choices. Stephen, you want to comment on the debt?"

And historically, that's been a fairly longer lead time-type market in terms of bringing contracts to fruition than maybe some of these other areas.

But that's -- to give you a definitive answer on day rates, I would just tell you that I think they're going to be -- just going to be -- remain very competitive in '17 for sure."

But in terms of the other levels by region, I'll just, I guess, highlight some of them briefly. The drillships are now in the high $130,000 range, in which -- that stands significantly from where we were at the start of the downturn in the $170,000 range. Our costs in Trinidad are really pretty much in line with where they were previously in the mid-$60s to mid-$70s on a per-day basis. Norway, our costs are down significantly. There are in the mid- to high $100,000 range. And that's down from about $160,000 at the peak. The U.K., nice reduction in costs there as well, in the high $50s to low $60s. And those previously were in the mid- to high $80s. In the Middle East, it really runs, again, at something that's very small, all the rigs in the region as well as one of our largest jack-up rigs, the Bob Palmer.

Welcome to our call, and thank you for your continued interest and investment in Rowan.
In the face of continued difficult industry conditions, our third quarter 2016 exceeded our expectations, with net income of $5.5 million or $0.04 per diluted share. Excluding the effects of a noncash asset impairment charge and a credit from the litigation-related matter, our adjusted net income was $38.4 million or $0.30 per diluted share. Our adjusted EBITDA was $168.7 million versus consensus of approximately $131 million. While revenues from both deepwater and jack-up segments declined quarter-over-quarter, we had significantly lower-than-projected drilling and overhead expenses. Stephen will go into greater detail on each of these items later in the call.
As you are aware from our previous announcements, the Rowan Gorilla VI contract was terminated during the quarter, and we reached a settlement with Cobalt allowing for an early termination option of the Rowan Reliance. Although we are disappointed that these contracts will likely terminate early, we are pleased with the economic value that will be realized, especially given the difficult current market conditions. 
Moving on to our operational highlights. As you may have read in our press release this morning, our focus on continuous improvement resulted in another quarter of impressive safety and downtime performance. We had one of our safest quarters, and we achieved operational downtime of less than 2%. This trend of improved safety and reliability over last few years is reason to pause and congratulate our offshore crews. Our focus on operational execution will be paramount for securing future backlog additions. 
I'm also pleased with our cost-control efforts that have had a significant effect on our financial results. Though certain of our decreased operating expenses were attributable to decreased drilling activity, our SG&A expenses decreased approximately 10% quarter-over-quarter and approximately 21% compared to the third quarter of 2015. We have achieved these cost reductions while remaining focused on training of our crews and maintenance of our rigs. I have continuously reinforced to our management that while we must have strong control of our costs, we will not take shortcuts that reduce our operational integrity. Mark will go into greater detail, but I'd like to briefly comment on the market environment. 
Although premature to forecast a definitive rebound in the market, we are certainly encouraged by the positive recent upward direction of crude oil prices. This year marks the first time since the beginning of the downturn that commodity prices seem to be supported during our customers' budget cycle. However, 2017 still looks to be a conservative investment year for our customers, with many of the contract awards focused on projects near existing infrastructure. As approximately 2/3 of offshore production worldwide comes from shallow water, we hope that this bodes well for our high-specification jack-up fleet. 
Also, during the quarter, we agreed to sell the Rowan Gorilla II, which will be converted into a mobile offshore production unit. The offshore drilling market continues to be severely challenged with uncertain timing of a recovery. However, as previously noted, we are heartened by recent commodity price strengthening and encouraged by the continued retirements of less competitive drilling rigs. However, we believe that the full utilization on pricing can improve the healthy levels, additional rig retirements are required as well as a constructed and relatively stable commodity price environment. Though this may take some time, we are confident we will remain highly competitive, thanks to the strength of our balance sheet and our robust operational performance.
We will continue to focus on optimal capital allocation, with over $1.2 billion in cash today and an unpacked revolver of $1.5 billion. This strong $2.7 billion liquidity exceeds our total outstanding debt. Our financial discipline continues to support our operational efforts even during this challenging period when our backlog is shrinking. This depressed market does provide significant opportunity, and we are reviewing all of our alternatives for strong returns on invested capital over the course of the eventual market recovery.
Now for a look at the markets where Rowan competes, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

It has been 2 years since the dramatic decline in commodity prices and the harsh realities of the current down cycle began to emerge.

It has been 2 years since the dramatic decline in commodity prices and the harsh realities of the current down cycle began to emerge. Now, we are battling back towards recovery, and as Tom mentioned, we are hopeful that the recent stabilization of commodity prices will provide a sense of security for our customers. 
Although there is a large number of idle units and rebills that require contracts before utilization can turn around, we believe that drilling activity will increase, both for jack-ups and floaters in the coming 12 to 18 months.
Based on tender activity and our discussions with customers, we believe that the overall jack-up market will improve at a faster rate than the floater market. As evidence of this progress, I am pleased to report 2 contract awards in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico since our last fleet status report. The Gorilla IV will be extended with Arena Energy for 300 days, at a day rate of $65,000 beginning in mid-December. This project will carry the contract out to October of 2017. 
Additionally, Arena signed a 90-day contract with EXL III at $55,000 per day, also estimated to commence in mid-December. These agreements will add approximately $25 million to our backlog.
We sincerely appreciate the ongoing business from Arena and look forward to the continuation of our long-standing relationship. 
Worldwide market of jack-up utilization is 72% since our last call down to 70%. While we anticipate the utilization numbers will fall into the 60s before rebounding, we are encouraged by our ongoing dialogue with customers and the recent uptick in tender activity for 2017. 
Even if the NP spending remains flat year-over-year, overall drilling costs are down, and many higher-priced contracts signed at the peak of the market are rolling off, resulting in an increase in the amount of available cash.
Jack-up programs are less expensive and quicker to initiate than deepwater projects, which supports our belief that jack-up activity will strengthen in the coming months, especially in mature basins not requiring investment and new infrastructure.
Currently, we see several promising opportunities for jack-ups in the next 12 to 18 months. These opportunities are well suited for our fleet and ultimately, will result in an increase in demand of approximately 15 to 18 jack-ups. The Middle East continues to be one of the few regions, where they forecasted increase in demand, and we're also seeing prospects in the North Sea, West Africa and Central and South America.
The recent reforms in Mexico have piqued the interest of international companies, and we're closely monitoring these developments for opportunities for Rowan's fleet. We are actively marketing our idle jack-ups and strategically and creatively tendering worldwide. We continue to believe that our high-spec jack-ups will be at the front of the line for available contracts.
Turning to the ultra-deepwater market. Currently, 3 of our 4 drillships are contracted. However, as previously reported, we recently signed an amendment with Cobalt, allowing for an early termination option at March 31, 2017, in exchange for $96 million. The Rowan Relentless is warm stacked in U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and the Rowan Renaissance contract with Repsol will conclude in the second quarter of 2017.
We are aggressively marketing all 3 of these units, and there are 5 to 7 promising programs, with commencement windows in mid-2017 through the first half of 2018.
We are encouraged by the recent legislative reforms in Brazil and hope to see an improvement in deepwater opportunities there over the next 12 to 18 months. 
The Rowan Resolute remains on contract with Anadarko until at least September of 2018. Worldwide marketed ultra-deepwater utilization has slipped to 75% and similar to our jack-up assumptions, we believe that utilization will decline further before showing signs of improvement.
As customers begin to increase activity, we believe they will look to companies like Rowan, who have a proven workforce, delivering outstanding operations, a solid financial position and a high-spec fleet of jack-ups and drillships ready to meet their demand in drilling requirements. The road to recovery will be strenuous, but we are well positioned for the remaining months of the trough of and poised for the recovery of our industry.
This concludes my remarks this morning. I will now turn the call over to Stephen."
300794,403645731,1069090,"Rowan Companies plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. In addition to reviewing our third quarter 2016 operating results today, I'll provide you with updates on our costs and capital spending guidance for the remainder of 2016 and offer preliminary guidance for 201",1332,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. In addition to reviewing our third quarter 2016 operating results today, I'll provide you with updates on our costs and capital spending guidance for the remainder of 2016 and offer preliminary guidance for 2017. Following my comments, I'll open the call for questions and answers. 
Despite the arduous market environment, we have continued to improve our solid liquidity position and reduced costs at a greater rate than our expectations, further strengthening our competitive position within the industry.
With a current cash balance in excess of $1.2 billion and a $1.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility that extends into 2021, we remain well positioned to withstand the trough cycle. While we take some comfort in our runway, we are mindful of our eroding backlog and the challenges that lie ahead. 
Now for our financial results. Excluding $34 million in noncash asset impairment charges and a $1.4 million credit from a litigation-related matter, we generated earnings of $0.30 per share. Ongoing cost control, better-than-expected jack-up and drillship utilization levels and favorable drillship revenue per day contributed to our solid earnings as compared to expectations. However, earnings per share declined by $0.45 from the second quarter non-GAAP adjusted earnings, primarily due to declining deepwater revenues. 
The Cobalt contract termination settlement had no impact on third quarter revenue, and the $96 million settlement will be recognized as revenue over multiple periods, starting in the second quarter of 2017 as reported in our fleet status.
During the third quarter, we generated revenue of $375 million, excluding rebillable items, down approximately 23% from second quarter levels, when adjusted for the Freeport-McMoRan settlement. The decline was driven by the Rowan Relentless being idle and the Rowan Resolute receiving a lower day rate as part of the blend-and-extend agreement with Anadarko, which should yield positive results in 2018. Additionally, our jack-up revenues declined by $25 million sequentially, primarily as a result of the Rowan Norway contract completion. 
We are pleased with our low level of operational downtime, which was less than 2% fleet-wide for the fifth consecutive quarter, below both our guidance of 2.5% for the jack-ups and 5% for our drillships. Notably, our drillships did not incur any downtime during the quarter. However, our idle days increased to nearly 27% of available days during the third quarter. Our out-of-service time for the jack-up fleet was approximately 4% of available rig days, slightly higher than the previous quarter, primarily due to planned repairs and inspections on the Bob Palmer, Gorilla VII and Joe Douglas, but it was lower than our expectations as the survey on the Bob Palmer commenced later than expected and will now have a larger impact on the fourth quarter.
Moving on to expenses. Third quarter operating expenses were $182 million, excluding rebills, an improvement of approximately $19 million from the second quarter level, due primarily to cost reductions on idle rigs and lower mobilization expenses. Continued cost-control efforts throughout the company also contributed to the improvement, though to a lesser extent. 
As a result of continued cost-control measures and increased efficiency, we now estimate our full year 2016 operating costs will approximate $775 million, a reduction of $20 million from our guidance provided last quarter.
Fourth quarter expenses are expected to approximate $190 million. As a reminder, this excludes rebillable items, which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenue. This modest increase from the third quarter level is primarily driven by our expectation of higher repair and maintenance expense on a number of our rigs, which are incurring out-of-service time during the fourth quarter.
SG&A expenses totaled $24 million for the third quarter, which was lower than the second quarter and our guidance as a result of favorable mark-to-market adjustment on incentive compensations, deferral of certain costs into the fourth quarter and widespread cost-control measures. We are reducing our full year SG&A guidance to slightly below $105 million, with estimated fourth quarter expenses of approximately $26 million.
As we announced in September, we completed an asset impairment evaluation in the third quarter. As a result, we recorded a $34 million pretax charge related to 5 of our older jack-ups.
Our third quarter depreciation expense totaled $102 million, and we are refining our full year 2016 guidance to be slightly above $400 million. Interest expense was $39 million for the third quarter, and our full year guidance remains at approximately $155 million.
With respect to the income tax provision, we recognized a tax benefit of $12 million as the result of a change in our tax asset valuation allowance due to the gain reported in other comprehensive income on a change to our post-retirement benefit plan. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the low to mid-single digits, but I will reiterate that our effective income tax rate may fluctuate significantly at low levels of nominal profit or loss, given the number of jurisdictions in which we operate. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Capital expenditures for the third quarter totaled less than $25 million, approximately $7 million below second quarter expenditures. We are reducing our full year CapEx guidance to $125 million to $130 million from $140 million to $150 million previously.
We generated $276 million in cash during the third quarter, which included the final payment by McMoRan and also the first payment by Cobalt of $45 million related to its early termination option as outlined in the 8-K in September. 
As I mentioned earlier, our liquidity is solid, with enough cash on hand today, to repay debt maturities through 2021 and the flexibility to participate in distressed asset purchases as we aim to improve our return on capital.
Although we have not yet completed our 2017 budget, I will now provide an update to the preliminary full year guidance that we provided in September. 
Our $2.2 billion backlog provides good visibility in the coming years. However, we realized the challenges that 2017 will bring, with one drillship currently idle and 2 additional vessels approaching the end of their contracts.
While we anticipate reaching a bottom in demand for both jack-ups and floaters during 2017, we are aware of the excess capacity that the industry must work through before an increase in day rates will be achieved. 
Our 2017 operating expenses, excluding rebillable items, are expected to range from $650 million to $750 million. As part of these expenses, we anticipate our drillship warm-stacking costs will approximate $45,000 per day, following a ramp-down period of approximately 3 months from the time the ship goes idle. This warm-stacking costs represents a slight reduction from our previous guidance in excess of $50,000 per day. 
SG&A for 2017 is estimated to range from $90 million to $100 million, a 5% to 14% decrease from the expected 2016 range. Depreciation expense is expected to vary from $385 million to $395 million and interest expense is expected to range from $145 million to $150 million in 2017. 
And finally, we estimate our maintenance capital expenditures will be less than $100 million, a reduction of more than 20% from current year level, reflecting our strong ongoing focus on capital discipline. We will refine this 2017 guidance in our next earnings call after we have completed our annual budget. 
In closing, we are pleased with our performance across the organization during this cyclical downturn. We are cautiously optimistic that demand for offshore drilling services will reach a bottom during 2017 and begin the climb back toward an improved supply and demand balance, but we recognize that it will take some time to reach that balance. In the meantime, we will continue to focus on areas that are within our control such as safety, operational performance, customer satisfaction and our cost structure. We continue to believe that we are well positioned to endure the challenges ahead as well as capitalize on the opportunities that may arise.
With that, we are now prepared to open the call for questions. Operator?"

So moving the rig into cold stack will basically guarantee, again, to take part later on in the cycle, which given that we have some of the best drillships in the world, it will be really, definitely make any sense to use the cold-stacked that if they will be a month as things would have picked up then operators start taking up drillships. And secondly, it's very common that we want to remain -- obtain our capabilities, indeed, we only have 4 rigs. They are, as I said, again, some of the best in the world.

So although those rigs are -- we have 2 of those rigs stacked in Dundee, right now, they are an asset, which are unique, and then they are an asset, which is position in the niche.

There's one, possibly 2 that wouldn't require dual-stacked 1,250-ton ships, but we're obviously in discussions with that -- with those operators to try to convince them to use them. If you look at that market, if you look at the requirements, obviously, price comes more into play than if they actually require dual-stacked 1,250-ton rig. Operation performance in that market plays a much bigger role than it does maybe in a jack-up market, given the spread costs and the exposure that the operators have. Some of these contracts, they vary in term from a year plus. But I would always think that price is going to have some bearing. Certainly, the relationship with that operator is going to carry a lot of weight. As far as start-up, yes, I would say that a lot of these -- because there hasn't been much activity, a lot of things have already been worked internally from the oil companies. So you could possibly see a little quicker start in 6 months, but I would use that as a -- we've seen that historically probably. But with virtually, no exploration programs since 2014, if you look at the ultra-deepwater market, a lot of the oil companies have maintained a lot of their staffs, and they've been working on these prospects. So I think it's possible to see some quicker start-up than that. As far as award and commencement, like I said, I think you would see some of it mid-'17 onward.

We determined that it was the right thing to do to move it back to the Gulf of Mexico. The operations group decided that and then had the rig moving in short order. We don't have to spend any money to do that. Over time, we will keep -- we are keeping up with special surveys. We are keeping up certifications.

I can give some thoughts and Stephen, you can probably talk about debt spreads as well. I would say that we are -- have a real focus on -- while maintaining safe, reliable and efficient operations, we have a real focus of trying to improve our returns on invested capital. And so we think about that and think about it a lot. And so we are -- when we think about capital allocation, Stephen and I spent a bunch of time working through it together. And we look at everything, and we run multiple scenarios, and we present those to the Board. And we have a very fulsome conversation, every board meeting, lasting several hours about capital allocation and what our choices are and how we improve our returns over the long term. So it is very important for us. And distressed assets is one way to do that and M&A is one way to do that. I think we -- Stephen provide the -- during this not as long as others done, but they're long enough to understand that when approaching M&A have to do it very carefully because a lot of value can be destroyed if you don't do it right. So we do -- on the distressed asset side, we do look at distressed assets a lot, and Chris Pitre, who heads up the IR, also has a dual role, looking at corporate developments. And he spends a lot of time thinking through different scenarios about what distressed assets make sense for us. I think what makes sense, really 3 things. One is big jack-ups. We like the larger jack-ups. We are probably less focused on smaller jack-ups, but big jack-ups, new jack-ups -- big, new jack-ups is of interest to us. Not only price but any means, but that is an area where we're focused on. As we retire rigs like the Gorilla II, we want to replace those rigs. We don't feel like we have to get to 60 rigs or a number like that. What we need to do is improve our return on capital with more purchases. The second area is ultra-deepwater. And we think seventh-generation assets are the way to go. We might consider an early sixth-generation asset, but would have to make absolute sense from return on capital perspective. And that's why didn't -- we passed on the Cerrada. We knew what the reserved price was. And we sat in a room and determined that we couldn't make the necessary return on that asset versus our other opportunities. And the third area, which we're interested in is harsh environment floating rigs, complementing our focus on new jack-ups with a high-spec jack-up rig. We like the harsh environment market. They're all obviously a lot less of those assets in the world. But we also think that it's a niche, which is hard to compete in, but it's not obvious at this point how to get in that without paying over the odds for it. So those are the 3 that we're looking at. We spend a bunch of time thinking about this. And frankly, at this point, we haven't moved because the prices keep coming down. Now distressed assets is one way of improving our returns, and we do look at others, particularly, just one of several choices. Stephen, you want to comment on the debt?"

And historically, that's been a fairly longer lead time-type market in terms of bringing contracts to fruition than maybe some of these other areas. And with oil price may be stuck in the high $40s or plus minus $50 now, I could just start to wonder if there's a real possibility that maybe those opportunities for next year, the window is narrowing and that we go another year without much of a turn there.

If it's a Super Gorilla working in a difficult area, obviously, you're going to be able to get a little more premium. And it depends on if it's going to be drilling HPHT wells or just drilling some very benign wells in deepwater. So there are a lot of variables that go into day rate.

The drillships are now in the high $130,000 range, in which -- that stands significantly from where we were at the start of the downturn in the $170,000 range. Our costs in Trinidad are really pretty much in line with where they were previously in the mid-$60s to mid-$70s on a per-day basis. Norway, our costs are down significantly. They're in the mid- to high $100,000 range. And that's down from about $160,000 at the peak.  In U.K., nice reduction in costs there as well, in the high $50s to low $60s. And those previously were in the mid- to high $80s. In the Middle East, it really runs, again, at something that's very small, all the rigs in the region as well as one of our largest jack-up rigs, the Bob Palmer.

Welcome to our call, and thank you for your continued interest and investment in Rowan.
In the face of continued difficult industry conditions, our third quarter 2016 exceeded our expectations, with net income of $5.5 million or $0.04 per diluted share. Excluding the effects of a noncash asset impairment charge and a credit from the litigation-related matter, our adjusted net income was $38.4 million or $0.30 per diluted share. Our adjusted EBITDA was $168.7 million versus consensus of approximately $131 million. While revenues from both deepwater and jack-up segments declined quarter-over-quarter, we had significantly lower-than-projected drilling and overhead expenses. Stephen will go into greater detail on each of these items later in the call.
As you are aware from our previous announcements, the Rowan Gorilla VI contract was terminated during the quarter, and we reached a settlement with Cobalt allowing for an early termination option of the Rowan Reliance. Although we are disappointed that these contracts will likely terminate early, we are pleased with the economic value that will be realized, especially given the difficult current market conditions. 
Moving on to our operational highlights. As you may have read in our press release this morning, our focus on continuous improvement resulted in another quarter of impressive safety and downtime performance. We had one of our safest quarters, and we achieved operational downtime of less than 2%. This trend of improved safety and reliability over last few years is reason to pause and congratulate our offshore crews. Our focus on operational execution will be paramount for securing future backlog additions. 
I'm also pleased with our cost-control efforts that have had a significant effect on our financial results. Though certain of our decreased operating expenses were attributable to decreased drilling activity, our SG&A expenses decreased approximately 10% quarter-over-quarter and approximately 21% compared to the third quarter of 2015. We have achieved these cost reductions while remaining focused on training of our crews and maintenance of our rigs. I have continuously reinforced to our management that while we must have strong control of our costs, we will not take shortcuts that reduce our operational integrity. Mark will go into greater detail, but I'd like to briefly comment on the market environment. 
Although premature to forecast a definitive rebound in the market, we are certainly encouraged by the positive recent upward direction of crude oil prices. This year marks the first time since the beginning of the downturn that commodity prices seem to be supported during our customers' budget cycle. However, 2017 still looks to be a conservative investment year for our customers, with many of the contract awards focused on projects near existing infrastructure. As approximately 2/3 of offshore production worldwide comes from shallow water, we hope that this bodes well for our high-specification jack-up fleet. 
Also, during the quarter, we agreed to sell the Rowan Gorilla II, which will be converted into a mobile offshore production unit. The offshore drilling market continues to be severely challenged with uncertain timing of a recovery. However, as previously noted, we are heartened by recent commodity price strengthening and encouraged by the continued retirements of less competitive drilling rigs. However, we believe that the full utilization on pricing can improve the healthy levels, additional rig retirements are required as well as a constructed and relatively stable commodity price environment. Though this may take some time, we are confident we will remain highly competitive, thanks to the strength of our balance sheet and our robust operational performance.
We will continue to focus on optimal capital allocation, with over $1.2 billion in cash today and an unpacked revolver of $1.5 billion. This strong $2.7 billion liquidity exceeds our total outstanding debt. Our financial discipline continues to support our operational efforts even during this challenging period when our backlog is shrinking. This depressed market does provide significant opportunity, and we are reviewing all of our alternatives for strong returns on invested capital over the course of the eventual market recovery.
Now for a look at the markets where Rowan competes, I'll hand the call over to Mark."

It has been 2 years since the dramatic decline in commodity prices and the harsh realities of the current down cycle began to emerge. Now, we are battling back towards recovery, and as Tom mentioned, we are hopeful",717,"Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. It has been 2 years since the dramatic decline in commodity prices and the harsh realities of the current down cycle began to emerge. Now, we are battling back towards recovery, and as Tom mentioned, we are hopeful that the recent stabilization of commodity prices will provide a sense of security for our customers. 
Although there is a large number of idle units and rebills that require contracts before utilization can turn around, we believe that drilling activity will increase, both for jack-ups and floaters in the coming 12 to 18 months.
Based on tender activity and our discussions with customers, we believe that the overall jack-up market will improve at a faster rate than the floater market. As evidence of this progress, I am pleased to report 2 contract awards in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico since our last fleet status report. The Gorilla IV will be extended with Arena Energy for 300 days, at a day rate of $65,000 beginning in mid-December. This project will carry the contract out to October of 2017. 
Additionally, Arena signed a 90-day contract with EXL III at $55,000 per day, also estimated to commence in mid-December. These agreements will add approximately $25 million to our backlog.
We sincerely appreciate the ongoing business from Arena and look forward to the continuation of our long-standing relationship. 
Worldwide market of jack-up utilization is 72% since our last call down to 70%. While we anticipate the utilization numbers will fall into the 60s before rebounding, we are encouraged by our ongoing dialogue with customers and the recent uptick in tender activity for 2017. 
Even if the NP spending remains flat year-over-year, overall drilling costs are down, and many higher-priced contracts signed at the peak of the market are rolling off, resulting in an increase in the amount of available cash.
Jack-up programs are less expensive and quicker to initiate than deepwater projects, which supports our belief that jack-up activity will strengthen in the coming months, especially in mature basins not requiring investment and new infrastructure.
Currently, we see several promising opportunities for jack-ups in the next 12 to 18 months. These opportunities are well suited for our fleet and ultimately, will result in an increase in demand of approximately 15 to 18 jack-ups. The Middle East continues to be one of the few regions, where they forecasted increase in demand, and we're also seeing prospects in the North Sea, West Africa and Central and South America.
The recent reforms in Mexico have piqued the interest of international companies, and we're closely monitoring these developments for opportunities for Rowan's fleet. We are actively marketing our idle jack-ups and strategically and creatively tendering worldwide. We continue to believe that our high-spec jack-ups will be at the front of the line for available contracts.
Turning to the ultra-deepwater market. Currently, 3 of our 4 drillships are contracted. However, as previously reported, we recently signed an amendment with Cobalt, allowing for an early termination option at March 31, 2017, in exchange for $96 million. The Rowan Relentless is warm stacked in U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and the Rowan Renaissance contract with Repsol will conclude in the second quarter of 2017.
We are aggressively marketing all 3 of these units, and there are 5 to 7 promising programs, with commencement windows in mid-2017 through the first half of 2018.
We are encouraged by the recent legislative reforms in Brazil and hope to see an improvement in deepwater opportunities there over the next 12 to 18 months. 
The Rowan Resolute remains on contract with Anadarko until at least September of 2018. Worldwide marketed ultra-deepwater utilization has slipped to 75% and similar to our jack-up assumptions, we believe that utilization will decline further before showing signs of improvement.
As customers begin to increase activity, we believe they will look to companies like Rowan, who have a proven workforce, delivering outstanding operations, a solid financial position and a high-spec fleet of jack-ups and drillships ready to meet their demand in drilling requirements. The road to recovery will be strenuous, but we are well positioned for the remaining months of the trough of and poised for the recovery of our industry.
This concludes my remarks this morning. I will now turn the call over to Stephen."
300794,403645731,1070335,"Rowan Companies plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Rowan Companies Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. In addition to reviewing our third quarter 2016 operating results today, I'll provide you with updates on our costs and capital spending guidance for the remainder of 2016 and offer preliminary guidance for 201",1332,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. In addition to reviewing our third quarter 2016 operating results today, I'll provide you with updates on our costs and capital spending guidance for the remainder of 2016 and offer preliminary guidance for 2017. Following my comments, I'll open the call for questions and answers. 
Despite the arduous market environment, we have continued to improve our solid liquidity position and reduced costs at a greater rate than our expectations, further strengthening our competitive position within the industry.
With a current cash balance in excess of $1.2 billion and a $1.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility that extends into 2021, we remain well positioned to withstand the trough cycle. While we take some comfort in our runway, we are mindful of our eroding backlog and the challenges that lie ahead. 
Now for our financial results. Excluding $34 million in noncash asset impairment charges and a $1.4 million credit from a litigation-related matter, we generated earnings of $0.30 per share. Ongoing cost control, better-than-expected jack-up and drillship utilization levels and favorable drillship revenue per day contributed to our solid earnings as compared to expectations. However, earnings per share declined by $0.45 from the second quarter non-GAAP adjusted earnings, primarily due to declining deepwater revenues. 
The Cobalt contract termination settlement had no impact on third quarter revenue, and the $96 million settlement will be recognized as revenue over multiple periods, starting in the second quarter of 2017 as reported in our fleet status.
During the third quarter, we generated revenue of $375 million, excluding rebillable items, down approximately 23% from second quarter levels, when adjusted for the Freeport-McMoRan settlement. The decline was driven by the Rowan Relentless being idle and the Rowan Resolute receiving a lower day rate as part of the blend-and-extend agreement with Anadarko, which should yield positive results in 2018. Additionally, our jack-up revenues declined by $25 million sequentially, primarily as a result of the Rowan Norway contract completion. 
We are pleased with our low level of operational downtime, which was less than 2% fleet-wide for the fifth consecutive quarter, below both our guidance of 2.5% for the jack-ups and 5% for our drillships. Notably, our drillships did not incur any downtime during the quarter. However, our idle days increased to nearly 27% of available days during the third quarter. Our out-of-service time for the jack-up fleet was approximately 4% of available rig days, slightly higher than the previous quarter, primarily due to planned repairs and inspections on the Bob Palmer, Gorilla VII and Joe Douglas, but it was lower than our expectations as the survey on the Bob Palmer commenced later than expected and will now have a larger impact on the fourth quarter.
Moving on to expenses. Third quarter operating expenses were $182 million, excluding rebills, an improvement of approximately $19 million from the second quarter level, due primarily to cost reductions on idle rigs and lower mobilization expenses. Continued cost-control efforts throughout the company also contributed to the improvement, though to a lesser extent. 
As a result of continued cost-control measures and increased efficiency, we now estimate our full year 2016 operating costs will approximate $775 million, a reduction of $20 million from our guidance provided last quarter.
Fourth quarter expenses are expected to approximate $190 million. As a reminder, this excludes rebillable items, which are offset by a commensurate increase in revenue. This modest increase from the third quarter level is primarily driven by our expectation of higher repair and maintenance expense on a number of our rigs, which are incurring out-of-service time during the fourth quarter.
SG&A expenses totaled $24 million for the third quarter, which was lower than the second quarter and our guidance as a result of favorable mark-to-market adjustment on incentive compensations, deferral of certain costs into the fourth quarter and widespread cost-control measures. We are reducing our full year SG&A guidance to slightly below $105 million, with estimated fourth quarter expenses of approximately $26 million.
As we announced in September, we completed an asset impairment evaluation in the third quarter. As a result, we recorded a $34 million pretax charge related to 5 of our older jack-ups.
Our third quarter depreciation expense totaled $102 million, and we are refining our full year 2016 guidance to be slightly above $400 million. Interest expense was $39 million for the third quarter, and our full year guidance remains at approximately $155 million.
With respect to the income tax provision, we recognized a tax benefit of $12 million as the result of a change in our tax asset valuation allowance due to the gain reported in other comprehensive income on a change to our post-retirement benefit plan. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the low to mid-single digits, but I will reiterate that our effective income tax rate may fluctuate significantly at low levels of nominal profit or loss, given the number of jurisdictions in which we operate. 
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Capital expenditures for the third quarter totaled less than $25 million, approximately $7 million below second quarter expenditures. We are reducing our full year CapEx guidance to $125 million to $130 million from $140 million to $150 million previously.
We generated $276 million in cash during the third quarter, which included the final payment by McMoRan and also the first payment by Cobalt of $45 million related to its early termination option as outlined in the 8-K in September. 
As I mentioned earlier, our liquidity is solid, with enough cash on hand today, to repay debt maturities through 2021 and the flexibility to participate in distressed asset purchases as we aim to improve our return on capital.
Although we have not yet completed our 2017 budget, I will now provide an update to the preliminary full year guidance that we provided in September. 
Our $2.2 billion backlog provides good visibility in the coming years. However, we realized the challenges that 2017 will bring, with one drillship currently idle and 2 additional vessels approaching the end of their contracts.
While we anticipate reaching a bottom in demand for both jack-ups and floaters during 2017, we are aware of the excess capacity that the industry must work through before an increase in day rates will be achieved. 
Our 2017 operating expenses, excluding rebillable items, are expected to range from $650 million to $750 million. As part of these expenses, we anticipate our drillship warm-stacking costs will approximate $45,000 per day, following a ramp-down period of approximately 3 months from the time the ship goes idle. This warm-stacking costs represents a slight reduction from our previous guidance in excess of $50,000 per day. 
SG&A for 2017 is estimated to range from $90 million to $100 million, a 5% to 14% decrease from the expected 2016 range. Depreciation expense is expected to vary from $385 million to $395 million and interest expense is expected to range from $145 million to $150 million in 2017. 
And finally, we estimate our maintenance capital expenditures will be less than $100 million, a reduction of more than 20% from current year level, reflecting our strong ongoing focus on capital discipline. We will refine this 2017 guidance in our next earnings call after we have completed our annual budget. 
In closing, we are pleased with our performance across the organization during this cyclical downturn. We are cautiously optimistic that demand for offshore drilling services will reach a bottom during 2017 and begin the climb back toward an improved supply and demand balance, but we recognize that it will take some time to reach that balance. In the meantime, we will continue to focus on areas that are within our control such as safety, operational performance, customer satisfaction and our cost structure. We continue to believe that we are well positioned to endure the challenges ahead as well as capitalize on the opportunities that may arise.
With that, we are now prepared to open the call for questions. Operator?"

First, we believe that the customers will take working rigs, warmer-stacked rigs, reorders and then cold-stack new rigs that are about to be delivered and then cold-stack rigs in that order. So moving the rig into cold stack will basically guarantee, again, to take part later on in the cycle, which given that we have some of the best drillships in the world, it will be really, definitely make any sense to use the cold-stacked that if they will be a month as things would have picked up then operators start taking up drillships. And secondly, it's very common that we want to remain -- obtain our capabilities, indeed, we only have 4 rigs. They are, as I said, again, some of the best in the world. So cold stacking them we will lose those capability. So it is just something that I think, we should, right now our plan is to warm stack them.

So although those rigs are -- we have 2 of those rigs stacked in Dundee, right now, they are an asset, which are unique, and then they are an asset, which is position in the niche. And then frankly, a niche, which is the heavy-duty ultra-harsh environment.

If you look at that market, if you look at the requirements, obviously, price comes more into play than if they actually require dual-stacked 1,250-ton rig. Operation performance in that market plays a much bigger role than it does maybe in a jack-up market, given the spread costs and the exposure that the operators have. Some of these contracts, they vary in term from a year plus. But I would always think that price is going to have some bearing. Certainly, the relationship with that operator is going to carry a lot of weight. As far as start-up, yes, I would say that a lot of these -- because there hasn't been much activity, a lot of things have already been worked internally from the oil companies. So you could possibly see a little quicker start in 6 months, but I would use that as a -- we've seen that historically probably. But with virtually, no exploration programs since 2014, if you look at the ultra-deepwater market, a lot of the oil companies have maintained a lot of their staffs, and they've been working on these prospects. So I think it's possible to see some quicker start-up than that. As far as award and commencement, like I said, I think you would see some of it mid-'17 onward. It's going to vary according to how they implement their budgets and how their final budgets come out. But just in discussions that we have had now, that's what we see.

I can give some thoughts and Stephen, you can probably talk about debt spreads as well. I would say that we are -- have a real focus on -- while maintaining safe, reliable and efficient operations, we have a real focus of trying to improve our returns on invested capital. And so we think about that and think about it a lot. And so we are -- when we think about capital allocation, Stephen and I spent a bunch of time working through it together. And we look at everything, and we run multiple scenarios, and we present those to the Board. And we have a very fulsome conversation, every board meeting, lasting several hours about capital allocation and what our choices are and how we improve our returns over the long term. So it is very important for us. And distressed assets is one way to do that and M&A is one way to do that. I think we -- Stephen provide the -- during this not as long as others done, but they're long enough to understand that when approaching M&A have to do it very carefully because a lot of value can be destroyed if you don't do it right. So we do -- on the distressed asset side, we do look at distressed assets a lot, and Chris Pitre, who heads up the IR, also has a dual role, looking at corporate developments. And he spends a lot of time thinking through different scenarios about what distressed assets make sense for us. I think what makes sense, really 3 things. One is big jack-ups. We like the larger jack-ups. We are probably less focused on smaller jack-ups, but big jack-ups, new jack-ups -- big, new jack-ups is of interest to us. Not only price but any means, but that is an area where we're focused on. As we retire rigs like the Gorilla II, we want to replace those rigs. We don't feel like we have to get to 60 rigs or a number like that. What we need to do is improve our return on capital with more purchases. The second area is ultra-deepwater. And we think seventh-generation assets are the way to go. We might consider an early sixth-generation asset, but would have to make absolute sense from return on capital perspective. And that's why didn't -- we passed on the Cerrada. We knew what the reserved price was. And we sat in a room and determined that we couldn't make the necessary return on that asset versus our other opportunities. And the third area, which we're interested in is harsh environment floating rigs, complementing our focus on new jack-ups with a high-spec jack-up rig. We like the harsh environment market. They're all obviously a lot less of those assets in the world. But we also think that it's a niche, which is hard to compete in, but it's not obvious at this point how to get in that without paying over the odds for it. So those are the 3 that we're looking at. We spend a bunch of time thinking about this. And frankly, at this point, we haven't moved because the prices keep coming down. Now distressed assets is one way of improving our returns, and we do look at others, particularly, just one of several choices. Stephen, you want to comment on the debt?"

I know you gave some perspective on the N-Class rigs about maybe taking them internationally, or obviously, it's a pretty small market, so it doesn't take much to term. But just curious for your thoughts on how that may shape up in 2017. I seem to be getting a sense on our end that maybe the $50 plus or minus oil price is pretty -- is obviously pretty solid for demand a lot of pockets of the world, but then the North Sea is maybe one that'll lag. And historically, that's been a fairly longer lead time-type market in terms of bringing contracts to fruition than maybe some of these other areas. And with oil price may be stuck in the high $40s or plus minus $50 now, I could just start to wonder if there's a real possibility that maybe those opportunities for next year, the window is narrowing and that we go another year without much of a turn there. So obviously, hearing a lot of competitive situations, but I guess, if you could just comment on that. It just seems like maybe one of the tougher markets to be able to put rigs back to working more quickly."

The ones that we feel are rolling off that won't be -- that we see being extended that we know of today. We see about 6 to 7 opportunities to take those rigs out of the North Sea. The timing varies in different times in '17 and early '18. But there are some opportunities. The Super Gorilla class rigs can work virtually anywhere in the world. As you know, we have the Bob Palmer drilling gas wells for Saudi Aramco in about 30-feet water. So given their drilling capability, those rigs are -- can work in different areas. We're seeing demand in Southeast Asia. We're seeing demand in Africa, different regions of the world that would utilize those type of assets."

Most of it is around ramping up the crews and making sure we have competent crews to go out with that rig. That rig has the benefit of being close to Houston. So I visited it several times over the last year, gone trough up to the cruise and just touch based with them. I would say that, that rig is -- as far as the jack-ups in the world that rig is in very good condition. I mean the crew -- we have had crew on it the whole time, and they have really taken care of that rig. So you go there and it is -- I mean, it is painted well and gray from top to bottom. It's been looked after and in fact, we've taken the opportunity to use -- take some excess crews that we had the work for, but not immediately and strip the preload tank and really done a bunch of work on that.

So at the risk of repeating any questions, I'm just curious, Mark, maybe that when you look at the demand dynamics that are unfolding, as you mentioned, for jack-ups, fairly positive commentary, probably more positive commentary that I can recall hearing in, I don't know, maybe a couple of years. At least on the demand front, kind of how do you balance that with the context around what the pricing dynamics are, especially the recent contracts you just announced here today, $50,000, $60,000 in the Gulf of Mexico, rapidly approaching cash costs? So with the incremental demand, do you expect there to be continued pricing pressure? Or do you think pricing will start to stabilize?"

I don't think the market will actually trough until sometime in '17. But it certainly doesn't bode well for increases in day rates. But we are -- as I said in my remarks, we are seeing some demand for rigs. And I think the answer to the pricing question is all going to depend on the operator and the type of asset they require. If it's a Super Gorilla working in a difficult area, obviously, you're going to be able to get a little more premium. And it depends on if it's going to be drilling HPHT wells or just drilling some very benign wells in deepwater. So there are a lot of variables that go into day rate. But at the end of the day, I think the market is going to be very competitive from a pricing standpoint. I do think there are some -- there is some visible demand. If it remains intact, if commodity prices hold and continue to move upward, I think you could see some of that increase. But that's -- to give you a definitive answer on day rates, I would just tell you that I think they're going to be -- just going to be -- remain very competitive in '17 for sure."

So our other shore-based cost is on top of that. Now of course, all that are included in our overall cost guidance. But in terms of the other levels by region, I'll just, I guess, highlight some of them briefly. The drillships are now in the high $130,000 range, in which -- that stands significantly from where we were at the start of the downturn in the $170,000 range. Our costs in Trinidad are really pretty much in line with where they were previously in the mid-$60s to mid-$70s on a per-day basis. Norway, our costs are down significantly. They're in the mid- to high $100,000 range. And that's down from about $160,000 at the peak.  In U.K., nice reduction in costs there as well, in the high $50s to low $60s. And those previously were in the mid- to high $80s. In the Middle East, it really runs, again, at something that's very small, all the rigs in the region as well as one of our largest jack-up rigs, the Bob Palmer. So we've got a broader range there, but it's really high $30s to low $60s today. And those are down quite a bit as well."
