Thank you, David, and thanks, everyone, for joining us for our first quarter 2016 conference call. This morning, I'm joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Collins, who you just heard from; Diane Bessette, our Vice",1822,"All right. Very good. Thank you, David, and thanks, everyone, for joining us for our first quarter 2016 conference call. This morning, I'm joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Collins, who you just heard from; Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; Rick Beckwith, our President; Jeffrey Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto, are here as well, along with a few other members of our management team, and John Jeff, he is joining by phone from California. Some of this group will join for our Q&A period. 
I'm going to give some brief remarks to begin about the business, Bruce is going to jump in and break down our financial picture and then as always, we're going to open up for Q&A. And as we have in the past, we'd like to request that each person limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
So let me begin, and let me begin by saying that our first quarter 2016 marks the beginning of yet another year of strong operating results for the company. Even while the month of December was defined by the first interest rate hike by the Fed since the Great Recession, which turned into capital market turbulence and fears of recession as we entered calendar 2016, we have seen only mild negative impacts to our business and have continued to be able to perform as expected.
The management team across our platform have recognized the challenges of these sometimes complicated market conditions and have adjusted strategies to meet those challenges and have often turned them into unique opportunities. Each segment of our company has positioned itself for continued performance in 2016 and beyond, and we believe that we remain very well positioned to execute our operating plans and strategies in each of those segments.
In light of the Fed's move in interest rates early in this quarter and the turbulent market conditions that followed, let me speak briefly about our outlook for the housing market in general. There have been some questions raised about the relationship between housing and interest rates, about the possibility of recession, about consumer confidence in a globally terror-stricken world and about the implications of a god awful election season in the United States. In times like these, it's probably best to put the blinders on and focus on the road ahead because it seems almost impossible to avoid the distractions of the environment around.
To answer the questions directly, we feel certain that modest moves in interest rates tied to low unemployment and some wage growth will be a net positive for housing. We do not see the telltale signs of recession. Global terror seems to highlight that the U.S. is the safest place to be and to invest in the world and keep U.S. citizens focused right here at home. And as for the election, well, they say that America always gets to the right answer right after we've tried all the wrong ones. We'll see. 
As we've noted consistently over the past few years, the overall housing market has been generally defined by a rather large production deficit, and this has resulted in a growing pent-up demand. Stronger general economic conditions, including lower unemployment, modest wage growth and general consumer confidence, are still driving consumers to form new households and to rent and to purchase apartments and homes. We expect that demand will continue to build and come to the market over the next years and will drive increased production as the deficit in housing stock ultimately needs to be replenished.
Land and labor shortages will continue to constrain supply and constrain the ability to quickly respond to growing demand, while the mortgage market will continue to constrain purchasers access to mortgages. These conditions will continue to result in slow and steady positive homebuilding market conditions and will enable slow, steady, though sometimes erratic, growth across our platform.
This has been our consistent guiding theme for the past years, and we've mapped our strategy around this view. Even with the somewhat erratic conditions that define the first quarter, we remain resolute in our view and have adhered to our strategies.
Against this backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating segments. Our for-sales homebuilding operations have performed extremely well in the first quarter. Our results reflect slow but steady growth in the overall homebuilding market as our new orders increased 10% year-over-year. Even while continued labor shortages and land and construction cost increases have tested our ability to map sales and delivery pace, our management team has carefully managed sales prices, maximize margin and focus on reducing SG&A to offset and maintain strong net operating margins.
We have noted in the past quarter conference calls that given the now mature recovery, we have been and continued to carefully manage our growth in order to grow our bottom line and to drive strong cash flow. We've moderated our growth targets to achieve a growth rate in the 8% to 10% range as we've redirected our management efforts towards creating operating efficiencies and leveraging SG&A.
We've also talked consistently about a soft pivot in our land strategy, away from the land-heavy acquisition strategy in the early stages of the recovery and we are now targeting land acquisition with a shorter 2- to 3-year average life.
Generally, we've moderated our land spend as a percent of revenues, and this will be reflected in future quarters. This has been and will continue to be the strategy driving our homebuilding platform as we manage land acquisitions to taper the growth rate in both community count and home sales.
With less pressure on growth rate, we can intensify management focus on driving bottom line growth, cash flow and maximizing pricing power, while using innovative strategies to drive SG&A down.
Under a company mantra of what we can manage we can change, we are focused on changing and improving quite a lot in operations. As one example of this focus, we've been working on reducing customer acquisition costs. We've been moving our spend away from conventional marketing and advertising to a digital platform. We've learned that digital advertising can be much more targeted and much less expensive. We believe that once fully implemented, we will see up to a 50 basis point reduction in SG&A, while driving an increase in qualified traffic. In the current quarter, we are already starting to see results from this initiative.
With demand growing steadily, land-limited, labor tight and constrained mortgage availability, we feel that we're in an excellent environment to run our business at a steady and consistent growth rate with strong bottom line profitability and strong cash flow by measuring and changing our way to greater efficiency and performance in our core for-sale homebuilding segment.
Next, our financial services group has had an outstanding first quarter as well. While the financial services operations have grown alongside our core homebuilding business, we've also benefited historically from a strong, though sometimes erratic, refi market, as well as from expansion of retail opportunities in both our mortgage and titled platforms. These sidecar opportunities will continue to expand in 2016. 
Our strategy for the future for Lennar's financial services continues to be to construct and maintain a fully self-sufficient financial services platform that benefits from Lennar homebuilding business, but drives profitability from retail operations as well. 
Bruce Gross oversees this operation and will discuss it further in his comments. 
The first quarter has continued to display our outstanding positioning for LMC, Lennar Multifamily Communities, as well. We closed 1 property in the quarter and continued to develop our extensive over $6.5 billion pipeline of quality properties across the country.
Our multifamily program continues to complement our for-sale operation. Since household formation has recovered at a slower rate than expected and new households have been more inclined to rent than purchase, we addressed these markets with rental communities that are desired or can be afforded. First-time home purchasers have come back to the housing market more slowly than they have historically and more slowly than expected. While approximately 30% of our for-sale homebuilding business continues to be geared to first-time home purchasers, our broader new household strategy has been aimed primarily at the rental market. 
We've continued to expand our national footprint and grow from a merchant build program to a build-to-own program. In the first quarter, we got equity commitments for an additional $300 million for our Lennar Multifamily venture to bring our raise to just over $1.4 billion. Our apartment strategy is proving to be very well-timed as rental rates continue to climb and vacancies are at historic lows. More rental product is going to continue to be needed, and we are well-positioned to continue to fill this need and grow our Multifamily platform.
Also in the first quarter, our Rialto segments are both challenges and opportunity. While the collapse of the capital market in the beginning of the calendar year negatively impacted current quarter earnings for Rialto, the volatility did create unique opportunities for investment for the future. During the quarter, volatility was in the capital market pressured the pricing on a variety of fixed income products, including issued commercial mortgage-backed securities. Accordingly, Rialto mortgage finance [indiscernible] saw its net spread dwindled to unusually low levels, while volume dropped as well. 
Although profit expectations were missed, excellent management kept us in the black in a stressed market, and Rialto was able to make strategic purchases of CMBS B-pieces at advantage prices for future profitability.
Overall, our Rialto platform enables us to invest across real estate and financial product types as an opportunistic play on the long duration of this economic recovery. The disfunction in the financial market, along with a new risk retention rules, will ultimately work to the benefit of Rialto's core competence in CMBS and financial products, and will continue to grow as a best-in-class manager.
Finally, let me mention briefly our FivePoint properties strategic investment and its management team, which positions us to continue to benefit from some of the best located land in California as that market continues to improve. As noted in our last conference call, FivePoint has confidentially filed a registration statement for an initial public offering. Of course, the difficult market conditions of the first quarter have kept us on the sidelines, but we'll keep you posted as further information becomes available. 
In conclusion, let me say that we're very pleased to present our first quarter results this morning. We feel confident that our view of the market and the strategies that define our business segments have worked well to position us for continued performance and for future growth. As I've said in the past many times, we are very confident that we, at Lennar, have the right people, the right programs and the right timing to continue to perform this year and into the future. 
With that, let me turn you over to Bruce."
30763,328038679,956261,"Lennar Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 29, 2016",2016-03-29,"Earnings Calls","Lennar Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jeri, and good morning. Our net earnings for the first quarter were $144 million, which is a 25% increase over the prior-year. Revenues from home sales increased 25% in the first quarter, driven by a 12% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and a 1",1271,"Thanks, Jeri, and good morning. Our net earnings for the first quarter were $144 million, which is a 25% increase over the prior-year. Revenues from home sales increased 25% in the first quarter, driven by a 12% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and a 12% increase in average selling price to $365,000. 
Our gross margin on home sales in the first quarter was 22.7%, which was in line with our expectations. The prior-year's gross margin percentage was 23.1%. The decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land cost. 
Sales incentives as a percent of revenue continue to decline as this quarter was 5.6% versus 6.3% in the prior year. Gross margin percentages were once again highest in the East and West regions. Direct construction cost for the single-family detached loans were up 5% year-over-year to approximately $53 per square foot, and that was driven primarily by labor increases. 
Our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of home sales revenue improved 60 basis points to 10.8% in the first quarter. We were successful on improving SG&A operating leverage by growing volume organically in our existing homebuilding divisions, and additionally, we continue to see the benefits of our focus on digital marketing. This resulted in the lowest first quarter SG&A percentage in our history.
Operating margins on home sales also improved, and this was improved by 20 basis points to 11.9% in the first quarter. This quarter, we opened 62 new communities to end the quarter with 684 net active communities. New home owners increased 10% and new order dollar value increased 15% for the quarter. Our sales pace was slightly higher compared to the prior year at 2.9 sales per community per month versus 2.8 in the prior-year. The cancellation rate decreased to 15% in the first quarter from 16% in the prior year. 
In the first quarter, we purchased 10,300 homesites totaling $537 million versus $421 million in the prior year's quarter. We continue to focus on our soft [indiscernible] land strategy however, however our land spend in 2016 is weighted more heavily to the first half of the year. Our homesites owned and controlled now total 168,000 homesites of which 132,000 are owned and 36,000 are controlled.
We continue to carefully manage inventory as our completed unsold inventory ended the quarter with approximately 1,200 homes, which is in our normal range of 1 to 2 per community. 
Our financial services business segment had strong results with operating earnings of $14.9 million, and that compared to $15.5 million in the prior-year. Mortgage pretax income decreased to $13 million from $14 million in the prior-year, and mortgage originations increased 2% to $1.7 billion from $1.6  billion in the prior-year. Refinance volume decreased 47% year-over-year, which created a more competitive market for the remaining purchase business. We did, however, increased our purchase origination volume by 17% as a result of increased Lennar home deliveries and an expanded retail presence.
The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers improved to 82% this quarter from 79% in the prior-year. Our title company's profit decreased slightly to $2 million in the quarter from $2.1 million in the prior year, primarily due to lower volume versus last year. 
Our Rialto segment produced operating earnings of $1.9 million compared to $4.6 million in the prior year, both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The investment management business contributed $23.2 million of earnings, which includes $1.5 million of equity in earnings from the real estate funds and $21.7 million of management fees and other.
At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Fund's 1 and 2 combined now totals $136 million. Rialto mortgage finance operations contributed $380 million of commercial loans into 2 securitizations with an average margin of 1.6%, totaling earnings of $3.9 million for the quarter, and that was before their G&A expenses.
Our direct investments had earnings of $1.8 million, and Rialto G&A and other expenses were $20 million for the quarter and interest expense was about $7 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $112 million of cash.
The Multifamily segment delivered a $12.2 million operating profit in the first quarter, primarily driven by the segment's $20.4 million share of a gain from the sales and operating property as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses.
The apartment communities sale this quarter was in Mountain View California and was sold to a firm providing corporate housing for companies, including Google and Facebook. This will be the most profitable apartment communities sale this year.
We ended the quarter with 6 completed and operating properties, 28 under construction, 5 of which are in lease up, totaling over 8,000 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $2.1 billion. 
Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 28%. The rate was benefited by a favorable settlement with the IRS, as well as the extension of the new home energy efficiency credit. The remaining quarters of the year should have a tax rate of approximately 34%. 
Our Southeast Florida division has grown successfully and was operating from [indiscernible] beach to Miami. As the result in the first quarter, we split the division into 2 operating divisions to maximize operational efficiencies. The Southeast Florida segment no longer needs the reportable segment criteria and is now part of the homebuilding East segment.
Turning to the balance sheet. Liquidity remain strong with approximately $511 million of homebuilding cash and $500 million of borrowings under our $1.6 billion revolving credit facility. Our leverage improved by 240 basis points year-over-year as our homebuilding net debt-to-total capital was reduced to 45.3%. We grew stockholders equity by 18% to $5.8 billion, and our book value per share increased to $27.11 per share. 
During the quarter, we converted $163 million of our 2.75% convertible notes for $163 million of cash and $3.6 million of shares with an average price of approximately $44. At quarter end, the remaining balance to be converted was $71 million. 
In March, we issued $500 million of 5-year senior notes in the 4.75%, which will be used for working capital and to retire our $250 million, 6.5% senior notes. This will continue to reduce our borrowing rate, while expanding our maturities.
Finally, I would like to update our 2016 goals. 2016 homebuilding goals are right on track with the guidance we gave in December with just a couple of quarterly refinements. Deliveries are still on track to be between 26,500 and 27,000 homes. We expect the backlog conversion ratio in a range of 80% to 85% for Q2, 75% to 80% for Q3 and 90% to 95% for Q4. 
Operating margins are still on track to be flat to down 50 basis points for the entire year. The full year gross margin is still expected to be in a range of 23% to 24%, the second and third quarter are expected to be at the low end of this range and the fourth quarter is expected to be at the high end of the range. We are still on track to achieve the lowest SG&A percentage in our company's history in 2016 with the greatest leverage coming in our higher delivery quarters in the second half of the year. 
Our other company goals are all on track, except given the turmoil in the capital markets, we now expect Rialto to earn between $15 million and $20 million for 2016, and that's weighted more heavily towards the fourth quarter.
We're off to a strong start in 2016. And with that, let me turn it back to the operator, and open it up for questions."

We saw that with regard to both the home sales activity as well as pricing, so we're optimistic that we're entering the sales season, although we're at the very beginning stages because our quarter ended in February. Geographically, we saw the numbers are pretty similar. Probably our toughest market was Houston. Sales were down 3%. But I think we're outperforming the market there because on the new home side, as we calculated, the market was down about 10% during the comparable period. We saw good pricing power because we are, as Stuart said and Bruce mentioned earlier, balancing phase and price there. Sales prices were up about 5%. The margin took it a little bit on the chin because we're keeping our inventory active, and we are optimistic that we're going to -- pace starts to deal with the market on the higher price points. The lower price point is still performing pretty well. But once you get above $350,000, $400,000, it's down quite a bit.

But selling at almost 4 sales per month per community for the builders at the Great Part. At [indiscernible], we're seeing over 3 sales per month per community. So it shows very good activity in those markets. Northern California, the Bay Area, remains very strong, really defined by a shortage of both housing and, particularly, in Silicon Valley, by a shortage of skilled labor in the tech and biotech world. So that continues to fuel demand there. And then in Sacramento, we've seen a nice recovery with that becoming a strong market. In the [indiscernible] Central Valley as described more stable, good markets, healthy, not as robust as Northern and Southern California. And then across the rest of the West, Colorado and Nevada, Arizona, all very stable markets.

The first part of that is the migration from conventional to digital marketing. If you think about it, conventional marketing is going to a newspaper ad and basically shotgunning across a wide population a message that might or might not resonate with that population. Using an example, we think of first-time homebuyers as most likely to decide to purchase a home where they're getting married or rather having children. In a digital platform, we can target our message to people who are looking for wedding dresses or purchasing cribs. That's a more targeted, focused audience, and it costs a lot less to target that group. Digital marketing enables a greater penetration to the people that want to hear our message, less scattered delivery of our message at a much, much lower cost. That's been driving our marketing and advertising cost down, and we're at the front end of that. There are other benefits that will flow from that as we become more proficient at that form of marketing, and I think that our industry and our company are at the front end of really redefining what that cost structure can look like."

Think of the homebuilding business more like a cruise ship than a speedboat. There's a lot of momentum in the direction that we're headed. It's hard to turn in short distances. The land acquisition program is that kind of a momentum program. We start negotiating land positions years in advance of actually closing them. Rick has already articulated that our land spend this quarter, in large part, derived from negotiations and contracts that were entered into 2 and 3 years ago. So as we look out towards future quarters, we're going to see the work, the redirection that was put in place 2 years earlier. So over the next quarters and over the next couple of years, we'll see our land spend subside as a percentage of total revenues and we'll see the impact of that soft pivot. As I articulated, our land today as we focus on land acquisition is generally targeted towards 2 and 3 year duration land purchases. That doesn't mean where we find a unique opportunity that we won't buy something larger, we most certainly will because we are opportunistic in that way, but it's going to be priced in a certain way.

Really, homebuilding, if you look at it, step back from it, rode through some pretty tumultuous timing in the first quarter, pretty much unscathed. There might have been some pullback in some consumer confidence, and we all sat kind of at the edge of our seats waiting to see how the spring selling season might present itself. And I think there was a lot of questions, asked questions about recession in the U.S. economy started to kind of gain steam among economists. So I think what I was trying to express was that it was a shock to the system. There were some impacts to certain parts of our business, though they were minor.

And in that regard, I think that to continue to see fairly strong demand. I think affordability is a looming question as prices have tended to go up. They tend to go up because the supply, we read about it, we see it all the time both on existing homes and new homes is fairly tight and the demand is emerging. It hasn't emerged, but it's still emerging. And I think there is a sizable pent-up demand. Your question about move-up purchasers in the market, we're generally seeing some relative strength across the board from first-time buyers all the way through to move up. There are certain markets that are a little bit different. The Houston market, as we've noted, has been softer at the higher end. The California markets have remained robust. So it's not a national picture anymore. We have to look at local markets more directly, but we're still seeing strength. I think the thing to remember for everyone in the back of their mind is that you have to measure affordability against the alternative, and the alternative is what does the rental market look like, what is the rental option. And with the rental rates moving up, the more and more people are thinking to kind of stabilize their outflow of capital, of personal capital, into the housing cost by purchasing as opposed to renting because, on an annual basis, the rental rates are going up. So that picture is one that continues to define the housing markets today, a production deficit, supply is tight, demand is growing, rental rates are going up and the affordability picture is a bit of a question. But I think in the mix, it probably gives way to a strong consistent slowly growing housing market.

I'm going to give some brief remarks to begin about the business, Bruce is going to jump in and break down our financial picture, and then as always, we're going to open up for Q&A. [Operator Instructions]
So let me begin, and let me begin by saying that our first quarter 2016 marks the beginning of yet another year of strong operating results for the company. Even while the month of December was defined by the first interest rate hike by the Fed since the Great Recession, which turned into capital market turbulence and fears of recession as we entered calendar 2016, we have seen only mild negative impacts to our business and have continued to be able to perform as expected.
The management teams across our platform has -- have recognized the challenges of these sometimes complicated market conditions and have adjusted strategies to meet those challenges and have often turned them into unique opportunities. Each segment of our company has positioned itself for continued performance in 2016 and beyond, and we believe that we remain very well positioned to execute our operating plans and strategies in each of those segments.
In light of the Fed's move in interest rates early in this quarter and the turbulent market conditions that followed, let me speak briefly about our outlook for the housing market in general. There've  been some questions raised about the relationship between housing and interest rates, about the possibility of recession, about consumer confidence in a globally terror-stricken world and about the implications of a god-awful election season in the United States. In times like these, it's probably best to put the blinders on and focus on the road ahead, because it seems almost impossible to avoid the distractions of the environment around.
To answer the questions directly, we feel certain that modest moves in interest rates tied to low unemployment and some wage growth will be a net positive for housing. We do not see the telltale signs of recession. Global terror seems to highlight that the U.S. is the safest place to be and to invest in the world and keeps U.S. citizens focused right here at home. And as for the election, well, they say that America always gets to the right answer right after we've tried all the wrong ones. We'll see. 
As we've noted consistently over the past few years, the overall housing market has been generally defined by a rather large production deficit, and this has resulted in a growing pent-up demand. Stronger general economic conditions, including lower unemployment, modest wage growth and general consumer confidence are still driving consumers to form new households and to rent and to purchase apartments and homes. We expect that demand will continue to build and come to the market over the next years and will drive increased production as the deficit in housing stock ultimately needs to be replenished.
Land and labor shortages will continue to constrain supply and constrain the ability to quickly respond to growing demand, while the mortgage market will continue to constrain purchasers access to mortgages. These conditions will continue to result in slow and steady positive homebuilding market conditions and will enable slow, steady, though sometimes erratic growth across our platform.
This has been our consistent guiding theme for the past years, and we've mapped our strategy around this view. Even with the somewhat erratic conditions that define the first quarter, we've remained resolute in our view and have adhered to our strategies.
Against this backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating segments. Our for-sale homebuilding operations have performed extremely well in the first quarter. Our results reflect slow but steady growth in the overall homebuilding market as our new orders increased 10% year-over-year. Even while continued labor shortages and land and construction cost increases have tested our ability to map sales and delivery pace, our management team has carefully managed sales prices, maximized margin and focused on reducing SG&A to offset and maintain strong net operating margins.
We've noted in the past quarter conference calls that given the now mature recovery, we have been and continue to carefully manage our growth in order to grow our bottom line and to drive strong cash flow. We've moderated our growth targets to achieve a growth rate in the 8% to 10% range, as we've redirected our management efforts towards creating operating efficiencies and leveraging SG&A.
We've also talked consistently about a soft pivot in our land strategy away from the land-heavy acquisition strategy in the early stages of the recovery, and we are now targeting land acquisition with a shorter 2- to 3-year average life.
Generally, we've moderated our land spend as a percent of revenues, and this will be reflected in future quarters. This has been and will continue to be the strategy driving our homebuilding platform, as we manage land acquisitions to taper the growth rate in both community count and home sales.
With less pressure on growth rate, we can intensify management focus on driving bottom line growth, cash flow and maximizing pricing power, while using innovative strategies to drive SG&A down.
Under a company mantra of what we can manage we can change, we are focused on changing and improving quite a lot in operations. As one example of this focus, we've been working on reducing customer acquisition costs. We've been moving our spend away from conventional marketing and advertising to a digital platform. We've learned that digital advertising can be much more targeted and much less expensive. We believe that once fully implemented, we will see up to a 50 basis point reduction in SG&A, while driving an increase in qualified traffic. In the current quarter, we are already starting to see results from this initiative.
With demand growing steadily, land-limited, labor tight and constrained mortgage availability, we feel that we're in an excellent environment to run our business at a steady and consistent growth rate, with strong bottom line profitability and strong cash flow by measuring and changing our way to greater efficiency and performance in our core for-sale homebuilding segment.
Next, our financial services group has had an outstanding first quarter as well. While the financial services operations have grown alongside our core homebuilding business, we've also benefited historically from a strong, though sometimes erratic, refi market as well as from expansion of retail opportunities in both our mortgage and titled platforms. These sidecar opportunities will continue to expand in 2016. 
Our strategy for the future for Lennar's financial services continues to be to construct and maintain a fully self-sufficient financial services platform that benefits from Lennar homebuilding business but drives profitability from retail operations as well.
Bruce Gross oversees this operation and will discuss it further in his comments.
The first quarter has continued to display our outstanding positioning for LMC, Lennar Multifamily Communities as well. We closed 1 property in the quarter and continued to develop our extensive over $6.5 billion pipeline of quality properties across the country.
Our multifamily program continues to complement our for-sale operation. Since household formation has recovered at a slower rate than expected, a new households have been more inclined to rent than purchase, we address these markets with rental communities that are desired or can be afforded. First-time home purchasers have come back to the housing market more slowly than they have historically and more slowly than expected. While approximately 30% of our for-sale homebuilding business continues to be geared to first-time home purchasers, our broader new household strategy has been aimed primarily at the rental market. 
We've continued to expand our national footprint and grow from a merchant build program to a build-to-own program. In the first quarter, we got equity commitments for an additional $300 million for our Lennar Multifamily Venture to bring our raise to just over $1.4 billion. Our apartment strategy is proving to be very well-timed, as rental rates continue to climb and vacancies are at historic lows. More rental product is going to continue to be needed, and we are well positioned to continue to fill this need and grow our Multifamily platform.
Also in the first quarter, our Rialto segment saw both challenges and opportunity. While the collapse of the capital markets in the beginning of the calendar year negatively impacted current quarter earnings for Rialto, the volatility did create unique opportunities for investment for the future. During the quarter, volatility within the capital markets pressured the pricing on a variety of fixed income products, including new-issue commercial mortgage-backed securities. Accordingly, Rialto mortgage finance, RMF, saw its net spread dwindled to unusually low levels while volume dropped as well.
Although profit expectations were missed, excellent management kept us in the black in a stressed market, and Rialto was able to make strategic purchases of CMBS B-Pieces at advantage prices for future profitability.
Overall, our Rialto platform enables us to invest across real estate and financial product types as an opportunistic play on the long duration of this economic recovery. The disfunction in the financial market, along with new risk retention rules, will ultimately work to benefit -- to the benefit of Rialto's core competence in CMBS and financial products and will continue to grow as a best-in-class manager.
Finally, let me mention briefly our FivePoint properties strategic investment and its management team, which positions us to continue to benefit from some of the best located land in California as that market continues to improve. As noted in our last conference call, FivePoint has confidentially filed a registration statement for an initial public offering. Of course, the difficult market conditions of the first quarter have kept us on the sidelines, but we'll keep you posted as further information becomes available.
In conclusion, let me say that we're very pleased to prevent -- present our first quarter results this morning. We feel confident that our view of the market and the strategies that define our business segments have worked well to position us for continued performance and for future growth. As I've said in the past many times, we are very confident that we, at Lennar, have the right people, the right programs and the right timing to continue to perform this year and into the future.
With that, let me turn you over to Bruce."

Our gross margin on home sales in the first quarter was 22.7%, which was in line with our expectations. The prior year's gross margin percentage was 23.1%. The decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land cost. 
Sales incentives as a percent of home sales revenue continue to decline as this quarter was 5.6% versus 6.3% in the prior year. Gross margin percentages were once again highest in the East and West regions. Direct construction cost for the single-family detached homes were up 5% year-over-year to approximately $53 per square foot, and that was driven primarily by labor increases. 
Our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of home sales revenue improved 60 basis points to 10.8% in the first quarter. We were successful on improving SG&A operating leverage by growing volume organically in our existing homebuilding divisions, and additionally, we continue to see the benefits of our focus on digital marketing. This resulted in the lowest first quarter SG&A percentage in our history.
Operating margins on home sales also improved, and this was improved by 20 basis points to 11.9% in the first quarter. This quarter, we opened 62 new communities to end the quarter with 684 net active communities. New home owners increased 10%,  and new order dollar value increased 15% for the quarter. Our sales pace was slightly higher compared to the prior year at 2.9 sales per community per month versus 2.8 in the prior year. The cancellation rate decreased to 15% in the first quarter from 16% in the prior year.
In the first quarter, we purchased 10,300 homesites, totaling $537 million versus $421 million in the prior year's quarter. We continue to focus on our soft pivot land strategy. However, our land spend in 2016 is weighted more heavily to the first half of the year. Our homesites owned and controlled now total 168,000 homesites of which 132,000 are owned and 36,000 are controlled.
We continue to carefully manage inventory as our completed unsold inventory ended the quarter with approximately 1,200 homes, which is in our normal range of 1 to 2 per community.
Our Financial Services business segment had strong results with operating earnings of $14.9 million and that compared to $15.5 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income decreased to $13 million from $14 million in the prior year, and mortgage originations increased 2% to $1.7 billion from $1.6  billion in the prior year. Refinance volume decreased 47% year-over-year, which created a more competitive market for the remaining purchase business. We did, however, increased our purchase origination volume by 17% as a result of increased Lennar home deliveries and an expanded retail presence.
The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers improved to 82% this quarter from 79% in the prior year. Our title company's profit decreased slightly to $2 million in the quarter from $2.1 million in the prior year, primarily due to lower volume versus last year.
Our Rialto segment produced operating earnings of $1.9 million compared to $4.6 million in the prior year, both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The investment management business contributed $23.2 million of earnings, which includes $1.5 million of equity in earnings from the real estate funds and $21.7 million of management fees and other.
At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Funds I and II combined now totals $136 million. Rialto mortgage finance operations contributed $380 million of commercial loans into 2 securitizations, with an average margin of 1.6%, totaling earnings of $3.9 million for the quarter, and that was before their G&A expenses.
Our direct investments had earnings of $1.8 million, and Rialto G&A and other expenses were $20 million for the quarter, and interest expense was about $7 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $112 million of cash.
The Multifamily segment delivered a $12.2 million operating profit in the first quarter, primarily driven by the segment's $20.4 million share of a gain from the sales and operating property as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses.
The apartment communities sale this quarter was in Mountain View California and was sold to a firm providing corporate housing for companies, including Google and Facebook. This will be the most profitable apartment communities sale this year.
We ended the quarter with 6 completed and operating properties, 28 under construction, 5 of which are in lease up, totaling over 8,000 apartments, with a total development cost of approximately $2.1 billion. 
Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 28%. The rate was benefited by a favorable settlement with the IRS as well as the extension of the new home energy efficiency credit. The remaining quarters of the year should have a tax rate of approximately 34%.
Our Southeast Florida division has grown successfully and was operating from Vero beach to Miami. As the result in the first quarter, we split the division into 2 operating divisions to maximize operational efficiencies. The Southeast Florida segment no longer needs the reportable segment criteria and is now part of the homebuilding East segment.
Turning to the balance sheet. Liquidity remained strong with approximately $511 million of homebuilding cash and $500 million of borrowings under our $1.6 billion revolving credit facility. Our leverage improved by 240 basis points year-over-year as our homebuilding net debt-to-total capital was reduced to 45.3%. We grew stockholders equity by 18% to $5.8 billion, and our book value per share increased to $27.11 per share.
During the quarter, we converted $163 million of our 2.75% convertible notes for $163 million of cash and $3.6 million of shares with an average price of approximately $44. At quarter end, the remaining balance to be converted was $71 million.
In March, we issued $500 million of 5-year senior notes at 4.75%, which will be used for working capital and to retire our $250 million, 6.5% senior notes. This will continue to reduce our borrowing rate while extending our maturities.
Finally, I would like to update our 2016 goals. 2016 homebuilding goals are right on track with the guidance we gave in December, with just a couple of quarterly refinements. Deliveries are still on track to be between 26,500 and 27,000 homes. We expect the backlog conversion ratio in a range of 80% to 85% for Q2, 75% to 80% for Q3 and 90% to 95% for Q4. 
Operating margins are still on track to be flat to down 50 basis points for the entire year. The full year gross margin is still expected to be in a range of 23% to 24%, the second and third quarter are expected to be at the low end of this range and the fourth quarter is expected to be at the high end of the range. We are still on track to achieve the lowest SG&A percentage in our company's history in 2016, with the greatest leverage coming in our higher delivery quarters in the second half of the year.
Our other company goals are all on track except given the turmoil in the capital markets, we now expect Rialto to earn between $15 million and $20 million for 2016, and that's weighted more heavily towards the fourth quarter.
We're off to a strong start in 2016. And with that, let me turn it back to the operator and open it up for questions."

Pretty much spread across every operating territory that we've got, and I'll address Houston in a little bit. We saw that with regard to both home sales activity as well as pricing. So we're optimistic that we're entering the sales season although we're at the very beginning stages, because our quarter ended in February. Geographically, we saw the numbers are pretty similar. Probably our toughest market was Houston. Sales were down 3%. But I think we're outperforming the market there, because on the new home side, as we calculated, the market was down about 10% during this -- the comparable period. We saw good pricing power because we are, as Stuart said and Bruce mentioned earlier, balancing pace and price there. Sales prices were up about 5%. The margin took it a little bit on the chin, because we're keeping our inventory active, and we are optimistic that we're going to -- pace starts to deal with the market on the higher price points. The lower price points still performing pretty well. But once you get above $350,000, $400,000, it's down quite a bit. And we anticipate the numbers that you're seeing in the magnitude, as I said last quarter, around 5%, 6% down for the year is where we think we're going to end up. But we have tapered back our starts, given some of the weakness on the higher end. Jon, you want to talk about any Western markets?"

At Valencia, we're seeing over 3 sales per month per community. That shows very good activity in those markets. Northern California, the Bay Area remains very strong, really defined by a shortage of both housing and, particularly, in Silicon Valley, by shortage of skilled labor in the tech and biotech world. So that continues to fuel demand there. And then in Sacramento, we've seen a nice recovery with that becoming a strong market. Inland Empire and Central Valley, I describe more stable, good markets, healthy, not as robust as Northern and Southern California. And then across the rest of the West, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, all very stable markets. And then in the Pacific Northwest, we see continued good strength up there, again defined by a very strong job demand and very short supply of housing."

But we are underwriting deals today north of 20% across the board, and we're being relatively conservative with regard to pricing.

The first part of that is the migration from conventional to digital marketing. If you think about it, conventional marketing is going to a newspaper ad and basically shotgunning across the wide population a message that might or might not resonate with that population. Using an example, we think of first-time homebuyers as most likely to decide to purchase a home when they're getting married or when they're  having children. In a digital platform, we can target our message to people who are looking for wedding dresses or purchasing cribs. That's a more targeted, focused audience, and it costs a lot less to target that group. Digital marketing enables a greater penetration to the people that we want to hear our message, less scattered delivery of our message at a much, much lower cost. That's been driving our marketing and advertising cost down, and we're at the front end of that. There are other benefits that will flow from that as we become more proficient at that form of marketing, and I think that our industry and our company are at the front end of really redefining what that cost structure can look like."

Think of the homebuilding business more like a cruise ship than a speedboat. There's a lot of momentum in the direction that we're headed. It's hard to turn in short distances. The land acquisition program is that kind of a momentum program. We start negotiating land position years in advance of actually closing them. Rick has already articulated that our land spend this quarter, in large part, derived from negotiations and contracts that were entered into 2 and 3 years ago. So as we look out towards future quarters, we're going to see the work, the redirection that was put in place 2 years earlier. So over the next quarters and over the next couple of years, we'll see our land spend subside as a percentage of total revenues, and we'll see the impact of that soft pivot. As I articulated, our land today as we focus on land acquisition is generally targeted towards 2- and 3-year duration land purchases.

Really, homebuilding, if you look at it, step back from it, rode through some pretty tumultuous timing in the first quarter, pretty much unscathed. There might have been some pullback in some consumer confidence, and we all sat kind of on the edge of our seats waiting to see how the spring selling season might present itself. And I think there was a lot of question, as questions about recession in the U.S. economy started to kind of gain steam among the economists. So I think that what I was trying to express is that it was a shock to the system. There were some impacts to certain parts of our business though they were minor. The homebuilding side really rode through it intact, and there was a little bit of anxiety in terms of anticipation about what might evolve.

In the markets of Texas, Carolinas, Atlanta, Florida, those areas we've been targeting for the last year or so, couple of years to increase our first-time presence by about 10% to 20%. Most of that focus going back a couple of years ago was in securing land positions that were more closer to where people wanted to live than in the tertiary areas. And you can do that generally in the markets that we've talked about, because there is still good employment, there's good trend. As a result of that, those positions are going to be higher IRR type of opportunities and lower gross margin opportunities, because you just don't have the juice in those deals to really get a higher margin. They are more retail-oriented positions. That's not to suggest that we aren't moving out into a little bit further commute-oriented places. But you won't see us going out outside of what I would call core markets. Hopefully, that answers your question."

And in that regard, I think that we continue to see fairly strong demand. I think affordability is a looming question as prices have tended to go up. They tend to go up, because the supply, we read about it, we see it all the time, both on existing homes and new homes is fairly tight and the demand is emerging. It hasn't emerged, but it's still emerging. And I think there is a sizable pent-up demand. Your question about move-up purchasers, in the market, we're generally still seeing relative strength across the board from first-time buyers all the way through to move-up. There are certain markets that are a little bit different. The Houston market, as we've noted, has been softer at the higher end. The California markets have remained robust. So it's not a national picture anymore. We have to look at local markets more directly, but we're still seeing strength. I think the thing to remember for everyone in the back of their mind is that you have to measure affordability against the alternative, and the alternative is what does the rental market look like, what is the rental option. And with rental rates moving up, more and more people are thinking to kind of stabilize their outflow of capital -- of personal capital into the housing cost by purchasing as opposed to renting, because, on an annual basis, the rental rates are going up. So that picture is one that continues to define the housing markets today, a production deficit, supply is tight, demand is growing, rental rates are going up and the affordability picture is a bit of a question. But I think in the mix, it probably gives way to a strong, consistent slowly growing housing market.
And with that, I think we're going to bring it to a close and say thank you all for joining us and we look forward to continuing to report on our progress."

Some of this group will join for our Q&A period.
I'm going to give some brief remarks to begin about the business, Bruce is going to jump in and break down our financial picture, and then as always, we're going to open up to Q&A. [Operator Instructions]
So let me begin, and let me begin by saying that our first quarter 2016 marks the beginning of yet another year of strong operating results for the company. Even while the month of December was defined by the first interest rate hike by the Fed since the Great Recession, which turned into capital market turbulence and fears of recession as we entered calendar 2016, we have seen only mild negative impacts to our business and have continued to be able to perform as expected.
The management teams across our platform has -- have recognized the challenges of these sometimes complicated market conditions and have adjusted strategies to meet those challenges and have often turned them into unique opportunities. Each segment of our company has positioned itself for continued performance in 2016 and beyond, and we believe that we remain very well positioned to execute our operating plans and strategies in each of those segments.
In light of the Fed's move in interest rates early in this quarter and the turbulent market conditions that followed, let me speak briefly about our outlook for the housing market in general. There've  been some questions raised about the relationship between housing and interest rates, about the possibility of recession, about consumer confidence in a globally terror-stricken world and about the implications of a god-awful election season in the United States. In times like these, it's probably best to put the blinders on and focus on the road ahead, because it seems almost impossible to avoid the distractions of the environment around.
To answer the questions directly, we feel certain that modest moves in interest rates tied to low unemployment and some wage growth will be a net positive for housing. We do not see the telltale signs of recession. Global terror seems to highlight that the U.S. is the safest place to be and to invest in the world and keeps U.S. citizens focused right here at home. And as for the election, well, they say that America always gets to the right answer right after we've tried all the wrong ones. We'll see. 
As we've noted consistently over the past few years, the overall housing market has been generally defined by a rather large production deficit, and this has resulted in a growing pent-up demand. Stronger general economic conditions, including lower unemployment, modest wage growth and general consumer confidence are still driving consumers to form new households and to rent and to purchase apartments and homes. We expect that demand will continue to build and come to the market over the next years and will drive increased production as the deficit in housing stock ultimately needs to be replenished.
Land and labor shortages will continue to constrain supply and constrain the ability to quickly respond to growing demand, while the mortgage market will continue to constrain purchasers' access to mortgages. These conditions will continue to result in slow and steady positive homebuilding market conditions and will enable slow, steady, though sometimes erratic growth across our platform.
This has been our consistent guiding theme for the past years, and we've mapped our strategy around this view. Even with the somewhat erratic conditions that defined the first quarter, we've remained resolute in our view and have adhered to our strategy.
Against this backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating segments. Our for-sale homebuilding operations have performed extremely well in the first quarter. Our results reflect slow but steady growth in the over homebuilding market as our new orders increased 10% year-over-year. Even while continued labor shortages and land and construction cost increases have tested our ability to match sales and delivery pace, our management team has carefully managed sales prices, maximized margin and focused on reducing SG&A to offset and maintain strong net operating margins.
We've noted in the past quarter conference calls that given the now mature recovery, we have been and continue to carefully manage our growth in order to grow our bottom line and to drive strong cash flow. We've moderated our growth target to achieve a growth rate in the 8% to 10% range, as we've redirected our management efforts towards creating operating efficiencies and leveraging SG&A.
We've also talked consistently about a soft pivot in our land strategy away from the land-heavy acquisition strategy in the early stages of the recovery, and we are now targeting land acquisition with a shorter 2- to 3-year average life.
Generally, we've moderated our land spend as a percent of revenues, and this will be reflected in future quarters. This has been and will continue to be the strategy driving our homebuilding platform, as we manage land acquisitions to taper the growth rate in both community count and home sales.
With less pressure on growth rate, we can intensify management focus on driving bottom line growth, cash flow and maximizing pricing power, while using innovative strategies to drive SG&A down.
Under a company mantra of what we can manage we can change, we are focused on changing and improving quite a lot in operations. As one example of this focus, we've been working on reducing customer acquisition costs. We've been moving our spend away from conventional marketing and advertising to a digital platform. We've learned that digital advertising can be much more targeted and much less expensive. We believe that once fully implemented, we will see up to a 50 basis point reduction in SG&A, while driving an increase in qualified traffic. In the current quarter, we are already starting to see results from this initiative.
With demand growing steadily, land limited, labor tight and constrained mortgage availability, we feel that we're in an excellent environment to run our business at a steady and consistent growth rate, with strong bottom line profitability and strong cash flow by measuring and changing our way to greater efficiency and performance in our core for-sale homebuilding segment.
Next, our financial services group has had an outstanding first quarter as well. While the financial services operations have grown alongside our core homebuilding business, we've also benefited historically from a strong, though sometimes erratic, refi market as well as from expansion of retail opportunities in both our mortgage and titled platforms. These sidecar opportunities will continue to expand in 2016. 
Our strategy for the future for Lennar's financial services continues to be to construct and maintain a fully self-sufficient financial services platform that benefits from Lennar homebuilding business but drives profitability from retail operations as well.
Bruce Gross oversees this operation and will discuss it further in his comments.
The first quarter has continued to display our outstanding positioning for LMC, Lennar Multifamily Communities, as well. We closed 1 property in the quarter and continued to develop our extensive over $6.5 billion pipeline of quality properties across the country.
Our multifamily program continues to complement our for-sale operation. Since household formation has recovered at a slower rate than expected and new households have been more inclined to rent than purchase, we address these markets with rental communities that are desired or can be afforded. First-time home purchasers have come back to the housing market more slowly than they have historically and more slowly than expected. While approximately 30% of our for-sale homebuilding business continues to be geared to first-time home purchasers, our broader new household strategy has been aimed primarily at the rental market. 
We've continued to expand our national footprint and grow from a merchant build program to a build-to-own program. In the first quarter, we got equity commitments for an additional $300 million for our Lennar Multifamily Venture to bring our raise to just over $1.4 billion. Our apartment strategy is proving to be very well-timed, as rental rates continue to climb and vacancies are at historic lows. More rental product is going to continue to be needed, and we are well positioned to continue to fill this need and grow our Multifamily platform.
Also in the first quarter, our Rialto segment saw both challenges and opportunity. While the collapse of the capital markets in the beginning of the calendar year negatively impacted current quarter earnings for Rialto, the volatility did create unique opportunities for investment for the future. During the quarter, volatility within the capital markets pressured the pricing on a variety of fixed income products, including new-issued commercial mortgage-backed securities. Accordingly, Rialto mortgage finance, RMF, saw its net spread dwindle to unusually low levels while volume dropped as well.
Although profit expectations were missed, excellent management kept us in the black in a stressed market, and Rialto was able to make strategic purchases of CMBS B-Pieces at advantage prices for future profitability.
Overall, our Rialto platform enables us to invest across real estate and financial product types as an opportunistic play on the long duration of this economic recovery. The dysfunction in the financial market, along with new risk retention rules, will ultimately work to benefit -- to the benefit of Rialto's core competence in CMBS and financial products and we'll continue to grow as a best-in-class manager.
Finally, let me mention briefly our FivePoint properties strategic investment and its management team, which positions us to continue to benefit from some of the best-located land in California as that market continues to improve. As noted in our last conference call, FivePoint has confidentially filed a registration statement for an initial public offering. Of course, the difficult market conditions of the first quarter have kept us on the sidelines, but we'll keep you posted as further information becomes available.
In conclusion, let me say that we're very pleased to prevent -- to present our first quarter results this morning. We feel confident that our view of the market and the strategies that define our business segments have worked well to position us for continued performance and for future growth. As I've said in the past many times, we are very confident that we, at Lennar, have the right people, the right programs and the right timing to continue to perform this year and into the future.
With that, let me turn you over to Bruce."

Our net earnings for the first quarter were $144 million, which is a 25% increase over the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 25% in the first quarter, driven by a 12% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and a 12% increase in average selling price to $365,000. 
Our gross margin on home sales in the first quarter was 22.7%, which was in line with our expectations. The prior year's gross margin percentage was 23.1%. The decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land cost. 
Sales incentives as a percent of home sales revenue continue to decline as this quarter was 5.6% versus 6.3% in the prior year. Gross margin percentages were once again highest in the East and West regions. Direct construction costs for our single-family detached homes were up 5% year-over-year to approximately $53 per square foot, and that was driven primarily by labor increases. 
Our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of home sales revenue improved 60 basis points to 10.8% in the first quarter. We were successful in improving SG&A operating leverage by growing volume organically in our existing homebuilding divisions, and additionally, we continue to see the benefits of our focus on digital marketing. This resulted in the lowest first quarter SG&A percentage in our history.
Operating margins on home sales also improved, and this was improved by 20 basis points to 11.9% in the first quarter. This quarter, we opened 62 new communities to end the quarter with 684 net active communities. New home owners increased 10%, and new order dollar value increased 15% for the quarter. Our sales pace was slightly higher compared to the prior year at 2.9 sales per community per month versus 2.8 in the prior year. The cancellation rate decreased to 15% in the first quarter from 16% in the prior year.
In the first quarter, we purchased 10,300 homesites, totaling $537 million versus $421 million in the prior year's quarter. We continue to focus on our soft pivot land strategy. However, our land spend in 2016 is weighted more heavily to the first half of the year. Our homesites owned and controlled now total 168,000 homesites of which 132,000 are owned and 36,000 are controlled.
We continue to carefully manage inventory as our completed unsold inventory ended the quarter with approximately 1,200 homes, which is in our normal range of 1 to 2 per community.
Our Financial Services business segment had strong results with operating earnings of $14.9 million and that compared to $15.5 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income decreased to $13 million from $14 million in the prior year, and mortgage originations increased 2% to $1.7 billion from $1.6  billion in the prior year. Refinance volume decreased 47% year-over-year, which created a more competitive market for the remaining purchase business. We did, however, increase our purchase origination volume by 17% as a result of increased Lennar home deliveries and an expanded retail presence.
The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers improved to 82% this quarter from 79% in the prior year. Our title company's profit decreased slightly to $2 million in the quarter from $2.1 million in the prior year, primarily due to lower volume versus last year.
Our Rialto segment produced operating earnings of $1.9 million compared to $4.6 million in the prior year; both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The investment management business contributed $23.2 million of earnings, which includes $1.5 million of equity in earnings from the real estate funds and $21.7 million of management fees and other.
At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Funds I and II combined now totals $136 million. Rialto mortgage finance operations contributed $380 million of commercial loans into 2 securitizations, with an average margin of 1.6%, totaling earnings of $3.9 million for the quarter, and that was before their G&A expenses.
Our direct investments had earnings of $1.8 million, and Rialto G&A and other expenses were $20 million for the quarter, and interest expense was about $7 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $112 million of cash.
The Multifamily segment delivered a $12.2 million operating profit in the first quarter, primarily driven by the segment's $20.4 million share of a gain from the sales and operating property as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses.
The apartment community sale this quarter was in Mountain View, California and was sold to a firm providing corporate housing for companies, including Google and Facebook. This will be the most profitable apartment community sale this year.
We ended the quarter with 6 completed and operating properties, 28 under construction -- 5 of which are in lease up -- totaling over 8,000 apartments, with a total development cost of approximately $2.1 billion. 
Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 28%. The rate was benefited by a favorable settlement with the IRS as well as the extension of the new home energy efficiency credit. The remaining quarters of the year should have a tax rate of approximately 34%.
Our Southeast Florida division has grown successfully and was operating from Vero Beach to Miami. As the result in the first quarter, we split the division into 2 operating divisions to maximize operational efficiencies. The Southeast Florida segment no longer meets the reportable segment criteria and is now part of the homebuilding East segment.
Turning to the balance sheet. Liquidity remained strong with approximately $511 million of homebuilding cash and $500 million of borrowings under our $1.6 billion revolving credit facility. Our leverage improved by 240 basis points year-over-year as our homebuilding net debt-to-total capital was reduced to 45.3%. We grew stockholders equity by 18% to $5.8 billion, and our book value per share increased to $27.11 per share.
During the quarter, we converted $163 million of our 2.75% convertible notes for $163 million of cash and $3.6 million of shares with an average price of approximately $44. At quarter end, the remaining balance to be converted was $71 million.
In March, we issued $500 million of 5-year senior notes at 4.75%, which will be used for working capital and to retire our $250 million, 6.5% senior notes. This will continue to reduce our borrowing rate while extending our maturities.
Finally, I would like to update our 2016 goals. 2016 homebuilding goals are right on track with the guidance we gave in December, with just a couple of quarterly refinements. Deliveries are still on track to be between 26,500 and 27,000 homes. We expect the backlog conversion ratio in a range of 80% to 85% for Q2, 75% to 80% for Q3 and 90% to 95% for Q4. 
Operating margins are still on track to be flat to down 50 basis points for the entire year. The full year gross margin is still expected to be in a range of 23% to 24%. The second and third quarter are expected to be at the low end of this range and the fourth quarter is expected to be at the high end of the range. We are still on track to achieve the lowest SG&A percentage in our company's history in 2016, with the greatest leverage coming in our higher-delivery quarters in the second half of the year.
Our other company goals are all on track except given the turmoil in the capital markets, we now expect Rialto to earn between $15 million and $20 million for 2016, and that's weighted more heavily towards the fourth quarter.
We're off to a strong start in 2016. And with that, let me turn it back to the operator and open it up for questions."

We saw that with regard to both home sales activity as well as pricing. So we're optimistic that we're entering the sales season although we're at the very beginning stages, because our quarter ended in February. Geographically, we saw the numbers are pretty similar. Probably our toughest market was Houston. Sales were down 3%. But I think we're outperforming the market there, because on the new home side, as we calculate it, the market was down about 10% during this -- the comparable period. We saw good pricing power because we are, as Stuart said and Bruce mentioned earlier, balancing pace and price there. Sales prices were up about 5%. The margin took it a little bit on the chin, because we're keeping our inventory active, and we are optimistic that we're going to -- pace starts to deal with the market on the higher price point. The lower price point's still performing pretty well. But once you get above $350,000, $400,000, it's down quite a bit.

That's not only supported by our activity, but when you look at our FivePoint master-planned communities at the Great Park, you're seeing that same seasonality Rick described, but selling at almost 4 sales per month per community for the builders at the Great Park. At Valencia, we're seeing over 3 sales per month per community. So it shows very good activity in those markets. Northern California, the Bay Area remains very strong, really defined by a shortage of both housing and, particularly, in Silicon Valley, by a shortage of skilled labor in the tech and biotech world. So that continues to fuel demand there. And then in Sacramento, we've seen a nice recovery where that's become a strong market.

Stuart said you're managing what you can measure. And I'm not really asking about 2016, but as a company, when you're thinking about net margin and profitability going forward in '17 and '18, are you thinking that like a 20% plus or a 22% gross margin is sustainable, given current pricing trends and land costs?

Clearly, we're continuing to benefit from some of the land that we purchased in the last cycle going back to 2009, and some of the land that we're continuing to close was put under contract a couple of years back. As we move later in the cycle, it's going to be more difficult to keep the margins up where they are now. But we are underwriting deals today north of 20% across the board, and we're being relatively conservative with regard to pricing. So as we look at it, the company has historically done, produced a margin that's north of 20%, and it's the balance of buying finished homesites on a retail basis and doing some pivot and doing some land development where you've got some wholesale purchasing."

The first part of that is a migration from conventional to digital marketing. If you think about it, conventional marketing is going to a newspaper ad and basically shotgunning across a wide population a message that might or might not resonate with that population. Using an example, we think of first-time homebuyers as most likely to decide to purchase a home when they're getting married or when they're  having children. In a digital platform, we can target our message to people who are looking for wedding dresses or purchasing cribs. That's a more targeted, focused audience, and it costs a lot less to target that group. Digital marketing enables a greater penetration to the people that we want to hear our message, less scattered delivery of our message at a much, much lower cost. That's been driving our marketing and advertising costs down, and we're at the front end of that. There are other benefits that will flow from that as we become more proficient at that form of marketing, and I think that our industry and our company are at the front end of really redefining what that cost structure can look like."

Think of the homebuilding business more like a cruise ship than a speedboat. There's a lot of momentum in the direction that we're headed. It's hard to turn in short distances. The land acquisition program is that kind of a momentum program. We start negotiating land positions years in advance of actually closing them. Rick has already articulated that our land spend this quarter, in large part, derived from negotiations and contracts that were entered into 2 and 3 years ago. So as we look out towards future quarters, we're going to see the work, the redirection that was put in place 2 years earlier. So over the next quarters and over the next couple of years, we'll see our land spend subside as a percentage of total revenues, and we'll see the impact of that soft pivot. As I articulated, our land today as we focus on land acquisition is generally targeted towards 2- and 3-year duration land purchases. That doesn't mean where we find a unique opportunity that we won't buy something larger, we most certainly will, because we're opportunistic in that way, but it's got to be priced in a certain way.

And clearly, within the Lennar environment, the biggest shock rippled through RMF and the capital markets' approach through Rialto. But relative to our company, it was relatively minor in scope. Really, homebuilding, if you look at it, step back from it, rode through some pretty tumultuous timing in the first quarter, pretty much unscathed. There might have been some pullback in some consumer confidence, and we all sat kind of on the edge of our seats waiting to see how the spring selling season might present itself. And I think there was a lot of question, as questions about recession in the U.S. economy started to kind of gain steam among the economists. So I think that what I was trying to express is that it was a shock to the system. There were some impacts to certain parts of our business though they were minor. The homebuilding side really rode through it intact, and there was a little bit of anxiety in terms of anticipation about what might evolve. And I still think that people are staying tuned, because I don't think that there's a complete view that we're out of the woods. So we're going to have to wait and see what the Fed says and see how the markets present themselves. I hope I communicated that all right."

In terms of cash flow, as noted in answer to an earlier question, turning the tide on land acquisition and actually, turning to that real cash flow program with a lower growth rate and a soft pivot in our land strategy will take some quarters still ahead of us. But with our ancillary businesses at least neutral, some of them cash flowing positive, apartments still being somewhat of a cash flow negative, we really think as we get into 2017, we have a fortified balance sheet, we continue to recast our business with our soft pivot, I think that we're going to see that cash starts to come in. It's most likely to start to reduce our debt dependence, and that's where our focus will be initially. And then ultimately, with excess cash from operations, we will start to buy back stock, but that's not going to happen in 2016."

And in that regard, I think that we continue to see fairly strong demand. I think affordability is a looming question as prices have tended to go up. They tend to go up because the supply -- we read about it, we see it all the time, both on existing homes and new homes -- is fairly tight and the demand is emerging. It hasn't emerged, but it's still emerging. And I think that there is a sizable pent-up demand. Your question about move-up purchasers, in the market, we're generally still seeing relative strength across the board from first-time buyers all the way through to move-up. There are certain markets that are a little bit different. The Houston market, as we've noted, has been softer at the higher end. The California markets have remained robust. So it's not a national picture anymore. We have to look at local markets more directly, but we're still seeing strength. I think the thing to remember for everyone in the back of their mind is that you have to measure affordability against the alternative, and the alternative is what does the rental market look like, what is the rental option? And with rental rates moving up, more and more people are thinking to kind of stabilize their outflow of capital -- of personal capital into their housing costs by purchasing as opposed to renting, because, on an annual basis, the rental rates are going up. So that picture is one that continues to define the housing markets today -- a production deficit, supply is tight, demand is growing, rental rates are going up and the affordability picture is a bit of a question. But I think in the mix, it probably gives way to a strong, consistent slowly growing housing market.

And then, as always, we will open up to Q&A. 
We would like to request, as well we always do, that during the Q&A period, each of our participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can get as many participants as possible.
So let me go ahead and begin and say that our second quarter 2016 results reflect another quarter of strong operating results for our company. We've continued to benefit from a slow and steady housing market recovery that has continued to define the U.S. housing market environment. And we've crafted specific strategies within our company for our business that have positioned us well to maximize opportunity in these market conditions. 
As we've noted consistently over the past years, the overall housing market has been generally defined by a rather large production deficit that has continue to grow over the past year's. While questions had been raised as to the real normalized levels of production that are required to serve the U.S. current population, we believe that production levels in the 1 million to 1.2 million starts per year range are still too low for the needs of American household growth that is now normalizing. While measuring current production levels against historical norms of 1.5 million starts per year might be flawed logic as there may be a new normal, we believe this of every low inventory levels in existing and new homes and the low vacancy rate and high and growing rental rates for apartments indicate that we are in short supply nationally. With that said, it's important to note that the housing market is not really a national market. Instead, it's a large number of very local markets each with different dynamics that are averaged together to generate some sometimes quirky results. 
With that said, we believe that there continues to be out growing pent-up demand for dwellings of all types across the country, though stronger in some markets than others, in this demand will continue to propel a continued, long cycle, slow and steady market improvement. 
While demand has been constrained by limited access to mortgages, stronger general economic condition, including lower unemployment, modest wage growth and general consumer confidence, are still driving consumers to form new households and to purchase homes and to rent apartments. We expect that demand will continue to build and come to the market over the next years and that will drive increased production as the deficit and housing stock ultimately needs to be replenished. Nevertheless,, land and labor shortages will continue to be limiting factors and will constrained supply and restrict the ability to quickly respond to growing demand while the mortgage markets in higher rents will continue to constrain in that demand.
We expect that these conditions will continue to result in a slow and steady positive homebuilding market and will enable slow steady, though sometimes erratic growth, throughout the industry. This has been our consistent guiding theme over the past years, and we have mapped our strategy around this view. 
Each segment of our company has positioned itself for continued performance in 2016 and beyond, and we believe that we remain well-positioned to execute our operating plans and strategies in each of the segments. And then with the somewhat erratic conditions that defined in the early part of this year, we have remained resolute in our view that have generated our strategy. 
Against this backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating segments. Our for-sale homebuilding operations experience in the healthy spring selling season with the sales base of 3.9 sales per month per community. Our results reflect the slow but steady growth in the overall homebuilding market I us our new home orders increased 10% year-over-year while community count grew 4% and our average sales price grew 4% to $362,000. 
Even while continued labor shortages and land and construction cost increases have tested our ability to mac's sales and delivery pace, our management team has carefully managed sales prices, maximize margins and focus on reducing SG&A to offset and maintain a strong net operating margin, which came in at 13.9%. As we've noted in past conference calls, we have adjusted our for-sale housing strategy as the recovery has matured and then pricing has adjusted to that recovery. There are 3 components of our core homebuilding segment strategy. They are: Soft pivot; slower growth; and focus on SG&A.
To begin, we've talked consistently about our soft pivot land strategy over the past years, away from the land-heavy acquisition strategy in the early stages of the recovery. And we are now targeting land acquisitions with the shorter 2 to 3-year average life. Our more recent quarterly reports have demonstrated that we've moderated our land spend as a percent of homebuilding revenues. And this has, and we'll continue to be, a core strategy driving our homebuilding platform as we manage land acquisitions to taper the growth rate in both community count and home sales. 
Second, we've noted in past quarter conference call that given our and now mature recovery, we have been and continue to carefully manage and limit our growth in order to grow the bottom line and to drive strong cash flow. We have moderated our topline growth targets to a chief our growth rate in the 7% to 10% range as we've redirected our management efforts towards maximizing our net operating margin. Third, with less pressure on the topline growth rate, we can intensify management focus on driving faster bottom line growth and cash flow by maximizing pricing power and using innovative strategies to drive our SG&A down. 
Under the company mantra of what we can measure we can change, we are focused on changing and improving all elements of our operation. As an example, last quarter, we highlighted that we've been working on reducing customer acquisition cost. We've been moving our advertising and marketing spend away from conventional marketing like newspaper and billboard advertising to a purely digital platform. 
In the current quarter's results, we're continuing to see the benefit of this management focus as a significant portion of our SG&A reduction can be attributed to this initiative. It is noteworthy that this quarter's SG&A of 9.3% is the lowest second quarter SG&A in our company's history. With demand growing steadily, land limited, labor tight and constrained mortgage availability, we believe that our three-pronged strategy for our homebuilding segment positions us well for this slow but steady growth environment. We feel that we can 1 our business at a steady and consistent growth rate with strong bottom line profitability and cash flow by measuring and changing our way to greater efficiency and performance in our core for-sale homebuilding segment.
Moving on, our financial services group has an outstanding second quarter as well. While the Financial Services operations have grown alongside our core homebuilding business, we've also benefited from a strong, though sometimes erratic, we find market as well as from the expansion of retail opportunities in both our mortgage and titled platforms. These sidecar opportunities are continuing to expand as we move through 2016. Our strategies for the future of Lennar Financial Services continues to be to continue to construct and maintain a fully self-sufficient Financial Services platform that benefits from Lennar homebuilding business but drives profitability from retail operations as well. Bruce Gross oversees this operation and will discuss this further in his comments. 
Next, our Multifamily program continues to develop as a leading blue-chip developer of apartment communities across the country. The second quarter has continued an outstanding run for LMC, Lennar Multifamily Communities, which continues to complement our for-sale homebuilding operation. Since household formation has recovered as a slower rate than expected and many new households have been more inclined to rent than purchase, we have focused on building well located rental communities to address this market opportunity. First-time home purchasers have come back to the market more slowly than they have historically and more slowly than expected. While approximately 30% of our for-sale homebuilding business continues to be geared to first-time home purchases, our broader new household strategy has targeted the rental market as well.
As we've continued to expand our national footprint, we've matured and evolved from a merchant build program, which was designed to prove our base concept. This beginning phase work extremely well as we have proven our ability to purchase, design, build, stabilize and sell a number of our communities at a growing level of profitability. Having proven in the concept, we have no built were added a build to core platform. This platform enables us to build and retain our outstanding pipeline of properties and benefit from long-term ownership. We have now waste $2 billion for our build to core platform, which will become a long-term cash flow producing fee generating value creation machine. 
And while Multifamily production has generally normalized more rental product -- has generally normalized more rental product is going to continue to be needed, and we are very well-positioned to continue to be careful and site selection while we feel this need and grow our Multifamily platform. Our now almost $7 billion plus apartment strategy is proving to be very well-timed as rental rates continue to climb and vacancies are at very low levels. 
Next, our Rialto segment continued to see challenges of the second quarter. While our Rialto segment continued to see challenges in the second quarter, we continue to see opportunity rising in our asset management business as we get closer to realizing the embedded value of our promote from our Rialto fund investments. We expect to begin to report our promote in the first half of 2017. Additionally, on a current basis, our fund and asset management business showed improved profitability over last year's second quarter, and we expect this trend to continue. 
Unfortunately, volatility within of the capital markets in the first quarter continue to pressure volumes and pricing on new issue commercial mortgage-backed securities into the second quarter, and that continued to negatively impact our mortgage finance business. Nevertheless, while Rialto Mortgage Finance was less of a contributor in the current period than in past quarters, we have been seeing sequential improvement in both volumes and margins for RMF and the capital markets have generally healed, and we expect to improve -- improvement and contributions in the second half of the year. 
Rialto also suffered a one-time write-off resulting from a discrete single assets from a bulk legacy acquisition in 2010. Overall, our Rialto platform enables us to invest across all real estate and financial products and allows us to capitalize on both short-term and long-term duration opportunities throughout the economic cycles. 
While the collapse of the capital markets in the beginning of the calendar year and the one-time water from a single asset negatively impacted year-to-date earnings for Rialto, this volatility has also created unique opportunities for new investments in our asset management business. The dysfunction in the financial market, along with new risk retention rules and banking regulations, will ultimately work to the benefit of Rialto's core competence in CMBS and financial products, and we will continue to grow as the best-in-class asset manager.
And finally, as we noted in our press release, we've successfully completed an important step in the evolution of FivePoint, our strategic large-scale community builder. We contribute and exchanged our interest in 3 strategic joint ventures and our interests in the management company for an investment in the newly formed entity called FivePoint Holdings LLC. This transaction marks the next step in FivePoint's evolution as a strategic developer and manager of large-scale, master-planned communities. It also marks a next step in Lennar's strategic mission to revert to our core homebuilding base. As the recovery matures, FivePoint will operate very independently with a self-contained management team led by Emil Haddad. We simply could not be more excited about the prospects for the future of this one-of-a-kind leader in community development. 
Overall and in conclusion, let me say that we continue to be very pleased to present our second quarter results and our overall progress of this morning. We feel very confident that our view of the market and the strategies that define our business segments have worked very well to position us for continued performance and future growth. And as I said many times before, we are extremely confident that we have the right people, the right programs and the right timing to continue to perform this year and into the future. Now let me turn it over to Bruce."

Our net earnings for the second quarter were $218 million, which is a 19% increase over the prior year.

Our net earnings for the second quarter were $218 million, which is a 19% increase over the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 17% in the second quarter, driven by a 12% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and a 4% year-over-year increase in average selling price to $362,000. 
Our gross margin on home sales in the second quarter was 23.1%, which was in line with our stated goals. The prior year's gross margin percentage was 23.8%. The gross margin defined year-over-year was due primarily to increased land costs. Sales incentives continued to decline as this quarter was 5.7% versus 5.8% in the prior year. Gross margin percent were once again the highest in the East and West regions. 
Direct construction cost increases have moderated compared to the prior year. These costs were up 2% year-over-year to approximately $53 per square foot, driven entirely by labor an offset by a slight decrease in material cost. As Stuart highlighted, we were successful in improving our SG&A operating leverage by growing volume organically in our existing homebuilding divisions, and we continued to see the benefits of our focus on digital marketing. As a result, operating margins improved year-over-year by 10 basis points. 
Equity and loss from unconsolidated subs was $9.6 million in the second quarter compared to equity in earnings of $6.5 million in the prior year. The loss was primarily attributable to the company's share of costs associated with establishing the new FivePoint entity, partially offset by $6.7 million of equity and earnings from one of our unconsolidated entities primarily due to the sale of homesites to third parties. 
Other income was $14.9 million, primarily due to a profit participation from one of our joint ventures, and there is a partial offset of $7 million in the noncontrolling interest line. We opened 88 new communities in the quarter with 692 net active communities. New home orders increased 10% and new order dollar value increased 11% for the quarter. The cancellation rate decreased to 14% in the second quarter from 15% in the prior year. In the second quarter, we purchased 5,300 homesites, totaling $437 million versus $445 million in the prior year's quarter. These numbers aligned with our soft pivot strategy where we're focused on writing shorter duration land. Our homesites owned and controlled now total 166,000 homesites, of which 131,000 are owned and 35,000 are controlled. Our completed unsold inventory ended the quarter with approximately 1,200 homes, which is in our normal range of 1 to 2/3 community.
Turning to Financial Services. This business segment had strong results this quarter with operating earnings of $44.1 million compared to $39.1 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income increased to $36.8 million from $33.5 million in the prior year. Mortgage originations were flat with the prior year at $2.4 billion. The improved earnings is driven by an increase profit per alone due to the favorable interest rate environment. Refinance volume for the company decreased to 12% of total originations from 19% in the prior year, bringing this quarter's purchase origination volume to 88% of total originations. The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers improved to 83% this quarter from 82% in the prior year. Our title company's profit also increased growing to $7.4 million in the quarter from $5.1 million in the prior year primarily due to higher profit per transaction versus the prior year. 
Turning to Rialto. This segment produced an operating loss of $13.8 million compared to operating earnings of $7.6 million in the prior year. Both amounts are a net of noncontrolling interest. The investment management business contributed $26.1 million of earnings, which includes $6.9 million of equity and earnings in the real estate funds and $19.2 million of management fees and other. 
At quarter-end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Funds 1 and 2 now totals $138 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $386 billion of commercial loans into 3 securitizations resulting in earnings of $12.7 million compared with $721 million and $29 million in the prior year, respectively, and these are before their G&A expenses. 
As mentioned previously, the volume decrease was due to the disruption in the CMBS capital markets earlier this year and has taken some time for the new home market to ramp back up. Our direct investments had a loss of $21 million. This included a $16 million write-off of uncollectible receivables at a hospital acquired through the foreclosure of the distressed loan from a 2010 bank portfolio acquisition. A third-party management company operates this hospital. Rialto's G&A and other expenses were $24.9 million for the quarter and interest expense were $6.7 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $104 million of cash. 
The Multifamily segment delivered a $14.9 million operating profit in the quarter, primarily driven by the segment's $15.4 million share of the gain from the sales and operating property and a $5.2 million gain on a third-party land sale, as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses. 
We ended the quarter with 8 completed and operating properties and 32 under construction, 5 of which are in lease up totaling over 9,700 apartments total development cost of approximately $2.6 billion. Including these communities, we had a diversified development pipeline that exceeds $7 billion in over 25,000 apartments. 
Our tax rate for the quarter was 32.2%. The lower rate is a result of our continuing efforts to maximize the new home energy efficiency credit, which was again extended into 2016. The tax rate for future quarters should be approximately 34%. Although we will continue to focus on trying to maximize of this available energy credit. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Liquidity remained strong with approximately $600 million of homebuilding cash and $375 million of borrowings under our $1.6 billion revolving credit facility. Our leverage improved by 390 basis points year-over-year as our homebuilding net debt to total capital was reduced to 43.5%. We grew stockholder's equity by 19% to $6.1 billion and our book value per share increased to 27.92 per share. 
In March, we issued $500 million of 5-year senior notes at 4.75%. And in April, we retired our maturing 6.5% senior notes. In May, we converted the remaining $71 million of our 2.75% convertible notes. And in addition, during the quarter, we early converted approximately $68 million of our 3.25% convertible senior notes with an additional $136  million [ph] converted subsequent to quarter end.
Finally, I would like to update our 2016 goals. 2016 homebuilding goals are right on track with the guidance that we gave at the start of the year was just a couple of quarterly refinements. First, deliveries. 
Deliveries are still on track to be between 26,500 and 27,000 homes for all of 2016. The backlog conversion ratio in the second quarter was 88%, which exceeded the previous guidance of 80% to 85%. We capitalized on a healthy spring selling season and sold and delivered some homes in Q2 that were scheduled for our third quarter. Given that, we now expect our backlog conversion ratio to be around 75% in the third quarter. 
The fourth quarter is still projected to achieve a backlog conversion of at least 90%. Operating margins are still on track to be flat to down 50 basis points for the entire year. The gross margin percent will vary between Q3 and Q4 based on our product mix. Q3 is expected to be between 22.5% and 23%, while the fourth quarter is projected to be between 23.5% and 24%. 
We are still on track to achieve the lowest SG&A in our company's history for the full year with the greatest leverage coming in our fourth quarter. 
Turning to Financial Services. We are assuming we will continue to benefit from the extended low interest rate environment, and we are increasing our Financial Services goal to $130 million tell $135 million of profit for all of 2016. 
Turning to Rialto. We are still on track to growing between $15 million and $20 million for 2016. However, the one-time write-off of the hospital receivables will now bring the range to flat to $5 million of profit for the full year and is still weighted more heavily towards the fourth quarter. 
We are still on track with $50 million to $55 million of profit in the Multifamily segment with the third quarter close to breakeven and strong profit in the fourth quarter. The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income, we expect to be flattish for the third quarter. But now expect the fourth quarter to be the highest profit quarter for this category through 2016 with $20 million to $30 million of profit. 
And finally, our balance sheet is well on its way on its Ted to lower leverage. The soft pivot strategy, the strong earnings contribution and the 400 million 3.25% convertible securities, of which half has already converted through mid-June, should bring us to a net debt-to-total capital in debt 35% to 40% range by year-end. This will position us extremely well as we finish out 2016. 
Let me turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions."

As you look at the things that we've put under contract, we were very careful in, first of all, understanding with their growth of the market was going to be, focus and vacancy levels, focusing on each of products that was close to our assets.

We started with an overlay of homebuilding operations, where we had market data and market intelligence. We understood that we were not dealing with a national apartment market or for-sale markets for that matter, but we were dealing with local markets, and each one would have to be regarded carefully and individually. We mapped out our strategy for investments, for land acquisition. We were careful to avoid markets that look like they were becoming oversaturated. I think Rick and Jon and the entire Multifamily team did an extraordinary job of finding the opportunities where growth would be consistent and where we would have long dated opportunities for a sustained business. And given the fact that we had a very deep research team already established that had an eye towards, not just the rental markets, but also the for-sale markets we think gave us a better window into the market and better strategic positioning. There is a lot of talk about the urban markets being somewhat overbuilt. In most of those instances, those were the markets where we saw the most action and where we didn't get heavily involved or where we did we got involved very early and very attractive pricing. So I think that we are starting to hear, everybody is starting to hear that there might be a little bit more heat in some of the rental markets. What I've heard articulated by one of the best and brightest in the rental market is that we're probably coming to the later innings of a doubleheader, the first game of a doubleheader. We might see a little bit of softness for a period of time. But it looks like and it feels like absorption is going to outstrip any kind of oversupply in fairly short order. And we think that there's a lot of run rates for the Multifamily markets -- for the rental markets going forward."

And we see a pace of overall 5 sales per community per month on average. Certainly, at the lower price point, it absorbs faster. So California, in general, though, it's hard to produce homes at the lower price points because not only at land costs, but also because of impact piece being as significant as they are. But that tends to drive, particularly in Southern California, the Bay Area, a higher sales point. And that higher sales price point clearly, it's hard to get significant momentum above looking at the current levels. We are seeing sustained interest particularly in the Asian or Chinese buyer. We haven't seen that fall off. So if you look at a place like Irvine, where's it's been very significant, we have a good day at the great Park. That's remained very consistent and healthy. Same thing in the Bay Area marketplace. So we're seeing consistency there. Bakersfield probably is off the most in terms of California markets. It's emerge in Houston. It's not as severe their us all back in the energy sector, which is a lot of the job creations that has been in Bakersfield has been job loss in Bakersfield, remains healthy, though, from a Central Valley perspective."

We have initiatives throughout our organization that are designed to use technologies to change the landscape of the way that we are operating our business. Some other examples of that are as simple as in and around technology. We are revamping the entire plumbing system of our technology department to reconfigure in a more efficient manner the way that we input information and ultimately produce reports for people in the field. That seems kind of simplistic. But in a company like ours that has evolved systems over a lot of years, going back and reconfiguring systems with a proper tubing system enables us to reduce of the number of applications that we're actually using in the field with multiple points of input to drive efficient export of data to the people that need to use it on a regular basis. It will enable us to be more accurate. It'll enable us to be a lot more timely approaching real-time distribution of data over the next year or 2. This will, that initiative alone will drive cost down. We view that over the next couple of years, there's a 20 to 50 basis point reduction in SG&A that we'll derive just from that. Now there might be some intermittent takes up in cost, but primarily, the trend will be down. 
In our production arena, we are using our technologies to look at the number of models and the efficiency of the plan designs that we're offering our customers in the field. We're looking at technologies to review and to consolidate the view of SKUs that we're offering across our different markets. All of these things, we view as opportunities to bring another 10, 20, 50 basis points to either the reduction of SG&A or potentially the efficiency of our construction efforts."

You see that embedded in the way that FivePoint has been evolving. If you look at the management team of FivePoint, led by Emil Haddad, who we have been working -- he's been working within the company for over 20 years. The management team is a self-sufficient, independent, highly confident, industry-leading management team that's prepared to operate very independently. And as has been reported, we have been looking at an opportune time to integrate an IPO. The market doesn't happen to be there. But with that said, it's emblematic of the strategies that we've employed. Jeff Krasnoff leads Rialto. Rialto has it self-sufficient team.

We're probably trending to the lower parts of that range. But I think it drives from of the choppiness that's embedded in the system and the way that the year started out.

So I would say that the Multifamily group has interacted very symbiotically with the for-sale group. And it's really worked to our benefit developing a long-term strategy."

The fact is in none of our markets are we a dominant factor. To the contrary, we might have a community or 2 in any of the markets in which we operate in. And our homebuilding operation and pricing per se operates very independently from the way that where pricing rental rates. I would say to steer clear of viewing those, to any kind of relationship in rental rates for-sale pricing as interdependent as it relates to our management team pricing either one."

I'm going to briefly give some remarks, as I've always done, about the business in general. And then Bruce is going to jump in, break down our financial detail and give some further guidance for next year. And then, as always, we will open up to Q&A.
We would like to request, as we always do, that during the Q&A period, each of our participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can get as many participants as possible.
So let me go ahead and begin and say that our second quarter 2016 results reflect another quarter of strong operating results for our company. We've continued to benefit from a slow and steady housing market recovery that has continued to define the U.S. housing market environment. And we have crafted specific strategies within our company for our business that have positioned us well to maximize opportunity in these market conditions.
As we've noted consistently over the past years, the overall housing market has been generally defined by a rather large production deficit that has continued to grow over the past years. While questions have been raised as to the real normalized levels of production that are required to serve the U.S. current population, we believe that production levels in the 1 million to 1.2 million starts per year range are still too low for the needs of American household growth that is now normalizing.
While measuring current production levels against historical norms of 1.5 million starts per year might be flawed logic as there may be a new normal, we believe this a [ph] very low inventory levels in existing and new homes, and the low vacancy rate and high and growing rental rates for apartments indicate that we are in short supply nationally. With that said, it's important to note that the housing market is not really a national market. Instead, it's a large number of very local markets, each with different dynamics that are averaged together to generate some sometimes quirky results.
With that said, we believe that there continues to be a growing pent-up demand for dwellings of all types across the country, though stronger in some markets than others, and this demand will continue to propel a continued, long cycle, slow and steady market improvement.
While demand has been constrained by limited access to mortgages, stronger general economic condition, including lower unemployment, modest wage growth and general consumer confidence, are still driving consumers to form new households and to purchase homes and to rent apartments. We expect that demand will continue to build and come to the market over the next years, and that will drive increased production as the deficit and housing stock ultimately needs to be replenished. Nevertheless, land and labor shortages will continue to be limiting factors and will constrain supply and restrict the ability to quickly respond to growing demand, while the mortgage market and higher rents will continue to constrain that demand.
We expect that these conditions will continue to result in a slow and steady positive homebuilding market and will enable slow, steady, though sometimes erratic growth, throughout the industry. This has been our consistent guiding theme over the past years, and we have mapped our strategy around this view.
Each segment of our company has positioned itself for continued performance in 2016 and beyond, and we believe that we remain well positioned to execute our operating plans and strategies in each of these segments. Even with the somewhat erratic conditions that defined the early part of this year, we have remained resolute in our view that have generated our strategies.
Against this backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating segments. Our for-sale homebuilding operations experienced a healthy spring selling season with a sales pace of 3.9 sales per month per community. Our results reflect the slow but steady growth in the overall homebuilding market as our new home orders increased 10% year-over-year while community count grew 4% and our average sales price grew 4% to $362,000.
Even while continued labor shortages and land and construction cost increases have tested our ability to map sales and delivery pace, our management team has carefully managed sales prices, maximized margins and focused on reducing SG&A to offset and maintain a strong net operating margin, which came in at 13.9%. As we've noted in past conference calls, we have adjusted our for-sale housing strategy as the recovery has matured and land pricing has adjusted to that recovery. There are 3 components of our core homebuilding segment strategy. They are: Soft pivot, slower growth and focus on SG&A.
To begin, we've talked consistently about our soft pivot land strategy over the past years, away from the land-heavy acquisition strategy in the early stages of the recovery, and we're now targeting land acquisitions with a shorter 2- to 3-year average life. Our more recent quarterly reports have demonstrated that we've moderated our land spend as a percent of homebuilding revenues. And this has and will continue to be a core strategy driving our homebuilding platform as we manage land acquisitions to taper the growth rate in both community count and home sales.
Second, we've noted in past quarter conference calls that given our and now mature recovery, we have been and continue to carefully manage and limit our growth in order to grow the bottom line and to drive strong cash flow. We have moderated our top line growth targets to achieve a growth rate in the 7% to 10% range as we've redirected our management efforts towards maximizing our net operating margin.
Third, with less pressure on the top line growth rate, we can intensify management focus on driving faster bottom line growth and cash flow by maximizing pricing power and using innovative strategies to drive our SG&A down. Under the company mantra of what we can measure, we can change, we are focused on changing and improving all elements of our operation. As an example, last quarter, we highlighted that we've been working on reducing customer acquisition costs. We've been moving our advertising and marketing spend away from conventional marketing like newspaper and billboard advertising to a purely digital platform.
In the current quarter's results, we're continuing to see the benefit of this management focus as a significant portion of our SG&A reduction can be attributed to this initiative. It is noteworthy that this quarter's SG&A of 9.3% is the lowest second quarter SG&A in our company's history. With demand growing steadily, land limited, labor tight and constrained mortgage availability, we believe that our three-pronged strategy for our homebuilding segment positions us well for this slow but steady growth environment. We feel that we can run our business at a steady and consistent growth rate with strong bottom line profitability and cash flow by measuring and changing our way to greater efficiency and performance in our core for-sale homebuilding segment.
Moving on, our Financial Services group has an outstanding second quarter as well. While the Financial Services operations have grown alongside our core homebuilding business, we've also benefited from a strong, though sometimes erratic, refi market as well as from the expansion of retail opportunities in both our mortgage and titled platforms. These sidecar opportunities are continuing to expand as we move through 2016.
Our strategies for the future of Lennar Financial Services continues to be to continue to construct and maintain a fully self-sufficient financial services platform that benefits from Lennar Homebuilding business but drives profitability from retail operations as well. Bruce Gross oversees this operation and will discuss it further in his comments.
Next, our Multifamily program continues to develop as a leading blue-chip developer of apartment communities across the country. The second quarter has continued an outstanding run for LMC, Lennar Multifamily Communities, which continues to complement our for-sale homebuilding operation. Since household formation has recovered at a slower rate than expected and many new households have been more inclined to rent than purchase, we have focused on building well-located rental communities to address this market opportunity. First-time home purchasers have come back to the market more slowly than they have historically and more slowly than expected. While approximately 30% of our for-sale homebuilding business continues to be geared to first-time home purchasers, our broader new household strategy has targeted the rental market as well.
As we've continued to expand our national footprint, we've matured and evolved from a merchant build program, which was designed to prove our base concept. This beginning phase worked extremely well as we have proven our ability to purchase, design, build, stabilize and sell a number of our communities at a growing level of profitability. Having proven the concept, we have now built or added a build-to-core platform. This platform enables us to build and retain our outstanding pipeline of properties and benefit from long-term ownership. We have now raised $2 billion for our build-to-core platform, which will become a long-term, cash flow producing, fee-generating value creation machine.
And while Multifamily production has generally normalized, more rental product is going to continue to be needed. And we are very well positioned to continue to be careful in site selection while we fill this need and grow our Multifamily platform. Our now almost $7 billion plus apartment strategy is proving to be very well timed as rental rates continue to climb and vacancies are at very low levels.
Next, our Rialto segment continued to see challenges in the second quarter. While our Rialto segment continued to see challenges in the second quarter, we continue to see opportunity rising in our asset management business as we get closer to realizing the embedded value of our promote from our Rialto fund investments. We expect to begin to report our promote in the first half of 2017. Additionally, on a current basis, our fund and asset management business showed improved profitability over last year's second quarter, and we expect this trend to continue.
Unfortunately, volatility within the capital markets in the first quarter continued to pressure volumes and pricing on new issued commercial mortgage-backed securities into the second quarter, and that continued to negatively impact our mortgage finance business. Nevertheless, while Rialto Mortgage Finance was less of a contributor in the current period than in past quarters, we have been seeing sequential improvements in both volumes and margins for RMF, and the capital markets have generally healed and we expect to improve -- improvement in contributions in the second half of the year. Rialto also suffered a one-time write-off resulting from a discrete single assets from a bulk legacy acquisition in 2010.
Overall, our Rialto platform enables us to invest across all real estate and financial products and allows us to capitalize on both short-term and long-term duration opportunities throughout the economic cycles. While the collapse of the capital markets in the beginning of the calendar year and the one-time write-off from a single asset negatively impacted year-to-date earnings for Rialto, this volatility has also created unique opportunities for new investments in our asset management business. The dysfunction in the financial market, along with new risk retention rules and banking regulations, will ultimately work to the benefit of Rialto's core competence in CMBS and financial products, and we will continue to grow as a best-in-class asset manager.
And finally, as we noted in our press release, we've successfully completed an important step in the evolution of FivePoint, our strategic large-scale community builder. We contributed and exchanged our interest in 3 strategic joint ventures and our interests in the management company for an investment in a newly formed entity called FivePoint Holdings, LLC. This transaction marks the next step in FivePoint's evolution as a strategic developer and manager of large-scale master-planned communities. It also marks a next step in Lennar's strategic mission to revert to our core homebuilding base. As the recovery matures, FivePoint will operate very independently with a self-contained management team led by Emile Haddad. We simply could not be more excited about the prospects for the future of this one-of-a-kind leader in community development.
Overall and in conclusion, let me say that we continue to be very pleased to present our second quarter results and our overall progress this morning. We feel very confident that our view of the market and the strategies that define our business segments have worked very well to position us for continued performance and future growth. And as I said many times before, we are extremely confident that we have the right people, the right programs and the right timing to continue to perform this year and into the future.
Now let me turn over to Bruce."
30763,347075527,1001449,"Lennar Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 21, 2016",2016-06-21,"Earnings Calls","Lennar Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Stuart, and good morning.

Our net earnings for the second quarter were $218 million, which is a 19% increase over the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 17% in the second quarter, driven by a 12% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 4% year-over-year increase in average selling price to $362,000.
Our gross margin on home sales in the second quarter was 23.1%, which was in line with our stated goals. The prior year's gross margin percentage was 23.8%. The gross margin decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land costs. Sales incentives continued to decline as this quarter was 5.7% versus 5.8% in the prior year. Gross margin percents were once again the highest in the East and West regions.
Direct construction cost increases have moderated compared to the prior year. These costs were up 2% year-over-year to approximately $53 per square foot, driven entirely by labor and offset by a slight decrease in material costs. As Stuart highlighted, we were successful in improving our SG&A operating leverage by growing volume organically in our existing homebuilding divisions, and we continued to see the benefits of our focus on digital marketing. As a result, operating margins improved year-over-year by 10 basis points.
Equity and loss from unconsolidated subs was $9.6 million in the second quarter compared to equity in earnings of $6.5 million in the prior year. The loss was primarily attributable to the company's share of costs associated with establishing the new FivePoint entity, partially offset by $6.7 million of equity and earnings from one of our unconsolidated entities primarily due to the sale of homesites to third parties.
Other income was $14.9 million primarily due to a profit participation from one of our joint ventures, and there is a partial offset of $7 million in the noncontrolling interest line. We opened 88 new communities in the quarter with 692 net active communities. New home orders increased 10% and new order dollar value increased 11% for the quarter. The cancellation rate decreased to 14% in the second quarter from 15% in the prior year.
In the second quarter, we purchased 5,300 homesites totaling $437 million versus $445 million in the prior year's quarter. These numbers align with our soft pivot strategy where we're focused on buying shorter duration lands. Our homesites owned and controlled now total 166,000 homesites, of which 131,000 are owned and 35,000 are controlled. Our completed unsold inventory ended the quarter with approximately 1,200 homes, which is in our normal range of 1 to 2  per  community.
Turning to Financial Services. This business segment had strong results this quarter with operating earnings of $44.1 million compared to $39.1 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income increased to $36.8 million from $33.5 million in the prior year. Mortgage originations were flat with the prior year at $2.4 billion. The improved earnings is driven by an increased profit per loan due to the favorable interest rate environment.
Refinance volume for the company decreased to 12% of total originations from 19% in the prior year, bringing this quarter's purchase origination volume to 88% of total originations. The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers improved to 83% this quarter from 82% in the prior year. Our title company's profit also increased, growing to $7.4 million in the quarter from $5.1 million in the prior year primarily due to higher profit per transaction versus the prior year.
Turning to Rialto. This segment produced an operating loss of $13.8 million compared to operating earnings of $7.6 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The investment management business contributed $26.1 million of earnings, which includes $6.9 million of equity and earnings from the real estate funds and $19.2 million of management fees and other.
At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Funds 1 and 2 now totals $138 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $386 million of commercial loans into 3 securitizations resulting in earnings of $12.7 million compared with $721 million and $29 million in the prior year, respectively, and these are before their G&A expenses.
As mentioned previously, the volume decrease was due to the disruption in the CMBS capital markets earlier this year, and it has taken some time for the new home market to ramp back up. Our direct investments had a loss of $21 million. This included a $16 million write-off of uncollectible receivables at a hospital acquired through the foreclosure of the distressed loan from a 2010 bank portfolio acquisition. A third-party management company operates this hospital. Rialto's G&A and other expenses were $24.9 million for the quarter and interest expense were $6.7 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $104 million of cash.
The Multifamily segment delivered a $14.9 million operating profit in the quarter, primarily driven by the segment's $15.4 million share of a gain from the sale of an operating property and a $5.2 million gain on a third-party land sale as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses. We ended the quarter with 8 completed and operating properties and 32 under construction, 5 of which are in lease-up, totaling over 9,700 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $2.6 billion. Including these communities, we had a diversified development pipeline that exceeds $7 billion in over 25,000 apartments.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 32.2%. The lower rate is a result of our continuing efforts to maximize the new home energy efficiency credit, which was again extended into 2016. The tax rate for future quarters should be approximately 34%, although we will continue to focus on trying to maximize this available energy credit.
Turning to the balance sheet. Liquidity remained strong with approximately $600 million of homebuilding cash and $375 million of borrowings under our $1.6 billion revolving credit facility. Our leverage improved by 390 basis points year-over-year as our homebuilding net debt to total capital was reduced to 43.5%. We grew stockholders' equity by 19% to $6.1 billion, and our book value per share increased to $27.92 per share.
In March, we issued $500 million of 5-year senior notes at 4.75%. And in April, we retired our maturing 6.5% senior notes. In May, we converted the remaining $71 million of our 2.75% convertible notes. And in addition, during the quarter, we early converted approximately $68 million of our 3.25% convertible senior notes with an additional $136 million converted subsequent to quarter end.
Finally, I would like to update our 2016 goals. 2016 homebuilding goals are right on track with the guidance that we gave at the start of the year with just a couple of quarterly refinements.
First, deliveries. Deliveries are still on track to be between 26,500 and 27,000 homes for all of 2016. The backlog conversion ratio in the second quarter was 88%, which exceeded the previous guidance of 80% to 85%. We capitalized on a healthy spring selling season and sold and delivered some homes in Q2 that were scheduled for our third quarter. Given that, we now expect our backlog conversion ratio to be around 75% in the third quarter.
The fourth quarter is still projected to achieve a backlog conversion of at least 90%. Operating margins are still on track to be flat to down 50 basis points for the entire year. The gross margin percent will vary between Q3 and Q4 based on our product mix. Q3 is expected to be between 22.5% and 23%, while the fourth quarter is projected to be between 23.5% and 24%. We are still on track to achieve the lowest SG&A in our company's history for the full year with the greatest leverage coming in our fourth quarter.
Turning to Financial Services. We are assuming we will continue to benefit from the extended low interest rate environment, and we are increasing our Financial Services goal to $130 million to $135 million of profit for all of 2016.
Turning to Rialto. We are still on track to earn between $15 million and $20 million for 2016. However, the onetime write-off of the hospital receivables will now bring the range to flat to $5 million of profit for the full year and is still weighted more heavily towards the fourth quarter.
We are still on track with $50 million to $55 million of profit in the Multifamily segment with the third quarter close to breakeven and strong profits in the fourth quarter. The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income, we expect to be flattish for the third quarter. But now we expect the fourth quarter to be the highest profit quarter for this category through 2016 with $20 million to $30 million of profit.
And finally, our balance sheet is well on its way on its path to lower leverage. The soft pivot strategy, the strong earnings contribution and the $400 million 3.25% convertible securities, of which half is already converted through mid-June, should bring us to a net debt to total capital in the 35% to 40% range by year-end. This will position us extremely well as we finish out 2016.
Let me turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions."

So if you look at it big picture, Florida was year-over-year sort of flat for us in absorption pace. California, flat. Texas, excluding Houston, was actually improved. Pricing in the Carolinas were improved. And clearly, we do see some lower demand in the higher price points as compared to lower price points. But generally, it's still submarket-driven."

As you look at the things that we've put under contract, we were very careful in, first of all, understanding where the growth in the market was going to be, focusing on vacancy levels, focusing on age of product that was close to our assets.

We started with an overlay of homebuilding operations where we had market data and market intelligence. We understood that we were not dealing with a national apartment market or for-sale markets for that matter, but we were dealing with local markets and each one would have to be regarded carefully and individually. We mapped out our strategy for investment for land acquisition. We were careful to avoid markets that look like they were becoming oversaturated. I think Rick and Jon and the entire Multifamily team did an extraordinary job of finding the opportunities where growth would be consistent and where we would have long dated opportunities for a sustained business. And given the fact that we had a very deep research team already established that had an eye towards, not just the rental markets, but also the for-sale markets, we think, gave us a better window into the market and better strategic positioning. There is a lot of talk about the urban markets being somewhat overbuilt. In most of those instances, those were the markets where we saw the most action and where we didn't get heavily involved or where we did -- we got involved very early at very attractive pricing. So I think that we are starting to hear -- everybody is starting to hear that there might be a little bit more heat in some of the rental markets. What I've heard articulated by one of the best and brightest in the rental market is that we're probably coming to the later innings of a doubleheader, the first game of a doubleheader. We might see a little bit of softness for a period of time. But it looks like and it feels like absorption is going to outstrip any kind of oversupply in fairly short order. And we think that there's a lot of run rate for the Multifamily markets -- for the rental markets going forward."

And we see a pace of over 5 sales per community per month on average. Certainly, at the lower price point, it absorbs faster. California, in general, though, it's hard to produce homes at the lower price points because, not only of land costs, but also because of impact fees being as significant as they are. And so that tends to drive, particularly in Southern California and the Bay Area, a higher sales point. And at that higher sales price point, clearly, it's hard to get significant momentum above, I think, the current levels. We are seeing sustained interest particularly in the Asian or Chinese buyer. We haven't seen that fall off. So if you look at a place like Irvine, where's it's been very significant, we have a good data at the Great Park. That's remained very consistent and healthy. Same thing in the Bay Area marketplace. So we're seeing consistency there. Bakersfield probably is off the most in terms of California markets. It's emerged [ph] at Houston. It's not as severe though, as hurt by the haul back in the energy sector, which is a lot of the job creations that has been in Bakersfield. There has been job loss in Bakersfield.

We have initiatives throughout our organization that are designed to use technologies to change the landscape of the way that we're operating our business. Some other examples of that are as simple as in and around technology. We are revamping the entire plumbing system of our technology department to reconfigure in a more efficient manner the way that we input information and ultimately produce reports for people in the field. That seems kind of simplistic. But in a company like ours that has evolved systems over a lot of years, going back and reconfiguring systems with a proper tubing system enables us to reduce of the number of applications that we're actually using in the field with multiple points of input to drive efficient export of data to the people that need to use it on a regular basis. It'll enable us to be more accurate. It'll enable us to be a lot more timely, approaching real-time distribution of data over the next year or 2. This will, that initiative alone will drive cost down. We view that over the next couple of years, there's a 20 to 50 basis point reduction in SG&A that we'll derive just from that. Now there might be some intermittent ticks up in cost, but primarily, the trend will be down. In our production arena, we are using our technologies to look at the number of models and the efficiency of the plan designs that we're offering our customers in the field. We're looking at technologies to review and to consolidate the view of SKUs that we're offering across our different markets. All of these things, we view as opportunities to bring another 10, 20, 50 basis points to either the reduction of SG&A or potentially the efficiency of our construction efforts."

That business is really well crafted to participate in this ultra regulatory environment that we have run into, where both bank regulation, whether it's Basel III or Dodd-Frank and risk retention rules, all kind of migrate business in the direction of the platform that we've built.

I think generally speaking, you can't time where the choppiness actually exist. And so we left a fairly wide range as we gave guidance at the beginning of the year. We're probably trending to the lower parts of that range. But I think it derives from the choppiness that's embedded in the system and the way that the year started out. And so at the end of the day, I think this is well within kind of the range that we've articulated. I don't think it should be of any concern that we're trending towards the lower part of that range.

[Operator Instructions]
So let me go ahead and begin and say that our second quarter 2016 results reflect another quarter of strong operating results for our company. We've continued to benefit from a slow and steady housing market recovery that has continued to define the U.S. housing market environment. And we have crafted specific strategies within our company for our business that have positioned us well to maximize opportunity in these market conditions.
As we've noted consistently over the past years, the overall housing market has been generally defined by a rather large production deficit that has continued to grow over the past years. While questions have been raised as to the real normalized levels of production that are required to serve the U.S. current population, we believe that production levels in the 1 million to 1.2 million starts per year range are still too low for the needs of American household growth that is now normalizing.
While measuring current production levels against historical norms of 1.5 million starts per year might be flawed logic, as there may be a new normal, we believe that the very low inventory levels in existing and new homes, and the low vacancy rates and high and growing rental rates for apartments, indicate that we are in short supply nationally. With that said, it's important to note that the housing market is not really a national market. Instead, it's a large number of very local markets, each with different dynamics that are averaged together to generate some sometimes quirky results.
With that said, we believe that there continues to be a growing pent-up demand for dwellings of all types across the country, though stronger in some markets than others, and this demand will continue to propel a continued long cycle, slow and steady market improvement.
While demand has been constrained by limited access to mortgages, stronger general economic conditions, including lower unemployment, modest wage growth and general consumer confidence, are still driving consumers to form new households and to purchase homes and to rent apartments. We expect that demand will continue to build and come to the market over the next years, and that will drive increased production as the deficit in housing stock ultimately needs to be replenished. Nevertheless, land and labor shortages will continue to be limiting factors and will constrain supply and restrict the ability to quickly respond to growing demand, while the mortgage market and higher rents will continue to constrain that demand.
We expect that these conditions will continue to result in a slow and steady positive homebuilding market and will enable slow, steady, though sometimes erratic, growth throughout the industry. This has been our consistent guiding theme over the past years, and we have mapped our strategy around this view.
Each segment of our company has positioned itself for continued performance in 2016 and beyond, and we believe that we remain well positioned to execute our operating plans and strategies in each of these segments. Even with the somewhat erratic conditions that defined the early part of this year, we have remained resolute in our view  that have generated our strategies. 
Against this backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating segments. Our for-sale homebuilding operations experienced a healthy spring selling season with a sales pace of 3.9 sales per month per community. Our results reflect the slow but steady growth in the overall homebuilding market as our new home orders increased 10% year-over-year while community count grew 4% and our average sales price grew 4% to $362,000.
Even while continued labor shortages and land and construction cost increases have tested our ability to match sales and delivery pace, our management team has carefully managed sales prices, maximized margins and focused on reducing SG&A to offset and maintain a strong net operating margin, which came in at 13.9%. As we've noted in past conference calls, we have adjusted our for-sale housing strategy as the recovery has matured and land pricing has adjusted to that recovery. There are 3 components of our core homebuilding segment strategy. They are: soft pivot, slower growth and focus on SG&A.
To begin, we've talked consistently about our soft pivot land strategy over the past years, away from the land-heavy acquisition strategy in the early stages of the recovery, and we're now targeting land acquisitions with a shorter 2- to 3-year average life. Our more recent quarterly reports have demonstrated that we've moderated our land spend as a percent of homebuilding revenues. And this has and will continue to be a core strategy driving our homebuilding platform as we manage land acquisitions to taper the growth rate in both community count and home sales.
Second, we've noted in past quarter conference calls that given our now mature recovery, we have been and continue to carefully manage and limit our growth in order to grow the bottom line and to drive strong cash flow. We have moderated our top line growth targets to achieve a growth rate in the 7% to 10% range as we've redirected our management effort towards maximizing our net operating margin.
Third, with less pressure on the top line growth rate, we can intensify management focus on driving faster bottom line growth and cash flow by maximizing pricing power and using innovative strategies to drive our SG&A down. Under the company mantra of ""what we can measure, we can change,"" we are focused on changing and improving all elements of our operation. As an example, last quarter we highlighted that we've been working on reducing customer acquisition costs. We've been moving our advertising and marketing spend away from conventional marketing, like newspaper and billboard advertising, to a purely digital platform.
In the current quarter's results, we're continuing to see the benefit of this management focus, as a significant portion of our SG&A reduction can be attributed to this initiative. It is noteworthy that this quarter's SG&A of 9.3% is the lowest second quarter SG&A in our company's history. With demand growing steadily, land limited, labor tight and constrained mortgage availability, we believe that our three-pronged strategy for our homebuilding segment positions us well for this slow but steady growth environment. We feel that we can run our business at a steady and consistent growth rate with strong bottom line profitability and cash flow by measuring and changing our way to greater efficiency and performance in our core for-sale homebuilding segment.
Moving on, our Financial Services group has had an outstanding second quarter as well. While the Financial Services operations have grown alongside our core homebuilding business, we've also benefited from a strong, though sometimes erratic, refi market as well as from the expansion of retail opportunities in both our mortgage and title platforms. These sidecar opportunities are continuing to expand as we move through 2016.
Our strategies for the future of Lennar Financial Services continues to be to continue to construct and maintain a fully self-sufficient financial services platform that benefits from Lennar Homebuilding business but drives profitability from retail operations as well. Bruce Gross oversees this operation and will discuss it further in his comments.
Next, our Multifamily program continues to develop as a leading blue-chip developer of apartment communities across the country. The second quarter has continued an outstanding run for LMC, Lennar Multifamily Communities, which continues to complement our for-sale homebuilding operation. Since household formation has recovered at a slower rate than expected and many new households have been more inclined to rent than purchase, we have focused on building well-located rental communities to address this market opportunity. First-time home purchasers have come back to the market more slowly than they have historically and more slowly than expected. While approximately 30% of our for-sale homebuilding business continues to be geared to first-time home purchasers, our broader new household strategy has targeted the rental market as well.
As we've continued to expand our national footprint, we've matured and evolved from a merchant build program, which was designed to prove our base concept. This beginning phase worked extremely well as we have proven our ability to purchase, design, build, stabilize and sell a number of our communities at a growing level of profitability. Having proven the concept, we have now built or added a build-to-core platform. This platform enables us to build and retain our outstanding pipeline of properties and benefit from long-term ownership. We have now raised $2 billion for our build-to-core platform, which will become a long-term, cash flow producing, fee-generating value creation machine.
And while Multifamily production has generally normalized, more rental product is going to continue to be needed. And we are very well positioned to continue to be careful in site selection while we fill this need and grow our Multifamily platform. Our now almost $7 billion plus apartment strategy is proving to be very well timed as rental rates continue to climb and vacancies are at very low levels.
Next, our Rialto segment continued to see challenges in the second quarter -- while our Rialto segment continued to see challenges in the second quarter, we continue to see opportunity rising in our asset management business as we get closer to realizing the embedded value of our promote from our Rialto fund investments. We expect to begin to report our promote in the first half of 2017. Additionally, on a current basis, our fund and asset management business showed improved profitability over last year's second quarter, and we expect this trend to continue.
Unfortunately, volatility within the capital markets in the first quarter continued to pressure volumes and pricing on new issued commercial mortgage-backed securities into the second quarter, and that continued to negatively impact our mortgage finance business. Nevertheless, while Rialto Mortgage Finance was less of a contributor in the current period than in past quarters, we have been seeing sequential improvements in both volumes and margins for RMF, and the capital markets have generally healed, and we expect improvement in contributions in the second half of the year. Rialto also suffered a one-time write-off resulting from a discrete single asset from a bulk legacy acquisition in 2010.
Overall, our Rialto platform enables us to invest across all real estate and financial products and allows us to capitalize on both short-term and long-term duration opportunities throughout the economic cycle. While the collapse of the capital markets in the beginning of the calendar year and the one-time write-off from a single asset negatively impacted year-to-date earnings for Rialto, this volatility has also created unique opportunities for new investments in our asset management business. The dysfunction in the financial markets, along with new risk retention rules and banking regulations, will ultimately work to the benefit of Rialto's core competence in CMBS and financial products, and we will continue to grow as a best-in-class asset manager.
And finally, as we noted in our press release, we've successfully completed an important step in the evolution of FivePoint, our strategic large-scale community builder. We contributed and exchanged our interest in 3 strategic joint ventures and our interest in the management company for an investment in a newly formed entity called FivePoint Holdings, LLC. This transaction marks the next step in FivePoint's evolution as a strategic developer and manager of large-scale master-planned communities. It also marks a next step in Lennar's strategic mission to revert to our core homebuilding base. As the recovery matures, FivePoint will operate very independently with a self-contained management team led by Emile Haddad. We simply could not be more excited about the prospects for the future of this one-of-a-kind leader in community development.
Overall, and in conclusion, let me say that we continue to be very pleased to present our second quarter results and our overall progress this morning. We feel very confident that our view of the market and the strategies that define our business segments have worked very well to position us for continued performance and future growth. And as I've said many times before, we are extremely confident that we have the right people, the right programs and the right timing to continue to perform this year and into the future.
Now let me turn over to Bruce."

The gross margin decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land costs. Sales incentives continued to decline, as this quarter was 5.7% versus 5.8% in the prior year. Gross margin percents were once again the highest in the East and West regions.
Direct construction cost increases have moderated compared to the prior year. These costs were up 2% year-over-year to approximately $53 per square foot, driven entirely by labor and offset by a slight decrease in material costs. As Stuart highlighted, we were successful in improving our SG&A operating leverage by growing volume organically in our existing homebuilding divisions, and we continued to see the benefits of our focus on digital marketing. As a result, operating margins improved year-over-year by 10 basis points.
Equity and loss from unconsolidated subs was $9.6 million in the second quarter compared to equity in earnings of $6.5 million in the prior year. The loss was primarily attributable to the company's share of costs associated with establishing the new FivePoint entity, partially offset by $6.7 million of equity and earnings from one of our unconsolidated entities primarily due to the sale of homesites to third parties.
Other income was $14.9 million, primarily due to a profit participation from one of our joint ventures, and there is a partial offset of $7 million in the noncontrolling interest line. We opened 88 new communities to end the quarter with 692 net active communities. New home orders increased 10% and new order dollar value increased 11% for the quarter. The cancellation rate decreased to 14% in the second quarter from 15% in the prior year.
In the second quarter, we purchased 5,300 homesites totaling $437 million versus $445 million in the prior year's quarter. These numbers align with our soft pivot strategy where we're focused on buying shorter duration land. Our homesites owned and controlled now total 166,000 homesites, of which 131,000 are owned and 35,000 are controlled. Our completed unsold inventory ended the quarter with approximately 1,200 homes, which is in our normal range of 1 to 2 per  community.
Turning to Financial Services. This business segment had strong results this quarter with operating earnings of $44.1 million compared to $39.1 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income increased to $36.8 million from $33.5 million in the prior year. Mortgage originations were flat with the prior year at $2.4 billion. The improved earnings is driven by an increased profit per loan due to the favorable interest rate environment.
Refinance volume for the company decreased to 12% of total originations from 19% in the prior year, bringing this quarter's purchase origination volume to 88% of total originations. The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers improved to 83% this quarter from 82% in the prior year. Our title company's profit also increased, growing to $7.4 million in the quarter from $5.1 million in the prior year, primarily due to higher profit per transaction versus the prior year.
Turning to Rialto. This segment produced an operating loss of $13.8 million compared to operating earnings of $7.6 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The investment management business contributed $26.1 million of earnings, which includes $6.9 million of equity and earnings from the real estate funds and $19.2 million of management fees and other.
At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Funds 1 and 2 now totals $138 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $386 million of commercial loans into 3 securitizations resulting in earnings of $12.7 million compared with $721 million and $29 million in the prior year, respectively, and these are before their G&A expenses.
As mentioned previously, the volume decrease was due to the disruption in the CMBS capital markets earlier this year, and it has taken some time for the new loan market to ramp back up. Our direct investments had a loss of $21 million. This included a $16 million write-off of uncollectible receivables at a hospital acquired through the foreclosure of a distressed loan from a 2010 bank portfolio acquisition. A third-party management company operates this hospital. Rialto's G&A and other expenses were $24.9 million for the quarter, and interest expense was $6.7 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $104 million of cash.
The Multifamily segment delivered a $14.9 million operating profit in the quarter, primarily driven by the segment's $15.4 million share of a gain from the sale of an operating property and a $5.2 million gain on a third-party land sale, as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses. We ended the quarter with 8 completed and operating properties and 32 under construction, 5 of which are in lease-up, totaling over 9,700 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $2.6 billion. Including these communities, we have a diversified development pipeline that exceeds $7 billion in over 25,000 apartments.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 32.2%. The lower rate is a result of our continuing efforts to maximize the new home energy efficiency credit, which was again extended into 2016. The tax rate for future quarters should be approximately 34%, although we will continue to focus on trying to maximize this available energy credit.
Turning to the balance sheet. Liquidity remained strong with approximately $600 million of homebuilding cash and $375 million of borrowings under our $1.6 billion revolving credit facility. Our leverage improved by 390 basis points year-over-year as our homebuilding net debt to total capital was reduced to 43.5%. We grew stockholders' equity by 19% to $6.1 billion, and our book value per share increased to $27.92 per share.
In March, we issued $500 million of 5-year senior notes at 4.75%. And in April, we retired our maturing 6.5% senior notes. In May, we converted the remaining $71 million of our 2.75% convertible notes. And in addition, during the quarter, we early converted approximately $68 million of our 3.25% convertible senior notes with an additional $136 million converted subsequent to quarter end.
Finally, I would like to update our 2016 goals. 2016 homebuilding goals are right on track with the guidance that we gave at the start of the year with just a couple of quarterly refinements.
First, deliveries. Deliveries are still on track to be between 26,500 and 27,000 homes for all of 2016. The backlog conversion ratio in the second quarter was 88%, which exceeded the previous guidance of 80% to 85%. We capitalized on a healthy spring selling season and sold and delivered some homes in Q2 that were scheduled for our third quarter. Given that, we now expect our backlog conversion ratio to be around 75% in the third quarter.
The fourth quarter is still projected to achieve a backlog conversion of at least 90%. Operating margins are still on track to be flat to down 50 basis points for the entire year. The gross margin percent will vary between Q3 and Q4 based on our product mix. Q3 is expected to be between 22.5% and 23%, while the fourth quarter is projected to be between 23.5% and 24%. We are still on track to achieve the lowest SG&A in our company's history for the full year with the greatest leverage coming in our fourth quarter.
Turning to Financial Services. We are assuming we will continue to benefit from the extended low interest rate environment, and we are increasing our Financial Services goal to $130 million to $135 million of profit for all of 2016.
Turning to Rialto. We are still on track to earn between $15 million and $20 million for 2016. However, the one-time write-off of the hospital receivables will now bring the range to flat to $5 million of profit for the full year and is still weighted more heavily towards the fourth quarter.
We are still on track with $50 million to $55 million of profit in the Multifamily segment with the third quarter close to breakeven and strong profits in the fourth quarter. The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income, we expect to be flattish for the third quarter, but now expect the fourth quarter to be the highest profit quarter for this category in 2016 with $20 million to $30 million of profit.
And finally, our balance sheet is well on its way on its path to lower leverage. The soft pivot strategy, the strong earnings contribution and the $400 million 3.25% convertible securities, of which half is already converted through mid-June, should bring us to a net debt to total capital in the 35% to 40% range by year-end. This will position us extremely well as we finish out 2016.
Let me turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions."

For example, Pacific Northwest were strong across all segments. Southern California was strong. Southeast and Southwest Florida were strong.

The place that was off the most was Houston, as you would expect, as we continue to see the effects of job loss there. And if -- you see that also with our greatest increase in incentives in Houston even though, for the overall company, we're flat. So if you look at it big picture, Florida was year-over-year sort of flat for us in absorption pace. California, flat. Texas, excluding Houston, was actually improved. Pricing in the Carolinas were improved. And clearly, we do see some lower demand in the higher price points as compared to lower price points. But generally, it's still submarket-driven."

We've got 2 strategies: The merchant build strategy, where we're going to sell those assets and generate good, consistent profits for us as a company. And our build-to-core strategy gives us the opportunity to hold on to these assets for a longer period of time because it's in a longer growth vehicle. As you look at the things that we've put under contract, we were very careful in, first of all, understanding where the growth in the market was going to be, focusing on vacancy levels, focusing on age of product that was close to our assets. So just like in our homebuilding business, we're very specific on identifying where things were going to come on and compete. And I can tell you, looking across the portfolio, we really couldn't be better positioned right now."

We started with an overlay of homebuilding operations where we had market data and market intelligence. We understood that we were not dealing with a national apartment market, or for-sale market, for that matter, but we were dealing with local markets, and each one would have to be regarded carefully and individually. We mapped out our strategy for investment for land acquisition. We were careful to avoid markets that looked like they were becoming oversaturated. I think Rick and Jon and the entire Multifamily team did an extraordinary job of finding the opportunities where growth would be consistent and where we would have long dated opportunities for a sustained business. And given the fact that we had a very deep research team already established that had an eye towards not just the rental markets, but also the for-sale markets, we think, gave us a better window into the market and better strategic positioning. There is a lot of talk about the urban markets being somewhat overbuilt. In most of those instances, those were the markets where we saw the most action and where we didn't get heavily involved or where we did -- we got involved very early at very attractive pricing. So I think that we are starting to hear -- everybody is starting to hear that there might be a little bit more heat in some of the rental markets. What I've heard articulated by one of the best and brightest in the rental market is that we're probably coming to the later innings of a doubleheader, the first game of a doubleheader. We might see a little bit of softness for a period of time. But it looks like and it feels like absorption is going to outstrip any kind of oversupply in fairly short order. And we think that there's a lot of run rate for the Multifamily market -- for the rental markets going forward."

And we see a pace of over 5 sales per community per month on average. Certainly, at the lower price points, it absorbs faster. California, in general, though, it's hard to produce homes at the lower price points because, not only of land costs, but also because of impact fees being as significant as they are. And so that tends to drive, particularly in Southern California and the Bay Area, a higher sales point. And at that higher sales price point, clearly, it's hard to get significant momentum above, I think, the current levels. We are seeing sustained interest particularly in the Asian or Chinese buyer. We haven't seen that fall off. So if you look at a place like Irvine, where's it's been very significant, we have good data at the Great Park. That's remained very consistent and healthy. Same thing in the Bay Area marketplace. So we're seeing consistency there. Bakersfield probably is off the most in terms of California markets. It's similar to Houston, just not as severe, that was hurt by the pullback in the energy sector, which is a lot of the job creation, so there's been -- in Bakersfield.

We have initiatives throughout our organization that are designed to use technologies to change the landscape of the way that we're operating our business. Some other examples of that are as simple as in and around technology. We are revamping the entire plumbing system of our technology department to reconfigure in a more efficient manner the way that we input information and ultimately produce reports for people in the field. That seems kind of simplistic. But in a company like ours that has evolved systems over a lot of years, going back and reconfiguring systems with a proper tubing system enables us to reduce the number of applications that we're actually using in the field with multiple points of input to drive efficient export of data to the people that need to use it on a regular basis. It'll enable us to be more accurate. It'll enable us to be a lot more timely, approaching real-time distribution of data over the next year or 2. This will -- that initiative alone will drive cost down. We view that over the next couple of years, there's a 20 to 50 basis point reduction in SG&A that we'll derive just from that. Now there might be some intermittent ticks up in cost, but primarily, the trend will be down. In our production arena, we are using our technologies to look at the number of models and the efficiency of the plan designs that we're offering our customers in the field. We're looking at technologies to review and to consolidate the view of SKUs that we're offering across our different markets. All of these things we view as opportunities to bring another 10, 20, 50 basis points to either the reduction of SG&A or potentially the efficiency of our construction efforts."

But having developed those strategies to elements of maturity, we think that there are opportunities that we have maintained as optional opportunities for those businesses to find better programs for themselves. You see that embedded in the way that FivePoint has been evolving. If you look at the management team of FivePoint, led by Emile Haddad, who we have been working -- he's been working within the company for over 20 years. The management team is a self-sufficient, independent, highly confident, industry-leading management team that's prepared to operate very independently. And as has been reported, we have been looking at an opportune time to invigorate an IPO. The market doesn't happen to be there. But with that said, it's emblematic of the strategies that we've employed. Jeff Krasnoff leads Rialto. Rialto has its self-sufficient team. And of course, as we've talked about quite a lot on this call, our Multifamily program, LMC, is also led by Todd Farrell, very strong leader with a core management team, that it too is operating very independently. So while under the Lennar umbrella, we all tend to thrive and work well together. And synergistically, the core mission right now is to revert to pure play as a homebuilder and to ultimately, over the next years, as opportunities present themselves, find proper homes for those opportunities."

So I think that what you're seeing is very similar to what we articulated as part of an IPO process, but just not with the fruition of the IPO process.

And I guess, if there's a representation of the choppiness we're talking about, it's the way that the first quarter evolved, kind of as a surprise to everyone. Fed raised interest rates, starting January 1 right out of the chutes at the beginning of the year. The capital markets tanked, and it created some lack of confidence in the consumer. I think, generally speaking, you can't time where the choppiness actually exists. And so we left a fairly wide range as we gave guidance at the beginning of the year. We're probably trending to the lower parts of that range. But I think it derives from the choppiness that's embedded in the system and the way that the year started out. And so at the end of the day, I think this is well within kind of the range that we've articulated. I don't think it should be of any concern that we're trending towards the lower part of that range. And in fact, it's exactly why we gave the range that we did, recognizing that there are some tugs and pulls to the downside as well as the upside, but we still believe very strongly that the trend is upward."

We are seeing some labor price increases out in the field and that's flowing through our product. Certainly, the building material manufacturers are trying to get more for their product as well. That, combined with the slowing of sales price increases, has caused our margins to compress a little bit. As you step back from that, I would say that they're still very healthy margins. We're very much focused on operating margin. If we can get some incremental deliveries, you'll see the play on operating margin, and that's really how we're operating the company. We are -- we continue to benefit from some land assets that we bought in prior years. But when we're replacing those land assets, a little bit higher land cost base is running through.

I'm going to briefly give some remarks, as I've always done, about the business in general. And then Bruce is going to jump in, break down our financial detail and give some further guidance for next year. And then, as always, we will open up to Q&A.
[Operator Instructions]
So let me go ahead and begin and say that our second quarter 2016 results reflect another quarter of strong operating results for our company. We've continued to benefit from a slow and steady housing market recovery that has continued to define the U.S. housing market environment. And we have crafted specific strategies within our company for our business that have positioned us well to maximize opportunity in these market conditions.
As we've noted consistently over the past years, the overall housing market has been generally defined by a rather large production deficit that has continued to grow over the past years. While questions have been raised as to the real normalized levels of production that are required to serve the U.S. current population, we believe that production levels in the 1 million to 1.2 million starts per year range are still too low for the needs of American household growth that is now normalizing.
While measuring current production levels against historical norms of 1.5 million starts per year might be flawed logic, as there may be a new normal, we believe that the very low inventory levels in existing and new homes, and the low vacancy rates and high and growing rental rates for apartments, indicate that we are in short supply nationally. With that said, it's important to note that the housing market is not really a national market. Instead, it's a large number of very local markets, each with different dynamics that are averaged together to generate some sometimes quirky results.
With that said, we believe that there continues to be a growing pent-up demand for dwellings of all types across the country, though stronger in some markets than others, and this demand will continue to propel a continued long cycle, slow and steady market improvement.
While demand has been constrained by limited access to mortgages, stronger general economic conditions, including lower unemployment, modest wage growth and general consumer confidence, are still driving consumers to form new households and to purchase homes and to rent apartments. We expect that demand will continue to build and come to the market over the next years, and that will drive increased production as the deficit in housing stock ultimately needs to be replenished. Nevertheless, land and labor shortages will continue to be limiting factors and will constrain supply and restrict the ability to quickly respond to growing demand, while the mortgage market and higher rents will continue to constrain that demand.
We expect that these conditions will continue to result in a slow and steady positive homebuilding market and will enable slow, steady, though sometimes erratic, growth throughout the industry. This has been our consistent guiding theme over the past years, and we have mapped our strategy around this view.
Each segment of our company has positioned itself for continued performance in 2016 and beyond, and we believe that we remain well positioned to execute our operating plans and strategies in each of these segments. Even with the somewhat erratic conditions that defined the early part of this year, we have remained resolute in our view  that have generated our strategies. 
Against this backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating segments. Our for-sale homebuilding operations experienced a healthy spring selling season with a sales pace of 3.9 sales per month per community. Our results reflect the slow but steady growth in the overall homebuilding market as our new home orders increased 10% year-over-year while community count grew 4% and our average sales price grew 4% to $362,000.
Even while continued labor shortages and land and construction cost increases have tested our ability to match sales and delivery pace, our management team has carefully managed sales prices, maximized margins and focused on reducing SG&A to offset and maintain a strong net operating margin, which came in at 13.9%. As we've noted in past conference calls, we have adjusted our for-sale housing strategy as the recovery has matured and land pricing has adjusted to that recovery. There are 3 components of our core homebuilding segment strategy. They are: soft pivot, slower growth and focus on SG&A.
To begin, we've talked consistently about our soft pivot land strategy over the past years, away from the land-heavy acquisition strategy in the early stages of the recovery, and we're now targeting land acquisitions with a shorter 2- to 3-year average life. Our more recent quarterly reports have demonstrated that we've moderated our land spend as a percent of homebuilding revenues. And this has and will continue to be a core strategy driving our homebuilding platform as we manage land acquisitions to taper the growth rate in both community count and home sales.
Second, we've noted in past quarter conference calls that given our now mature recovery, we have been and continue to carefully manage and limit our growth in order to grow the bottom line and to drive strong cash flow. We have moderated our top line growth targets to achieve a growth rate in the 7% to 10% range as we've redirected our management effort towards maximizing our net operating margin.
Third, with less pressure on the top line growth rate, we can intensify management focus on driving faster bottom line growth and cash flow by maximizing pricing power and using innovative strategies to drive our SG&A down. Under the company mantra of ""what we can measure, we can change,"" we are focused on changing and improving all elements of our operation. As an example, last quarter we highlighted that we've been working on reducing customer acquisition costs. We've been moving our advertising and marketing spend away from conventional marketing, like newspaper and billboard advertising, to a purely digital platform.
In the current quarter's results, we're continuing to see the benefit of this management focus, as a significant portion of our SG&A reduction can be attributed to this initiative. It is noteworthy that this quarter's SG&A of 9.3% is the lowest second quarter SG&A in our company's history. With demand growing steadily, land limited, labor tight and constrained mortgage availability, we believe that our three-pronged strategy for our homebuilding segment positions us well for this slow but steady growth environment. We feel that we can run our business at a steady and consistent growth rate with strong bottom line profitability and cash flow by measuring and changing our way to greater efficiency and performance in our core for-sale homebuilding segment.
Moving on, our Financial Services group has had an outstanding second quarter as well. While the Financial Services operations have grown alongside our core homebuilding business, we've also benefited from a strong, though sometimes erratic, refi market as well as from the expansion of retail opportunities in both our mortgage and title platforms. These sidecar opportunities are continuing to expand as we move through 2016.
Our strategies for the future of Lennar Financial Services continues to be to continue to construct and maintain a fully self-sufficient financial services platform that benefits from Lennar Homebuilding business but drives profitability from retail operations as well. Bruce Gross oversees this operation and will discuss it further in his comments.
Next, our Multifamily program continues to develop as a leading blue-chip developer of apartment communities across the country. The second quarter has continued an outstanding run for LMC, Lennar Multifamily Communities, which continues to complement our for-sale homebuilding operation. Since household formation has recovered at a slower rate than expected and many new households have been more inclined to rent than purchase, we have focused on building well-located rental communities to address this market opportunity. First-time home purchasers have come back to the market more slowly than they have historically and more slowly than expected. While approximately 30% of our for-sale homebuilding business continues to be geared to first-time home purchasers, our broader new household strategy has targeted the rental market as well.
As we've continued to expand our national footprint, we've matured and evolved from a merchant build program, which was designed to prove our base concept. This beginning phase worked extremely well as we have proven our ability to purchase, design, build, stabilize and sell a number of our communities at a growing level of profitability. Having proven the concept, we have now built or added a build-to-core platform. This platform enables us to build and retain our outstanding pipeline of properties and benefit from long-term ownership. We have now raised $2 billion for our build-to-core platform, which will become a long-term, cash flow producing, fee-generating value creation machine.
And while Multifamily production has generally normalized, more rental product is going to continue to be needed. And we are very well positioned to continue to be careful in site selection while we fill this need and grow our Multifamily platform. Our now almost $7 billion plus apartment strategy is proving to be very well timed as rental rates continue to climb and vacancies are at very low levels.
Next, our Rialto segment continued to see challenges in the second quarter -- while our Rialto segment continued to see challenges in the second quarter, we continue to see opportunity rising in our asset management business as we get closer to realizing the embedded value of our promote from our Rialto fund investments. We expect to begin to report our promote in the first half of 2017. Additionally, on a current basis, our fund and asset management business showed improved profitability over last year's second quarter, and we expect this trend to continue.
Unfortunately, volatility within the capital markets in the first quarter continued to pressure volumes and pricing on new issued commercial mortgage-backed securities into the second quarter, and that continued to negatively impact our mortgage finance business. Nevertheless, while Rialto Mortgage Finance was less of a contributor in the current period than in past quarters, we have been seeing sequential improvements in both volumes and margins for RMF, and the capital markets have generally healed, and we expect improvement in contributions in the second half of the year. Rialto also suffered a one-time write-off resulting from a discrete single asset from a bulk legacy acquisition in 2010.
Overall, our Rialto platform enables us to invest across all real estate and financial products and allows us to capitalize on both short-term and long-term duration opportunities throughout the economic cycle. While the collapse of the capital markets in the beginning of the calendar year and the one-time write-off from a single asset negatively impacted year-to-date earnings for Rialto, this volatility has also created unique opportunities for new investments in our asset management business. The dysfunction in the financial markets, along with new risk retention rules and banking regulations, will ultimately work to the benefit of Rialto's core competence in CMBS and financial products, and we will continue to grow as a best-in-class asset manager.
And finally, as we noted in our press release, we've successfully completed an important step in the evolution of FivePoint, our strategic large-scale community builder. We contributed and exchanged our interest in 3 strategic joint ventures and our interest in the management company for an investment in a newly formed entity called FivePoint Holdings, LLC. This transaction marks the next step in FivePoint's evolution as a strategic developer and manager of large-scale master-planned communities. It also marks a next step in Lennar's strategic mission to revert to our core homebuilding base. As the recovery matures, FivePoint will operate very independently with a self-contained management team led by Emile Haddad. We simply could not be more excited about the prospects for the future of this one-of-a-kind leader in community development.
Overall, and in conclusion, let me say that we continue to be very pleased to present our second quarter results and our overall progress this morning. We feel very confident that our view of the market and the strategies that define our business segments have worked very well to position us for continued performance and future growth. And as I've said many times before, we are extremely confident that we have the right people, the right programs and the right timing to continue to perform this year and into the future.
Now let me turn over to Bruce."
30763,347075527,1001796,"Lennar Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 21, 2016",2016-06-21,"Earnings Calls","Lennar Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Stuart, and good morning.

Our net earnings for the second quarter were $218 million, which is a 19% increase over the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 17% in the second quarter, driven by a 12% increase in wholly owned [ph] deliveries and a 4% year-over-year increase in average selling price to $362,000. 
Our gross margin on home sales in the second quarter was 23.1%, which was in line with our stated goals. The prior year's gross margin percentage was 23.8%. The gross margin decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land costs. Sales incentives continued to decline, as this quarter was 5.7% versus 5.8% in the prior year. Gross margin percents were once again the highest in the East and West regions.
Direct construction cost increases have moderated compared to the prior year. These costs were up 2% year-over-year to approximately $53 per square foot, driven entirely by labor and offset by a slight decrease in material costs. As Stuart highlighted, we were successful in improving our SG&A operating leverage by growing volume organically in our existing homebuilding divisions, and we continued to see the benefits of our focus on digital marketing. As a result, operating margins improved year-over-year by 10 basis points.
Equity and loss from unconsolidated subs was $9.6 million in the second quarter compared to equity in earnings of $6.5 million in the prior year. The loss was primarily attributable to the company's share of costs associated with establishing the new FivePoint entity, partially offset by $6.7 million of equity and earnings from one of our unconsolidated entities primarily due to the sale of homesites to third parties.
Other income was $14.9 million, primarily due to a profit participation from one of our joint ventures, and there is a partial offset of $7 million in the noncontrolling interest line. We opened 88 new communities to end the quarter with 692 net active communities. New home orders increased 10% and new order dollar value increased 11% for the quarter. The cancellation rate decreased to 14% in the second quarter from 15% in the prior year.
In the second quarter, we purchased 5,300 homesites totaling $437 million versus $445 million in the prior year's quarter. These numbers align with our soft pivot strategy where we're focused on buying shorter duration land. Our homesites owned and controlled now total 166,000 homesites, of which 131,000 are owned and 35,000 are controlled. Our completed unsold inventory ended the quarter with approximately 1,200 homes, which is in our normal range of 1 to 2 per  community.
Turning to Financial Services. This business segment had strong results this quarter with operating earnings of $44.1 million compared to $39.1 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income increased to $36.8 million from $33.5 million in the prior year. Mortgage originations were flat with the prior year at $2.4 billion. The improved earnings is driven by an increased profit per loan due to the favorable interest rate environment.
Refinance volume for the company decreased to 12% of total originations from 19% in the prior year, bringing this quarter's purchase origination volume to 88% of total originations. The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers improved to 83% this quarter from 82% in the prior year. Our title company's profit also increased, growing to $7.4 million in the quarter from $5.1 million in the prior year, primarily due to higher profit per transaction versus the prior year.
Turning to Rialto. This segment produced an operating loss of $13.8 million compared to operating earnings of $7.6 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The investment management business contributed $26.1 million of earnings, which includes $6.9 million of equity and earnings from the real estate funds and $19.2 million of management fees and other.
At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Funds 1 and 2 now totals $138 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $386 million of commercial loans into 3 securitizations resulting in earnings of $12.7 million compared with $721 million and $29 million in the prior year, respectively, and these are before their G&A expenses.
As mentioned previously, the volume decrease was due to the disruption in the CMBS capital markets earlier this year, and it has taken some time for the new loan market to ramp back up. Our direct investments had a loss of $21 million. This included a $16 million write-off of uncollectible receivables at a hospital acquired through the foreclosure of a distressed loan from a 2010 bank portfolio acquisition. A third-party management company operates this hospital. Rialto's G&A and other expenses were $24.9 million for the quarter, and interest expense was $6.7 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $104 million of cash.
The Multifamily segment delivered a $14.9 million operating profit in the quarter, primarily driven by the segment's $15.4 million share of a gain from the sale of an operating property and a $5.2 million gain on a third-party land sale, as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses. We ended the quarter with 8 completed and operating properties and 32 under construction, 5 of which are in lease-up, totaling over 9,700 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $2.6 billion. Including these communities, we have a diversified development pipeline that exceeds $7 billion in over 25,000 apartments.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 32.2%. The lower rate is a result of our continuing efforts to maximize the new home energy efficiency credit, which was again extended into 2016. The tax rate for future quarters should be approximately 34%, although we will continue to focus on trying to maximize this available energy credit.
Turning to the balance sheet. Liquidity remained strong with approximately $600 million of homebuilding cash and $375 million of borrowings under our $1.6 billion revolving credit facility. Our leverage improved by 390 basis points year-over-year as our homebuilding net debt to total capital was reduced to 43.5%. We grew stockholders' equity by 19% to $6.1 billion, and our book value per share increased to $27.92 per share.
In March, we issued $500 million of 5-year senior notes at 4.75%. And in April, we retired our maturing 6.5% senior notes. In May, we converted the remaining $71 million of our 2.75% convertible notes. And in addition, during the quarter, we early converted approximately $68 million of our 3.25% convertible senior notes with an additional $136 million converted subsequent to quarter end.
Finally, I would like to update our 2016 goals. 2016 homebuilding goals are right on track with the guidance that we gave at the start of the year with just a couple of quarterly refinements.
First, deliveries. Deliveries are still on track to be between 26,500 and 27,000 homes for all of 2016. The backlog conversion ratio in the second quarter was 88%, which exceeded the previous guidance of 80% to 85%. We capitalized on a healthy spring selling season and sold and delivered some homes in Q2 that were scheduled for our third quarter. Given that, we now expect our backlog conversion ratio to be around 75% in the third quarter.
The fourth quarter is still projected to achieve a backlog conversion of at least 90%. Operating margins are still on track to be flat to down 50 basis points for the entire year. The gross margin percent will vary between Q3 and Q4 based on our product mix. Q3 is expected to be between 22.5% and 23%, while the fourth quarter is projected to be between 23.5% and 24%. We are still on track to achieve the lowest SG&A in our company's history for the full year with the greatest leverage coming in our fourth quarter.
Turning to Financial Services. We are assuming we will continue to benefit from the extended low interest rate environment, and we are increasing our Financial Services goal to $130 million to $135 million of profit for all of 2016.
Turning to Rialto. We are still on track to earn between $15 million and $20 million for 2016. However, the one-time write-off of the hospital receivables will now bring the range to flat to $5 million of profit for the full year and is still weighted more heavily towards the fourth quarter.
We are still on track with $50 million to $55 million of profit in the Multifamily segment with the third quarter close to breakeven and strong profits in the fourth quarter. The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income, we expect to be flattish for the third quarter, but now expect the fourth quarter to be the highest profit quarter for this category in 2016 with $20 million to $30 million of profit.
And finally, our balance sheet is well on its way on its path to lower leverage. The soft pivot strategy, the strong earnings contribution and the $400 million 3.25% convertible securities, of which half is already converted through mid-June, should bring us to a net debt to total capital in the 35% to 40% range by year-end. This will position us extremely well as we finish out 2016.
Let me turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions."

The place that was off the most was Houston, as you would expect, as we continue to see the effects of job loss there. And if -- you see that also with our greatest increase in incentives in Houston even though, for the overall company, we're flat. So if you look at it big picture, Florida was year-over-year sort of flat for us in absorption pace. California, flat. Texas, excluding Houston, was actually improved. Pricing in the Carolinas were improved. And clearly, we do see some lower demand in the higher price points as compared to lower price points. But generally, it's still submarket-driven."

And our build-to-core strategy gives us the opportunity to hold on to these assets for a longer period of time because it's in a longer growth vehicle. As you look at the things that we've put under contract, we were very careful in, first of all, understanding where the growth in the market was going to be, focusing on vacancy levels, focusing on age of product that was close to our assets. So just like in our homebuilding business, we're very specific on identifying where things were going to come on and compete.

We started with an overlay of homebuilding operations where we had market data and market intelligence. We understood that we were not dealing with a national apartment market, or for-sale market, for that matter, but we were dealing with local markets, and each one would have to be regarded carefully and individually. We mapped out our strategy for investment for land acquisition. We were careful to avoid markets that looked like they were becoming oversaturated. I think Rick and Jon and the entire Multifamily team did an extraordinary job of finding the opportunities where growth would be consistent and where we would have long dated opportunities for a sustained business. And given the fact that we had a very deep research team already established that had an eye towards not just the rental markets, but also the for-sale markets, we think, gave us a better window into the market and better strategic positioning. There is a lot of talk about the urban markets being somewhat overbuilt. In most of those instances, those were the markets where we saw the most action and where we didn't get heavily involved or where we did -- we got involved very early at very attractive pricing. So I think that we are starting to hear -- everybody is starting to hear that there might be a little bit more heat in some of the rental markets. What I've heard articulated by one of the best and brightest in the rental market is that we're probably coming to the later innings of a doubleheader, the first game of a doubleheader. We might see a little bit of softness for a period of time. But it looks like and it feels like absorption is going to outstrip any kind of oversupply in fairly short order. And we think that there's a lot of run rate for the Multifamily market -- for the rental markets going forward."

California, in general, though, it's hard to produce homes at the lower price points because, not only of land costs, but also because of impact fees being as significant as they are. And so that tends to drive, particularly in Southern California and the Bay Area, a higher sales point. And at that higher sales price point, clearly, it's hard to get significant momentum above, I think, the current levels. We are seeing sustained interest particularly in the Asian or Chinese buyer. We haven't seen that fall off. So if you look at a place like Irvine, where's it's been very significant, we have good data at the Great Park. That's remained very consistent and healthy. Same thing in the Bay Area marketplace. So we're seeing consistency there. Bakersfield probably is off the most in terms of California markets. It's similar to Houston, just not as severe, that was hurt by the pullback in the energy sector, which is a lot of the job creation, so there's been -- in Bakersfield. So there's been job loss in Bakersfield. Fresno remains healthy, though, from a Central Valley perspective."

We have initiatives throughout our organization that are designed to use technologies to change the landscape of the way that we're operating our business. Some other examples of that are as simple as in and around technology. We are revamping the entire plumbing system of our technology department to reconfigure in a more efficient manner the way that we input information and ultimately produce reports for people in the field. That seems kind of simplistic. But in a company like ours that has evolved systems over a lot of years, going back and reconfiguring systems with a proper tubing system enables us to reduce the number of applications that we're actually using in the field with multiple points of input to drive efficient export of data to the people that need to use it on a regular basis. It'll enable us to be more accurate. It'll enable us to be a lot more timely, approaching real-time distribution of data over the next year or 2. This will -- that initiative alone will drive cost down. We view that over the next couple of years, there's a 20 to 50 basis point reduction in SG&A that we'll derive just from that. Now there might be some intermittent ticks up in cost, but primarily, the trend will be down. In our production arena, we are using our technologies to look at the number of models and the efficiency of the plan designs that we're offering our customers in the field. We're looking at technologies to review and to consolidate the view of SKUs that we're offering across our different markets. All of these things we view as opportunities to bring another 10, 20, 50 basis points to either the reduction of SG&A or potentially the efficiency of our construction efforts."

And I guess, if there's a representation of the choppiness we're talking about, it's the way that the first quarter evolved, kind of as a surprise to everyone. Fed raised interest rates, starting January 1 right out of the chutes at the beginning of the year. The capital markets tanked, and it created some lack of confidence in the consumer. I think, generally speaking, you can't time where the choppiness actually exists. And so we left a fairly wide range as we gave guidance at the beginning of the year. We're probably trending to the lower parts of that range. But I think it derives from the choppiness that's embedded in the system and the way that the year started out. And so at the end of the day, I think this is well within kind of the range that we've articulated. I don't think it should be of any concern that we're trending towards the lower part of that range.

We're very much focused on operating margin. If we can get some incremental deliveries, you'll see the play on operating margin, and that's really how we're operating the company. We are -- we continue to benefit from some land assets that we bought in prior years. But when we're replacing those land assets, a little bit higher land cost base is running through.

So it enabled us to avoid the markets that were perhaps getting a little bit too hot while gearing towards the markets that had the most -- the deepest set of opportunities. So I would say that the Multifamily group has interacted very symbiotically with the for-sale group, and it's really worked to our benefit in developing a long-term strategy."

The fact is, in none of our markets are we a dominant factor. To the contrary, we might have a community or 2 at any of the markets in which we operate.

[Operator Instructions]
So let me go ahead and begin and say that our second quarter 2016 results reflect another quarter of strong operating results for our company. We've continued to benefit from a slow and steady housing market recovery that has continued to define the U.S. housing market environment. And we have crafted specific strategies within our company for our business that have positioned us well to maximize opportunity in these market conditions.
As we've noted consistently over the past years, the overall housing market has been generally defined by a rather large production deficit that has continued to grow over the past years. While questions have been raised as to the real normalized levels of production that are required to serve the U.S. current population, we believe that production levels in the 1 million to 1.2 million starts per year range are still too low for the needs of American household growth that is now normalizing.
While measuring current production levels against historical norms of 1.5 million starts per year might be flawed logic as there may be a new normal, we believe that the very low inventory levels in existing and new homes, and the low vacancy rate and high and growing rental rates for apartments indicate that we are in short supply nationally. With that said, it's important to note that the housing market is not really a national market. Instead, it's a large number of very local markets, each with different dynamics that are averaged together to generate some sometimes quirky results.
With that said, we believe that there continues to be a growing pent-up demand for dwellings of all types across the country, though stronger in some markets than others, and this demand will continue to propel a continued, long cycle, slow and steady market improvement.
While demand has been constrained by limited access to mortgages, stronger general economic conditions, including lower unemployment, modest wage growth and general consumer confidence, are still driving consumers to form new households and to purchase homes and to rent apartments. We expect that demand will continue to build and come to the market over the next years, and that will drive increased production as the deficit in housing stock ultimately needs to be replenished. Nevertheless, land and labor shortages will continue to be limiting factors and will constrain supply and restrict the ability to quickly respond to growing demand, while the mortgage market and higher rents will continue to constrain that demand.
We expect that these conditions will continue to result in a slow and steady positive homebuilding market and will enable slow, steady, though sometimes erratic, growth throughout the industry. This has been our consistent guiding theme over the past years, and we have mapped our strategy around this view.
Each segment of our company has positioned itself for continued performance in 2016 and beyond, and we believe that we remain well positioned to execute our operating plans and strategies in each of these segments. Even with the somewhat erratic conditions that defined the early part of this year, we have remained resolute in our view that have generated our strategies.
Against this backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating segments. Our for-sale homebuilding operations experienced a healthy spring selling season with a sales pace of 3.9 sales per month per community. Our results reflect the slow but steady growth in the overall homebuilding market as our new home orders increased 10% year-over-year while community count grew 4% and our average sales price grew 4% to $362,000.
Even while continued labor shortages and land and construction cost increases have tested our ability to match sales and delivery pace, our management team has carefully managed sales prices, maximized margins and focused on reducing SG&A to offset and maintain a strong net operating margin, which came in at 13.9%. As we've noted in past conference calls, we have adjusted our for-sale housing strategy as the recovery has matured and land pricing has adjusted to that recovery. There are 3 components of our core homebuilding segment strategy. They are: soft pivot, slower growth and focus on SG&A.
To begin, we've talked consistently about our soft pivot land strategy over the past years, away from the land-heavy acquisition strategy in the early stages of the recovery, and we're now targeting land acquisitions with a shorter 2- to 3-year average life. Our more recent quarterly reports have demonstrated that we've moderated our land spend as a percent of homebuilding revenues. And this has and will continue to be a core strategy driving our homebuilding platform as we manage land acquisitions to taper the growth rate in both community count and home sales.
Second, we've noted in past quarter conference calls that given our now mature recovery, we have been and continue to carefully manage and limit our growth in order to grow the bottom line and to drive strong cash flow. We have moderated our top line growth targets to achieve a growth rate in the 7% to 10% range as we've redirected our management efforts towards maximizing our net operating margin.
Third, with less pressure on the top line growth rate, we can intensify management focus on driving faster bottom line growth and cash flow by maximizing pricing power and using innovative strategies to drive our SG&A down. Under the company mantra of what we can measure, we can change, we are focused on changing and improving all elements of our operation. As an example, last quarter, we highlighted that we've been working on reducing customer acquisition costs. We've been moving our advertising and marketing spend away from conventional marketing like newspaper and billboard advertising to a purely digital platform.
In the current quarter's results, we're continuing to see the benefit of this management focus as a significant portion of our SG&A reduction can be attributed to this initiative. It is noteworthy that this quarter's SG&A of 9.3% is the lowest second quarter SG&A in our company's history. With demand growing steadily, land limited, labor tight and constrained mortgage availability, we believe that our three-pronged strategy for our homebuilding segment positions us well for this slow but steady growth environment. We feel that we can run our business at a steady and consistent growth rate with strong bottom line profitability and cash flow by measuring and changing our way to greater efficiency and performance in our core for-sale homebuilding segment.
Moving on, our Financial Services group has had an outstanding second quarter as well. While the Financial Services operations have grown alongside our core homebuilding business, we've also benefited from a strong, though sometimes erratic, refi market as well as from the expansion of retail opportunities in both our mortgage and title platforms. These sidecar opportunities are continuing to expand as we move through 2016.
Our strategies for the future of Lennar Financial Services continues to be to continue to construct and maintain a fully self-sufficient financial services platform that benefits from Lennar Homebuilding business but drives profitability from retail operations as well. Bruce Gross oversees this operation and will discuss it further in his comments.
Next, our Multifamily program continues to develop as a leading blue-chip developer of apartment communities across the country. The second quarter has continued an outstanding run for LMC, Lennar Multifamily Communities, which continues to complement our for-sale homebuilding operation. Since household formation has recovered at a slower rate than expected and many new households have been more inclined to rent than purchase, we have focused on building well-located rental communities to address this market opportunity. First-time home purchasers have come back to the market more slowly than they have historically and more slowly than expected. While approximately 30% of our for-sale homebuilding business continues to be geared to first-time home purchasers, our broader new household strategy has targeted the rental market as well.
As we've continued to expand our national footprint, we've matured and evolved from a merchant build program, which was designed to prove our base concept. This beginning phase worked extremely well as we have proven our ability to purchase, design, build, stabilize and sell a number of our communities at a growing level of profitability. Having proven the concept, we have now built or added a build-to-core platform. This platform enables us to build and retain our outstanding pipeline of properties and benefit from long-term ownership. We have now raised $2 billion for our build-to-core platform, which will become a long-term, cash flow producing, fee-generating value creation machine.
And while Multifamily production has generally normalized, more rental product is going to continue to be needed. And we are very well positioned to continue to be careful in site selection while we fill this need and grow our Multifamily platform. Our now almost $7 billion plus apartment strategy is proving to be very well timed as rental rates continue to climb and vacancies are at very low levels.
Next, our Rialto segment continued to see challenges in the second quarter. While our Rialto segment continued to see challenges in the second quarter, we continue to see opportunity rising in our asset management business as we get closer to realizing the embedded value of our promote from our Rialto fund investments. We expect to begin to report our promote in the first half of 2017. Additionally, on a current basis, our fund and asset management business showed improved profitability over last year's second quarter, and we expect this trend to continue.
Unfortunately, volatility within the capital markets in the first quarter continued to pressure volumes and pricing on new issued commercial mortgage-backed securities into the second quarter, and that continued to negatively impact our mortgage finance business. Nevertheless, while Rialto Mortgage Finance was less of a contributor in the current period than in past quarters, we have been seeing sequential improvements in both volumes and margins for RMF, and the capital markets have generally healed, and we expect to improve -- improvement in contributions in the second half of the year. Rialto also suffered a onetime write-off resulting from a discrete single asset from a bulk legacy acquisition in 2010.
Overall, our Rialto platform enables us to invest across all real estate and financial products and allows us to capitalize on both short-term and long-term duration opportunities throughout the economic cycle. While the collapse of the capital markets in the beginning of the calendar year and the onetime write-off from a single asset negatively impacted year-to-date earnings for Rialto, this volatility has also created unique opportunities for new investments in our asset management business. The dysfunction in the financial market, along with new risk retention rules and banking regulations, will ultimately work to the benefit of Rialto's core competence in CMBS and financial products, and we will continue to grow as a best-in-class asset manager.
And finally, as we noted in our press release, we've successfully completed an important step in the evolution of FivePoint, our strategic large-scale community builder. We contributed and exchanged our interest in 3 strategic joint ventures and our interest in the management company for an investment in a newly formed entity called FivePoint Holdings, LLC. This transaction marks the next step in FivePoint's evolution as a strategic developer and manager of large-scale master-planned communities. It also marks a next step in Lennar's strategic mission to revert to our core homebuilding base. As the recovery matures, FivePoint will operate very independently with a self-contained management team led by Emile Haddad. We simply could not be more excited about the prospects for the future of this one-of-a-kind leader in community development.
Overall and in conclusion, let me say that we continue to be very pleased to present our second quarter results and our overall progress this morning. We feel very confident that our view of the market and the strategies that define our business segments have worked very well to position us for continued performance and future growth. And as I said many times before, we are extremely confident that we have the right people, the right programs and the right timing to continue to perform this year and into the future.
Now let me turn over to Bruce."
30763,347075527,1006134,"Lennar Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 21, 2016",2016-06-21,"Earnings Calls","Lennar Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Stuart, and good morning.

Our net earnings for the second quarter were $218 million, which is a 19% increase over the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 17% in the second quarter, driven by a 12% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 4% year-over-year increase in average selling price to $362,000. 
Our gross margin on home sales in the second quarter was 23.1%, which was in line with our stated goals. The prior year's gross margin percentage was 23.8%. The gross margin decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land costs. Sales incentives continued to decline as this quarter was 5.7% versus 5.8% in the prior year. Gross margin percents were once again the highest in the East and West regions.
Direct construction cost increases have moderated compared to the prior year. These costs were up 2% year-over-year to approximately $53 per square foot, driven entirely by labor and offset by a slight decrease in material costs. As Stuart highlighted, we were successful in improving our SG&A operating leverage by growing volume organically in our existing homebuilding divisions, and we continued to see the benefits of our focus on digital marketing. As a result, operating margins improved year-over-year by 10 basis points.
Equity and loss from unconsolidated subs was $9.6 million in the second quarter compared to equity in earnings of $6.5 million in the prior year. The loss was primarily attributable to the company's share of costs associated with establishing the new FivePoint entity, partially offset by $6.7 million of equity and earnings from one of our unconsolidated entities primarily due to the sale of homesites to third parties.
Other income was $14.9 million primarily due to a profit participation from one of our joint ventures, and there is a partial offset of $7 million in the noncontrolling interest line. We opened 88 new communities to end the quarter with 692 net active communities. New home orders increased 10% and new order dollar value increased 11% for the quarter. The cancellation rate decreased to 14% in the second quarter from 15% in the prior year.
In the second quarter, we purchased 5,300 homesites totaling $437 million versus $445 million in the prior year's quarter. These numbers align with our soft pivot strategy where we're focused on buying shorter duration land. Our homesites owned and controlled now total 166,000 homesites, of which 131,000 are owned and 35,000 are controlled. Our completed unsold inventory ended the quarter with approximately 1,200 homes, which is in our normal range of 1 to 2 per community.
Turning to Financial Services. This business segment had strong results this quarter with operating earnings of $44.1 million compared to $39.1 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income increased to $36.8 million from $33.5 million in the prior year. Mortgage originations were flat with the prior year at $2.4 billion. The improved earnings is driven by an increased profit per loan due to the favorable interest rate environment.
Refinance volume for the company decreased to 12% of total originations from 19% in the prior year, bringing this quarter's purchase origination volume to 88% of total originations. The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers improved to 83% this quarter from 82% in the prior year. Our title company's profit also increased, growing to $7.4 million in the quarter from $5.1 million in the prior year primarily due to higher profit per transaction versus the prior year.
Turning to Rialto. This segment produced an operating loss of $13.8 million compared to operating earnings of $7.6 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The investment management business contributed $26.1 million of earnings, which includes $6.9 million of equity and earnings from the real estate funds and $19.2 million of management fees and other.
At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Funds 1 and 2 now totals $138 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $386 million of commercial loans into 3 securitizations resulting in earnings of $12.7 million compared with $721 million and $29 million in the prior year, respectively, and these are before their G&A expenses.
As mentioned previously, the volume decrease was due to the disruption in the CMBS capital markets earlier this year, and it has taken some time for the new loan market to ramp back up. Our direct investments had a loss of $21 million. This included a $16 million write-off of uncollectible receivables at a hospital acquired through the foreclosure of a distressed loan from a 2010 bank portfolio acquisition. A third-party management company operates this hospital. Rialto's G&A and other expenses were $24.9 million for the quarter, and interest expense was $6.7 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $104 million of cash.
The Multifamily segment delivered a $14.9 million operating profit in the quarter, primarily driven by the segment's $15.4 million share of a gain from the sale of an operating property and a $5.2 million gain on a third-party land sale, as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses. We ended the quarter with 8 completed and operating properties and 32 under construction, 5 of which are in lease-up, totaling over 9,700 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $2.6 billion. Including these communities, we have a diversified development pipeline that exceeds $7 billion in over 25,000 apartments.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 32.2%. The lower rate is a result of our continuing efforts to maximize the new home energy efficiency credit, which was again extended into 2016. The tax rate for future quarters should be approximately 34%, although we will continue to focus on trying to maximize this available energy credit.
Turning to the balance sheet. Liquidity remained strong with approximately $600 million of homebuilding cash and $375 million of borrowings under our $1.6 billion revolving credit facility. Our leverage improved by 390 basis points year-over-year as our homebuilding net debt to total capital was reduced to 43.5%. We grew stockholders' equity by 19% to $6.1 billion, and our book value per share increased to $27.92 per share.
In March, we issued $500 million of 5-year senior notes at 4.75%. And in April, we retired our maturing 6.5% senior notes. In May, we converted the remaining $71 million of our 2.75% convertible notes. And in addition, during the quarter, we early converted approximately $68 million of our 3.25% convertible senior notes with an additional $136 million converted subsequent to quarter end.
Finally, I would like to update our 2016 goals. 2016 homebuilding goals are right on track with the guidance that we gave at the start of the year with just a couple of quarterly refinements.
First, deliveries. Deliveries are still on track to be between 26,500 and 27,000 homes for all of 2016. The backlog conversion ratio in the second quarter was 88%, which exceeded the previous guidance of 80% to 85%. We capitalized on a healthy spring selling season and sold and delivered some homes in Q2 that were scheduled for our third quarter. Given that, we now expect our backlog conversion ratio to be around 75% in the third quarter.
The fourth quarter is still projected to achieve a backlog conversion of at least 90%. Operating margins are still on track to be flat to down 50 basis points for the entire year. The gross margin percent will vary between Q3 and Q4 based on our product mix. Q3 is expected to be between 22.5% and 23%, while the fourth quarter is projected to be between 23.5% and 24%. We are still on track to achieve the lowest SG&A in our company's history for the full year with the greatest leverage coming in our fourth quarter.
Turning to Financial Services. We are assuming we will continue to benefit from the extended low interest rate environment, and we are increasing our Financial Services goal to $130 million to $135 million of profit for all of 2016.
Turning to Rialto. We are still on track to earn between $15 million and $20 million for 2016. However, the onetime write-off of the hospital receivables will now bring the range to flat to $5 million of profit for the full year and is still weighted more heavily towards the fourth quarter.
We are still on track with $50 million to $55 million of profit in the Multifamily segment with the third quarter close to breakeven and strong profits in the fourth quarter. The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income, we expect to be flattish for the third quarter, but now expect the fourth quarter to be the highest profit quarter for this category in 2016 with $20 million to $30 million of profit.
And finally, our balance sheet is well on its way on its path to lower leverage. The soft pivot strategy, the strong earnings contribution and the $400 million 3.25% convertible securities, of which half is already converted through mid-June, should bring us to a net debt to total capital in the 35% to 40% range by year-end.

For example, Pacific Northwest were strong across all segments. Southern California was strong. Southeast and Southwest Florida were strong. Charlotte in the Carolinas also strong, and Central Valley, which is a more affordable price point for California. The place that was off the most was Houston, as you would expect, as we continue to see the effects of job loss there. And if -- you see that also with our greatest increase in incentives in Houston even though, for the overall company, we're flat. So if you look at it big picture, Florida was year-over-year sort of flat for us in absorption pace. California, flat. Texas, excluding Houston, was actually improved. Pricing in the Carolinas were improved. And clearly, we do see some lower demand in the higher price points as compared to lower price points. But generally, it's still submarket-driven."

As you look at the things that we've put under contract, we were very careful in, first of all, understanding where the growth in the market was going to be, focusing on vacancy levels, focusing on age of product that was close to our assets. So just like in our homebuilding business, we're very specific on identifying where things were going to come on and compete.

We started with an overlay of homebuilding operations where we had market data and market intelligence. We understood that we were not dealing with a national apartment market or for-sale markets, for that matter, but we were dealing with local markets, and each one would have to be regarded carefully and individually. We mapped out our strategy for investment for land acquisition. We were careful to avoid markets that looked like they were becoming oversaturated. I think Rick and Jon and the entire Multifamily team did an extraordinary job of finding the opportunities where growth would be consistent and where we would have long dated opportunities for a sustained business. And given the fact that we had a very deep research team already established that had an eye towards not just the rental markets, but also the for-sale markets, we think, gave us a better window into the market and better strategic positioning. There is a lot of talk about the urban markets being somewhat overbuilt. In most of those instances, those were the markets where we saw the most action and where we didn't get heavily involved or where we did -- we got involved very early at very attractive pricing. So I think that we are starting to hear -- everybody is starting to hear that there might be a little bit more heat in some of the rental markets. What I've heard articulated by one of the best and brightest in the rental market is that we're probably coming to the later innings of a doubleheader, the first game of a doubleheader. We might see a little bit of softness for a period of time. But it looks like and it feels like absorption is going to outstrip any kind of oversupply in fairly short order. And we think that there's a lot of run rate for the Multifamily market -- for the rental markets going forward."

And we see a pace of over 5 sales per community per month on average. Certainly, at the lower price point, it absorbs faster. California, in general, though, it's hard to produce homes at the lower price points because, not only of land costs, but also because of impact fees being as significant as they are. And so that tends to drive, particularly in Southern California and the Bay Area, a higher sales point. And at that higher sales price point, clearly, it's hard to get significant momentum above, I think, the current levels. We are seeing sustained interest particularly in the Asian or Chinese buyer. We haven't seen that fall off. So if you look at a place like Irvine, where's it's been very significant, we have good data at the Great Park. That's remained very consistent and healthy. Same thing in the Bay Area marketplace. So we're seeing consistency there. Bakersfield probably is off the most in terms of California markets. It's similar to Houston, just not as severe, that was hurt by the pullback in the energy sector, which is a lot of the job creation, so there's been -- in Bakersfield.

We have initiatives throughout our organization that are designed to use technologies to change the landscape of the way that we're operating our business. Some other examples of that are as simple as in and around technology. We are revamping the entire plumbing system of our technology department to reconfigure in a more efficient manner the way that we input information and ultimately produce reports for people in the field. That seems kind of simplistic. But in a company like ours that has evolved systems over a lot of years, going back and reconfiguring systems with a proper tubing system enables us to reduce the number of applications that we're actually using in the field with multiple points of input to drive efficient export of data to the people that need to use it on a regular basis. It'll enable us to be more accurate. It'll enable us to be a lot more timely, approaching real-time distribution of data over the next year or 2. This will -- that initiative alone will drive cost down. We view that over the next couple of years, there's a 20 to 50 basis point reduction in SG&A that we'll derive just from that. Now there might be some intermittent ticks up in cost, but primarily, the trend will be down. In our production arena, we are using our technologies to look at the number of models and the efficiency of the plan designs that we're offering our customers in the field. We're looking at technologies to review and to consolidate the view of SKUs that we're offering across our different markets. All of these things, we view as opportunities to bring another 10, 20, 50 basis points to either the reduction of SG&A or potentially the efficiency of our construction efforts."

We think that the development of some of these strategic ancillary businesses were very much a part of growing the core out of the downturn and leveraging opportunities that were part of our DNA. But having developed those strategies to elements of maturity, we think that there are opportunities that we have maintained as optional opportunities for those businesses to find better programs for themselves. You see that embedded in the way that FivePoint has been evolving. If you look at the management team of FivePoint, led by Emile Haddad, who we have been working -- he's been working within the company for over 20 years. The management team is a self-sufficient, independent, highly confident, industry-leading management team that's prepared to operate very independently. And as has been reported, we have been looking at an opportune time to invigorate an IPO. The market doesn't happen to be there. But with that said, it's emblematic of the strategies that we've employed. Jeff Krasnoff leads Rialto. Rialto has its self-sufficient team. And of course, as we've talked about quite a lot on this call, our Multifamily program, LMC, is also led by Todd Farrell, very strong leader with a core management team, that it too is operating very independently. So while under the Lennar umbrella, we all tend to thrive and work well together. And synergistically, the core mission right now is to revert to pure play as a homebuilder and to ultimately, over the next years, as opportunities present themselves, find proper homes for those opportunities."

So I think that what you're seeing is very similar to what we articulated as part of an IPO process, but just not with the fruition of the IPO process.

And I guess, if there's a representation of the choppiness we're talking about, it's the way that the first quarter evolved, kind of as a surprise to everyone. Fed raised interest rates, starting January 1 right out of the chutes at the beginning of the year. The capital markets tanked, and it created some lack of confidence in the consumer. I think, generally speaking, you can't time where the choppiness actually exists. And so we left a fairly wide range as we gave guidance at the beginning of the year. We're probably trending to the lower parts of that range. But I think it derives from the choppiness that's embedded in the system and the way that the year started out. And so at the end of the day, I think this is well within kind of the range that we've articulated. I don't think it should be of any concern that we're trending towards the lower part of that range. And in fact, it's exactly why we gave the range that we did, recognizing that there are some tugs and pulls to the downside as well as the upside, but we still believe very strongly that the trend is upward."

We are seeing some labor price increases out in the field and that's flowing through our product. Certainly, the building material manufacturers are trying to get more for their product as well. That, combined with the slowing of sales price increases, has caused our margins to compress a little bit. As you step back from that, I would say that they're still very healthy margins. We're very much focused on operating margin. If we can get some incremental deliveries, you'll see the play on operating margin, and that's really how we're operating the company. We are -- we continue to benefit from some land assets that we bought in prior years. But when we're replacing those land assets, a little bit higher land cost base is running through.

And as usual, the light to request so we can get as many questions as possible in our hours that you limit yourself to one question. [Operator Instructions]
So great. Let me go ahead and begin and say that our third quarter 2016 results reflect yet another quarter of strong operating results for our company. We have consistently believe that we are in a slow steady, though sometimes choppy, housing market recovery, and we've crafted our operating strategies specifically to position us well to grow steadily and consistently and to act opportunistically in these market conditions. 
As we noted over the past years, the overall housing market has been generally defined by a rather large production deficit that continue to grow over the past years. This deficit is particularly focused on the first-time homebuyer segment of the market, and this was rather late to begin its slow and steady improvement as well.
While questions have been raised as to the real normalized levels of production that are required to serve the growing U.S. population, we continue to believe that production levels in the 1 million to 1.2 million starts per year range are still too low for the needs of the American household growth that is now normalizing. Additional questions have been raised as the effect of an increase in interest rates relative to the recovery for first-time homebuyers segment. We believe that there continues to be a growing pent-up demand for dwellings of all price across the country, though stronger in some markets than others, and this demand will continue to propel a continued long cycle, slow and steady, sometimes erratic market improvement that will not be derailed by slow movements in interest rate, and this goes for both first-time and move-up purchasers.
With that said, it's important to note that the housing market is not really a national market, but instead, it's a large number of very local markets each with different dynamics that are averaged together to -- that generate some sometimes quirky results and data.
While demand has been constrained by limited access to mortgages, stronger general economic conditions, including lower unemployment, wage growth and general consumer confidence, are still driving consumers to form new households and to purchase homes and to rent apartments. We continue to expect that demand will build and come to market over the next years, and that will drive increased production as the deficit in housing stock ultimately needs to be replenished.
Nevertheless, availability of land and labor shortages continue to be limiting factors and constrain supply and restrict the ability to quickly respond to growing demand while the mortgage market and higher rent continue to limit that demand.
We expect that these conditions will continue to result in a slow, steady, positive homebuilding market and will enable slow and steady growth throughout the industry. These have been our consistent guiding views over the past years, and we've mapped our operating strategy around these bees. Each segment of our company has positioned itself for continued performance in 2016 and beyond, and we believe that we remain well positioned to execute our operating plans and strategies in each of these segments.
Now against that backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating segments. Our for-sale homebuilding operations continue to operate at a very high level of efficiency with a steady growth pace and a focus on operational excellence. Our results reflect execution of our operating strategy as our new home orders increased 8% year-over-year while community count grew 3% and our average home price grew 3% to approximately $362,000. Even while continued labor shortages and land and construction cost increases have tested our ability to match sales and delivery pace, our management team has managed sales prices, maximized margins and focused on reducing SG&A to offset and maintain a strong net operating margin, which came in at 13.2% for the third quarter. This focus has helped improve our balance sheet as well with our net homebuilding debt to total cap coming in at just below 40% with further improvement expected in the fourth quarter. 
As we've noticed -- as we've noted in past conference calls, we've adjusted our for-sale housing strategy as the recovery has matured and land pricing has gotten more expensive. We've noted 3 components of our core homebuilding strategy. One, soft pivot ; two, target lower growth rate; and three, focus on SG&A. We've talked consistently and extensively about our soft pivot land strategy over the past years away from land-heavy acquisition strategy in the early stages in recovery. We are now targeting high-quality a location land acquisition with a shorter 2 to 3-year average life. Additionally, we've ramped up our first-time homebuyer offering organically with lower land cost as that segment of the market continues to recover.
Second, we've noted in the past quarterly conference calls and that given the now mature recovery, we have been and continue to carefully manage and limit our growth in orders to concurrently grow bottom line and to drive strong cash flow. We've moderated our top line growth target to achieve a growth rate in the 7% at 10% range as we've redirected our management efforts towards maximizing our net operating margin. 
Third, with less pressure on top line growth, we've intensified management focus on driving faster bottom line growth and cash flow by maximizing pricing power and using innovative strategies to drive our SG&A down. Under the company mantra of what we can measure we can change, we are focused on changing and improving all elements of our operations. I noted an example last quarter and highlighted that we've been reducing customer acquisition cost through our digital marketing initiatives.
We've expanded our focus to other operational elements of our business and are seeing reductions in expenses in those areas as well. It is noteworthy that this quarter's SG&A of 9.3% is the lowest third quarter SG&A in our company's history. Our homebuilding operations are becoming extremely efficient operating machines. 
With demand growing steadily, land limited, labor tight and constrained mortgage availability, we believe that our 3-pronged strategy for our homebuilding segment positions us well for steady growth and as well the ability to use a strong balance sheet to act opportunistically.
Moving on, our Financial Services group is continuing to expand and improve and has had an outstanding second quarter as well. While the Financial Services operation have grown alongside our core homebuilding business, we have also benefited from a strong, though sometimes erratic, refi market, as well as from the expansion of retail opportunities in both our mortgage and title platforms. These sidecar opportunities have continued to expand our platform as we move through 2016, and that's reflected in our operating earnings of $53.2 million, up 35% over last year.
Our strategy for the future of Lennar Financial Services continues to be to construct and maintain a fully sufficient financial services platform that benefits from Lennar homebuilding business, but drives profitability from retail operations as well. Bruce Gross oversees this operation and will discuss it further in his comments.
Next, our Multifamily platform continues to develop as a leading blue-chip developer of apartment communities across the country. The third quarter has continued an outstanding run for LMC, Lennar Multifamily Communities, which continues to come lament our for-sale homebuilding operations. With the home ownership rate continuing its decline, now dropping just below 63%, many new households have either been forced or are inclined to rent rather than purchase and have focused on -- and we have focused on building well-located rental communities to address this market opportunity.
First-time home purchasers have come back to the market more slowly than they have historically and more slowly than expected. While the growing percentage of our for-sale homebuilding business continues to be geared towards first-time purchasers, our broader new household strategy has targeted the rental market as well. 
As we've continued to expand our national footprint, we've matured and evolved from a merchant build program, which was designed to prove our base concept. This beginning phase has worked extremely well, as reflected in the sales of properties we have recorded to date and the additional sales that will close in the fourth quarter as well. Through those sales, we have proven our ability to purchase, to design, build, stabilize and sell quite profitably number of our community at an increasing level of profitability.
Having proven the concept, we have now built or added to -- or added a build-to-core platform. This platform enables us to build and retain our outstanding pipeline of properties and benefit from long-term ownership. We have currently a solid $2 billion for a build-to-core platform, which will become a long-term cash flowing -- cash producing, fee generating value creation machine. While Multifamily production has generally normalized and some have expressed concerns about over-building in some markets, nationally, more rental product is going to continue to be needed to feel the national production deficit and we are very well positioned to continue to be very careful in site selection while we fill this need and grow our Multifamily platform. Our now $7 billion plus apartment strategy is proving to be very well-timed, as rental rates have climbed to exceed our original underwriting and vacancies remained at very low levels.
Next, our Rialto segment saw a nice turnaround in the third quarter, as the capital markets stabilized after a rough start in the first half of 2016. During the quarter, market conditions continued to improve and [indiscernible] completed -- Rialto Mortgage Finance completed its 30th and 31st securitization transaction with gross margins ranging from 5.4% to 5.7% and with almost $500 million of RMF origination loans. Rialto Mortgage Finance maintained its position as one of the largest non-bank CMBS loan originators with the rebound in the market, the securitization transactions occurring this quarter, generated the single largest contribution of loans Rialto Mortgage Finance has ever made and also the largest net margin for a single transition -- transaction in our history. This brings our total to almost $6 billion of securitized loans since RMF inception. 
On the asset management front, we also previously announced the first closing of commitments of our third fund. And although we can't really say anything more as we're still in the market, this fund will complement our other opportunistic fund with readily available capital to invest as we have approximately $920 million of investor equity dedicated to mezzanine and transitional lending in those other funds. 
Our 2 flagship opportunity funds have both been top quartile performers. Fund one became fully invested in early 2013 and we now distributed 135% of investors original capital from income and monetizations. And with the distribution through this quarter, Rialto now has already realized 2x its original best investment with a  lot more to go.
We expect to begin to report, promote on this first fund in the first half of 2017. Additionally, on a current basis, our fund and asset management business shows improved profitability over the last year's second -- last year's third quarter, and we expect this trend to continue. 
Overall, our Rialto platform enables us to invest across all real estate and financial products and allows us to capitalize on both short-term and long-term duration opportunities throughout the economic cycle. The dysfunction that we saw earlier this year in the financial market, along with new retention rules and banking relations, are beginning to work to the benefit of Rialto's core competent and CMBS and financial products, and we have the capital available to invest.
Finally, FivePoint is now a self-sufficient standalone company that is a premier strategic large-scale community builder. As we stated in our last quarterly conference call, we contributed and exchanged our interest in 3 strategic joint ventures and our interest in the management company for an investment in this newly formed entity. This transaction marks the next step in FivePoint's evolution as a strategic developer and manager of large-scale, master-planned communities. It also marks a next step in Lennar's strategic mission to revert to our core homebuilding base as it liberates FivePoint to act independently, raise capital and utilize its pristine balance sheet to operate opportunistically.
FivePoint will operate very independently with a self-contained management team under the leadership of Emil Hadad, who many of you know. We simply could not be more excited about the prospects for the future for this one-of-a-kind leader in community development. 
So in summary, overall, let me say that we continue to be very pleased to present our third quarter results and our overall progress this morning. We feel very confident that our view of the market and the strategies that have defined our various business segments continue to work very well to position us for continued performance and for future growth. As I've said many times before, we believe very confidently that we have the right people, the right programs and the right timing to continue to perform this year and into the future. 
Now let me turn it over to Bruce."

I'll provide some more color on our businesses and conclude with an update on our 2016 goals. 
Revenues from home sales increased 11% in the third quarter, driven by a 7% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and a 3% year-over-year increase in average selling price to $362,000. Our gross margin on home sales in the third quarter was 22.6%, which was in line with our stated goals. The prior year's gross margin percentage was 24.1%. The gross margin decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land cost.
Sales incentives were 5.9% this quarter compared to 5.6% in the prior year, with the largest increase coming from the Houston segment, particularly with higher-price communities. Gross margin percent were once again highest in the East region. Direct construction cost have increased moderately compared to the prior year. These costs were up 2.5% year-over-year to approximately $53 per square foot. This was driven entirely by labor, offset by a slight decrease in material cost.
As Stuart mentioned, SG&A as a percentage of revenue improved -- it improved by 60 basis points as we were successful gaining operating leverage by growing volume organically in existing homebuilding divisions and from the benefits of our focus on digital marketing.
Other income was $30.9 million, primarily due to a gain of $8.7 million on the sale of a clubhouse, which we originally were projecting to close in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we had $17 million of management fee income from one of our strategic joint ventures. Equity in large from unconsolidated entities was $18 million, which included our share of the loss related to the $17 million that I just mentioned in other income, and our share of net operating losses and one-time charges from the newly created 5-point entity combination that Stuart mentioned.
This quarter, we opened 66 new communities and ended the quarter with 694 net active communities. Our sales pace was higher compared to the prior year at 3.4 sales per community per month versus 3.2 in prior year's quarter. The cancellation rate decreased to 16% in the third quarter. And we purchased approximately 5,400 homesites, totaling hundred 264 million versus 267 million in the prior year's quarter. These numbers align with our soft pivot strategy where we're focused on buying shortage land. Our homesites owned and controlled now total 159,000 homesites, of which 129,000 are owned and 30,000 are controlled.
We brought down our completed unsold homes during the quarter. It came down 19% sequentially to 973 homes. 
Turning to Financial Services. They had strong results this quarter with operating earnings of $53.2 million compared to $39.4 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income increased to $38.3 million from $31.4 million in the prior year. The improved earnings were driven by an increase profit per loan due to the favorable interest rate environment. Mortgage originations increased to $2.6 billion compared to $2.4 billion in the prior year. As a result of a focused effort to capitalize on low mortgage rates in the third quarter, we achieved a 56% increase in refinance origination volume versus the prior year.
The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers remain consistent with the prior year at 82% capture rate. And our title company also had a strong quarter. Their profits increased to $15 million from $8.2 million in the prior year, and that was also primarily due to higher refinance transaction volume in the current year. Additionally, they had a great focus on operational efficiencies driving additional bottom line profit.
Turning to Rialto. This segment produced operating earnings of $5.9 million compared to $9 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The investment management business contributed $27.6 million of earnings, which include $6 million of equity and earnings from the real estate funds and $21.6 million of management fees and other. At quarter end, the undiscovered it hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Fund 1 and 2 now totals $141 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $491 million of commercial loans and to 2 securitizations resulting in earnings of $27.2 million compared with $519 million and $14.2 million in the prior year, respectively.  And that's before their G&A expense. 
The increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in the net margins, this year was 5.4% in the third quarter versus last year's third quarter at 3.1% net margin. Our direct investments had a loss of $5.6 million during the quarter. And Rialto G&A and other expenses were $36.2 million for the quarter. And interest expense, excluding warehouse lines, was $7.1 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $133 million of cash.
The Multifamily segment delivered a $2.6 million operating profit in the quarter, primarily driven by the segment's $8 million share of a gain from the sale of an operating property, as well as management fee income partially offset by G&A expenses. We ended the quarter with 8 completed in operating properties and 37 under construction, 10 of which are in lease up, totaling over 11,000 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $3.2 billion. Including these communities, we have a diversified development pipeline that exceeds $7 billion and over 20,000 apartments.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 31.1% compared to 30% in the prior years period. The rate is lower than expected for this quarter as a result of our continued efforts to maximize the new home energy efficiency credit, which was extended into 2016.
We will continue to focus on maximizing this energy credit. And therefore, we believe the tax rates in the fourth quarter will also be lower than previously expected. We believe that will be a range of 33% to 34%. 
Our balance sheet is strong. Our operating strategy is focused on driving cash flow generation. And this quarter, we generated positive operating cash flow. Liquidity remained strong with approximately $568 million of homebuilding cash and $125 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which during the quarter was increased to $1.8 billion.
Our leverage improved by 650 basis points year-over-year as our homebuilding net debt-to-total capital was reduced to 39.9%. We grew stockholders equity by 22% to $6.5 billion and our book value per share increased to $28.73 per share.
During the quarter, we early converted an additional $175 million of our 3.25% convertible senior notes. And for the year, we've now converted a total of $243 million of those notes. Our next step maturity matures in June of 2017, and we look forward to retiring $400 million of 12.25% senior notes, which currently cost us $50 million per interest per year.
Finally, I would like to update our 2016 goals. We are still on track with our 2016 goals with a few refinements for the fourth quarter. 
First, deliveries are still on track with our original 2016 goal to deliver between 26,527,000 homes. The fourth quarter is projected to achieve a backlog conversion right at 90%. We expect the average sales price for these deliveries to be between $355,000 and $360,000 per how homes. 
Turning to margin. There gross margin percentage for the fourth quarter is projected to be approximately 23.25%. And we are still on track to achieve the lowest SG&A percentage in the company's history in 2016 with our fourth quarter expected to see another 50 basis points reduction sequentially below the third quarter's 9.3%. So that would bring it around 8.8% for the fourth quarter. 
Financial Services. Our second and third quarter are typically the highest profit quarters for LSS. However, given the continued favorable interest rate environment, we are also increasing our goal to the fourth quarter for this segment to a range of $37 million to $40 million for the quarter.
Rialto earnings are projected to be in a range of $5 million to $7 million of profit for the fourth quarter. And Multifamily, based on our favorable sale expectations, for between 4 and 5 communities for the fourth quarter, we are increasing our Multifamily goal to a range of $30 million to $40 million for the fourth quarter. Joint ventures, land sales and the other income, which I'll group together, we were successful in accelerating some of the projected fourth quarter land sale and clubhouse transactions into our third quarter. So we are now updating our projection to this category to $5 million for the fourth quarter.
And then, finally, with our balance sheet. As we noted, our third quarter net debt to total capital has come down below 40%, and we are well on our path to lowered leverage. As Stuart mentioned with our operating strategies, our strong projected earnings, our soft pivot strategy and converting the remainder of the 3.25% convertible, which will shift from deft equity in the fourth quarter, all of these will continue to lead to lower leverage, which has given us a rock solid balance sheet and positions us well for opportunities as we finish out 2016.
Let me now turn it back to the operator and open it up for questions."

And I was hoping, instead of just focusing on this quarter, we could kind of walk through your thinking process on gross margin and profitability in the context of your comments about delivery growth of 7% to 10% annually. It sounds a little bit like you're doing more with less inventory, but you're keeping margins high. I'm just trying thinking about the trajectory of how this involves, not just today, but more in 2017 and 2018."

We highlighted that at the beginning of this year and as we move through last year as well. But we also focus attention on net operating margin primarily, recognizing that as land that was what bought at very low prices flow through our system, margins would be higher. As that land dissipated and we ended up with more shorter-term land, our gross margins would drift down. But we felt that as the recovery matured, we will continue to focus on bringing down our growth rate, focusing on efficiencies in our SG&A, as we've been articulating, and really driving increased earnings through more efficient net operating margin. 
Let me turn to Rick and Jon and have them weigh in on that."

The natural evolution of a soft pivot is that you're starting to take less risk in land. Associated with that risk profile is a margin presence. You're looking for near-term opportunities, quicker turns. So gross margin will naturally come down and IRRs will come up. And so when we're going less long on some of these positions, it means that you're paying a little bit closer to retail than you were in buying homes sale. The other thing that we've been doing as we really been managing pace in price. A great example of that is notwithstanding the fact that the Houston market is definitely softer, given the turmoil in the energy market. But if you look at our performance there for the last quarter, sales were up by 14%, but our ASP was up by 4%. So in a tough market, we're really trying to maximize the value of the quality assets that we've got there and I give the homes away. We certainly could sold more homes, but we're just really managing it."

And the Rialto business sounds like to promote what's going to become much more visible in the second -- the first half of 2017. Can you give us a little bit of a roadmap for thinking about the timing and how you might monetize these assets? It sounds like you have a lot of progress burning them up the curve.

FivePoint, we have seen a consolidation of our interest and a unification under a corporate umbrella, where which is being overseen by its Emil Hadad.

That's an example of how we will continue to think about our ancillary businesses move them through the system. The second area is in the apartment area. You're already starting to see a migration through that merchant build program and towards our build to core program, which, in many ways, is very separate program. It, again like FivePoint has its own complement of management and that builds a core program as an opportunity for us to build a stream of earnings that is consistent, it's fee generative and enables us to realize on the great value that we're creating. 
Rialto continues to build to be able to be strategic in its alignment for the future, but we don't have a current path for Rialto that we've articulated.

Our view has been that our gross margins will continue to drift downward. I think if you look at the average in the industry, if you look at what's normalized gross margin in the industry, you're probably looking at 21%, 22%. And over time, we'll probably drift in that direction. The industry average might even be lower than that. But I would say a few things. We have all lot of guns in our arsenal. We've been very focused on operational efficiency. We are not focusing on stretching growth in an environment that just isn't giving it easily. Land is expensive. Land is hard to come by. People are expensive and hard to come by. It's hard to grow operations efficiently and effectively at an accelerated rate in a market where land and labor is really constrained. And so we've chosen to focus on operational efficiencies as a mechanism for driving profitability going forward. And we've been consistently articulating, look at the net operating margin where we'll find much more stability and the opportunity to drive profitability going forward from our core business. But with that said, we've also articulated other strategies. Look at our Financial Services group. We've been diversifying that group, not only is it growing alongside our core homebuilding business, it's growing outside of that homebuilding operation. And we're finding additional earnings by leveraging that part of our business. Look at Rialto, look at our Multifamily effort, look at our ancillaries, and you start to see that there are real growth components that derive from a core homebuilding operation that's operating well and these ancillary businesses that are operating cooperatively."

But perhaps, you could talk to Rialto and LMC, I'm sorry, LMF, how do you think about those businesses in terms of being a part of the broader Lennar family over the next 2 or 3 years.

As it relates to LMC, our Multifamily platform, I think that there's a very strong case to be made that, that business really is almost part of the quarter. It has been a part of our strategy for dealing with the first-time homebuyer segment, which is being forced or inclined to rent rather than to purchase the car's market conditions or because of appetites. And in fact, this strategy has worked out quite well for us and might be a very compatible program under the core umbrella. So we're not -- we're certainly not targeting right now a spinoff or some other kind of program relative to that segment and we'll have to see over time. As it relates to Rialto, Rialto was built with the understanding that it will be synergistic to our -- to the growth of our core business and it was in fact, through the downturn. We've grown Rialto into a business that looked an awful lot like the business that we spun-off back in 1997 under the name Eleanor. And it continues to grow along those lines. Now there has been choppiness in the capital market. There are questions around the regulatory environment. We think that each of these things work to our benefit. And as we continue to grow the platform, we want to let these things resolved themselves before we designed and put forth an exit strategy. But ultimately, Rialto will standal one."

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. And I'm here this morning joined by an assorted group of our management team, including Bruce, of course, our Chief Financial Officer; Rick Beckwitt our President; and Jon Jaffe, our Chief Financial Officer; Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto; and some others. But those will be the primary participants. I'm going to briefly give some remarks and then Bruce will jump in with some additional detail and then we'll open up to Q&A. And as usual, I'd like to request so we can get as many questions as possible in our hour that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up please.
So great. Let me go ahead and begin and say that our third quarter 2016 results reflect yet another quarter of strong operating results for our company. We have consistently believed that we are in a slow, steady, though sometimes choppy, housing market recovery, and we've crafted our operating strategies specifically to position us well to grow steadily and consistently and to act opportunistically in these market conditions.
As we've noted over the past years, the overall housing market has been generally defined by a rather large production deficit that's continued to grow over the past years. This deficit is particularly focused on the first-time homebuyer segment of the market and this part of the market was rather late to begin its slow and steady improvement as well.
While questions have been raised as to the real normalized levels of production that are required to serve the growing U.S. population, we continue to believe that production levels in the 1 million to 1.2 million starts per year range are still too low for the needs of the American household growth that is now normalizing. Additional questions have been raised as the effect of an increase in interest rates relative to the recovery for first-time homebuyers segment. We believe that there continues to be a growing pent-up demand for dwellings of all types across the country, though stronger in some markets than others, and this demand will continue to propel a continued long cycle, slow and steady, sometimes erratic, market improvement that will not be derailed by slow movements in interest rate and this goes for both first-time and move-up purchasers.
With that said, it's important to note that the housing market is not really a national market, but instead, it's a large number of very local markets each with different dynamics that are averaged together to -- that generate some sometimes-quirky results and data.
While demand has been constrained by limited access to mortgages, stronger general economic conditions, including lower unemployment, wage growth and general consumer confidence, are still driving consumers to form new households and to purchase homes and to rent apartments. We continue to expect that demand will build and come to market over the next years, and that will drive increased production as the deficit in housing stock ultimately needs to be replenished.
Nevertheless, availability of land and labor shortages continue to be limiting factors and constrain supply and restrict the ability to quickly respond to growing demand while the mortgage market and higher rents continue to limit that demand.
We expect that these conditions will continue to result in a slow, steady, positive homebuilding market and will enable slow and steady growth throughout the industry. These have been our consistent guiding views over the past years, and we've mapped our operating strategy around these views. Each segment of our company has positioned itself for continued performance in 2016 and beyond, and we believe that we remain well positioned to execute our operating plans and strategies in each of these segments.
Now against that backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating segments. Our for-sale homebuilding operations continue to operate at a very high level of efficiency with a steady growth pace and a focus on operational excellence. Our results reflect execution of our operating strategy as our new home orders increased 8% year-over-year, while community count grew 3% and our average home price grew 3% to approximately $362,000. Even while continued labor shortages and land and construction cost increases have tested our ability to match sales and delivery pace, our management team has managed sales prices, maximized margins and focused on reducing SG&A to offset and maintain a strong net operating margin, which came in at 13.2% for the third quarter. This focus has helped improve our balance sheet as well with our net homebuilding debt to total cap coming in at just below 40% with further improvement expected in the fourth quarter.
As we've noticed -- as we've noted in past conference calls, we've adjusted our for-sale housing strategy as the recovery has matured and land pricing has gotten more expensive. We've noted 3 components of our core homebuilding strategy: one, soft pivot ; two, target lower growth rate; and three, focus on SG&A. We've talked consistently and extensively about our soft pivot land strategy over the past years, away from land-heavy acquisition strategy in the early stages of the recovery. We are now targeting high-quality 'A' location land acquisition with a shorter 2- to 3-year average life. Additionally, we've ramped up our first-time homebuyer offering organically with lower land costs as that segment of the market continues to recover.
Second, we've noted in the past quarterly conference calls that given the now mature recovery, we have been and continue to carefully manage and limit our growth in orders to concurrently grow bottom line and to drive strong cash flow. We've moderated our top line growth target to achieve a growth rate in the 7% to 10% range as we've redirected our management efforts towards maximizing our net operating margin.
Third, with less pressure on top line growth, we've intensified management focus on driving faster bottom line growth and cash flow by maximizing pricing power and using innovative strategies to drive our SG&A down. Under the company mantra of what we can measure we can change, we are focused on changing and improving all elements of our operations. I noted an example last quarter and highlighted that we've been reducing customer acquisition costs through our digital marketing initiatives.
We've expanded our focus to other operational elements of our business and are seeing reductions in expenses in those areas as well. It is noteworthy that this quarter's SG&A of 9.3% is the lowest third quarter SG&A in our company's history. Our homebuilding operations are becoming extremely efficient operating machines.
With demand growing steadily, land limited, labor tight and constrained mortgage availability, we believe that our 3-pronged strategy for our homebuilding segment positions us well for steady growth and as well, the ability to use a strong balance sheet to act opportunistically.
Moving on, our Financial Services group is continuing to expand and improve and has had an outstanding second quarter as well. While the Financial Services operations have grown alongside our core homebuilding business, we have also benefited from a strong, though sometimes erratic, refi market, as well as from the expansion of retail opportunities in both our mortgage and titled platforms. These sidecar opportunities have continued to expand our platform as we move through 2016, and that's reflected in our operating earnings of $53.2 million, up 35% over last year.
Our strategies for the future of Lennar Financial Services continues to be to construct and maintain a fully sufficient financial services platform that benefits from Lennar Homebuilding business, but drives profitability from retail operations as well. Bruce Gross oversees this operation and will discuss it further in his comments.
Next, our Multifamily platform continues to develop as a leading blue-chip developer of apartment communities across the country. The third quarter has continued an outstanding run for LMC, Lennar Multifamily Communities, which continues to complement our for-sale homebuilding operations. With the home-ownership rate continuing its decline, now dropping just below 63%, many new households have either been forced or are inclined to rent rather than purchase and have focused on build -- and we have focused on building well-located rental communities to address this market opportunity.
First-time home purchasers have come back to the market more slowly than they have historically and more slowly than expected. While the growing percentage of our for-sale homebuilding business continues to be geared towards first-time purchasers, our broader new household strategy has targeted the rental market as well.
As we've continued to expand our national footprint, we've matured and evolved from a merchant build program, which was designed to prove our base concept. This beginning phase has worked extremely well as reflected in the sales of properties we have recorded to date and the additional sales that will close in the fourth quarter as well. Through those sales, we have proven our ability to purchase, to design, build, stabilize and sell quite profitably a number of our communities at an increasing level of profitability. Having proven the concept, we have now built or added to -- or added a build-to-core platform. This platform enables us to build and retain our outstanding pipeline of properties and benefit from long-term ownership. We have currently a solid $2 billion for a build-to-core platform, which will become a long-term cash flowing -- cash-producing, fee-generating value creation machine.
While Multifamily production has generally normalized and some have expressed concerns about overbuilding in some markets, nationally, more rental product is going to continue to be needed to fill the national production deficit, and we are very well positioned to continue to be very careful in site selection while we fill this need and grow our Multifamily platform. Our now $7 billion plus apartment strategy is proving to be very well-timed as rental rates have climbed to exceed our original underwriting and vacancies remained at very low levels.
Next, our Rialto segment saw a nice turnaround in the third quarter as the capital markets stabilized after a rough start in the first half of 2016. During the quarter, market conditions continued to improve and RMF completed -- Rialto Mortgage Finance completed its 30th and 31st securitization transactions with gross margins ranging from 5.4% to 5.7% and with almost $500 million of RMF-originated loans. Rialto Mortgage Finance maintained its position as one of the largest nonbank CMBS loan originators. With the rebound in the market, the securitization transactions occurring this quarter generated the single largest contribution of loans Rialto Mortgage Finance has ever made and also the largest net margin for a single transition -- transaction in our history. This brings our total to almost $6 billion of securitized loans since RMF inception.
On the asset management front, we also previously announced the first closing of commitments of our third fund. And although we can't really say anything more, as we are still in the market, this fund will complement our other opportunistic funds with readily available capital to invest as we have approximately $920 million of investor equity dedicated to mezzanine and transitional lending in those other funds.
Our first 2 flagship opportunity funds have both been top quartile performers. Fund 1 became fully invested in early 2013, and we've now distributed 135% of investors original capital from income and monetizations. And with the distribution through this quarter, Rialto now has already realized 2x its original investment with a lot more to go.
We expect to begin to report -- promote on this first fund in the first half of 2017. Additionally, on a current basis, our fund and asset management business showed improved profitability over the last year's second -- last year's third quarter, and we expect this trend to continue.
Overall, our Rialto platform enables us to invest across all real estate and financial products and allows us to capitalize on both short-term and long-term duration opportunities throughout the economic cycle. The dysfunction that we saw earlier this year in the financial markets, along with new risk retention rules and banking regulations, are beginning to work to the benefit of Rialto's core competent and CMBS and financial products, and we have the capital available to invest.
Finally, FivePoint is now a self-sufficient standalone company that is a premier strategic large-scale community builder. As we stated in our last quarterly conference call, we contributed and exchanged our interest in 3 strategic joint ventures and our interest in the management company for an investment in this newly formed entity. This transaction marks the next step in FivePoint's evolution as a strategic developer and manager of large-scale, master-planned communities. It also marks a next step in Lennar's strategic mission to revert to our core homebuilding base as it liberates FivePoint to act independently, raise capital and utilize its pristine balance sheet to operate opportunistically.
FivePoint will operate very independently with a self-contained management team under the leadership of Emile Haddad, who many of you know. We simply could not be more excited about the prospects for the future for this one-of-a-kind leader in community development.
So in summary, overall, let me say that we continue to be very pleased to present our third quarter results and our overall progress this morning. We feel very confident that our view of the market and the strategies that have defined our various business segments continue to work very well to position us for continued performance and for future growth. As I've said many times before, we believe very confidently that we have the right people, the right programs and the right timing to continue to perform this year and into the future.
Now let me turn it over to Bruce."

I'll provide some more color on our businesses and conclude with an update on our 2016 goals.Revenues from home sales increased 11% in the third quarter, driven by a 7% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 3% year-",1514,"Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. I'll provide some more color on our businesses and conclude with an update on our 2016 goals.
Revenues from home sales increased 11% in the third quarter, driven by a 7% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 3% year-over-year increase in average selling price to $362,000. Our gross margin on home sales in the third quarter was 22.6%, which was in line with our stated goals. The prior year's gross margin percentage was 24.1%. The gross margin decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land costs.
Sales incentives were 5.9% this quarter compared to 5.6% in the prior year, with the largest increase coming from the Houston segment, particularly with higher-price communities. Gross margin percents were once again highest in the East region. Direct construction costs have increased moderately compared to the prior year. These costs were up 2.5% year-over-year to approximately $53 per square foot. This was driven entirely by labor, offset by a slight decrease in material costs.
As Stuart mentioned, SG&A as a percentage of revenue improved, it improved by 60 basis points, as we were successful gaining operating leverage by growing volume organically in existing homebuilding divisions and from the benefits of our focus on digital marketing.
Other income was $30.9 million, primarily due to a gain of $8.7 million on the sale of a clubhouse, which we originally were projecting to close in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we had $17 million of management fee income from one of our strategic joint ventures.
Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $18 million, which included our share of the loss related to the $17 million that I just mentioned in other income, and our share of net operating losses and one-time charges from the newly created FivePoint entity and combination that Stuart mentioned.
This quarter, we opened 66 new communities and ended the quarter with 694 net active communities. Our sales pace was higher compared to the prior year at 3.4 sales per community per month versus 3.2 in the prior year's quarter. The cancellation rate decreased to 16% in the third quarter. And we purchased approximately 5,400 homesites, totaling $264 million versus $267 million in the prior year's quarter. These numbers align with our soft pivot strategy where we're focused on buying shorter duration lands. Our homesites owned and controlled now total 159,000 homesites, of which 129,000 are owned and 30,000 are controlled. We brought down our completed unsold homes during the quarter. They came down 19% sequentially to 973 homes.
Turning to Financial Services. They had strong results this quarter with operating earnings of $53.2 million compared to $39.4 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income increased to $38.3 million from $31.4 million in the prior year. The improved earnings were driven by an increase profit per loan due to the favorable interest rate environment. Mortgage originations increased to $2.6 billion compared to $2.4 billion in the prior year. As a result of a focused effort to capitalize on the low mortgage rates in the third quarter, we achieved a 56% increase in refinance origination volume versus the prior year.
The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers remain consistent with the prior year at 82% capture rate. And our titled company also had a strong quarter. Their profits increased to $15 million from $8.2 million in the prior year and that was also primarily due to higher refinance transaction volume in the current year. Additionally, they had a great focus on operational efficiencies driving additional bottom line profit.
Turning to Rialto. This segment produced operating earnings of $5.9 million compared to $9 million in the prior year. Both amounts are a net of noncontrolling interest. The investment management business contributed $27.6 million of earnings, which includes $6 million of equity and earnings from the real estate funds and $21.6 million of management fees and other. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Funds 1 and 2 now totals $141 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $491 million of commercial loans into 2 securitizations resulting in earnings of $27.2 million compared with $519 million and $14.2 million in the prior year, respectively. And that's before their G&A expense.
The increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in the net margins. This year was 5.4% in the third quarter versus last year's third quarter at 3.1% net margin. Our direct investments had a loss of $5.6 million during the quarter. And Rialto G&A and other expenses were $36.2 million for the quarter and interest expense, excluding warehouse lines, was $7.1 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $133 million of cash.
The Multifamily segment delivered a $2.6 million operating profit in the quarter, primarily driven by the segment's $8 million share of the gain from the sale of an operating property, as well as management fee income partially offset by G&A expenses. We ended the quarter with 8 completed in operating properties and 37 under construction, 10 of which are in lease-up, totaling over 11,000 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $3.2 billion. Including these communities, we have a diversified development pipeline that exceeds $7 billion and over 20,000 apartments.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 31.1% compared to 30% in the prior year's period. The rate is lower than expected for this quarter as a result of our continued efforts to maximize the new home energy efficiency credit, which was extended into 2016.
We will continue to focus on maximizing this energy credit and, therefore, we believe the tax rate for the fourth quarter will also be lower than previously expected. We believe that will be a range of 33% to 34%.
Our balance sheet is strong. Our operating strategy is focused on driving cash flow generation and this quarter, we generated positive operating cash flow. Liquidity remained strong with approximately $568 million of homebuilding cash and $125 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which during the quarter was increased to $1.8 billion. Our leverage improved by 650 basis points year-over-year as our homebuilding net debt to total capital was reduced to 39.9%. We grew stockholders' equity by 22% to $6.5 billion, and our book value per share increased to $28.73 per share.
During the quarter, we early converted an additional $175 million of our 3.25% convertible senior notes. And for the year, we've now converted a total of $243 million of those notes. Our next step maturity matures in June of 2017, and we look forward to retiring $400 million of 12.25% senior notes, which currently cost us $50 million interest per year.
Finally, I would like to update our 2016 goals. We are still on track with our 2016 goals with a few refinements for the fourth quarter.
First, deliveries are still on track with our original 2016 goal to deliver between 26,500 and 27,000 homes. The fourth quarter is projected to achieve a backlog conversion right at 90%. We expect the average sales price for these deliveries to be between $355,000 and $360,000 per home.
Turning to margins. The gross margin percentage for the fourth quarter is projected to be approximately 23.25%. And we are still on track to achieve the lowest SG&A percentage in the company's history in 2016 with our fourth quarter expected to see another 50 basis points reduction sequentially below the third quarter's 9.3%. So that would bring it around 8.8% for the fourth quarter.
Financial Services. Our second and third quarter are typically the highest profit quarters for LFS. However, given the continued favorable interest rate environment, we are also increasing our goal for the fourth quarter for this segment to a range of $37 million to $40 million for the quarter.
Rialto earnings are projected to be in a range of $5 million to $7 million of profit for the fourth quarter. And Multifamily, based on our favorable sale expectations, for between 4 and 5 communities for the fourth quarter, we are increasing our Multifamily goal to a range of $30 million to $40 million for the fourth quarter. Joint ventures, land sales and other income, which I'll group together, we were successful in accelerating some of the projected fourth quarter land sale and clubhouse transactions into our third quarter. So we are now updating our projection to this category to $5 million for the fourth quarter.
And then, finally, with our balance sheet. As we noted, our third quarter net debt to total capital has come down below 40%, and we are well on our path to lower leverage. As Stuart mentioned with our operating strategies, our strong projected earnings, our soft pivot strategy and converting the remainder of the 3.25% convertible, which will shift from debt to equity in the fourth quarter, all of this will continue to lead to lower leverage, which has given us a rock solid balance sheet and positions us well for opportunities as we finish out 2016.
Let me now turn it back to the operator and open it up for questions."

As that land dissipated and we ended up with more shorter-term land, our margins would -- our gross margins would drift down. But we felt that as the recovery matured, we would continue to focus on bringing down our growth rate, focusing on efficiencies in our SG&A, as we've been articulating, and really driving increased earnings through more efficient net operating margin. Let me turn to Rick and Jon and have them weigh in on that."

The natural evolution of a soft pivot is that you're starting to take less risk in land. Associated with that risk profile is a margin presence. You're looking for near-term opportunities, quick returns. So gross margin will naturally come down and IRRs will come up. And so when we're going less long on some of these positions, it means that you're paying a little bit closer to retail than you were in buying wholesale. The other thing that we've been doing is we've really been managing pace in price. A great example of that is notwithstanding the fact that the Houston market is definitely softer given the turmoil in the energy markets. But if you look at our performance there for the last quarter, sales were up by 14%, but our ASP was up by 4%. So in a tough market, we're really trying to maximize the value of the quality assets that we've got there, not give the homes away. We certainly could have sold more homes, but we're just really managing it."

And that's a story that's going to play out over the next couple of years. This construct doesn't change overnight. We've highlighted very clearly that FivePoint is our starting point in all of that. FivePoint, we have seen a consolidation of our interest and a unification under a corporate umbrella, where -- which is being overseen by its CEO, Emile Haddad. And FivePoint is positioned to see it evolve into its own independent company, managed by its own complement of executives and overseen by its own unique Board of Directors, which parenthetically, myself, Rick and Jon, are part of. That's an example of how we will continue to think about our ancillary businesses move them through the system. The second area is in the apartment area. You're already starting to see a migration through that merchant build program and towards our build-to-core program, which, in many ways, is a very separate program. It, again like FivePoint, has its own complement of management and that builds the core program as an opportunity for us to build a stream of earnings that is consistent, it's fee-generative and enables us to realize on the great value that we are creating. Rialto continues to build to be able to be strategic in its alignment for the future, but we don't have a current path for Rialto that we've articulated. But as Rialto's asset management and RMF, Rialto Mortgage Finance, businesses continue to grow, we think that there are tremendous opportunities for that company to combine to IPO to do a variety of things as we really start to focus on the core homebuilding business."

But the big concern is you're not be able to grow operating earnings in homebuilding as margins, even with the improvement in SG&A dropped down, your EBIT margin, operating margin from homebuilding is down year-over-year, although it's amongst the highest of the sector.

Our view has been that our gross margins will continue to drift downward. I think if you look at the average of the industry, if you look at what's normalized gross margin in the industry, you're probably looking at 21%, 22%. And over time, we'll probably drift in that direction. The industry average might even be lower than that. But I would say a few things. We have a lot of guns in our arsenal. We've been very focused on operational efficiency. We are not focusing on stretching growth in an environment that just isn't giving it easily. Land is expensive. Land is hard to come by. People are expensive and hard to come by. It's hard to grow operations efficiently and effectively at an accelerated rate in a market where land and labor is really constrained. And so we've chosen to focus on operational efficiencies as a mechanism for driving profitability going forward. And we've been consistently articulating, look at the net operating margin where we'll find much more stability and the opportunity to drive profitability going forward from our core business. But with that said, we've also articulated other strategies. Look at our Financial Services group. We've been diversifying that group, not only is it growing alongside our core homebuilding business, it's growing outside of that homebuilding operation. And we're finding additional earnings by leveraging that part of our business. Look at Rialto, look at our Multifamily effort, look at our ancillaries, and you start to see that there are real growth components that derive from a core homebuilding operation that's operating well and these ancillary businesses that are operating cooperatively."

And so maybe that's a little harder to kind of pinpoint or get a sense of when that might kind of become its own separate entity -- separate from Lennar that is on a more complete basis. But perhaps, you could talk to Rialto and LMC, I'm sorry, LMF, how do you think about those businesses in terms of being a part of the broader Lennar family over the next 2 or 3 years? Obviously, Rialto itself is taking a lot of strides. Is that something that might -- that you're looking for an exit over the next year or 2 and some early for Multifamily, now that that's closer to more of a recurring revenue stream, is that something that you just see kind of as an ongoing part of the business from a broader corporate umbrella cents?

As it relates to FivePoint, which where you started, Mike, FivePoint's trajectory has been very consistent and very positive. The properties in FivePoint have been moving through their system and the consolidation of FivePoint's ownership under one umbrella is a consistent theme. What hasn't been consistent on market conditions, we had embarked on a program to launch an IPO, which under good market conditions would have gone off by now. So the market is the market we can't do much to change that, but the underlying operations of FivePoint are spectacular. As it relates to LMC, our Multifamily platform, I think that there's a very strong case to be made that, that business really is almost part of the core. It has been a part of our strategy for dealing with the first-time homebuyers segment, which has been forced or inclined to rent rather than to purchase because of market conditions or because of appetites. And in fact, this -- that strategy has worked out quite well for us and might be a very compatible program under the core umbrella. So we're not -- we're certainly not targeting right now a spinoff or some other kind of program relative to that segment, and we'll have to see over time. As it relates to Rialto, Rialto was built with the understanding that it would be synergistic to our -- to the growth of our core business and it was, in fact, through the downturn. We've grown Rialto into a business that looked an awful lot like the business that we spun-off back in 1997 under the name LNR. And it continues to grow along those lines. Now there has been choppiness in the capital market. There are questions around the regulatory environment. We think that each of these things work to our benefit. And as we continue to grow the platform, we want to let these things resolve themselves before we design and put forth an exit strategy. But ultimately, Rialto will stand alone."

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us.

But those will be the primary participants. I'm going to briefly give some remarks and then Bruce will jump in with some additional detail and then we'll open up to Q&A. And as usual, I'd like to request so we can get as many questions as possible in our hour that you limit yourself to one question and just one follow-up, please.
So great. Let me go ahead and begin and say that our third quarter 2016 results reflect yet another quarter of strong operating results for our company. We have consistently believed that we are in a slow, steady, though sometimes choppy, housing market recovery, and we've crafted our operating strategies specifically to position us well to grow steadily and consistently and to act opportunistically in these market conditions.
As we've noted over the past years, the overall housing market has been generally defined by a rather large production deficit that's continued to grow over the past years. This deficit is particularly focused on the first-time homebuyer segment of the market and this part of the market was rather late to begin its slow and steady improvement as well.
While questions have been raised as to the real normalized levels of production that are required to serve the growing U.S. population, we continue to believe that production levels in the 1 million to 1.2 million starts per year range are still too low for the needs of the American household growth that is now normalizing. Additional questions have been raised as the effect of an increase in interest rates relative to the recovery for first-time homebuyers segment. We believe that there continues to be a growing pent-up demand for dwellings of all types across the country, though stronger in some markets than others, and this demand will continue to propel a continued long cycle, slow and steady, sometimes erratic, market improvement that will not be derailed by slow movements in interest rate and this goes for both first-time and move-up purchasers.
With that said, it's important to note that the housing market is not really a national market, but instead, it's a large number of very local markets each with different dynamics that are averaged together to -- that generate some sometimes quirky results and data.
While demand has been constrained by limited access to mortgages, stronger general economic conditions, including lower unemployment, wage growth and general consumer confidence, are still driving consumers to form new households and to purchase homes and to rent apartments. We continue to expect that demand will build and come to market over the next years, and that will drive increased production as the deficit in housing stock ultimately needs to be replenished.
Nevertheless, availability of land and labor shortages continue to be limiting factors and constrain supply and restrict the ability to quickly respond to growing demand while the mortgage market and higher rents continue to limit that demand.
We expect that these conditions will continue to result in a slow, steady, positive homebuilding market and will enable slow and steady growth throughout the industry. These have been our consistent guiding views over the past years, and we've mapped our operating strategy around these views. Each segment of our company has positioned itself for continued performance in 2016 and beyond, and we believe that we remain well positioned to execute our operating plans and strategies in each of these segments.
Now against that backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating segments. Our for-sale homebuilding operations continue to operate at a very high level of efficiency with a steady growth pace and a focus on operational excellence. Our results reflect execution of our operating strategy as our new home orders increased 8% year-over-year, while community count grew 3% and our average home price grew 3% to approximately $362,000. Even while continued labor shortages and land and construction cost increases have tested our ability to match sales and delivery pace, our management team has managed sales prices, maximized margins and focused on reducing SG&A to offset and maintain a strong net operating margin, which came in at 13.2% for the third quarter. This focus has helped improve our balance sheet as well with our net homebuilding debt to total cap coming in at just below 40% with further improvement expected in the fourth quarter.
As we've noticed -- as we've noted in past conference calls, we've adjusted our for-sale housing strategy as the recovery has matured and land pricing has gotten more expensive. We've noted 3 components of our core homebuilding strategy: one, soft pivot ; two, target lower growth rate; and three, focus on SG&A. We've talked consistently and extensively about our soft pivot land strategy over the past years, away from land-heavy acquisition strategy in the early stages of the recovery. We are now targeting high-quality 'A' location land acquisition with a shorter 2- to 3-year average life. Additionally, we've ramped up our first-time homebuyer offering organically with lower land costs as that segment of the market continues to recover.
Second, we've noted in the past quarterly conference calls that given the now mature recovery, we have been and continue to carefully manage and limit our growth in orders to concurrently grow bottom line and to drive strong cash flow. We've moderated our top line growth target to achieve a growth rate in the 7% to 10% range as we've redirected our management efforts towards maximizing our net operating margin.
Third, with less pressure on top line growth, we've intensified management focus on driving faster bottom line growth and cash flow by maximizing pricing power and using innovative strategies to drive our SG&A down. Under the company mantra of what we can measure we can change, we are focused on changing and improving all elements of our operations. I noted an example last quarter and highlighted that we've been reducing customer acquisition costs through our digital marketing initiatives.
We've expanded our focus to other operational elements of our business and are seeing reductions in expenses in those areas as well. It is noteworthy that this quarter's SG&A of 9.3% is the lowest third quarter SG&A in our company's history. Our homebuilding operations are becoming extremely efficient operating machines.
With demand growing steadily, land limited, labor tight and constrained mortgage availability, we believe that our 3-pronged strategy for our homebuilding segment positions us well for steady growth and, as well, the ability to use a strong balance sheet to act opportunistically.
Moving on, our Financial Services group is continuing to expand and improve and has had an outstanding second quarter as well. While the Financial Services operations have grown alongside our core homebuilding business, we have also benefited from a strong, though sometimes erratic, refi market, as well as from the expansion of retail opportunities in both our mortgage and titled platforms. These sidecar opportunities have continued to expand our platform as we move through 2016, and that's reflected in our operating earnings of $53.2 million, up 35% over last year.
Our strategies for the future of Lennar Financial Services continues to be to construct and maintain a fully sufficient financial services platform that benefits from Lennar Homebuilding business, but drives profitability from retail operations as well. Bruce Gross oversees this operation and will discuss it further in his comments.
Next, our Multifamily platform continues to develop as a leading blue-chip developer of apartment communities across the country. The third quarter has continued an outstanding run for LMC, Lennar Multifamily Communities, which continues to complement our for-sale homebuilding operations. With the home-ownership rate continuing its decline, now dropping just below 63%, many new households have either been forced or are inclined to rent rather than purchase and have focused on build -- and we have focused on building well-located rental communities to address this market opportunity.
First-time home purchasers have come back to the market more slowly than they have historically and more slowly than expected. While the growing percentage of our for-sale homebuilding business continues to be geared towards first-time purchasers, our broader new household strategy has targeted the rental market as well.
As we've continued to expand our national footprint, we've matured and evolved from a merchant-build program, which was designed to prove our base concept. This beginning phase has worked extremely well as reflected in the sales of properties we have recorded to date and the additional sales that will close in the fourth quarter as well. Through those sales, we have proven our ability to purchase, to design, build, stabilize and sell quite profitably a number of our communities at an increasing level of profitability. Having proven the concept, we have now built or added to -- or added a build-to-core platform. This platform enables us to build and retain our outstanding pipeline of properties and benefit from long-term ownership. We have currently a solid $2 billion for a build-to-core platform, which will become a long-term cash flowing -- cash-producing, fee-generating value creation machine.
While Multifamily production has generally normalized and some have expressed concerns about overbuilding in some markets, nationally, more rental product is going to continue to be needed to fill the national production deficit, and we are very well positioned to continue to be very careful in site selection while we fill this need and grow our Multifamily platform. Our now $7 billion plus apartment strategy is proving to be very well-timed as rental rates have climbed to exceed our original underwriting and vacancies remained at very low levels.
Next, our Rialto segment saw a nice turnaround in the third quarter as the capital markets stabilized after a rough start in the first half of 2016. During the quarter, market conditions continued to improve and RMF completed -- Rialto Mortgage Finance completed its 30th and 31st securitization transactions with gross margins ranging from 5.4% to 5.7% and with almost $500 million of RMF-originated loans. Rialto Mortgage Finance maintained its position as one of the largest nonbank CMBS loan originators. With the rebound in the market, the securitization transactions occurring this quarter generated the single largest contribution of loans Rialto Mortgage Finance has ever made and also the largest net margin for a single transition -- transaction in our history. This brings our total to almost $6 billion of securitized loans since RMF inception.
On the asset management front, we also previously announced the first closing of commitments of our third fund. And although we can't really say anything more, as we are still in the market, this fund will complement our other opportunistic funds with readily available capital to invest as we have approximately $920 million of investor equity dedicated to Mezzanine and transitional lending in those other funds.
Our first 2 flagship opportunity funds have both been top quartile performers. Fund I became fully invested in early 2013, and we've now distributed 135% of investors' original capital from income and monetizations. And with the distributions through this quarter, Rialto now has already realized 2x its original investment with a lot more to go.
We expect to begin to report -- promote on this first fund in the first half of 2017. Additionally, on a current basis, our fund and asset management business showed improved profitability over the last year's second -- last year's third quarter, and we expect this trend to continue.
Overall, our Rialto platform enables us to invest across all real estate and financial products and allows us to capitalize on both short-term and long-term duration opportunities throughout the economic cycle. The dysfunction that we saw earlier this year in the financial markets, along with new risk retention rules and banking regulations, are beginning to work to the benefit of Rialto's core competent and CMBS and financial products, and we have the capital available to invest.
Finally, FivePoint is now a self-sufficient stand-alone company that is a premier strategic large-scale community builder. As we stated in our last quarterly conference call, we contributed and exchanged our interest in 3 strategic joint ventures and our interest in the management company for an investment in this newly formed entity. This transaction marks the next step in FivePoint's evolution as a strategic developer and manager of large-scale, master-planned communities. It also marks a next step in Lennar's strategic mission to revert to our core homebuilding base as it liberates FivePoint to act independently, raise capital and utilize its pristine balance sheet to operate opportunistically.
FivePoint will operate very independently with a self-contained management team under the leadership of Emile Haddad, who many of you know. We simply could not be more excited about the prospects for the future for this one-of-a-kind leader in community development.
So in summary, overall, let me say that we continue to be very pleased to present our third quarter results and our overall progress this morning. We feel very confident that our view of the market and the strategies that have defined our various business segments continue to work very well to position us for continued performance and for future growth. As I've said many times before, we believe very confidently that we have the right people, the right programs and the right timing to continue to perform this year and into the future.
Now, let me turn it over to Bruce."

Revenues from home sales increased 11% in the third quarter, driven by a 7% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 3% year-over-year increase in average selling price to $362,000. Our gross margin on home sales in the third quarter was 22.6%, which was in line with our stated goals. The prior year's gross margin percentage was 24.1%. The gross margin decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land costs.
Sales incentives were 5.9% this quarter compared to 5.6% in the prior year, with the largest increase coming from the Houston segment, particularly with higher-price communities. Gross margin percents were once again highest in the East region. Direct construction costs have increased moderately compared to the prior year. These costs were up 2.5% year-over-year to approximately $53 per square foot. This was driven entirely by labor, offset by a slight decrease in material costs.
As Stuart mentioned, SG&A as a percentage of revenue improved, it improved by 60 basis points, as we were successful gaining operating leverage by growing volume organically in existing homebuilding divisions and from the benefits of our focus on digital marketing.
Other income was $30.9 million, primarily due to a gain of $8.7 million on the sale of a clubhouse, which we originally were projecting to close in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we had $17 million (sic) [$17.4 million] of management fee income from one of our strategic joint ventures.
Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $18 million, which included our share of the loss related to the $17 million (sic) [$17.4 million] that I just mentioned in other income, and our share of net operating losses and onetime charges from the newly created FivePoint entity and combination that Stuart mentioned.
This quarter, we opened 66 new communities and ended the quarter with 694 net active communities. Our sales pace was higher compared to the prior year at 3.4 sales per community per month versus 3.2 in the prior year's quarter. The cancellation rate decreased to 16% in the third quarter. And we purchased approximately 5,400 homesites, totaling $264 million versus $267 million in the prior year's quarter. These numbers align with our soft pivot strategy where we're focused on buying shorter duration lands. Our homesites owned and controlled now total 159,000 homesites, of which 129,000 are owned and 30,000 are controlled. We brought down our completed unsold homes during the quarter. They came down 19% sequentially to 973 homes.
Turning to Financial Services. They had strong results this quarter with operating earnings of $53.2 million compared to $39.4 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income increased to $38.3 million from $31.4 million in the prior year. The improved earnings were driven by an increase profit per loan due to the favorable interest rate environment. Mortgage originations increased to $2.6 billion compared to $2.4 billion in the prior year. As a result of a focused effort to capitalize on the low mortgage rates in the third quarter, we achieved a 56% increase in refinance origination volume versus the prior year.
The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers remain consistent with the prior year at 82% capture rate. And our titled company also had a strong quarter. Their profits increased to $15 million from $8.2 million in the prior year and that was also primarily due to higher refinance transaction volume in the current year. Additionally, they had a great focus on operational efficiencies driving additional bottom line profit.
Turning to Rialto. This segment produced operating earnings of $5.9 million compared to $9 million in the prior year. Both amounts are a net of noncontrolling interest. The investment management business contributed $27.6 million of earnings, which includes $6 million of equity and earnings from the real estate funds and $21.6 million of management fees and other. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Fund I and II now totals $141 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $491 million of commercial loans into 2 securitizations resulting in earnings of $27.2 million compared with $519 million and $14.2 million in the prior year, respectively. And that's before their G&A expense.
The increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in the net margins. This year was 5.4% in the third quarter versus last year's third quarter at 3.1% net margin. Our direct investments had a loss of $5.6 million during the quarter. And Rialto G&A and other expenses were $36.2 million for the quarter and interest expense, excluding warehouse lines, was $7.1 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $133 million of cash.
The Multifamily segment delivered a $2.6 million operating profit in the quarter, primarily driven by the segment's $8 million share of the gain from the sale of an operating property, as well as management fee income partially offset by G&A expenses. We ended the quarter with 8 completed in operating properties and 37 under construction, 10 of which are in lease-up, totaling over 11,000 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $3.2 billion. Including these communities, we have a diversified development pipeline that exceeds $7 billion and over 20,000 apartments.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 31.1% compared to 30% in the prior year's period. The rate is lower than expected for this quarter as a result of our continued efforts to maximize the new home energy efficiency credit, which was extended into 2016.
We will continue to focus on maximizing this energy credit and, therefore, we believe the tax rate for the fourth quarter will also be lower than previously expected. We believe that will be a range of 33% to 34%.
Our balance sheet is strong. Our operating strategy is focused on driving cash flow generation. In this quarter, we generated positive operating cash flow. Liquidity remained strong with approximately $568 million of homebuilding cash and $125 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which during the quarter was increased to $1.8 billion. Our leverage improved by 650 basis points year-over-year as our homebuilding net debt to total capital was reduced to 39.9%. We grew stockholders' equity by 22% to $6.5 billion, and our book value per share increased to $28.73 per share.
During the quarter, we early converted an additional $175 million of our 3.25% convertible senior notes. And for the year, we've now converted a total of $243 million of those notes. Our next step maturity matures in June of 2017, and we look forward to retiring $400 million of 12.25% senior notes, which currently cost us $50 million interest per year.
Finally, I would like to update our 2016 goals. We are still on track with our 2016 goals with a few refinements for the fourth quarter.
First, deliveries are still on track with our original 2016 goal to deliver between 26,500 and 27,000 homes. The fourth quarter is projected to achieve a backlog conversion right at 90%. We expect the average sales price for these deliveries to be between $355,000 and $360,000 per home.
Turning to margins. The gross margin percentage for the fourth quarter is projected to be approximately 23.25%. And we are still on track to achieve the lowest SG&A percentage in the company's history in 2016 with our fourth quarter expected to see another 50 basis points reduction sequentially below the third quarter's 9.3%. So that would bring it around 8.8% for the fourth quarter.
Financial Services. Our second and third quarter are typically the highest profit quarters for LFS. However, given the continued favorable interest rate environment, we are also increasing our goal for the fourth quarter for this segment to a range of $37 million to $40 million for the quarter.
Rialto earnings are projected to be in a range of $5 million to $7 million of profit for the fourth quarter. And Multifamily, based on our favorable sale expectations, for between 4 and 5 communities for the fourth quarter, we are increasing our Multifamily goal to a range of $30 million to $40 million for the fourth quarter. Joint ventures, land sales and other income, which I'll group together, we were successful in accelerating some of the projected fourth quarter land sale and clubhouse transactions into our third quarter. So we are now updating our projection to this category to $5 million for the fourth quarter.
And then, finally, with our balance sheet. As we noted, our third quarter net debt to total capital has come down below 40%, and we are well on our path to lower leverage. As Stuart mentioned with our operating strategies, our strong projected earnings, our soft pivot strategy and converting the remainder of the 3.25% convertible, which will shift from debt to equity in the fourth quarter, all of this will continue to lead to lower leverage, which has given us a rock solid balance sheet and positions us well for opportunities as we finish out 2016.
Let me now turn it back to the operator and open it up for questions."

But we also focused attention on net operating margin primarily, recognizing that as land that was bought at very low prices flow through our system, margins would be higher. As that land dissipated and we ended up with more shorter-term land, our margins would -- our gross margins would drift down. But we felt that as the recovery matured, we would continue to focus on bringing down our growth rate, focusing on efficiencies in our SG&A, as we've been articulating, and really driving increased earnings through more efficient net operating margin. Let me turn to Rick and Jon and have them weigh in on that."

The natural evolution of a soft pivot is that you're starting to take less risk in land. Associated with that risk profile is a margin presence. You're looking for near-term opportunities, quick returns. So gross margin will naturally come down and IRRs will come up. And so when we're going less long on some of these positions, it means that you're paying a little bit closer to retail than you were in buying wholesale. The other thing that we've been doing is we've really been managing pace in price. A great example of that is notwithstanding the fact that the Houston market is definitely softer given the turmoil in the energy markets. But if you look at our performance there for the last quarter, sales were up by 14%, but our ASP was up by 4%. So in a tough market, we're really trying to maximize the value of the quality assets that we've got there and not give the homes away. We certainly could have sold more homes, but we're just really managing it."

FivePoint, we have seen a consolidation of our interest and a unification under a corporate umbrella, where -- which is being overseen by its CEO, Emile Haddad. And FivePoint is positioned to see it evolve into its own independent company, managed by its own complement of executives and overseen by its own unique Board of Directors, which parenthetically, myself, Rick and Jon, are part of. That's an example of how we will continue to think about our ancillary businesses move them through the system. The second area is in the apartment area. You're already starting to see a migration through that merchant build program and towards our build-to-core program, which, in many ways, is a very separate program. It, again like FivePoint, has its own complement of management and that builds the core program as an opportunity for us to build a stream of earnings that is consistent, it's fee-generative and enables us to realize on the great value that we are creating. Rialto continues to build to be able to be strategic in its alignment for the future, but we don't have a current path for Rialto that we've articulated. But as Rialto's asset management and RMF, Rialto Mortgage Finance, businesses continue to grow, we think that there are tremendous opportunities for that company to combine to IPO to do a variety of things as we really start to focus on the core homebuilding business."

Our view has been that our gross margins will continue to drift downward. I think if you look at the average of the industry, if you look at what's normalized gross margin in the industry, you're probably looking at 21%, 22%. And over time, we'll probably drift in that direction. The industry average might even be lower than that. But I would say a few things. We have a lot of guns in our arsenal. We've been very focused on operational efficiency. We are not focusing on stretching growth in an environment that just isn't giving it easily. Land is expensive. Land is hard to come by. People are expensive and hard to come by. It's hard to grow operations efficiently and effectively at an accelerated rate in a market where land and labor is really constrained. And so we've chosen to focus on operational efficiencies as a mechanism for driving profitability going forward. And we've been consistently articulating, look at the net operating margin where we'll find much more stability and the opportunity to drive profitability going forward from our core business. But with that said, we've also articulated other strategies. Look at our Financial Services group. We've been diversifying that group, not only is it growing alongside of our core homebuilding business, it's growing outside of that homebuilding operation. And we're finding additional earnings by leveraging that part of our business. Look at Rialto, look at our Multifamily effort, look at our ancillaries, and you start to see that there are real growth components that derive from a core homebuilding operation that's operating well and these ancillary businesses that are operating cooperatively."

And so maybe that's a little harder to kind of pinpoint or get a sense of when that might kind of become its own separate entity -- separate from Lennar that is on a more complete basis. But perhaps, you could talk to Rialto and LMC, I'm sorry, LMF, how do you think about those businesses in terms of being a part of the broader Lennar family over the next 2 or 3 years? Obviously, Rialto itself is taking a lot of strides. Is that something that might -- that you're looking for an exit over the next year or 2 and some early for Multifamily, now that that's closer to more of a recurring revenue stream, is that something that you just see kind of as an ongoing part of the business from a broader corporate umbrella cents?

As it relates to FivePoint, which where you started, Mike, FivePoint's trajectory has been very consistent and very positive. The properties in FivePoint have been moving through their system and the consolidation of FivePoint's ownership under one umbrella is a consistent theme. What hasn't been consistent on market conditions, we had embarked on a program to launch an IPO, which under good market conditions would have gone off by now. So the market is the market we can't do much to change that, but the underlying operations of FivePoint are spectacular. As it relates to LMC, our Multifamily platform, I think that there's a very strong case to be made that, that business really is almost part of the core. It has been a part of our strategy for dealing with the first-time homebuyers segment, which has been forced or inclined to rent rather than to purchase because of market conditions or because of appetites. And in fact, this -- that strategy has worked out quite well for us and might be a very compatible program under the core umbrella. So we're not -- we're certainly not targeting right now a spinoff or some other kind of program relative to that segment, and we'll have to see over time. As it relates to Rialto, Rialto was built with the understanding that it would be synergistic to our -- to the growth of our core business and it was, in fact, through the downturn. We've grown Rialto into a business that looked an awful lot like the business that we spun-off back in 1997 under the name LNR. And it continues to grow along those lines. Now there has been choppiness in the capital market. There are questions around the regulatory environment. We think that each of these things work to our benefit. And as we continue to grow the platform, we want to let these things resolve themselves before we design and put forth an exit strategy. But ultimately, Rialto will stand alone."

And as you think about the 7% to 10% growth going forward, would you still expect there to be driven by perhaps roughly equally community count growth and absorption pace?"

We've seen our balance sheet improve and it will continue to improve as we go into the fourth quarter. I think Bruce highlighted that we'll be reducing our rather expensive debt in June of 2017. All of these are balance sheet enhancements.

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. And I'm here this morning joined by an assorted group of our management team, including Bruce, of course, our Chief Financial Officer; Rick Beckwitt our President; and Jon Jaffe, our Chief Financial Officer; Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto; and some others. But those will be the primary participants. I'm going to briefly give some remarks and then Bruce will jump in with some additional detail and then we'll open up to Q&A. And as usual, I'd like to request so we can get as many questions as possible in our hour that you limit yourself to one question and just one follow-up, please.
So great. Let me go ahead and begin and say that our third quarter 2016 results reflect yet another quarter of strong operating results for our company. We have consistently believed that we are in a slow, steady, though sometimes choppy, housing market recovery, and we've crafted our operating strategies specifically to position us well to grow steadily and consistently and to act opportunistically in these market conditions.
As we've noted over the past years, the overall housing market has been generally defined by a rather large production deficit that's continued to grow over the past years. This deficit is particularly focused on the first-time homebuyer segment of the market and this part of the market was rather late to begin its slow and steady improvement as well.
While questions have been raised as to the real normalized levels of production that are required to serve the growing U.S. population, we continue to believe that production levels in the 1 million to 1.2 million starts per year range are still too low for the needs of the American household growth that is now normalizing. Additional questions have been raised as the effect of an increase in interest rates relative to the recovery for first-time homebuyers segment. We believe that there continues to be a growing pent-up demand for dwellings of all types across the country, though stronger in some markets than others, and this demand will continue to propel a continued long cycle, slow and steady, sometimes erratic, market improvement that will not be derailed by slow movements in interest rate and this goes for both first-time and move-up purchasers.
With that said, it's important to note that the housing market is not really a national market, but instead, it's a large number of very local markets each with different dynamics that are averaged together to -- that generate some sometimes quirky results and data.
While demand has been constrained by limited access to mortgages, stronger general economic conditions, including lower unemployment, wage growth and general consumer confidence, are still driving consumers to form new households and to purchase homes and to rent apartments. We continue to expect that demand will build and come to market over the next years, and that will drive increased production as the deficit in housing stock ultimately needs to be replenished.
Nevertheless, availability of land and labor shortages continue to be limiting factors and constrain supply and restrict the ability to quickly respond to growing demand while the mortgage market and higher rents continue to limit that demand.
We expect that these conditions will continue to result in a slow, steady, positive homebuilding market and will enable slow and steady growth throughout the industry. These have been our consistent guiding views over the past years, and we've mapped our operating strategy around these views. Each segment of our company has positioned itself for continued performance in 2016 and beyond, and we believe that we remain well positioned to execute our operating plans and strategies in each of these segments.
Now against that backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating segments. Our for-sale homebuilding operations continue to operate at a very high level of efficiency with a steady growth pace and a focus on operational excellence. Our results reflect execution of our operating strategy as our new home orders increased 8% year-over-year, while community count grew 3% and our average home price grew 3% to approximately $362,000. Even while continued labor shortages and land and construction cost increases have tested our ability to match sales and delivery pace, our management team has managed sales prices, maximized margins and focused on reducing SG&A to offset and maintain a strong net operating margin, which came in at 13.2% for the third quarter. This focus has helped improve our balance sheet as well with our net homebuilding debt to total cap coming in at just below 40% with further improvement expected in the fourth quarter.
As we've noticed -- as we've noted in past conference calls, we've adjusted our for-sale housing strategy as the recovery has matured and land pricing has gotten more expensive. We've noted 3 components of our core homebuilding strategy: one, soft pivot ; two, target lower growth rate; and three, focus on SG&A. We've talked consistently and extensively about our soft pivot land strategy over the past years, away from land-heavy acquisition strategy in the early stages of the recovery. We are now targeting high-quality 'A' location land acquisition with a shorter 2- to 3-year average life. Additionally, we've ramped up our first-time homebuyer offering organically with lower land costs as that segment of the market continues to recover.
Second, we've noted in the past quarterly conference calls that given the now mature recovery, we have been and continue to carefully manage and limit our growth in orders to concurrently grow bottom line and to drive strong cash flow. We've moderated our top line growth target to achieve a growth rate in the 7% to 10% range as we've redirected our management efforts towards maximizing our net operating margin.
Third, with less pressure on top line growth, we've intensified management focus on driving faster bottom line growth and cash flow by maximizing pricing power and using innovative strategies to drive our SG&A down. Under the company mantra of what we can measure we can change, we are focused on changing and improving all elements of our operations. I noted an example last quarter and highlighted that we've been reducing customer acquisition costs through our digital marketing initiatives.
We've expanded our focus to other operational elements of our business and are seeing reductions in expenses in those areas as well. It is noteworthy that this quarter's SG&A of 9.3% is the lowest third quarter SG&A in our company's history. Our homebuilding operations are becoming extremely efficient operating machines.
With demand growing steadily, land limited, labor tight and constrained mortgage availability, we believe that our 3-pronged strategy for our homebuilding segment positions us well for steady growth and, as well, the ability to use a strong balance sheet to act opportunistically.
Moving on, our Financial Services group is continuing to expand and improve and has had an outstanding second quarter as well. While the Financial Services operations have grown alongside our core homebuilding business, we have also benefited from a strong, though sometimes erratic, refi market, as well as from the expansion of retail opportunities in both our mortgage and titled platforms. These sidecar opportunities have continued to expand our platform as we move through 2016, and that's reflected in our operating earnings of $53.2 million, up 35% over last year.
Our strategies for the future of Lennar Financial Services continues to be to construct and maintain a fully sufficient financial services platform that benefits from Lennar Homebuilding business, but drives profitability from retail operations as well. Bruce Gross oversees this operation and will discuss it further in his comments.
Next, our Multifamily platform continues to develop as a leading blue-chip developer of apartment communities across the country. The third quarter has continued an outstanding run for LMC, Lennar Multifamily Communities, which continues to complement our for-sale homebuilding operations. With the home-ownership rate continuing its decline, now dropping just below 63%, many new households have either been forced or are inclined to rent rather than purchase and have focused on build -- and we have focused on building well-located rental communities to address this market opportunity.
First-time home purchasers have come back to the market more slowly than they have historically and more slowly than expected. While the growing percentage of our for-sale homebuilding business continues to be geared towards first-time purchasers, our broader new household strategy has targeted the rental market as well.
As we've continued to expand our national footprint, we've matured and evolved from a merchant-build program, which was designed to prove our base concept. This beginning phase has worked extremely well as reflected in the sales of properties we have recorded to date and the additional sales that will close in the fourth quarter as well. Through those sales, we have proven our ability to purchase, to design, build, stabilize and sell quite profitably a number of our communities at an increasing level of profitability. Having proven the concept, we have now built or added to -- or added a build-to-core platform. This platform enables us to build and retain our outstanding pipeline of properties and benefit from long-term ownership. We have currently a solid $2 billion for a build-to-core platform, which will become a long-term cash flowing -- cash-producing, fee-generating value creation machine.
While Multifamily production has generally normalized and some have expressed concerns about overbuilding in some markets, nationally, more rental product is going to continue to be needed to fill the national production deficit, and we are very well positioned to continue to be very careful in site selection while we fill this need and grow our Multifamily platform. Our now $7 billion plus apartment strategy is proving to be very well-timed as rental rates have climbed to exceed our original underwriting and vacancies remained at very low levels.
Next, our Rialto segment saw a nice turnaround in the third quarter as the capital markets stabilized after a rough start in the first half of 2016. During the quarter, market conditions continued to improve and RMF completed -- Rialto Mortgage Finance completed its 30th and 31st securitization transactions with gross margins ranging from 5.4% to 5.7% and with almost $500 million of RMF-originated loans. Rialto Mortgage Finance maintained its position as one of the largest nonbank CMBS loan originators. With the rebound in the market, the securitization transactions occurring this quarter generated the single largest contribution of loans Rialto Mortgage Finance has ever made and also the largest net margin for a single transition -- transaction in our history. This brings our total to almost $6 billion of securitized loans since RMF inception.
On the asset management front, we also previously announced the first closing of commitments of our third fund. And although we can't really say anything more, as we are still in the market, this fund will complement our other opportunistic funds with readily available capital to invest as we have approximately $920 million of investor equity dedicated to Mezzanine and transitional lending in those other funds.
Our first 2 flagship opportunity funds have both been top quartile performers. Fund I became fully invested in early 2013, and we've now distributed 135% of investors' original capital from income and monetizations. And with the distributions through this quarter, Rialto now has already realized 2x its original investment with a lot more to go.
We expect to begin to report -- promote on this first fund in the first half of 2017. Additionally, on a current basis, our fund and asset management business showed improved profitability over the last year's second -- last year's third quarter, and we expect this trend to continue.
Overall, our Rialto platform enables us to invest across all real estate and financial products and allows us to capitalize on both short-term and long-term duration opportunities throughout the economic cycle. The dysfunction that we saw earlier this year in the financial markets, along with new risk retention rules and banking regulations, are beginning to work to the benefit of Rialto's core competent and CMBS and financial products, and we have the capital available to invest.
Finally, FivePoint is now a self-sufficient stand-alone company that is a premier strategic large-scale community builder. As we stated in our last quarterly conference call, we contributed and exchanged our interest in 3 strategic joint ventures and our interest in the management company for an investment in this newly formed entity. This transaction marks the next step in FivePoint's evolution as a strategic developer and manager of large-scale, master-planned communities. It also marks a next step in Lennar's strategic mission to revert to our core homebuilding base as it liberates FivePoint to act independently, raise capital and utilize its pristine balance sheet to operate opportunistically.
FivePoint will operate very independently with a self-contained management team under the leadership of Emile Haddad, who many of you know. We simply could not be more excited about the prospects for the future for this one-of-a-kind leader in community development.
So in summary, overall, let me say that we continue to be very pleased to present our third quarter results and our overall progress this morning. We feel very confident that our view of the market and the strategies that have defined our various business segments continue to work very well to position us for continued performance and for future growth. As I've said many times before, we believe very confidently that we have the right people, the right programs and the right timing to continue to perform this year and into the future.
Now, let me turn it over to Bruce."

I'll provide some more color on our businesses and conclude with an update on our 2016 goals.Revenues from home sales increased 11% in the third quarter, driven by a 7% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 3% year-",1520,"Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. I'll provide some more color on our businesses and conclude with an update on our 2016 goals.
Revenues from home sales increased 11% in the third quarter, driven by a 7% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 3% year-over-year increase in average selling price to $362,000. Our gross margin on home sales in the third quarter was 22.6%, which was in line with our stated goals. The prior year's gross margin percentage was 24.1%. The gross margin decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land costs.
Sales incentives were 5.9% this quarter compared to 5.6% in the prior year, with the largest increase coming from the Houston segment, particularly with higher-price communities. Gross margin percents were once again highest in the East region. Direct construction costs have increased moderately compared to the prior year. These costs were up 2.5% year-over-year to approximately $53 per square foot. This was driven entirely by labor, offset by a slight decrease in material costs.
As Stuart mentioned, SG&A as a percentage of revenue improved, it improved by 60 basis points, as we were successful gaining operating leverage by growing volume organically in existing homebuilding divisions and from the benefits of our focus on digital marketing.
Other income was $30.9 million, primarily due to a gain of $8.7 million on the sale of a clubhouse, which we originally were projecting to close in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we had $17 million (sic) [$17.4 million] of management fee income from one of our strategic joint ventures.
Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $18 million, which included our share of the loss related to the $17 million (sic) [$17.4 million] that I just mentioned in other income, and our share of net operating losses and onetime charges from the newly created FivePoint entity and combination that Stuart mentioned.
This quarter, we opened 66 new communities and ended the quarter with 694 net active communities. Our sales pace was higher compared to the prior year at 3.4 sales per community per month versus 3.2 in the prior year's quarter. The cancellation rate decreased to 16% in the third quarter. And we purchased approximately 5,400 homesites, totaling $264 million versus $267 million in the prior year's quarter. These numbers align with our soft pivot strategy where we're focused on buying shorter duration lands. Our homesites owned and controlled now total 159,000 homesites, of which 129,000 are owned and 30,000 are controlled. We brought down our completed unsold homes during the quarter. They came down 19% sequentially to 973 homes.
Turning to Financial Services. They had strong results this quarter with operating earnings of $53.2 million compared to $39.4 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income increased to $38.3 million from $31.4 million in the prior year. The improved earnings were driven by an increase profit per loan due to the favorable interest rate environment. Mortgage originations increased to $2.6 billion compared to $2.4 billion in the prior year. As a result of a focused effort to capitalize on the low mortgage rates in the third quarter, we achieved a 56% increase in refinance origination volume versus the prior year.
The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers remain consistent with the prior year at 82% capture rate. And our titled company also had a strong quarter. Their profits increased to $15 million from $8.2 million in the prior year and that was also primarily due to higher refinance transaction volume in the current year. Additionally, they had a great focus on operational efficiencies driving additional bottom line profit.
Turning to Rialto. This segment produced operating earnings of $5.9 million compared to $9 million in the prior year. Both amounts are a net of noncontrolling interest. The investment management business contributed $27.6 million of earnings, which includes $6 million of equity and earnings from the real estate funds and $21.6 million of management fees and other. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Fund I and II now totals $141 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $491 million of commercial loans into 2 securitizations resulting in earnings of $27.2 million compared with $519 million and $14.2 million in the prior year, respectively. And that's before their G&A expense.
The increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in the net margins. This year was 5.4% in the third quarter versus last year's third quarter at 3.1% net margin. Our direct investments had a loss of $5.6 million during the quarter. And Rialto G&A and other expenses were $36.2 million for the quarter and interest expense, excluding warehouse lines, was $7.1 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $133 million of cash.
The Multifamily segment delivered a $2.6 million operating profit in the quarter, primarily driven by the segment's $8 million share of the gain from the sale of an operating property, as well as management fee income partially offset by G&A expenses. We ended the quarter with 8 completed in operating properties and 37 under construction, 10 of which are in lease-up, totaling over 11,000 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $3.2 billion. Including these communities, we have a diversified development pipeline that exceeds $7 billion and over 20,000 apartments.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 31.1% compared to 30% in the prior year's period. The rate is lower than expected for this quarter as a result of our continued efforts to maximize the new home energy efficiency credit, which was extended into 2016.
We will continue to focus on maximizing this energy credit and, therefore, we believe the tax rate for the fourth quarter will also be lower than previously expected. We believe that will be a range of 33% to 34%.
Our balance sheet is strong. Our operating strategy is focused on driving cash flow generation. In this quarter, we generated positive operating cash flow. Liquidity remained strong with approximately $568 million of homebuilding cash and $125 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which during the quarter was increased to $1.8 billion. Our leverage improved by 650 basis points year-over-year as our homebuilding net debt to total capital was reduced to 39.9%. We grew stockholders' equity by 22% to $6.5 billion, and our book value per share increased to $28.73 per share.
During the quarter, we early converted an additional $175 million of our 3.25% convertible senior notes. And for the year, we've now converted a total of $243 million of those notes. Our next step maturity matures in June of 2017, and we look forward to retiring $400 million of 12.25% senior notes, which currently cost us $50 million interest per year.
Finally, I would like to update our 2016 goals. We are still on track with our 2016 goals with a few refinements for the fourth quarter.
First, deliveries are still on track with our original 2016 goal to deliver between 26,500 and 27,000 homes. The fourth quarter is projected to achieve a backlog conversion right at 90%. We expect the average sales price for these deliveries to be between $355,000 and $360,000 per home.
Turning to margins. The gross margin percentage for the fourth quarter is projected to be approximately 23.25%. And we are still on track to achieve the lowest SG&A percentage in the company's history in 2016 with our fourth quarter expected to see another 50 basis points reduction sequentially below the third quarter's 9.3%. So that would bring it around 8.8% for the fourth quarter.
Financial Services. Our second and third quarter are typically the highest profit quarters for LFS. However, given the continued favorable interest rate environment, we are also increasing our goal for the fourth quarter for this segment to a range of $37 million to $40 million for the quarter.
Rialto earnings are projected to be in a range of $5 million to $7 million of profit for the fourth quarter. And Multifamily, based on our favorable sale expectations, for between 4 and 5 communities for the fourth quarter, we are increasing our Multifamily goal to a range of $30 million to $40 million for the fourth quarter. Joint ventures, land sales and other income, which I'll group together, we were successful in accelerating some of the projected fourth quarter land sale and clubhouse transactions into our third quarter. So we are now updating our projection to this category to $5 million for the fourth quarter.
And then, finally, with our balance sheet. As we noted, our third quarter net debt to total capital has come down below 40%, and we are well on our path to lower leverage. As Stuart mentioned with our operating strategies, our strong projected earnings, our soft pivot strategy and converting the remainder of the 3.25% convertible, which will shift from debt to equity in the fourth quarter, all of this will continue to lead to lower leverage, which has given us a rock solid balance sheet and positions us well for opportunities as we finish out 2016.
Let me now turn it back to the operator and open it up for questions."

As that land dissipated and we ended up with more shorter-term land, our margins would -- our gross margins would drift down. But we felt that as the recovery matured, we would continue to focus on bringing down our growth rate, focusing on efficiencies in our SG&A, as we've been articulating, and really driving increased earnings through more efficient net operating margin. Let me turn to Rick and Jon and have them weigh in on that."

The natural evolution of a soft pivot is that you're starting to take less risk in land. Associated with that risk profile is a margin presence. You're looking for near-term opportunities, quick returns. So gross margin will naturally come down and IRRs will come up. And so when we're going less long on some of these positions, it means that you're paying a little bit closer to retail than you were in buying wholesale. The other thing that we've been doing is we've really been managing pace in price. A great example of that is notwithstanding the fact that the Houston market is definitely softer given the turmoil in the energy markets. But if you look at our performance there for the last quarter, sales were up by 14%, but our ASP was up by 4%. So in a tough market, we're really trying to maximize the value of the quality assets that we've got there and not give the homes away. We certainly could have sold more homes, but we're just really managing it."

And FivePoint is positioned to see it evolve into its own independent company, managed by its own complement of executives and overseen by its own unique Board of Directors, which parenthetically, myself, Rick and Jon, are part of. That's an example of how we will continue to think about our ancillary businesses move them through the system. The second area is in the apartment area. You're already starting to see a migration through that merchant build program and towards our build-to-core program, which, in many ways, is a very separate program. It, again like FivePoint, has its own complement of management and that builds the core program as an opportunity for us to build a stream of earnings that is consistent, it's fee-generative and enables us to realize on the great value that we are creating. Rialto continues to build to be able to be strategic in its alignment for the future, but we don't have a current path for Rialto that we've articulated. But as Rialto's asset management and RMF, Rialto Mortgage Finance, businesses continue to grow, we think that there are tremendous opportunities for that company to combine to IPO to do a variety of things as we really start to focus on the core homebuilding business."

And Stuart, I think you've done a great job in articulating that message for quite some time. But the big concern is that you're not be able to grow operating earnings in homebuilding as margins, even with the improvement in SG&A dropped down, your EBIT margin, operating margin from homebuilding is down year-over-year, although it's amongst the highest of the sector. And I think what we'd love to hear, what -- this cycle is different in many ways and when you look at the multiyear outlook, can you continue to drive improvements in ROE, utilizing the cash flow you're generating to drive shareholder value? And give the investors on the line more confidence that there is growth and probably better than S&P and alternatives with the stock down, I think it's very near-term focused on gross margins, which you're not seeing the bigger picture.

Our view has been that our gross margins will continue to drift downward. I think if you look at the average of the industry, if you look at what's normalized gross margin in the industry, you're probably looking at 21%, 22%. And over time, we'll probably drift in that direction. The industry average might even be lower than that. But I would say a few things. We have a lot of guns in our arsenal. We've been very focused on operational efficiency. We are not focusing on stretching growth in an environment that just isn't giving it easily. Land is expensive. Land is hard to come by. People are expensive and hard to come by. It's hard to grow operations efficiently and effectively at an accelerated rate in a market where land and labor is really constrained. And so we've chosen to focus on operational efficiencies as a mechanism for driving profitability going forward. And we've been consistently articulating, look at the net operating margin where we'll find much more stability and the opportunity to drive profitability going forward from our core business. But with that said, we've also articulated other strategies. Look at our Financial Services group. We've been diversifying that group, not only is it growing alongside of our core homebuilding business, it's growing outside of that homebuilding operation. And we're finding additional earnings by leveraging that part of our business. Look at Rialto, look at our Multifamily effort, look at our ancillaries, and you start to see that there are real growth components that derive from a core homebuilding operation that's operating well and these ancillary businesses that are operating cooperatively."

And so maybe that's a little harder to kind of pinpoint or get a sense of when that might kind of become its own separate entity -- separate from Lennar that is on a more complete basis. But perhaps, you could talk to Rialto and LMC, I'm sorry, LMF, how do you think about those businesses in terms of being a part of the broader Lennar family over the next 2 or 3 years? Obviously, Rialto itself is taking a lot of strides. Is that something that might -- that you're looking for an exit over the next year or 2 and some early for Multifamily, now that that's closer to more of a recurring revenue stream, is that something that you just see kind of as an ongoing part of the business from a broader corporate umbrella cents?

As it relates to FivePoint, which where you started, Mike, FivePoint's trajectory has been very consistent and very positive. The properties in FivePoint have been moving through their system and the consolidation of FivePoint's ownership under one umbrella is a consistent theme. What hasn't been consistent on market conditions, we had embarked on a program to launch an IPO, which under good market conditions would have gone off by now. So the market is the market we can't do much to change that, but the underlying operations of FivePoint are spectacular. As it relates to LMC, our Multifamily platform, I think that there's a very strong case to be made that, that business really is almost part of the core. It has been a part of our strategy for dealing with the first-time homebuyers segment, which has been forced or inclined to rent rather than to purchase because of market conditions or because of appetites. And in fact, this -- that strategy has worked out quite well for us and might be a very compatible program under the core umbrella. So we're not -- we're certainly not targeting right now a spinoff or some other kind of program relative to that segment, and we'll have to see over time. As it relates to Rialto, Rialto was built with the understanding that it would be synergistic to our -- to the growth of our core business and it was, in fact, through the downturn. We've grown Rialto into a business that looked an awful lot like the business that we spun-off back in 1997 under the name LNR. And it continues to grow along those lines. Now there has been choppiness in the capital market. There are questions around the regulatory environment. We think that each of these things work to our benefit. And as we continue to grow the platform, we want to let these things resolve themselves before we design and put forth an exit strategy. But ultimately, Rialto will stand alone."

I'm going to briefly give some remarks, as I always do, and Bruce is going to jump in and break down our financial detail and give some further guidance for next year, as we always do at this time of year, and then we'll open up to Q&A. As always, I'd like to request one question and one follow-up so we can have as many participants as possible.
So let me go ahead and begin. 
Our fourth quarter and year-end results reflect our disciplined adherence to our company-wide strategies of managing our business to a clearly defined growth rate in order to run our business efficiently while generating cash flow in order to fortify our balance sheet. We grew our fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings by 11% and 14%, respectively, while we improved our balance sheet to a 33.4% Homebuilding net debt-to-total cap ratio, which is now back to our predownturn financial condition. We view that as quite an accomplishment.
Across our platform, in each of our business segments, we improved performance and operations to position for our -- for the future and to make the overall company stronger. As we arrive at the close of 2016, we are better able to achieve our overall goal of reverting to a pure-play homebuilder with an excellent operating platform and a healthy capital structure that enables us to be both opportunistic and to ultimately return capital to shareholders in the future.  
All of this was accomplished in the context of market conditions that were suboptimal in 2016, defined by, overall, a slow but directionally steady market improvement that was often choppy and sometimes complicated. 
As we look ahead to 2017, we expect to see a generally similar economic environment define the homebuilding landscape, with some potential upside from the new administration in Washington. Our company strategies of soft pivot on land, [ph] 7% to 10% growth target and improved cash flow will remain the same for now, and we expect to achieve similar growth and balance sheet improvements in 2017, as Bruce will detail on our guidance for the next year. These expectations derive from the following general views. Even with the now clear upward momentum and movement in interest rates mapped out by the Fed and the many questions around taxes and the regulatory environment raised by our incoming, potentially business-friendly new President, we expect to see continued slow but steady market improvement that can be choppy and erratic at times as the new administration goes through the throes of enacting an agenda of change. Upside exists to this view if a general sense of optimism continues to dominate and changes happen quicker. We'll have to wait and see. 
We continue to believe, though, that production levels in the 1 million to 1.2 million starts per year range are still too low for the needs of American household growth that is now normalizing. The rather large production deficit that has continued to grow over the past years should continue to drive overall growth in the housing market. Therefore, we see the current levels of production forming somewhat of a downside or floor to the market. Even with interest rates moving higher, the first-time homebuyer will continue to come back to the market, as stronger economic conditions should drive purchasers to the market, undeterred by the marginally higher monthly payment, especially in the context of continued rent increases. Lower unemployment, wage growth and general consumer confidence should drive household formation, which drives families to purchase homes and to rent apartments. We believe that there continues to be strong pent-up demand for dwellings of all types across the country, though stronger in some markets than in others, and this demand will continue to propel a continued long-cycle, slow-and-steady market improvement that will not be derailed by slow movements in interest rate. This goes for both the first-time and the move-up purchasers.
While demand has been constrained by limited access to mortgages, we feel that any relaxing of the hyper-regulated banking system will normalize the mortgage market, which should enable more purchasers to find their way to homeownership. We continue to expect that demand will build and come to the market over the next years, and that will drive increased production as the deficit in housing stock ultimately needs to be replenished. Nevertheless, availability of land and labor shortages continue to be limiting factors and constrain supply and restrict the ability to quickly respond to growing demand. We expect that these conditions will continue to result in a slow, steady, though positive homebuilding market that will enable slow and steady growth throughout the industry. These have been our consistent guiding views over the past year, and we've mapped our operating strategy around these views, though, at this point, we leave room for upside as we look ahead. Each segment of our company has positioned itself for continued performance in 2017 and beyond, and we believe that -- and we remain well positioned to execute our operating plans and strategies in each of our business segments going forward.
Against this backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating segments. Our for-sale core homebuilding operations have operated a very high level of efficiency with a steady growth pace and a focus on operational excellence throughout 2016. As we've noted in past conference calls, we've adjusted our for-sale housing strategy as the recovery has matured and land pricing has gotten more expensive on the retail side. 
We've noted 3 key components of our core homebuilding strategy: number one, soft pivot on land purchases; number two, lower targeted growth rate; and number three, a heavy focus on SG&A. We've continued to reduce our combined land and land development spend, and new orders in the fourth quarter and the full year grew at 9%, while the -- while deliveries for the year were also up 9%. This is right on top of our targeted growth rate and has enabled us to focus on reducing SG&A while driving cash flow.
We've reduced our SG&A throughout the year. Even while continued labor shortages, construction cost increases and land increases have tested our ability to match sales and delivery pace, our management team has managed sales prices, maximized margins and focused on SG&A in the fourth quarter to bring it to an 8.7% rate to offset pressure on gross margins and maintain a strong net margin, which came in at 14.6% for the quarter. This was accomplished while we've also been increasing our spend on company-wide technologies in order to realize additional reductions in the future. As we look ahead to 2017, we expect to continue to focus on these 3 pillars of our operating strategy in order to drive performance.
Our first of those pillars, we continue our soft pivot on land strategy as we are targeting high-quality A location land acquisitions with a shorter 2- to 3-year average life. Additionally, we focused on expanding our first-time homebuyer offering organically with lower land costs, as that segment of the market has continued to recover. And finally, we've used the opportunistic proposed purchase of WCI to fill in some blanks and partially offset land purchases, upgrading our land positions with already mature communities. 
Second, we've noticed -- noted in past quarterly conference calls, given the now mature recovery, that we will continue to manage our growth in order to concurrently grow the bottom line and drive strong cash flows. We continue to manage the growth -- our growth targets to achieve a growth rate in the 7% to 10% range, as we've redirected our management efforts towards maximizing our net operating margin. 
And the third prong, with less pressure on top line growth rate, we've intensified management focus on driving faster bottom line growth and cash flow by maximizing pricing power and using innovative strategies to drive our SG&A down. Under the company mantra, as I said last quarter, of ""What we can measure, we can change,"" we are focused on changing and improving all elements of our operating platform. I noted the example in past quarters that we've been reducing customer acquisition costs through our digital marketing initiative. We've expanded our focus in -- to other operational elements of our business and are seeing reductions in expenses in those areas as well. It is noteworthy that this quarter's SG&A of 8.7% is the lowest fourth quarter SG&A in our company's history, and that follows last quarter's lowest third quarter SG&A. Our homebuilding operations are truly becoming extremely efficient operating machines. 
With demand growing steadily, land limited, labor tight and constrained mortgage availability, we believe that our 3-pronged strategy for Homebuilding -- for our Homebuilding segment positions us well for steady growth as well as the ability to use a strong balance sheet to act opportunistically. 
Moving on, our Financial Services group has also had an outstanding year of accomplishment in 2016. While the Financial Services operations have grown alongside our core Homebuilding business, we've also benefited from a strong, though sometimes erratic, refi market as well as from the expansion of retail opportunities in both our mortgage and titled platforms. While we expect refi opportunities to diminish as rates rise, the other side core [ph] opportunities have continued to expand our platform as we've moved through 2016, and that's reflected in our fourth quarter earnings of $51.4 million versus $33.8 million last year. 
Our strategy for 2017 for Financial Services continues to be to construct and maintain a fully self-sufficient financial services platform that benefits from Lennar Homebuilding business but drives profitability from retail operations as well. Bruce oversees this operation and will discuss it further in his comments. 
Next, our Multifamily program, LMC, Lennar Multifamily Communities, really matured in 2016 into a leading blue-chip developer of apartment communities across the country. LMC had an incredible quarter in our fourth quarter. Earnings totaled $41.4 million, up 306% from the $10.2 million in 2015. During the first -- fourth quarter, we sold 4 of our merchant-build apartment communities, all with high IRRs and 2-plus multiples. During the fourth quarter, we started 1,155 apartment homes in 5 communities with a total development cost of approximately $469 million. As of November 30, 2016, we have -- we had a geographically diversified pipeline of 74 communities totaling almost 23,000 apartment homes, with a total development cost of approximately $7.7 billion. 
Also, during the fourth quarter, we had the final close of our now $2.2 billion Lennar Multifamily Venture, LMV -- we call LMV. LMV represents the largest equity capital raise ever completed in the multifamily industry and demonstrates the confidence venture investors have placed in LMC and our new build-to-core strategy that will allow us to maintain an ownership interest in a portfolio of income-producing communities going forward. We continue to see growing demand in housing, both in our core Homebuilding business as well as our Multifamily platform, and this venture is a key building block for one of our growing ancillary businesses.
Next, our Rialto segment saw a nice turnaround in the back half of 2016, as the capital markets stabilized after a rough start in the first half of the year. During the quarter, market conditions continued to improve, particularly for RMF, Rialto Mortgage Finance, which has maintained its position as one of the largest nonbank CMBS originators. RMF completed its 32nd through 35th securitization transaction during the quarter, selling over $622 million of RMF-originated loans with very healthy net margins. This brings our total to over $6.5 billion of securitized loans since RMF's inception. 
On the investment management front, we also previously announced first quarter closings of commitments for our third fund. This fund will complement our other opportunistic funds with readily available capital to invest. Our first 2 flagship opportunity funds have continued to be top-quartile producers. Fund 1, as an example, became fully invested in early 2013, and we've now distributed 141% of investors' original capital from income and monetizations. And with the distribution through this quarter, Rialto has now realized 2x its original investment with a lot more to go. Fund 2 made its final investment during the first quarter investing -- including recycling over $1.6 billion of equity in 100 transactions. And similar to Fund 1, we've been making distributions already returning about 36% of investors' original commitments. 
Rialto's investment and asset management platform have been growing its asset base as well as harvesting value for investors and us. In a little over 6 years, we've now raised almost $7 billion of equity in a variety of real estate funds and investment vehicles. We've invested about $6.1 billion of equity, and we've already returned $4.8 billion to investors who have earned in excess of -- who have earned almost $2.4 billion over the years. Overall, our Rialto platform enables us to invest across all real estate and financial products. And as we look ahead to 2017, Rialto earnings will continue to grow as we work through our remaining legacy assets and refine our businesses into a 2-pronged, capital-light segment focused solely on RMF, Rialto Mortgage Finance, and the investment management business as well.
Finally, FivePoint is now a self-sufficient, stand-alone company that's a premier, strategic large-scale community builder in California. In 2016, we successfully contributed and exchanged our interest in 3 strategic joint ventures and our interest in the management company for an investment in this newly formed entity called FivePoint Holdings, LLC. This transaction liberated FivePoint in 2016 to start acting independently, to raise capital and to use its pristine balance sheet to operate opportunistically. It also positioned FivePoint to take advantage of either a recovered IPO market, should that happen, or other opportunities as they arise. We simply could not be more excited about the long-term prospects for this one-of-a-kind leader in community development. 
So overall, and in conclusion, let me say 2016 was a great strategic year for the company, and it sets up another year of consistent performance and opportunity. We feel very confident that our view of the market and the strategies that we have successfully implemented in our business have worked very well to position us for continued performance and future growth in 2017 and beyond.
So now let me turn over to Bruce."

Our gross margin on home sales in the fourth quarter was 23.3%, which was in line with our stated goals. The prior year's gross margin percentage was 24.6%.

Sales incentives were 6.2% this quarter compared to 5.9% in the prior year. The slight increase was primarily due to our focus on reducing completed unsold homes, which we managed to decreased by 13% year-over-year to 975 homes. 
Gross margin percentages were once again highest in the East region, and our direct construction cost increases have moderated compared to the prior year. These costs were up 3% year-over-year to approximately $54 per square foot, and this was driven entirely by the labor side, which was offset just slightly by a small decrease in material costs. Our SG&A percentage improved 50 basis points, as Stuart mentioned, to 8.7% in the fourth quarter. About 30 basis points of that improvement was attributable to operating leverage from growing volume organically in our existing Homebuilding divisions, and the other 20 basis points was due to improvement in advertising costs, which we reduced as a result of our focus on digital marketing.
Gross profits on land sales during the quarter were $24.3 million, and that was primarily driven by 3 land transactions during the quarter versus $7.9 million in the prior year. Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $24.6 million, which included our share of net operating losses from the newly created FivePoint entity. We opened 66 new communities during the fourth quarter to end the quarter with 695 active communities. New home orders increased 9%, and the new order dollar value increased 12% for the quarter. Our sales pace was higher during the quarter to 3.2 sales per community per month versus 3.0 in the prior year, and the cancellation rate was 18%. 
During the quarter, we purchased approximately 4,500 homesites totaling $250 million, and this is the same dollar amount that we purchased in the prior year's quarter. This number is aligned with what Stuart highlighted about our soft pivot strategy, where we're focused on buying shorter-duration [ph] land while continuing to grow the company. The number of years of land owned has now been reduced to 4.8 years. Our homesites owned and controlled now total 159,000 homesites, of which 33,000 are controlled.
Our Financial Services business segment had strong results with operating earnings of $51.4 million compared to $33.8 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income increased to $36.6 million from $25.9 million in the prior year. The improved earnings were driven by an increased profit per loan due to the favorable interest rate environment and higher volume. Mortgage originations increased to $2.7 billion compared to $2.4 billion in the prior year, and we captured 81% of Lennar homebuyers. As a result of a focused effort to capitalize on low mortgage rates in the fourth quarter, we achieved a 72% increase in refinance origination volume versus the prior year. Refinance volume was 15% of the total origination volume, but the strong refinance market also drove higher margins per loan. Our title company's profit increased to $14.9 million in the quarter from $8 million in the prior year, and this was primarily due to higher refinance transaction volume and the focus on operational efficiencies.
Providing a little bit more color on Rialto segment. They produced operating earnings of $8 million compared to $7.6 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The investment management business contributed $33.1 million of earnings, which included $4.6 million of equity and earnings from the real estate funds and $28.5 million of management fees and other. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Fund 1 and 2 now totals $141 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance contributed $622 million of commercial loans into 4 securitizations, resulting in earnings of $35.6 million compared with $854 million and $15.8 million in the prior year, respectively, before their G&A expenses. The increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in the average net margins of the securitizations from 2.2% in the prior year to 5.8% in the fourth quarter. The direct investments in Rialto had a loss of $10.7 million in the quarter, and Rialto's G&A and other expenses were $43.3 million for the quarter. And interest expense, excluding the warehouse lines, was $6.7 million. Rialto also ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $149 million of cash.
Adding to Stuart's comments on Multifamily. The $41.4 million operating profit in the quarter was driven primarily by the segment's $47.2 million share of gains from the sale of 4 operating properties as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses. We ended the quarter with 5 completed and operating properties and 38 under construction, 13 of which are in lease-up, totaling over 11,000 apartments, with a total development cost of approximately $3.4 billion. So you could see the pipeline for the sales that we're going to talk about for 2017.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 32.5%. The rate is lower than our previous guidance, primarily as a result of the tax department's continuing efforts to maximize new home energy efficiency credit, which is currently set to expire at the end of 2016. As a result of the expiration of this credit, we expect the tax rate for 2017 to be approximately 34%.
Turning to the balance sheet. The matching of the operating strategies with our execution has returned our balance sheet to the very healthy levels that existed before the downturn. We highlighted that the soft pivot strategy, common [ph] strong profitability and the conversion of our converts will drive the path to lower leverage. The result was an 880 basis point decline in net debt-to-total cap, going from 42.2% at the end of the prior year to 33.4% at this year-end. This year, we generated between $400 million and $500 million of operating cash flow in 2016. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with now over $1 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $1.8 billion revolving credit facility. Our balance sheet is rock solid, and it's positioning us well for tomorrow's opportunities. 
Additionally, stockholders' equity now exceeds $7 billion, and our book value per share increased to $29.96 per share. During the quarter, we converted the remaining $157 million of our 3 1/4% convertible senior notes. 
Next up for the balance sheet will be a continued focus on cash flow generation and retiring the $400 million of 12 1/4% debt on June 1, which currently costs us approximately $50 million of interest per year. 
Now I would like to provide some goals for 2017. Please note, these goals exclude the benefit from the WCI acquisition, which we will update in our first quarter conference call, assuming the transaction closes as expected in our first quarter. We still expect the transaction to be accretive to our fiscal 2017 numbers, excluding transaction costs. 
Number one, deliveries. We are currently geared up to deliver between 28,500 and 29,000 deliveries for 2017. We expect the backlog conversion ratio to be approximately 70% for the first quarter, between 80% and 85% for the second and third quarters and over 90% for the fourth quarter. We are expecting an average sales price between $365,000 and $370,000 for the full year. We expect operating margins to be around 13% for the full year. The full year gross margin is expected to be in the range of 22% to 22.5%. We expect continuing improvement in the SG&A line from operating leverage and our investments in technology, reducing SG&A to somewhere between 9.1% and 9.3% for the full year. There will be seasonality between the quarters, with the first quarter being the lowest operating margin, and the operating leverage is expected primarily in the second half of the year to match up with our highest volume quarters. 
Financial Services are expected to be in the range of $155 million to $160 million for the year. The quarterly amounts are expected to be spread fairly similar to 2016, with the first quarter anticipated to be the lowest quarter of profitability. With rising interest rates, we expect the strong refinance market that we did see in 2016 to start to slow down as we go through 2017. Rialto is expected to generate a range of profits between $45 million and $55 million for the year, and the second half of the rate is expected to have the bulk of the profitability for this segment. Multifamily expects to sell 7 to 8 multifamily communities in 2017, with a range of profits between $70 million and $80 million for the full year. We expect to be profitable each quarter with the fourth quarter profits similar to 2016's very strong fourth quarter.
The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income group together, we're expecting to have a range of $70 million to $80 million of profitability for this category. And although we don't anticipate profitability in the first 2 quarters of the year out of this grouping, we do expect strong profitability in the second half of the year.
Corporate G&A is expected to be between 2.2% and 2.3% of total company revenues, as we continue to invest in repiping our systems and technology initiatives. As I mentioned, our tax rate for 2017 should be approximately 34%, and our net community count is expected to increase approximately 7% from our ending count of 695 with the increase spread throughout the year, primarily in the second, third and fourth quarters. 
And then finally, we continue to focus and cash flow generation and expect to generate a similar level of operating cash flow in 2017 as we did in 2016. 
With these goals in mind, we are well positioned to deliver another strong, profitable year in 2017.
With that, let me turn it back to the operator and open it up for questions."

So to start off with, you asked about free cash flow and how we might think to deploy that to enhance shareholder value. And let me say, hats off to Rick, as he aptly negotiated our proposed deal with WCI. He injected a great deal of optionality for us in the way that we think about the use of cash versus stock. And then we do have optionality all the way -- for quite some time until closing. And so we are thinking about the way that we use cash to enhance shareholder value in all transactions, whether it's the purchase of new land, whether it's other deals that we are considering opportunistically or whether it's the way that we use cash and stock. And we'll keep a lot of optionality injected in our program so that we can watch as the world around us, given the new administration, starts to really unfold. So we are very keenly considering how we think about the use of cash. We've injected a lot of optionality, and you can expect that, that's going to be a primary focus for our corporate office. So that was part one. You asked about some of the discussion points and administrative changes that might come along with a new administration. We've been giving a lot of thought to that. There are some murkier waters, some questions around tax rate reductions and how they might ripple through, how they might result in cash savings. I think we're going to have to wait and see what the details are. But as the landscape shifts, as a tax policy that has been articulated actually gets form, there are going to be some change agents in the way that customers think about whether or not they want to purchase or whether or not they have the capital to deploy. We think that the tax changes are going to have some significant impact, not just to the individual or potential customers, but also to our corporate tax rate in the way that we kind of configure our organization. Corporate taxes, as articulated, are likely to go down. But what other elements of the tax code might change at the same time is something that we're going to have to stay on top of. Around the regulatory environment, there's a whole host of regulatory constraint that has defined the housing market, not the least of which is the way the banks have been not only regulated but also prosecuted. It has suddenly shifted the landscape for the mortgage history or defined the landscape for the mortgage industry. Any -- what it seems to be -- what seems to be lightning of that regulatory or prosecutorial environment would, in my opinion, result in more normalization of the mortgage market and, therefore, greater access to the mortgage market by the lower and middle class, which, I think, would be healthy, not only for the housing industry, but also for the economy in general. And I think we've been saying that for a long time. All of these pieces, as we see new administration come in, as we see that confidence has been lifted, we'll see how that ripples through the selling season and how consistent it stays. All of these provide opportunities for us to look opportunistically about -- as to how we deploy our cash and how we think about cash flow turning into the building of shareholder value. So I hope that answers the question."

The goal for the company is to be a pure-play homebuilder. Whether that includes our apartment effort or not is something that we're considering openly. That might be inclusive our Multifamily program. So we hold that open to see how we think about it in the future. But clearly, we've been focused on FivePoint and Rialto, maturing and positioning those companies for other forms of ownership. We've articulated that FivePoint, we've looked at an IPO opportunity. The IPO market closed up on us. And we look at other strategic opportunities. We really refined the ownership structure for FivePoint so that it's positioned and ready to go should the right opportunity come along, and we'll focus on that, looking for that. Likewise, with Rialto, 2016 and continuing into 2017, as we resolve the legacy component of our asset base really refines Rialto to become a self-sufficient operation, a lot like FivePoint already is, and positions it to find its way into some different form of ownership. As we resolve these ancillary businesses, we really clarify our position as a pure-play homebuilder, defined by our core Homebuilding business, financial services, which is a sidecar program, and potentially by our Multifamily group also. But as you can see, with this year's performance of the Multifamily side, we've really positioned that entity to also be -- and to have a lot of optionality in what we do with it because this is becoming a very valuable enterprise for the company and quite compatible with our core for-sale business."

I don't think that we've made that as a migration. I think we've just pulled cost out of the question. When I look at and think about our migration from conventional to digital marketing, we basically cut many of our advertising and marketing costs in half. While we have not increased traffic, we've actually reduced actual foot traffic but to a much higher quality of traffic. So our conversion rates have gone way up. This has really created less stress in this system. Remember that this one element is a proxy for many other areas that we're focused on around our SG&A. But some of the results about what our digital marketing platform has done really get a little bit interesting to me because it's not just about the reduction in costs. It's about the ability to drive traffic and to continue to enhance what we're already doing. So just some stats. Our digital marketing resulted in Internet leads being up 35% to over 90,000. Our social media followers are up 22% to 2.7 million, and our YouTube views are up by 11 million to 33 million. These are really big numbers that derive from the ability to actually focus on something and to use digital technologies to our advantage. Now when we talk about repiping our system, we're repiping the operational side of our business to be able to apply the same focuses to things like even flow and even distribution of closings through a quarter, to focus on a number of components of our business that we think can eliminate duplication in the way that we handle our financial accounting and the distribution of information through our company.

I'm going to briefly give some remarks, as I always do, and Bruce is going to jump in and break down our financial detail and give some further guidance for next year, as we always do at this time of year, and then we'll open up to Q&A. As always, I'd like to request one question and one follow-up so we can have as many participants as possible.
So let me go ahead and begin. 
Our fourth quarter and year-end results reflect our disciplined adherence to our company-wide strategies of managing our business to a clearly defined growth rate in order to run our business efficiently while generating cash flow in order to fortify our balance sheet. We grew our fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings by 11% and 14%, respectively, while we improved our balance sheet to a 33.4% Homebuilding net debt-to-total cap ratio, which is now back to our predownturn financial condition. We view that as quite an accomplishment.
Across our platform, in each of our business segments, we improved performance and operations to position for our -- for the future and to make the overall company stronger. As we arrive at the close of 2016, we are better able to achieve our overall goal of reverting to a pure-play homebuilder with an excellent operating platform and a healthy capital structure that enables us to be both opportunistic and to ultimately return capital to shareholders in the future.  
All of this was accomplished in the context of market conditions that were suboptimal in 2016, defined by, overall, a slow but directionally steady market improvement that was often choppy and sometimes complicated. 
As we look ahead to 2017, we expect to see a generally similar economic environment define the homebuilding landscape, with some potential upside from the new administration in Washington. Our company strategies of soft pivot on land, 7% to 10% growth target and improved cash flow will remain the same for now, and we expect to achieve similar growth and balance sheet improvements in 2017, as Bruce will detail on our guidance for the next year. These expectations derive from the following general views. Even with the now clear upward momentum and movement in interest rates mapped out by the Fed and the many questions around taxes and the regulatory environment raised by our incoming, potentially business-friendly new President, we expect to see continued slow but steady market improvement that can be choppy and erratic at times as the new administration goes through the throes of enacting an agenda of change. Upside exists to this view if a general sense of optimism continues to dominate and changes happen quicker. We'll have to wait and see. 
We continue to believe, though, that production levels in the 1 million to 1.2 million starts per year range are still too low for the needs of American household growth that is now normalizing. The rather large production deficit that has continued to grow over the past years should continue to drive overall growth in the housing market. Therefore, we see the current levels of production forming somewhat of a downside or floor to the market. Even with interest rates moving higher, the first-time homebuyer will continue to come back to the market, as stronger economic conditions should drive purchasers to the market, undeterred by the marginally higher monthly payment, especially in the context of continued rent increases. Lower unemployment, wage growth and general consumer confidence should drive household formation, which drives families to purchase homes and to rent apartments. We believe that there continues to be strong pent-up demand for dwellings of all types across the country, though stronger in some markets than in others, and this demand will continue to propel a continued long-cycle, slow-and-steady market improvement that will not be derailed by slow movements in interest rate. This goes for both the first-time and the move-up purchasers.
While demand has been constrained by limited access to mortgages, we feel that any relaxing of the hyper-regulated banking system will normalize the mortgage market, which should enable more purchasers to find their way to homeownership. We continue to expect that demand will build and come to the market over the next years, and that will drive increased production as the deficit in housing stock ultimately needs to be replenished. Nevertheless, availability of land and labor shortages continue to be limiting factors and constrain supply and restrict the ability to quickly respond to growing demand. We expect that these conditions will continue to result in a slow, steady, though positive homebuilding market that will enable slow and steady growth throughout the industry. These have been our consistent guiding views over the past year, and we've mapped our operating strategy around these views, though, at this point, we leave room for upside as we look ahead. Each segment of our company has positioned itself for continued performance in 2017 and beyond, and we believe that -- and we remain well positioned to execute our operating plans and strategies in each of our business segments going forward.
Against this backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating segments. Our for-sale core homebuilding operations have operated a very high level of efficiency with a steady growth pace and a focus on operational excellence throughout 2016. As we've noted in past conference calls, we've adjusted our for-sale housing strategy as the recovery has matured and land pricing has gotten more expensive on the retail side. 
We've noted 3 key components of our core homebuilding strategy: number one, soft pivot on land purchases; number two, lower targeted growth rate; and number three, a heavy focus on SG&A. We've continued to reduce our combined land and land development spend, and new orders in the fourth quarter and the full year grew at 9%, while the -- while deliveries for the year were also up 9%. This is right on top of our targeted growth rate and has enabled us to focus on reducing SG&A while driving cash flow.
We've reduced our SG&A throughout the year. Even while continued labor shortages, construction cost increases and land increases have tested our ability to match sales and delivery pace, our management team has managed sales prices, maximized margins and focused on SG&A in the fourth quarter to bring it to an 8.7% rate to offset pressure on gross margins and maintain a strong net margin, which came in at 14.6% for the quarter. This was accomplished while we've also been increasing our spend on company-wide technologies in order to realize additional reductions in the future. As we look ahead to 2017, we expect to continue to focus on these 3 pillars of our operating strategy in order to drive performance.
Our first of those pillars, we continue our soft pivot on land strategy as we are targeting high-quality A location land acquisitions with a shorter 2- to 3-year average life. Additionally, we focused on expanding our first-time homebuyer offering organically with lower land costs, as that segment of the market has continued to recover. And finally, we've used the opportunistic proposed purchase of WCI to fill in some blanks and partially offset land purchases, upgrading our land positions with already mature communities. 
Second, we've noticed -- noted in past quarterly conference calls, given the now mature recovery, that we will continue to manage our growth in order to concurrently grow the bottom line and drive strong cash flows. We continue to manage the growth -- our growth targets to achieve a growth rate in the 7% to 10% range, as we've redirected our management efforts towards maximizing our net operating margin. 
And the third prong, with less pressure on top line growth rate, we've intensified management focus on driving faster bottom line growth and cash flow by maximizing pricing power and using innovative strategies to drive our SG&A down. Under the company mantra, as I said last quarter, of ""What we can measure, we can change,"" we are focused on changing and improving all elements of our operating platform. I noted the example in past quarters that we've been reducing customer acquisition costs through our digital marketing initiative. We've expanded our focus in -- to other operational elements of our business and are seeing reductions in expenses in those areas as well. It is noteworthy that this quarter's SG&A of 8.7% is the lowest fourth quarter SG&A in our company's history, and that follows last quarter's lowest third quarter SG&A. Our homebuilding operations are truly becoming extremely efficient operating machines. 
With demand growing steadily, land limited, labor tight and constrained mortgage availability, we believe that our 3-pronged strategy for Homebuilding -- for our Homebuilding segment positions us well for steady growth as well as the ability to use a strong balance sheet to act opportunistically. 
Moving on, our Financial Services group has also had an outstanding year of accomplishment in 2016. While the Financial Services operations have grown alongside our core Homebuilding business, we've also benefited from a strong, though sometimes erratic, refi market as well as from the expansion of retail opportunities in both our mortgage and titled platforms. While we expect refi opportunities to diminish as rates rise, the other side core opportunities have continued to expand our platform as we've moved through 2016, and that's reflected in our fourth quarter earnings of $51.4 million versus $33.8 million last year. 
Our strategy for 2017 for Financial Services continues to be to construct and maintain a fully self-sufficient financial services platform that benefits from Lennar Homebuilding business but drives profitability from retail operations as well. Bruce oversees this operation and will discuss it further in his comments. 
Next, our Multifamily program, LMC, Lennar Multifamily Communities, really matured in 2016 into a leading blue-chip developer of apartment communities across the country. LMC had an incredible quarter in our fourth quarter. Earnings totaled $41.4 million, up 306% from the $10.2 million in 2015. During the first -- fourth quarter, we sold 4 of our merchant-build apartment communities, all with high IRRs and 2-plus multiples. During the fourth quarter, we started 1,155 apartment homes in 5 communities with a total development cost of approximately $469 million. As of November 30, 2016, we have -- we had a geographically diversified pipeline of 74 communities totaling almost 23,000 apartment homes, with a total development cost of approximately $7.7 billion. 
Also, during the fourth quarter, we had the final close of our now $2.2 billion Lennar Multifamily Venture, LMV -- we call LMV. LMV represents the largest equity capital raise ever completed in the multifamily industry and demonstrates the confidence venture investors have placed in LMC and our new build-to-core strategy that will allow us to maintain an ownership interest in a portfolio of income-producing communities going forward. We continue to see growing demand in housing, both in our core Homebuilding business as well as our Multifamily platform, and this venture is a key building block for one of our growing ancillary businesses.
Next, our Rialto segment saw a nice turnaround in the back half of 2016, as the capital markets stabilized after a rough start in the first half of the year. During the quarter, market conditions continued to improve, particularly for RMF, Rialto Mortgage Finance, which has maintained its position as one of the largest nonbank CMBS originators. RMF completed its 32nd through 35th securitization transaction during the quarter, selling over $622 million of RMF-originated loans with very healthy net margins. This brings our total to over $6.5 billion of securitized loans since RMF's inception. 
On the investment management front, we also previously announced first quarter closings of commitments for our third fund. This fund will complement our other opportunistic funds with readily available capital to invest. Our first 2 flagship opportunity funds have continued to be top-quartile producers. Fund 1, as an example, became fully invested in early 2013, and we've now distributed 141% of investors' original capital from income and monetizations. And with the distribution through this quarter, Rialto has now realized 2x its original investment with a lot more to go. Fund 2 made its final investment during the first quarter investing -- including recycling over $1.6 billion of equity in 100 transactions. And similar to Fund 1, we've been making distributions already returning about 36% of investors' original commitments. 
Rialto's investment and asset management platform have been growing its asset base as well as harvesting value for investors and us. In a little over 6 years, we've now raised almost $7 billion of equity in a variety of real estate funds and investment vehicles. We've invested about $6.1 billion of equity, and we've already returned $4.8 billion to investors who have earned in excess of -- who have earned almost $2.4 billion over the years. Overall, our Rialto platform enables us to invest across all real estate and financial products. And as we look ahead to 2017, Rialto earnings will continue to grow as we work through our remaining legacy assets and refine our businesses into a 2-pronged, capital-light segment focused solely on RMF, Rialto Mortgage Finance, and the investment management business as well.
Finally, FivePoint is now a self-sufficient, stand-alone company that's a premier, strategic large-scale community builder in California. In 2016, we successfully contributed and exchanged our interest in 3 strategic joint ventures and our interest in the management company for an investment in this newly formed entity called FivePoint Holdings, LLC. This transaction liberated FivePoint in 2016 to start acting independently, to raise capital and to use its pristine balance sheet to operate opportunistically. It also positioned FivePoint to take advantage of either a recovered IPO market, should that happen, or other opportunities as they arise. We simply could not be more excited about the long-term prospects for this one-of-a-kind leader in community development. 
So overall, and in conclusion, let me say 2016 was a great strategic year for the company, and it sets up another year of consistent performance and opportunity. We feel very confident that our view of the market and the strategies that we have successfully implemented in our business have worked very well to position us for continued performance and future growth in 2017 and beyond.
So now let me turn over to Bruce."

I'll provide some additional color on our 11% earnings increase over the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 11% in the fourth quarter, driven by an 8% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and a 3% year-over-y",1717,"Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. I'll provide some additional color on our 11% earnings increase over the prior year. 
Revenues from home sales increased 11% in the fourth quarter, driven by an 8% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and a 3% year-over-year increase in average selling price to $357,000. Our gross margin on home sales in the fourth quarter was 23.3%, which was in line with our stated goals. The prior year's gross margin percentage was 24.6%. The gross margin decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land costs and construction costs.
Sales incentives were 6.2% this quarter compared to 5.9% in the prior year. The slight increase was primarily due to our focus on reducing completed unsold homes, which we managed to decrease by 13% year-over-year to 975 homes. 
Gross margin percentages were once again highest in the East region, and our direct construction cost increases have moderated compared to the prior year. These costs were up 3% year-over-year to approximately $54 per square foot, and this was driven entirely by the labor side, which was offset just slightly by a small decrease in material costs. Our SG&A percentage improved 50 basis points, as Stuart mentioned, to 8.7% in the fourth quarter. About 30 basis points of that improvement was attributable to operating leverage from growing volume organically in our existing Homebuilding divisions, and the other 20 basis points was due to improvement in advertising costs, which we reduced as a result of our focus on digital marketing.
Gross profits on land sales during the quarter were $24.3 million, and that was primarily driven by 3 land transactions during the quarter versus $7.9 million in the prior year. Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $24.6 million, which included our share of net operating losses from the newly created FivePoint entity. We opened 66 new communities during the fourth quarter to end the quarter with 695 active communities. New home orders increased 9%, and the new order dollar value increased 12% for the quarter. Our sales pace was higher during the quarter to 3.2 sales per community per month versus 3.0 in the prior year, and the cancellation rate was 18%. 
During the quarter, we purchased approximately 4,500 homesites totaling $250 million, and this is the same dollar amount that we purchased in the prior year's quarter. This number is aligned with what Stuart highlighted about our soft pivot strategy, where we're focused on buying shorter-duration land while continuing to grow the company. The number of years of land owned has now been reduced to 4.8 years. Our homesites owned and controlled now total 159,000 homesites, of which 33,000 are controlled.
Our Financial Services business segment had strong results with operating earnings of $51.4 million compared to $33.8 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income increased to $36.6 million from $25.9 million in the prior year. The improved earnings were driven by an increased profit per loan due to the favorable interest rate environment and higher volume. Mortgage originations increased to $2.7 billion compared to $2.4 billion in the prior year, and we captured 81% of Lennar homebuyers. As a result of a focused effort to capitalize on low mortgage rates in the fourth quarter, we achieved a 72% increase in refinance origination volume versus the prior year. Refinance volume was 15% of the total origination volume, but the strong refinance market also drove higher margins per loan. Our title company's profit increased to $14.9 million in the quarter from $8 million in the prior year, and this was primarily due to higher refinance transaction volume and the focus on operational efficiencies.
Providing a little bit more color on Rialto segment. They produced operating earnings of $8 million compared to $7.6 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The investment management business contributed $33.1 million of earnings, which included $4.6 million of equity and earnings from the real estate funds and $28.5 million of management fees and other. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Fund 1 and 2 now totals $141 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance contributed $622 million of commercial loans into 4 securitizations, resulting in earnings of $35.6 million compared with $854 million and $15.8 million in the prior year, respectively, before their G&A expenses. The increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in the average net margins of the securitizations from 2.2% in the prior year to 5.8% in the fourth quarter. The direct investments in Rialto had a loss of $10.7 million in the quarter, and Rialto's G&A and other expenses were $43.3 million for the quarter. And interest expense, excluding the warehouse lines, was $6.7 million. Rialto also ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $149 million of cash.
Adding to Stuart's comments on Multifamily. The $41.4 million operating profit in the quarter was driven primarily by the segment's $47.2 million share of gains from the sale of 4 operating properties as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses. We ended the quarter with 5 completed and operating properties and 38 under construction, 13 of which are in lease-up, totaling over 11,000 apartments, with a total development cost of approximately $3.4 billion. So you could see the pipeline for the sales that we're going to talk about for 2017.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 32.5%. The rate is lower than our previous guidance, primarily as a result of the tax department's continuing efforts to maximize new home energy efficiency credit, which is currently set to expire at the end of 2016. As a result of the expiration of this credit, we expect the tax rate for 2017 to be approximately 34%.
Turning to the balance sheet. The matching of the operating strategies with our execution has returned our balance sheet to the very healthy levels that existed before the downturn. We highlighted that the soft pivot strategy, common [ph] strong profitability and the conversion of our converts will drive the path to lower leverage. The result was an 880 basis point decline in net debt-to-total cap, going from 42.2% at the end of the prior year to 33.4% at this year-end. This year, we generated between $400 million and $500 million of operating cash flow in 2016. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with now over $1 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $1.8 billion revolving credit facility. Our balance sheet is rock solid, and it's positioning us well for tomorrow's opportunities. 
Additionally, stockholders' equity now exceeds $7 billion, and our book value per share increased to $29.96 per share. During the quarter, we converted the remaining $157 million of our 3 1/4% convertible senior notes. 
Next up for the balance sheet will be a continued focus on cash flow generation and retiring the $400 million of 12 1/4% debt on June 1, which currently costs us approximately $50 million of interest per year. 
Now I would like to provide some goals for 2017. Please note, these goals exclude the benefit from the WCI acquisition, which we will update in our first quarter conference call, assuming the transaction closes as expected in our first quarter. We still expect the transaction to be accretive to our fiscal 2017 numbers, excluding transaction costs. 
Number one, deliveries. We are currently geared up to deliver between 28,500 and 29,000 deliveries for 2017. We expect the backlog conversion ratio to be approximately 70% for the first quarter, between 80% and 85% for the second and third quarters and over 90% for the fourth quarter. We are expecting an average sales price between $365,000 and $370,000 for the full year. We expect operating margins to be around 13% for the full year. The full year gross margin is expected to be in the range of 22% to 22.5%. We expect continuing improvement in the SG&A line from operating leverage and our investments in technology, reducing SG&A to somewhere between 9.1% and 9.3% for the full year. There will be seasonality between the quarters, with the first quarter being the lowest operating margin, and the operating leverage is expected primarily in the second half of the year to match up with our highest volume quarters. 
Financial Services are expected to be in the range of $155 million to $160 million for the year. The quarterly amounts are expected to be spread fairly similar to 2016, with the first quarter anticipated to be the lowest quarter of profitability. With rising interest rates, we expect the strong refinance market that we did see in 2016 to start to slow down as we go through 2017. 
Rialto is expected to generate a range of profits between $45 million and $55 million for the year, and the second half of the year is expected to have the bulk of the profitability for this segment. Multifamily expects to sell 7 to 8 multifamily communities in 2017, with a range of profits between $70 million and $80 million for the full year. We expect to be profitable each quarter, with the fourth quarter profits similar to 2016's very strong fourth quarter.
The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income grouped together, we're expecting to have a range of $70 million to $80 million of profitability for this category. And although we don't anticipate profitability in the first 2 quarters of the year out of this grouping, we do expect strong profitability in the second half of the year.
Corporate G&A is expected to be between 2.2% and 2.3% of total company revenues as we continue to invest in repiping our systems and technology initiatives. As I mentioned, our tax rate for 2017 should be approximately 34%, and our net community count is expected to increase approximately 7% from our ending count of 695, with the increase spread throughout the year, primarily in the second, third and fourth quarters. 
And then finally, we continue to focus on cash flow generation and expect to generate a similar level of operating cash flow in 2017 as we did in 2016. 
With these goals in mind, we are well positioned to deliver another strong, profitable year in 2017.
With that, let me turn it back to the operator and open it up for questions."

I'm going to give you credit for the one question and your follow-up on that. So to start off with, you asked about free cash flow and how we might think to deploy that to enhance shareholder value. And let me",604,"Okay. So that was a multipart question, Ivy. I'm going to give you credit for the one question and your follow-up on that. So to start off with, you asked about free cash flow and how we might think to deploy that to enhance shareholder value. And let me say, hats off to Rick, as he aptly negotiated our proposed deal with WCI. He injected a great deal of optionality for us and the way that we think about the use of cash versus stock. And then we do have optionality all the way -- for quite some time until closing. And so we're thinking about the way that we use cash to enhance shareholder value in all transactions, whether it's the purchase of new land, whether it's other deals that we are considering opportunistically, or whether it's the way that we use cash and stock. And we'll keep a lot of optionality injected in our program so that we can watch as the world around us, given the new administration, starts to really unfold. So we are very keenly considering how we think about the use of cash. We've injected a lot of optionality, and you can expect that, that's going to be a primary focus for our corporate office. So that was part one. You asked about some of the discussion points and administrative changes that might come along with a new administration. We've been giving a lot of thought to that. There are some murkier waters, some questions around tax rate reductions and how they might ripple through, how they might result in cash savings. I think we're going to have to wait and see what the details are. But as the landscape shifts, as a tax policy that has been articulated actually gets form, there are going to be some change agents in the way that customers think about whether or not they want to purchase or whether or not they have the capital to deploy. We think that the tax changes are going to have some significant impact, not just to the individual or potential customers, but also to our corporate tax rate and the way that we kind of configure our organization. Corporate taxes, as articulated, are likely to go down. But what other elements of the tax code might change at the same time is something that we're going to have to stay on top of. Around the regulatory environment, there's a whole host of regulatory constraint that has defined the housing market, not the least of which is the way the banks have been not only regulated but also prosecuted. It has certainly shifted the landscape for the mortgage industry or defined the landscape for the mortgage industry. Any -- what it seems to be -- what seems to be lightening of that regulatory or prosecutorial environment would, in my opinion, result in more normalization of the mortgage market and, therefore, greater access to the mortgage market by the lower and middle class, which, I think, would be healthy, not only for the housing industry, but also for the economy in general, and I think we've been saying that for a long time. All of these pieces, as we see new administration come in, as we see that confidence has been lifted, we'll see how that ripples through the selling season and how consistent it stays. All of these provide opportunities for us to look opportunistically about -- as to how we deploy our cash and how we think about cash flow turning into the building of shareholder value. So I hope that answers the question."

The goal for the company is to be a pure-play homebuilder. Whether that includes our apartment effort or not is something that we're considering openly. That might be inclusive our Multifamily program. So we hold that open to see how we think about it in the future. But clearly, we've been focused on FivePoint and Rialto, maturing and positioning those companies for other forms of ownership. We've articulated that FivePoint, well, we've looked at an IPO opportunity. The IPO market closed up on us. And we look at other strategic opportunities. We really refined the ownership structure for FivePoint so that it's positioned and ready to go should the right opportunity come along, and we're focused on that and looking for that. Likewise, with Rialto, 2016 and continuing into 2017, as we resolve the legacy component of our asset base really refines Rialto to become a self-sufficient operation, a lot like FivePoint already is, and positions it to find its way into some different form of ownership. As we resolve these ancillary businesses, we really clarify our position as a pure-play homebuilder, defined by our core Homebuilding business, financial services, which is a sidecar program, and potentially by our Multifamily group also. But as you can see, with this year's performance of the Multifamily side, we've really positioned that entity to also be -- and to have a lot of optionality in what we do with it because this is becoming a very valuable enterprise for the company and quite compatible with our core for-sale business."

Another thing that's impacting that is our continuing shift towards the lower-priced market, that those have lower gross margins but have higher IRRs. And that gets into the overall strategy that we have as a company. Where the bottom is, I don't think it's much lower than where we are on the 22% side.

We've seen this, as Rick's gone out and raised the capital for this build-to-core fund that we have in place, we've continued to see that, internationally, there's still a sizable demand for this asset class. And while there will be some ebb and flow as certain portfolios of buyers get a little bit more full or fully loaded in this asset class, we'll see a little ebb and flow in some of those cap rates, I think, directionally, we're still going to see a fairly strong cap rate relative to the sale of these kinds of properties and their valuation."

But some of the results about what our digital marketing platform has done really get a little bit interesting to me because it's not just about the reduction in costs. It's about the ability to drive traffic and to continue to enhance what we're already doing. So just some stats. Our digital marketing resulted in Internet leads being up 35% to over 90,000. Our social media followers are up 22% to 2.7 million, and our YouTube views are up by 11 million to 33 million. These are really big numbers that derive from the ability to actually focus on something and to use digital technologies to our advantage.

Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer, is with us by phone from California, and some of that group will be joining in our conversation during the Q&A period. I'm going to briefly give some remarks, as I always do, and Bruce is going to jump in and break down our financial detail and give some further guidance for next year, as we always do at this time of year, and then we'll open up to Q&A. As always, I'd like to request one question and one follow-up so we can have as many participants as possible.
So let me go ahead and begin. 
Our fourth quarter and year-end results reflect our disciplined adherence to our company-wide strategies of managing our business to a clearly defined growth rate in order to run our business efficiently, while generating cash flow in order to fortify our balance sheet. We grew our fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings by 11% and 14%, respectively, while we improved our balance sheet to a 33.4% homebuilding net debt-to-total cap ratio, which is now back to our predownturn financial condition. We view that as quite an accomplishment.
Across our platform, in each of our business segments, we improved performance and operations to position for our -- for the future and to make the overall company stronger. As we arrive at the close of 2016, we are better able to achieve our overall goal of reverting to a pure-play homebuilder with an excellent operating platform and a healthy capital structure that enables us to be both opportunistic and to ultimately return capital to shareholders in the future.  
All of this was accomplished in the context of market conditions that were suboptimal in 2016, defined by, overall, a slow but directionally steady market improvement that was often choppy and sometimes complicated. 
As we look ahead to 2017, we expect to see a generally similar economic environment define the homebuilding landscape, with some potential upside from the new administration in Washington. Our company strategies of soft pivot on land, 7% to 10% growth target and improved cash flow will remain the same for now, and we expect to achieve similar growth and balance sheet improvements in 2017, as Bruce will detail on our guidance for the next year. These expectations derive from the following general views. Even with the now clear upward momentum and movement in interest rates mapped out by the Fed and the many questions around taxes and the regulatory environment raised by our incoming, potentially business-friendly new President, we expect to see continued slow but steady market improvement that can be choppy and erratic at times as the new administration goes through the throes of enacting an agenda of change. Upside exists to this view if a general sense of optimism continues to dominate and changes happen quicker. We'll have to wait and see. 
We continue to believe, though, that production levels in the 1 million to 1.2 million starts per year range are still too low for the needs of American household growth that is now normalizing. The rather large production deficit that has continued to grow over the past years should continue to drive overall growth in the housing market. Therefore, we see the current levels of production forming somewhat of a downside or floor to the market. Even with interest rates moving higher, the first-time homebuyer will continue to come back to the market, as stronger economic conditions should drive purchasers to the market, undeterred by the marginally higher monthly payment, especially in the context of continued rent increases. Lower unemployment, wage growth and general consumer confidence should drive household formation, which drives families to purchase homes and to rent apartments. We believe that there continues to be strong pent-up demand for dwellings of all types across the country, though stronger in some markets than in others, and this demand will continue to propel a continued long-cycle, slow-and-steady market improvement that will not be derailed by slow movements in interest rate. This goes for both the first-time and the move-up purchasers.
While demand has been constrained by limited access to mortgages, we feel that any relaxing of the hyper-regulated banking system will normalize the mortgage market, which should enable more purchasers to find their way to homeownership. We continue to expect that demand will build and come to the market over the next years, and that will drive increased production as the deficit in housing stock ultimately needs to be replenished. Nevertheless, availability of land and labor shortages continue to be limiting factors and constrain supply and restrict the ability to quickly respond to growing demand. We expect that these conditions will continue to result in a slow, steady, though positive homebuilding market that will enable slow and steady growth throughout the industry. These have been our consistent guiding views over the past year, and we've mapped our operating strategy around these views, though, at this point, we leave room for upside as we look ahead. Each segment of our company has positioned itself for continued performance in 2017 and beyond, and we believe that -- and we remain well positioned to execute our operating plans and strategies in each of our business segments going forward.
Against this backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating segments. Our for-sale core homebuilding operations have operated at a very high level of efficiency with a steady growth pace and a focus on operational excellence throughout 2016. As we've noted in past conference calls, we've adjusted our for-sale housing strategy as the recovery has matured and land pricing has gotten more expensive on the retail side. 
We've noted 3 key components of our core homebuilding strategy: number one, soft pivot on land purchases; number two, lower targeted growth rate; and number three, a heavy focus on SG&A. We've continued to reduce our combined land and land development spend, and new orders in the fourth quarter and the full year grew at 9%, while the -- while deliveries for the year were also up 9%. This is right on top of our targeted growth rate and has enabled us to focus on reducing SG&A while driving cash flow.
We've reduced our SG&A throughout the year. Even while continued labor shortages, construction cost increases and land increases have tested our ability to match sales and delivery pace, our management team has managed sales prices, maximized margins and focused on SG&A in the fourth quarter to bring it to an 8.7% rate to offset pressure on gross margins and maintain a strong net margin, which came in at 14.6% for the quarter. This was accomplished while we've also been increasing our spend on company-wide technologies in order to realize additional reductions in the future. As we look ahead to 2017, we expect to continue to focus on these 3 pillars of our operating strategy in order to drive performance.
Our first of those pillars, we continue our soft pivot on land strategy as we are targeting high-quality A location land acquisitions with a shorter 2- to 3-year average life. Additionally, we focused on expanding our first-time homebuyer offering organically with lower land costs, as that segment of the market has continued to recover. And finally, we've used the opportunistic proposed purchase of WCI to fill in some blanks and partially offset land purchases, upgrading our land positions with already mature communities. 
Second, we've noticed -- noted in past quarterly conference calls, given the now mature recovery, that we will continue to manage our growth in order to concurrently grow the bottom line and drive strong cash flows. We continue to manage the growth -- our growth targets to achieve a growth rate in the 7% to 10% range, as we've redirected our management efforts towards maximizing our net operating margin. 
And the third prong, with less pressure on top line growth rate, we've intensified management focus on driving faster bottom line growth and cash flow by maximizing pricing power and using innovative strategies to drive our SG&A down. Under the company mantra, as I said last quarter, of ""What we can measure, we can change,"" we are focused on changing and improving all elements of our operating platform. I noted the example in past quarters that we've been reducing customer acquisition costs through our digital marketing initiative. We've expanded our focus in -- to other operational elements of our business and are seeing reductions in expenses in those areas as well. It is noteworthy that this quarter's SG&A of 8.7% is the lowest fourth quarter SG&A in our company's history, and that follows last quarter's lowest third quarter SG&A. Our homebuilding operations are truly becoming extremely efficient operating machines. 
With demand growing steadily, land limited, labor tight and constrained mortgage availability, we believe that our 3-pronged strategy for Homebuilding -- for our Homebuilding segment positions us well for steady growth as well as the ability to use a strong balance sheet to act opportunistically. 
Moving on, our Financial Services group has also had an outstanding year of accomplishment in 2016. While the Financial Services operations have grown alongside our core Homebuilding business, we've also benefited from a strong, though sometimes erratic, refi market as well as from the expansion of retail opportunities in both our mortgage and title platforms. While we expect refi opportunities to diminish as rates rise, the other sidecar opportunities have continued to expand our platform as we've moved through 2016, and that's reflected in our fourth quarter earnings of $51.4 million versus $33.8 million last year. 
Our strategy for 2017 for Financial Services continues to be to construct and maintain a fully self-sufficient financial services platform that benefits from Lennar Homebuilding business but drives profitability from retail operations as well. Bruce oversees this operation and will discuss it further in his comments. 
Next, our Multifamily program, LMC, Lennar Multifamily Communities, really matured in 2016 into a leading blue-chip developer of apartment communities across the country. LMC had an incredible quarter in our fourth quarter. Earnings totaled $41.4 million, up 306% from the $10.2 million in 2015. During the first -- fourth quarter, we sold 4 of our merchant-build apartment communities, all with high IRRs and 2-plus multiples. During the fourth quarter, we started 1,155 apartment homes in 5 communities with a total development cost of approximately $469 million. As of November 30, 2016, we have -- we had a geographically diversified pipeline of 74 communities totaling almost 23,000 apartment homes, with a total development cost of approximately $7.7 billion. 
Also, during the fourth quarter, we had the final close of our now $2.2 billion Lennar Multifamily Venture, LMV -- we call LMV. LMV represents the largest equity capital raise ever completed in the multifamily industry and demonstrates the confidence venture investors have placed in LMC and our new build-to-core strategy that will allow us to maintain an ownership interest in a portfolio of income-producing communities going forward. We continue to see growing demand in housing, both in our core Homebuilding business as well as our Multifamily platform, and this venture is a key building block for one of our growing ancillary businesses.
Next, our Rialto segment saw a nice turnaround in the back half of 2016, as the capital markets stabilized after a rough start in the first half of the year. During the quarter, market conditions continued to improve, particularly for RMF, Rialto Mortgage Finance, which has maintained its position as one of the largest nonbank CMBS originators. RMF completed its 32nd through 35th securitization transaction during the quarter, selling over $622 million of RMF-originated loans with very healthy net margins. This brings our total to over $6.5 billion of securitized loans since RMF's inception. 
On the investment management front, we also previously announced first quarter closings of commitments for our third fund. This fund will complement our other opportunistic funds with readily available capital to invest. Our first 2 flagship opportunity funds have continued to be top-quartile producers. Fund 1, as an example, became fully invested in early 2013, and we've now distributed 141% of investors' original capital from income and monetizations. And with the distribution through this quarter, Rialto has now realized 2x its original investment with a lot more to go. Fund 2 made its final investment during the first quarter investing -- including recycling over $1.6 billion of equity in 100 transactions. And similar to Fund 1, we've been making distributions already returning about 36% of investors' original commitments. 
Rialto's investment and asset management platform have been growing its asset base as well as harvesting value for investors and us. In a little over 6 years, we've now raised almost $7 billion of equity in a variety of real estate funds and investment vehicles. We've invested about $6.1 billion of equity, and we've already returned $4.8 billion to investors who have earned in excess of -- who have earned almost $2.4 billion over the years. Overall, our Rialto platform enables us to invest across all real estate and financial products. And as we look ahead to 2017, Rialto earnings will continue to grow as we work through our remaining legacy assets and refine our businesses into a 2-pronged, capital-light segment focused solely on RMF, Rialto Mortgage Finance, and the investment management business as well.
Finally, FivePoint is now a self-sufficient, stand-alone company that's a premier, strategic large-scale community builder in California. In 2016, we successfully contributed and exchanged our interest in 3 strategic joint ventures and our interest in the management company for an investment in this newly formed entity called FivePoint Holdings, LLC. This transaction liberated FivePoint in 2016 to start acting independently, to raise capital and to use its pristine balance sheet to operate opportunistically. It also positioned FivePoint to take advantage of either a recovered IPO market, should that happen, or other opportunities as they arise. We simply could not be more excited about the long-term prospects for this one-of-a-kind leader in community development. 
So overall, and in conclusion, let me say 2016 was a great strategic year for the company, and it sets up another year of consistent performance and opportunity. We feel very confident that our view of the market and the strategies that we have successfully implemented in our business have worked very well to position us for continued performance and future growth in 2017 and beyond.
So now let me turn over to Bruce."

I'll provide some additional color on our 11% earnings increase over the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 11% in the fourth quarter, driven by an 8% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 3% year-over-y",1714,"Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. I'll provide some additional color on our 11% earnings increase over the prior year. 
Revenues from home sales increased 11% in the fourth quarter, driven by an 8% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 3% year-over-year increase in average selling price to $357,000. Our gross margin on home sales in the fourth quarter was 23.3%, which was in line with our stated goals. The prior year's gross margin percentage was 24.6%. The gross margin decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land costs and construction costs.
Sales incentives were 6.2% this quarter compared to 5.9% in the prior year. The slight increase was primarily due to our focus on reducing completed unsold homes, which we managed to decrease by 13% year-over-year to 975 homes. 
Gross margin percentages were once again highest in the East region, and our direct construction cost increases have moderated compared to the prior year. These costs were up 3% year-over-year to approximately $54 per square foot, and this was driven entirely by the labor side, which was offset just slightly by a small decrease in material costs. Our SG&A percentage improved 50 basis points, as Stuart mentioned, to 8.7% in the fourth quarter. About 30 basis points of that improvement was attributable to operating leverage from growing volume organically in our existing Homebuilding divisions, and the other 20 basis points was due to improvement in advertising costs, which we reduced as a result of our focus on digital marketing.
Gross profits on land sales during the quarter were $24.3 million, and that was primarily driven by 3 land transactions during the quarter, versus $7.9 million in the prior year. Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $24.6 million, which included our share of net operating losses from the newly created FivePoint entity. We opened 66 new communities during the fourth quarter to end the quarter with 695 active communities. New home orders increased 9%, and the new order dollar value increased 12% for the quarter. Our sales pace was higher during the quarter to 3.2 sales per community per month versus 3.0 in the prior year, and the cancellation rate was 18%. 
During the quarter, we purchased approximately 4,500 homesites totaling $250 million, and this is the same dollar amount that we purchased in the prior year's quarter. This number is aligned with what Stuart highlighted about our soft pivot strategy, where we're focused on buying shorter-duration land while continuing to grow the company. The number of years of land owned has now been reduced to 4.8 years. Our homesites owned and controlled now total 159,000 homesites, of which 33,000 are controlled.
Our Financial Services business segment had strong results with operating earnings of $51.4 million compared to $33.8 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income increased to $36.6 million from $25.9 million in the prior year. The improved earnings were driven by an increased profit per loan due to the favorable interest rate environment and higher volume. Mortgage originations increased to $2.7 billion compared to $2.4 billion in the prior year, and we captured 81% of Lennar homebuyers. As a result of a focused effort to capitalize on low mortgage rates in the fourth quarter, we achieved a 72% increase in refinance origination volume versus the prior year. Refinance volume was 15% of the total origination volume, but the strong refinance market also drove higher margins per loan. Our title company's profit increased to $14.9 million in the quarter from $8 million in the prior year, and this was primarily due to higher refinance transaction volume and the focus on operational efficiencies.
Providing a little bit more color on Rialto segment. They produced operating earnings of $8 million compared to $7.6 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The investment management business contributed $33.1 million of earnings, which included $4.6 million of equity and earnings from the real estate funds and $28.5 million of management fees and other. At quarter-end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Funds 1 and 2 now totals $141 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance contributed $622 million of commercial loans into 4 securitizations, resulting in earnings of $35.6 million compared with $854 million and $15.8 million in the prior year, respectively, before their G&A expenses. The increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in the average net margins of the securitizations from 2.2% in the prior year to 5.8% in the fourth quarter. The direct investments in Rialto had a loss of $10.7 million in the quarter, and Rialto's G&A and other expenses were $43.3 million for the quarter. And interest expense, excluding the warehouse lines, was $6.7 million. Rialto also ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $149 million of cash.
Adding to Stuart's comments on Multifamily. The $41.4 million operating profit in the quarter was driven primarily by the segment's $47.2 million share of gains from the sale of 4 operating properties as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses. We ended the quarter with 5 completed and operating properties and 38 under construction, 13 of which are in lease-up, totaling over 11,000 apartments, with a total development cost of approximately $3.4 billion. So you could see the pipeline for the sales that we're going to talk about for 2017.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 32.5%. The rate is lower than our previous guidance, primarily as a result of the tax department's continuing efforts to maximize new home energy efficiency credit, which is currently set to expire at the end of 2016. As a result of the expiration of this credit, we expect the tax rate for 2017 to be approximately 34%.
Turning to the balance sheet. The matching of the operating strategies with our execution has returned our balance sheet to the very healthy levels that existed before the downturn. We highlighted that the soft pivot strategy, strong profitability and the conversion of our converts will drive the path to lower leverage. The result was an 880 basis point decline in net debt-to-total cap, going from 42.2% at the end of the prior year to 33.4% at this year-end. This year, we generated between $400 million and $500 million of operating cash flow in 2016. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with now over $1 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $1.8 billion revolving credit facility. Our balance sheet is rock solid, and it's positioning us well for tomorrow's opportunities. 
Additionally, stockholders' equity now exceeds $7 billion, and our book value per share increased to $29.96 per share. During the quarter, we converted the remaining $157 million of our 3 1/4% convertible senior notes. 
Next up for the balance sheet will be a continued focus on cash flow generation and retiring the $400 million of 12 1/4% debt on June 1, which currently costs us approximately $50 million of interest per year. 
Now I would like to provide some goals for 2017. Please note, these goals exclude the benefit from the WCI acquisition, which we will update in our first quarter conference call, assuming the transaction closes as expected in our first quarter. We still expect the transaction to be accretive to our fiscal 2017 numbers, excluding transaction costs. 
Number one, deliveries. We are currently geared up to deliver between 28,500 and 29,000 deliveries for 2017. We expect the backlog conversion ratio to be approximately 70% for the first quarter, between 80% and 85% for the second and third quarters and over 90% for the fourth quarter. We are expecting an average sales price between $365,000 and $370,000 for the full year. We expect operating margins to be around 13% for the full year. The full year gross margin is expected to be in the range of 22% to 22.5%. We expect continuing improvement in the SG&A line from operating leverage and our investments in technology, reducing SG&A to somewhere between 9.1% and 9.3% for the full year. There will be seasonality between the quarters, with the first quarter being the lowest operating margin, and the operating leverage is expected primarily in the second half of the year to match up with our highest-volume quarters. 
Financial Services are expected to be in the range of $155 million to $160 million for the year. The quarterly amounts are expected to be spread fairly similar to 2016, with the first quarter anticipated to be the lowest quarter of profitability. With rising interest rates, we expect the strong refinance market that we did see in 2016 to start to slow down as we go through 2017. 
Rialto is expected to generate a range of profits between $45 million and $55 million for the year, and the second half of the year is expected to have the bulk of the profitability for this segment. Multifamily expects to sell 7 to 8 multifamily communities in 2017, with a range of profits between $70 million and $80 million for the full year. We expect to be profitable each quarter, with the fourth quarter profits similar to 2016's very strong fourth quarter.
The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income grouped together, we're expecting to have a range of $70 million to $80 million of profitability for this category. And although we don't anticipate profitability in the first 2 quarters of the year out of this grouping, we do expect strong profitability in the second half of the year.
Corporate G&A is expected to be between 2.2% and 2.3% of total company revenues as we continue to invest in repiping our systems and technology initiatives. As I mentioned, our tax rate for 2017 should be approximately 34%, and our net community count is expected to increase approximately 7% from our ending count of 695, with the increase spread throughout the year, primarily in the second, third and fourth quarters. 
And then finally, we continue to focus on cash flow generation and expect to generate a similar level of operating cash flow in 2017 as we did in 2016. 
With these goals in mind, we are well positioned to deliver another strong, profitable year in 2017.
With that, let me turn it back to the operator and open it up for questions."

I think people would be pretty interested if you go into a little bit more specifics. Obviously, tax reform, some of the things that might drive how you would invest that free cash flow to drive shareholder value."

I'm going to give you credit for the one question and your follow-up on that. So to start off with, you asked about free cash flow and how we might think to deploy that to enhance shareholder value. And let me",605,"Okay. So that was a multipart question, Ivy. I'm going to give you credit for the one question and your follow-up on that. So to start off with, you asked about free cash flow and how we might think to deploy that to enhance shareholder value. And let me say, hats off to Rick, as he aptly negotiated our proposed deal with WCI. He injected a great deal of optionality for us and the way that we think about the use of cash versus stock. And then we do have optionality all the way -- for quite some time until closing. And so we're thinking about the way that we use cash to enhance shareholder value in all transactions, whether it's the purchase of new land, whether it's other deals that we are considering opportunistically, or whether it's the way that we use cash and stock. And we'll keep a lot of optionality injected in our program so that we can watch as the world around us, given the new administration, starts to really unfold. So we are very keenly considering how we think about the use of cash. We've injected a lot of optionality, and you can expect that that's going to be a primary focus for our corporate office. So that was part one. You asked about some of the discussion points and administrative changes that might come along with a new administration. We've been giving a lot of thought to that. There are some murkier waters, some questions around tax rate reductions and how they might ripple through, how they might result in cash savings. I think we're going to have to wait and see what the details are. But as the landscape shifts, as a tax policy that has been articulated actually gets formed, there are going to be some change agents in the way that customers think about whether or not they want to purchase or whether or not they have the capital to deploy. We think that the tax changes are going to have some significant impact, not just to the individual or potential customers, but also to our corporate tax rate and the way that we kind of configure our organization. Corporate taxes, as articulated, are likely to go down. But what other elements of the tax code might change at the same time is something that we're going to have to stay on top of. Around the regulatory environment, there's a whole host of regulatory constraint that has defined the housing market, not the least of which is the way the banks have been not only regulated but also prosecuted. It has certainly shifted the landscape for the mortgage industry or defined the landscape for the mortgage industry. Any -- what it seems to be -- what seems to be lightening of that regulatory or prosecutorial environment would, in my opinion, result in more normalization of the mortgage market and, therefore, greater access to the mortgage market by the lower and middle class, which, I think, would be healthy not only for the housing industry, but also for the economy in general, and I think we've been saying that for a long time. All of these pieces, as we see a new administration come in, as we see that confidence has been lifted, we'll see how that ripples through the selling season and how consistent it stays. All of these provide opportunities for us to look opportunistically about -- as to how we deploy our cash and how we think about cash flow turning into the building of shareholder value. So I hope that answers the question."

The goal for the company is to be a pure-play homebuilder. Whether that includes our apartment effort or not is something that we're considering openly. That might be inclusive our Multifamily program. So we hold that open to see how we think about it in the future. But clearly, we've been focused on FivePoint and Rialto, maturing and positioning those companies for other forms of ownership. We've articulated that FivePoint, well, we've looked at an IPO opportunity. The IPO market closed up on us. And we look at other strategic opportunities. We really refined the ownership structure for FivePoint so that it's positioned and ready to go should the right opportunity come along, and we're focused on that and looking for that. Likewise, with Rialto, 2016 and continuing into 2017, as we resolve the legacy component of our asset base, really refines Rialto to become a self-sufficient operation, a lot like FivePoint already is, and positions it to find its way into some different form of ownership. As we resolve these ancillary businesses, we really clarify our position as a pure-play homebuilder, defined by our core Homebuilding business, Financial Services, which is a sidecar program, and potentially by our Multifamily group also. But as you can see, with this year's performance of the Multifamily side, we've really positioned that entity to also be -- to have a lot of optionality in what we do with it because this is becoming a very valuable enterprise for the company and quite compatible with our core for-sale business."

And that gets into the overall strategy that we have as a company. Where the bottom is, I don't think it's much lower than where we are on the 22% side. And we're just going to have to see as that comes across. If you look at higher cycles for the industry, somewhere in that 21% to 21.5% range has always been considered a pretty solid gross margin.

We've seen this, as Rick's gone out and raised the capital for this build-to-core fund that we have in place, we've continued to see that, internationally, there's still a sizable demand for this asset class. And while there will be some ebb and flow as certain portfolios of buyers get a little bit more full or fully loaded in this asset class, we'll see a little ebb and flow in some of those cap rates.

So our conversion rates have gone way up, and this has really created less stress in this system. Remember that this one element is a proxy for many other areas that we're focused on around our SG&A. But some of the results about what our digital marketing platform has done really get a little bit interesting to me because it's not just about the reduction in costs; it's about the ability to drive traffic and to continue to enhance what we're already doing. So just some stats. Our digital marketing resulted in Internet leads being up 35% to over 90,000. Our social media followers are up 22% to 2.7 million, and our YouTube views are up by 11 million to 33 million. These are really big numbers that derive from the ability to actually focus on something and to use digital technologies to our advantage. Now when we talk about repiping our system, we're repiping the operational side of our business to be able to apply the same focuses to things like even flow and even distribution of closings through a quarter, to focus on a number of components of our business that we think can eliminate duplication in the way that we handle our financial accounting and the distribution of information through our company. And as these things are applied, we think we can have the same meaningful, actual reduction in costs as we go forward."

I'm going to briefly give some remarks, as I always do, and Bruce is going to jump in and break down our financial detail and give some further guidance for next year, as we always do at this time of year, and then we'll open up to Q&A. As always, I'd like to request one question and one follow-up so we can have as many participants as possible.
So let me go ahead and begin. 
Our fourth quarter and year-end results reflect our disciplined adherence to our company-wide strategies of managing our business to a clearly defined growth rate in order to run our business efficiently, while generating cash flow in order to fortify our balance sheet. We grew our fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings by 11% and 14%, respectively, while we improved our balance sheet to a 33.4% homebuilding net debt-to-total cap ratio, which is now back to our predownturn financial condition. We view that as quite an accomplishment.
Across our platform, in each of our business segments, we improved performance and operations to position for our -- for the future and to make the overall company stronger. As we arrive at the close of 2016, we are better able to achieve our overall goal of reverting to a pure-play homebuilder with an excellent operating platform and a healthy capital structure that enables us to be both opportunistic and to ultimately return capital to shareholders in the future.  
All of this was accomplished in the context of market conditions that were suboptimal in 2016, defined by, overall, a slow but directionally steady market improvement that was often choppy and sometimes complicated. 
As we look ahead to 2017, we expect to see a generally similar economic environment define the homebuilding landscape, with some potential upside from the new administration in Washington. Our company strategies of soft pivot on land, 7% to 10% growth target and improved cash flow will remain the same for now, and we expect to achieve similar growth and balance sheet improvements in 2017, as Bruce will detail on our guidance for the next year. These expectations derive from the following general views. Even with the now clear upward momentum and movement in interest rates mapped out by the Fed and the many questions around taxes and the regulatory environment raised by our incoming, potentially business-friendly new President, we expect to see continued slow but steady market improvement that can be choppy and erratic at times as the new administration goes through the throes of enacting an agenda of change. Upside exists to this view if a general sense of optimism continues to dominate and changes happen quicker. We'll have to wait and see. 
We continue to believe, though, that production levels in the 1 million to 1.2 million starts per year range are still too low for the needs of American household growth that is now normalizing. The rather large production deficit that has continued to grow over the past years should continue to drive overall growth in the housing market. Therefore, we see the current levels of production forming somewhat of a downside or floor to the market. Even with interest rates moving higher, the first-time homebuyer will continue to come back to the market, as stronger economic conditions should drive purchasers to the market, undeterred by the marginally higher monthly payment, especially in the context of continued rent increases. Lower unemployment, wage growth and general consumer confidence should drive household formation, which drives families to purchase homes and to rent apartments. We believe that there continues to be strong pent-up demand for dwellings of all types across the country, though stronger in some markets than in others, and this demand will continue to propel a continued long-cycle, slow-and-steady market improvement that will not be derailed by slow movements in interest rate. This goes for both the first-time and the move-up purchasers.
While demand has been constrained by limited access to mortgages, we feel that any relaxing of the hyper-regulated banking system will normalize the mortgage market, which should enable more purchasers to find their way to homeownership. We continue to expect that demand will build and come to the market over the next years, and that will drive increased production as the deficit in housing stock ultimately needs to be replenished. Nevertheless, availability of land and labor shortages continue to be limiting factors and constrain supply and restrict the ability to quickly respond to growing demand. We expect that these conditions will continue to result in a slow, steady, though positive homebuilding market that will enable slow and steady growth throughout the industry. These have been our consistent guiding views over the past year, and we've mapped our operating strategy around these views, though, at this point, we leave room for upside as we look ahead. Each segment of our company has positioned itself for continued performance in 2017 and beyond, and we believe that -- and we remain well positioned to execute our operating plans and strategies in each of our business segments going forward.
Against this backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating segments. Our for-sale core homebuilding operations have operated at a very high level of efficiency with a steady growth pace and a focus on operational excellence throughout 2016. As we've noted in past conference calls, we've adjusted our for-sale housing strategy as the recovery has matured and land pricing has gotten more expensive on the retail side. 
We've noted 3 key components of our core homebuilding strategy: number one, soft pivot on land purchases; number two, lower targeted growth rate; and number three, a heavy focus on SG&A. We've continued to reduce our combined land and land development spend, and new orders in the fourth quarter and the full year grew at 9%, while the -- while deliveries for the year were also up 9%. This is right on top of our targeted growth rate and has enabled us to focus on reducing SG&A while driving cash flow.
We've reduced our SG&A throughout the year. Even while continued labor shortages, construction cost increases and land increases have tested our ability to match sales and delivery pace, our management team has managed sales prices, maximized margins and focused on SG&A in the fourth quarter to bring it to an 8.7% rate to offset pressure on gross margins and maintain a strong net margin, which came in at 14.6% for the quarter. This was accomplished while we've also been increasing our spend on company-wide technologies in order to realize additional reductions in the future. As we look ahead to 2017, we expect to continue to focus on these 3 pillars of our operating strategy in order to drive performance.
Our first of those pillars, we continue our soft pivot on land strategy as we are targeting high-quality A location land acquisitions with a shorter 2- to 3-year average life. Additionally, we focused on expanding our first-time homebuyer offering organically with lower land costs, as that segment of the market has continued to recover. And finally, we've used the opportunistic proposed purchase of WCI to fill in some blanks and partially offset land purchases, upgrading our land positions with already mature communities. 
Second, we've noticed -- noted in past quarterly conference calls, given the now mature recovery, that we will continue to manage our growth in order to concurrently grow the bottom line and drive strong cash flows. We continue to manage the growth -- our growth targets to achieve a growth rate in the 7% to 10% range, as we've redirected our management efforts towards maximizing our net operating margin. 
And the third prong, with less pressure on top line growth rate, we've intensified management focus on driving faster bottom line growth and cash flow by maximizing pricing power and using innovative strategies to drive our SG&A down. Under the company mantra, as I said last quarter, of ""What we can measure, we can change,"" we are focused on changing and improving all elements of our operating platform. I noted the example in past quarters that we've been reducing customer acquisition costs through our digital marketing initiative. We've expanded our focus in -- to other operational elements of our business and are seeing reductions in expenses in those areas as well. It is noteworthy that this quarter's SG&A of 8.7% is the lowest fourth quarter SG&A in our company's history, and that follows last quarter's lowest third quarter SG&A. Our homebuilding operations are truly becoming extremely efficient operating machines. 
With demand growing steadily, land limited, labor tight and constrained mortgage availability, we believe that our 3-pronged strategy for Homebuilding -- for our Homebuilding segment positions us well for steady growth as well as the ability to use a strong balance sheet to act opportunistically. 
Moving on, our Financial Services group has also had an outstanding year of accomplishment in 2016. While the Financial Services operations have grown alongside our core Homebuilding business, we've also benefited from a strong, though sometimes erratic, refi market as well as from the expansion of retail opportunities in both our mortgage and title platforms. While we expect refi opportunities to diminish as rates rise, the other sidecar opportunities have continued to expand our platform as we've moved through 2016, and that's reflected in our fourth quarter earnings of $51.4 million versus $33.8 million last year. 
Our strategy for 2017 for Financial Services continues to be to construct and maintain a fully self-sufficient financial services platform that benefits from Lennar Homebuilding business but drives profitability from retail operations as well. Bruce oversees this operation and will discuss it further in his comments. 
Next, our Multifamily program, LMC, Lennar Multifamily Communities, really matured in 2016 into a leading blue-chip developer of apartment communities across the country. LMC had an incredible quarter in our fourth quarter. Earnings totaled $41.4 million, up 306% from the $10.2 million in 2015. During the first -- fourth quarter, we sold 4 of our merchant-build apartment communities, all with high IRRs and 2-plus multiples. During the fourth quarter, we started 1,155 apartment homes in 5 communities with a total development cost of approximately $469 million. As of November 30, 2016, we have -- we had a geographically diversified pipeline of 74 communities totaling almost 23,000 apartment homes, with a total development cost of approximately $7.7 billion. 
Also, during the fourth quarter, we had the final close of our now $2.2 billion Lennar Multifamily Venture, LMV -- we call LMV. LMV represents the largest equity capital raise ever completed in the multifamily industry and demonstrates the confidence venture investors have placed in LMC and our new build-to-core strategy that will allow us to maintain an ownership interest in a portfolio of income-producing communities going forward. We continue to see growing demand in housing, both in our core Homebuilding business as well as our Multifamily platform, and this venture is a key building block for one of our growing ancillary businesses.
Next, our Rialto segment saw a nice turnaround in the back half of 2016, as the capital markets stabilized after a rough start in the first half of the year. During the quarter, market conditions continued to improve, particularly for RMF, Rialto Mortgage Finance, which has maintained its position as one of the largest nonbank CMBS originators. RMF completed its 32nd through 35th securitization transaction during the quarter, selling over $622 million of RMF-originated loans with very healthy net margins. This brings our total to over $6.5 billion of securitized loans since RMF's inception. 
On the investment management front, we also previously announced first quarter closings of commitments for our third fund. This fund will complement our other opportunistic funds with readily available capital to invest. Our first 2 flagship opportunity funds have continued to be top-quartile producers. Fund 1, as an example, became fully invested in early 2013, and we've now distributed 141% of investors' original capital from income and monetizations. And with the distribution through this quarter, Rialto has now realized 2x its original investment with a lot more to go. Fund 2 made its final investment during the first quarter investing -- including recycling over $1.6 billion of equity in 100 transactions. And similar to Fund 1, we've been making distributions already returning about 36% of investors' original commitments. 
Rialto's investment and asset management platform have been growing its asset base as well as harvesting value for investors and us. In a little over 6 years, we've now raised almost $7 billion of equity in a variety of real estate funds and investment vehicles. We've invested about $6.1 billion of equity, and we've already returned $4.8 billion to investors who have earned in excess of -- who have earned almost $2.4 billion over the years. Overall, our Rialto platform enables us to invest across all real estate and financial products. And as we look ahead to 2017, Rialto earnings will continue to grow as we work through our remaining legacy assets and refine our businesses into a 2-pronged, capital-light segment focused solely on RMF, Rialto Mortgage Finance, and the investment management business as well.
Finally, FivePoint is now a self-sufficient, stand-alone company that's a premier, strategic large-scale community builder in California. In 2016, we successfully contributed and exchanged our interest in 3 strategic joint ventures and our interest in the management company for an investment in this newly formed entity called FivePoint Holdings, LLC. This transaction liberated FivePoint in 2016 to start acting independently, to raise capital and to use its pristine balance sheet to operate opportunistically. It also positioned FivePoint to take advantage of either a recovered IPO market, should that happen, or other opportunities as they arise. We simply could not be more excited about the long-term prospects for this one-of-a-kind leader in community development. 
So overall, and in conclusion, let me say 2016 was a great strategic year for the company, and it sets up another year of consistent performance and opportunity. We feel very confident that our view of the market and the strategies that we have successfully implemented in our business have worked very well to position us for continued performance and future growth in 2017 and beyond.
So now let me turn over to Bruce."

Revenues from home sales increased 11% in the fourth quarter, driven by an 8% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 3% year-over-y",1714,"Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. I'll provide some additional color on our 11% earnings increase over the prior year. 
Revenues from home sales increased 11% in the fourth quarter, driven by an 8% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 3% year-over-year increase in average selling price to $357,000. Our gross margin on home sales in the fourth quarter was 23.3%, which was in line with our stated goals. The prior year's gross margin percentage was 24.6%. The gross margin decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land costs and construction costs.
Sales incentives were 6.2% this quarter compared to 5.9% in the prior year. The slight increase was primarily due to our focus on reducing completed unsold homes, which we managed to decrease by 13% year-over-year to 975 homes. 
Gross margin percentages were once again highest in the East region, and our direct construction cost increases have moderated compared to the prior year. These costs were up 3% year-over-year to approximately $54 per square foot, and this was driven entirely by the labor side, which was offset just slightly by a small decrease in material costs. Our SG&A percentage improved 50 basis points, as Stuart mentioned, to 8.7% in the fourth quarter. About 30 basis points of that improvement was attributable to operating leverage from growing volume organically in our existing Homebuilding divisions, and the other 20 basis points was due to improvement in advertising costs, which we reduced as a result of our focus on digital marketing.
Gross profits on land sales during the quarter were $24.3 million, and that was primarily driven by 3 land transactions during the quarter, versus $7.9 million in the prior year. Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $24.6 million, which included our share of net operating losses from the newly created FivePoint entity. We opened 66 new communities during the fourth quarter to end the quarter with 695 active communities. New home orders increased 9%, and the new order dollar value increased 12% for the quarter. Our sales pace was higher during the quarter to 3.2 sales per community per month versus 3.0 in the prior year, and the cancellation rate was 18%. 
During the quarter, we purchased approximately 4,500 homesites totaling $250 million, and this is the same dollar amount that we purchased in the prior year's quarter. This number is aligned with what Stuart highlighted about our soft pivot strategy, where we're focused on buying shorter-duration land while continuing to grow the company. The number of years of land owned has now been reduced to 4.8 years. Our homesites owned and controlled now total 159,000 homesites, of which 33,000 are controlled.
Our Financial Services business segment had strong results with operating earnings of $51.4 million compared to $33.8 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income increased to $36.6 million from $25.9 million in the prior year. The improved earnings were driven by an increased profit per loan due to the favorable interest rate environment and higher volume. Mortgage originations increased to $2.7 billion compared to $2.4 billion in the prior year, and we captured 81% of Lennar homebuyers. As a result of a focused effort to capitalize on low mortgage rates in the fourth quarter, we achieved a 72% increase in refinance origination volume versus the prior year. Refinance volume was 15% of the total origination volume, but the strong refinance market also drove higher margins per loan. Our title company's profit increased to $14.9 million in the quarter from $8 million in the prior year, and this was primarily due to higher refinance transaction volume and the focus on operational efficiencies.
Providing a little bit more color on Rialto segment. They produced operating earnings of $8 million compared to $7.6 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The investment management business contributed $33.1 million of earnings, which included $4.6 million of equity and earnings from the real estate funds and $28.5 million of management fees and other. At quarter-end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Funds 1 and 2 now totals $141 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance contributed $622 million of commercial loans into 4 securitizations, resulting in earnings of $35.6 million compared with $854 million and $15.8 million in the prior year, respectively, before their G&A expenses. The increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in the average net margins of the securitizations from 2.2% in the prior year to 5.8% in the fourth quarter. The direct investments in Rialto had a loss of $10.7 million in the quarter, and Rialto's G&A and other expenses were $43.3 million for the quarter. And interest expense, excluding the warehouse lines, was $6.7 million. Rialto also ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $149 million of cash.
Adding to Stuart's comments on Multifamily. The $41.4 million operating profit in the quarter was driven primarily by the segment's $47.2 million share of gains from the sale of 4 operating properties as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses. We ended the quarter with 5 completed and operating properties and 38 under construction, 13 of which are in lease-up, totaling over 11,000 apartments, with a total development cost of approximately $3.4 billion. So you could see the pipeline for the sales that we're going to talk about for 2017.
Our tax rate for the quarter was 32.5%. The rate is lower than our previous guidance, primarily as a result of the tax department's continuing efforts to maximize new home energy efficiency credit, which is currently set to expire at the end of 2016. As a result of the expiration of this credit, we expect the tax rate for 2017 to be approximately 34%.
Turning to the balance sheet. The matching of the operating strategies with our execution has returned our balance sheet to the very healthy levels that existed before the downturn. We highlighted that the soft pivot strategy, strong profitability and the conversion of our converts will drive the path to lower leverage. The result was an 880 basis point decline in net debt-to-total cap, going from 42.2% at the end of the prior year to 33.4% at this year-end. This year, we generated between $400 million and $500 million of operating cash flow in 2016. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with now over $1 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $1.8 billion revolving credit facility. Our balance sheet is rock solid, and it's positioning us well for tomorrow's opportunities. 
Additionally, stockholders' equity now exceeds $7 billion, and our book value per share increased to $29.96 per share. During the quarter, we converted the remaining $157 million of our 3 1/4% convertible senior notes. 
Next up for the balance sheet will be a continued focus on cash flow generation and retiring the $400 million of 12 1/4% debt on June 1, which currently costs us approximately $50 million of interest per year. 
Now I would like to provide some goals for 2017. Please note, these goals exclude the benefit from the WCI acquisition, which we will update in our first quarter conference call, assuming the transaction closes as expected in our first quarter. We still expect the transaction to be accretive to our fiscal 2017 numbers, excluding transaction costs. 
Number one, deliveries. We are currently geared up to deliver between 28,500 and 29,000 deliveries for 2017. We expect the backlog conversion ratio to be approximately 70% for the first quarter, between 80% and 85% for the second and third quarters and over 90% for the fourth quarter. We are expecting an average sales price between $365,000 and $370,000 for the full year. We expect operating margins to be around 13% for the full year. The full year gross margin is expected to be in the range of 22% to 22.5%. We expect continuing improvement in the SG&A line from operating leverage and our investments in technology, reducing SG&A to somewhere between 9.1% and 9.3% for the full year. There will be seasonality between the quarters, with the first quarter being the lowest operating margin, and the operating leverage is expected primarily in the second half of the year to match up with our highest-volume quarters. 
Financial Services are expected to be in the range of $155 million to $160 million for the year. The quarterly amounts are expected to be spread fairly similar to 2016, with the first quarter anticipated to be the lowest quarter of profitability. With rising interest rates, we expect the strong refinance market that we did see in 2016 to start to slow down as we go through 2017. 
Rialto is expected to generate a range of profits between $45 million and $55 million for the year, and the second half of the year is expected to have the bulk of the profitability for this segment. Multifamily expects to sell 7 to 8 multifamily communities in 2017, with a range of profits between $70 million and $80 million for the full year. We expect to be profitable each quarter, with the fourth quarter profits similar to 2016's very strong fourth quarter.
The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income grouped together, we're expecting to have a range of $70 million to $80 million of profitability for this category. And although we don't anticipate profitability in the first 2 quarters of the year out of this grouping, we do expect strong profitability in the second half of the year.
Corporate G&A is expected to be between 2.2% and 2.3% of total company revenues as we continue to invest in repiping our systems and technology initiatives. As I mentioned, our tax rate for 2017 should be approximately 34%, and our net community count is expected to increase approximately 7% from our ending count of 695, with the increase spread throughout the year, primarily in the second, third and fourth quarters. 
And then finally, we continue to focus on cash flow generation and expect to generate a similar level of operating cash flow in 2017 as we did in 2016. 
With these goals in mind, we are well positioned to deliver another strong, profitable year in 2017.
With that, let me turn it back to the operator and open it up for questions."

I think people would be pretty interested if you go into a little bit more specifics. Obviously, tax reform, some of the things that might drive how you would invest that free cash flow to drive shareholder value."

I'm going to give you credit for the one question and your follow-up on that. So to start off with, you asked about free cash flow and how we might think to deploy that to enhance shareholder value. And let me",605,"Okay. So that was a multipart question, Ivy. I'm going to give you credit for the one question and your follow-up on that. So to start off with, you asked about free cash flow and how we might think to deploy that to enhance shareholder value. And let me say, hats off to Rick, as he aptly negotiated our proposed deal with WCI. He injected a great deal of optionality for us and the way that we think about the use of cash versus stock. And then we do have optionality all the way -- for quite some time until closing. And so we're thinking about the way that we use cash to enhance shareholder value in all transactions, whether it's the purchase of new land, whether it's other deals that we are considering opportunistically, or whether it's the way that we use cash and stock. And we'll keep a lot of optionality injected in our program so that we can watch as the world around us, given the new administration, starts to really unfold. So we are very keenly considering how we think about the use of cash. We've injected a lot of optionality, and you can expect that that's going to be a primary focus for our corporate office. So that was part one. You asked about some of the discussion points and administrative changes that might come along with a new administration. We've been giving a lot of thought to that. There are some murkier waters, some questions around tax rate reductions and how they might ripple through, how they might result in cash savings. I think we're going to have to wait and see what the details are. But as the landscape shifts, as a tax policy that has been articulated actually gets formed, there are going to be some change agents in the way that customers think about whether or not they want to purchase or whether or not they have the capital to deploy. We think that the tax changes are going to have some significant impact, not just to the individual or potential customers, but also to our corporate tax rate and the way that we kind of configure our organization. Corporate taxes, as articulated, are likely to go down. But what other elements of the tax code might change at the same time is something that we're going to have to stay on top of. Around the regulatory environment, there's a whole host of regulatory constraint that has defined the housing market, not the least of which is the way the banks have been not only regulated but also prosecuted. It has certainly shifted the landscape for the mortgage industry or defined the landscape for the mortgage industry. Any -- what it seems to be -- what seems to be lightening of that regulatory or prosecutorial environment would, in my opinion, result in more normalization of the mortgage market and, therefore, greater access to the mortgage market by the lower and middle class, which, I think, would be healthy not only for the housing industry, but also for the economy in general, and I think we've been saying that for a long time. All of these pieces, as we see a new administration come in, as we see that confidence has been lifted, we'll see how that ripples through the selling season and how consistent it stays. All of these provide opportunities for us to look opportunistically about -- as to how we deploy our cash and how we think about cash flow turning into the building of shareholder value. So I hope that answers the question."

The goal for the company is to be a pure-play homebuilder. Whether that includes our apartment effort or not is something that we're considering openly. That might be inclusive our Multifamily program. So we hold that open to see how we think about it in the future. But clearly, we've been focused on FivePoint and Rialto, maturing and positioning those companies for other forms of ownership. We've articulated that FivePoint, well, we've looked at an IPO opportunity. The IPO market closed up on us. And we look at other strategic opportunities. We really refined the ownership structure for FivePoint so that it's positioned and ready to go should the right opportunity come along, and we're focused on that and looking for that. Likewise, with Rialto, 2016 and continuing into 2017, as we resolve the legacy component of our asset base, really refines Rialto to become a self-sufficient operation, a lot like FivePoint already is, and positions it to find its way into some different form of ownership. As we resolve these ancillary businesses, we really clarify our position as a pure-play homebuilder, defined by our core Homebuilding business, Financial Services, which is a sidecar program, and potentially by our Multifamily group also. But as you can see, with this year's performance of the Multifamily side, we've really positioned that entity to also be -- to have a lot of optionality in what we do with it because this is becoming a very valuable enterprise for the company and quite compatible with our core for-sale business."

Another thing that's impacting that is our continuing shift towards the lower-priced market, that those have lower gross margins but have higher IRRs. And that gets into the overall strategy that we have as a company. Where the bottom is, I don't think it's much lower than where we are on the 22% side. And we're just going to have to see as that comes across. If you look at higher cycles for the industry, somewhere in that 21% to 21.5% range has always been considered a pretty solid gross margin.

And while there will be some ebb and flow as certain portfolios of buyers get a little bit more full or fully loaded in this asset class, we'll see a little ebb and flow in some of those cap rates.

I don't think that we've made that as a migration. I think we've just pulled cost out of the equation. When I look at and think about our migration from conventional to digital marketing, we've basically cut many of our advertising and marketing costs in half. While we have not increased traffic, we've actually reduced actual foot traffic but to a much higher quality of traffic. So our conversion rates have gone way up, and this has really created less stress in this system. Remember that this one element is a proxy for many other areas that we're focused on around our SG&A. But some of the results about what our digital marketing platform has done really get a little bit interesting to me because it's not just about the reduction in costs; it's about the ability to drive traffic and to continue to enhance what we're already doing. So just some stats. Our digital marketing resulted in Internet leads being up 35% to over 90,000. Our social media followers are up 22% to 2.7 million, and our YouTube views are up by 11 million to 33 million. These are really big numbers that derive from the ability to actually focus on something and to use digital technologies to our advantage. Now when we talk about repiping our system, we're repiping the operational side of our business to be able to apply the same focuses to things like even flow and even distribution of closings through a quarter, to focus on a number of components of our business that we think can eliminate duplication in the way that we handle our financial accounting and the distribution of information through our company.
