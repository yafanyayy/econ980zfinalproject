When listening to today's call, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on a comparable constant currency basis, which includes Thoratec sales in both comparable years and is adjusted for the impact of currency. 
Please also note the comparable constant currency sales growth rates in the fourth quarter of 2015 do not include the impact of an extra selling week in the comparable quarter 2014 resulting from our 52/53 week fiscal year convention. This convention, which has been referenced on previous calls, resulted in 5 fewer selling days in the fourth quarter of 2015 versus the fourth quarter of 2014 and 3 fewer selling days on a year-over-year comparison of full-year results. We estimate this variance in selling days decreased our 2015 fourth quarter sales growth rate by 5 to 6 percentage points. For the full year 2015, we estimate this negatively impacted our year-over-year sales growth by approximately 100 basis points. 
Consolidated sales for the fourth quarter totaled $1,447,000,000, a 1% decline from the fourth quarter of last year. Fourth quarter sales included $136 million of Thoratec sales, which was above the guidance range we provided of $125 million to $130 million. Unfavorable foreign currency translations decreased this quarter sales by approximately $91 million. 
For the full year 2015, consolidated sales were $5,541,000,000, up 4% from last year. Unfavorable foreign currency translations decreased 2015 net sales by approximately $413 million. 
During the fourth quarter, we recognized $195 million or $0.69 per share in after-tax charges and amortization expense. For further information regarding these items, please refer to details provided in our press release. Comments during this call referencing fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results, including earnings per share or EPS amounts, will be exclusive of these items. 
During the fourth quarter of 2015, the federal research and development tax credit was permanently extended, including 2015, on a retroactive basis. As a result, during the fourth quarter, we recorded a $16 million benefit to income tax expense, which increased EPS by $0.06, representing a cumulative catch-up adjustment of this credit for the first 9 months of 2015. Comments during this call referencing fourth quarter 2015 EPS would be exclusive of this item. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.02 for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to adjusted EPS of $1.08 in the fourth quarter of 2014. We estimate that on a constant currency basis, fourth quarter EPS increased 11%. For the full year 2015, adjusted EPS was $3.94 compared to adjusted EPS of $4.17 for the full year 2014. We estimate that on a constant currency basis, full-year adjusted EPS increased 11%. 
Before we discuss our financial results for 2015 and offer our sales and earnings guidance for 2016, let me comment on foreign currency. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2015, we used the exchange rates which assumed that each euro would translate into about $1.10 to $1.15 and each JPY 118 to JPY 123 will translate into USD 1. For the fourth quarter, the actual average exchange rate for the yen was consistent with these assumptions while the euro was slightly unfavorable. In addition, certain nonhedged currencies were unfavorable to our expectations. As a result, the impact of currency was approximately $11 million or $0.02 of EPS unfavorable to the midpoint of the guidance we provided last quarter. 
In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full-year 2016, we're assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.05 to $1.10 and for the yen each JPY 115 to JPY 120 will translate into USD 1. Using these exchange rate assumptions, we estimate that foreign currency translations will reduce total reported sales for 2016 by approximately $120 million to $140 million versus 2015, including approximately $45 million to $55 million in the first quarter.
Now for the discussion of sales by product category. For the fourth quarter, total Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM sales were $580 million, a 10% decline from last year's fourth quarter, including $40 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. Sales results were driven by weakness in the U.S., which declined due to MRI product apps in both our low-voltage and ICD product segments. 
For the fourth quarter, ICD sales were $358 million, an 11% decline from last year's fourth quarter. U.S. ICD sales were $209 million. International ICD sales were $149 million, including $22 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations.
For low-voltage devices, sales for the fourth quarter totaled $222 million, a 7% decline from last year's fourth quarter. In United States, pacemaker sales were $85 million. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $137 million, including $18 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. Our strong international growth was driven by our competitive pacer portfolio in Europe and Japan with continued adoption of our Assurity MRI safe pacemaker. As a reminder, we launched this product line in Japan during the third quarter of 2015. 
Atrial Fibrillation or AF product sales for the fourth quarter totaled $276 million, up 4%, including $18 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. Although there was a difficult comparison this quarter given last year's U.S. TactiCath launch, our worldwide AF business continued to demonstrate strong growth driven by continued adoption of our FlexAbility and TactiCath ablation catheters. Due to the successful launch of these products in 2015, we estimate we gained more than 4 points of share in U.S. ablation catheter market. In addition, we experienced an increase in sales of our other AF products, demonstrating pullthrough from ablation catheters sales.
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $327 million, a 2% increase from last year's fourth quarter, including $27 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. International sales, up 6%, were driven by the first full quarter launch of all 4 sizes in our Portico family of transcatheter valves. We also continued to see strong growth in our FFR, OCT and LAA products. In the U.S., sales were driven by growth in CardioMEMS on a year-over-year basis, partially offset by weakness in traditional heart valves. For modeling purposes only, we expect full year 2016 CardioMEMS sales to be approximately $65 million, which is simply the annualized run rate of our fourth quarter 2015 sales number. Given the uncertainty around upcoming reimbursement decisions, we expect to update this estimate on our April earnings call.
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $128 million, up 9%, as we continue to take share on a global basis with the most comprehensive neuromodulation portfolio on the market, allowing us to treat chronic pain patients through the pain continuum. In the U.S., we saw a continued strong adoption of our upgradable Protégé MRI platform. Our international spinal cord stimulation business grew over 20% during the quarter, highlighted by approximately 70% growth in Australia. 
The geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical sales in the fourth quarter of 2015 is detailed in our press release. In total, 51% of St. Jude Medical's sales in the fourth quarter came from the U.S., while 49% came from international markets. 
I would now like to provide comparable constant currency revenue guidance for 2016. We expect full year 2016 comparable constant currency sales growth to be in the range of 2% to 4%. We expect first quarter comparable constant currency sales growth to be flat to slightly up. 
On January 13, we issued an 8-K announcing our new revenue reporting structure. Beginning in April, we will report our revenue product categories in the 5 following areas of focus: Atrial Fibrillation, Heart Failure, Neuromodulation, Traditional CRM and Cardiovascular. 
The gross profit margin during the fourth quarter was 68.9%, down 220 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily due to a decline of 170 basis points related to the negative impact of currency. This currency impact included certain currencies in markets where we do not have hedging contracts. Additionally, there was a 50 basis point decline related to the continued weakness in our higher-margin U.S. CRM business. For the full year 2015, the gross profit margin was 69.9%, down 180 basis points from 2014, primarily due to 130 basis point impact from currency. For the full year 2016, we expect gross profit margin to be in the range of 69.0% to 69.5%. This expectation includes continued weakness in our U.S. CRM business, a 60 basis point improvement related to the suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax and a 50 to 70 basis point decline driven by the negative currency environment. 
Our fourth quarter SG&A expenses were 30.3% of net sales, an 80 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year 2015, SG&A expenses were 31.9% of net sales. For the full-year 2016, we expect this ratio to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.0%. 
Research and development expenses in the fourth quarter and full year 2015 were 12.2% of net sales. For the full-year 2016, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of net sales to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.0% as we invest in programs that support our innovation strategy. 
Other expense was $32 million in the fourth quarter and $88 million for the full year 2015. For the full year 2016, we expect other expense of approximately $150 million to $160 million, primarily driven by interest expense on our outstanding debt. 
For the full year 2015, our effective income tax rate was 16.6%. For 2015, we expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of 2015, we had $667 million in cash and cash equivalents and $6.4 billion in total debt. During the fourth quarter, we repaid approximately $700 million of outstanding debt. There were no borrowings outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility available with a group of banks. 
Next, I want to offer some comments regarding our EPS outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2016. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the first quarter of 2016 the weighted average outstanding shares used in our diluted EPS calculation will be about 286 million to 288 million shares and the weighted average outstanding shares for the full-year 2016 will be about 288 million to 290 million shares. For the full year 2016, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $3.95 to $4.05. This expectation includes the impact from negative currency translations, which we estimate, based on our current exchange rate assumptions, will reduce our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.25. On a constant currency basis, this represents adjusted EPS growth of $0.26 to $0.36. To help reconcile the components of this growth, please note the following: EPS accretion related to the Thoratec acquisition in 2016 is expected to be approximately $0.20, of which we plan to reinvest 50%. The temporary repeal of the Medical Device Excise Tax has a $0.07 benefit to our EPS, which we also plan to reinvest in the business. The remaining $0.16 to $0.26 of EPS accretion represents 4% to 7% constant currency growth. The company expects adjusted EPS for the first quarter of 2016 to be in the range of $0.87 to $0.89, which represents constant currency growth of 5% to 8%. 
I will now turn the call over to Mike."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. As most of you are aware, this is my first earnings call as St. Jude Medical's President and Chief Executive Officer. Over the past few months, I've had the opportunity to talk with many of yo",2170,"Thanks, Don. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. As most of you are aware, this is my first earnings call as St. Jude Medical's President and Chief Executive Officer. Over the past few months, I've had the opportunity to talk with many of you. And the main question I get is, ""What can we expect under your leadership?"" So I wanted to start there. 
First, we have a solid strategy in place. We are leading the market in our strategy to surround the patient care continuum in AF, heart failure and neuromodulation. Within these areas, we're bringing to market innovative relevant technologies that help our customers treat patients throughout key stages of care. We are positioning ourselves to be the partner of choice in these targeted disease state areas. That is our primary focus and long-term goal. 
Short term, we have some work to do to address current pressures in our business. This is my immediate focus and something our cross functional leadership team has their complete attention on as well. Cross-functional collaboration is Key. We are working to fully leverage our One St. Jude Medical structure to move quickly and address key challenges and opportunities globally and ensure we are executing on the basics, innovating in the right areas, getting new products to market and paving the path to get those products into the hands of our customers in a high quality timely fashion. So innovation and execution is what really matters. Our people and culture our top priority for me and our focus is on building an energized and accountable team that innovates and executes. We saw in our fourth quarter performance positive results where we effectively launched new innovative products. Fourth quarter sales were over $1.4 billion, with strong growth in both AF and Neuromodulation as well as in our recently acquired Thoratec mechanical circulatory support business. The Thoratec acquisition was the largest in our history and we are pleased with both the integration efforts and the sales momentum to date. 
At the beginning of 2015, we said that our success would depend on performance in AF, Neuromodulation and CardioMEMS. As we closed out the year, we achieved success in 2 of those 3 areas. We still have work to do to grow our CardioMEMS business. While it is on track from the perspective of patient care, physician demand and economic impact, the technology remains under pressure from a reimbursement standpoint. 
Going into 2015, we were well positioned to grow EPS faster than sales and we delivered this by growing adjusted EPS by 11% on a year-over-year basis with 2015 revenue growth of approximately 4% and above market growth in key areas including AF and neuromodulation. Our strong growth in AF, neuromodulation and our recently acquired Thoratec business was offset by underperformance in CRM, which along with currency headwinds put pressure on gross margin. We focused on disciplined expense management and cost-saving initiatives to deliver operating leverage and grew EPS quicker than sales. 
Building off of our experience in 2015, our plan for 2016 continues to leverage our core strengths primarily in technologies to treat and manage AF, heart failure and neuromodulation. We continue to see attractive growth rates from our international business due to strong results from a number of new product launches, which we believe is a key leading indicator for future U.S. sales performance. 
I'd like to provide an overview of our business in these core areas. Starting with AF. This market is growing in the low teens and is underpenetrated with approximately 2.5% of the diagnosed symptomatic AF patient population receiving ablation. Since growth in this area is largely driven by ablation procedures, St. Jude Medical is well positioned to be the provider of choice to our EP customers with the strongest and most comprehensive portfolio. Contact force technology is quickly moving to standard of care for RF ablation therapy, and we are uniquely positioned to benefit from this trend is given the strength of data supporting our TactiCath ablation catheter. In 2016, we expect to make important additions to our EP portfolio, including the EnSite precision cardiac mapping system, with sensor-enabled catheters and advanced user interface. In 2016, we will have the most comprehensive launch of new products in our AF portfolio. This system was designed in collaboration with key opinion leaders from around the world and the initial feedback received from the physicians and global thought leaders validates our confidence in this new mapping system. At our February 5 analyst investor meeting, we will also unveil plans for our next-generation insertable cardiac monitor, which we expect to be available in international markets in the second half of 2016. 
With our heart failure business, our new reporting structure includes CRT products, CardioMEMS and. We are developing technologies that position us as the global leader in heart failure management. We uniquely enable patient care from early symptoms to advanced heart failure regardless of type.
CardioMEMS is the cornerstone of our heart failure program. We are the only company with an FDA-approved remote hemodynamic monitoring device, and we plan to continue to develop this new market and expand clinical evidence to drive adoption and reimbursement globally. 
We were encouraged by the early collaboration with CMS to establish a New Technology Add-On Payment and the transitional APC passthrough payment status that help to determine payment for hospitals. 
I also want to highlight the November 2015 addition of, which published a prospective longitudinal analysis that demonstrated the long-term effectiveness of the CardioMEMS heart failure system. This prospect of data from the CHAMPION study showed that after a mean of 31 months of follow-up, heart failure patients managed with CardioMEMS had a 48% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations compared to patients managed with the current standard of care.
Despite the evidence that pulmonary artery pressure guided heart failure management is superior to clinical assessment alone and the CMS established new technology add-on and passthrough pathway payments, some of our customers are facing reimbursement challenges which have slowed our growth. We have a comprehensive plan in place to address these challenges in 2016. We are continuing to work with national payers and regional max to educate them on the latest published data and real world experience to ensure patient access to this important technology. And we are now in discussion with CMS to create a national coverage determination for implanted hemodynamic monitoring in order to establish clear coverage guidelines for CardioMEMS and increase access and coverage pathways for Medicare-eligible patients nationwide. We plan to update you on our progress during our analyst and investor meeting on February 5. 
Our acquisition of Thoratec added the market leader in left ventricular assist devices or LVADs to our heart failure portfolio. We expect the LVAD market to grow mid-single digits in 2016, and we expect to continue taking share. We have been pleased with the results of our HeartMate 3 launch internationally and the HeartMate 3 U.S. IDE clinical study momentum is making good progress. A key priority for 2016 is to expand global market access to this technology. We also expect meaningful accretion from the Thoratec transaction in the first year and plan to reinvest a portion of this accretion to drive sales growth.
We continue to be the leader in the CRT-D and CRT-P markets with our quadripolar pacing options. Our MultiPoint Pacing, or MPP, already differentiates our technology from competitors in markets where it's approved. We continue to expect this technology to be approved in the U.S. in the first half of 2016. Our growth in Europe during 2015 was supported by the continued adoption of MPP. We now offer the most comprehensive product portfolio to treat patients across their entire care continuum and to help hospitals manage this complex and expensive disease. 
Next, I'd like to discuss our traditional Cardiac Rhythm Management business, which now includes our core ICD devices and pacemakers. Although we will experience pressure in the CRM market in 2016, this business continues to generate significant revenue and cash flow. We expect the U.S  to continue to be a challenging market for us in 2016 due to our temporary product gap with MRI-compatible devices. We anticipate FDA approval for our MRI-compatible pacemaker in the first half of 2016 and MRI-compatible ICD in the first half of 2017. We're also expecting approval of our MRI-compatible ICD in Japan during the first half of 2016. We have demonstrated successful share recovery in Europe and Japan where we have been a late entrant into the MRI-compatible market and expect a similar result in the U.S. In addition, our leadless pacing technology, Nanostim, is scheduled to be discussed at the FDA panel meeting on February 18.
We have transformed our Neuromodulation business and are now positioned to establish St. Jude Medical as the global technology leader. We are the only company with a portfolio that has the ability to treat the continuum of care for chronic pain patients with radiofrequency ablation, St. Jude Medical's proprietary SCS first wave form with upgradable capability and dorsal root ganglion or DRG therapy. The chronic pain market is almost $2 billion and is growing in the mid- to high-single digits. We believe our differentiated technology will drive customer preference for a broader pain portfolio. The 2 recent strategic acquisitions, compelling clinical data and a focus on innovative technologies to address key barriers to adoption we are able to offer a unique proprietary solutions and are changing the landscape of the chronic pain management market. 
We plan to focus on establishing DRG as the standard of care for targeted pain syndromes. DRG is currently available in Europe and Australia, and we expect U.S. Approval in the first half of 2016. The recent 12-month follow-up data presented at in December demonstrated DRG sustained and superior pain relief and improved therapeutic targeting. We are working to contract with new customers in Europe and expand the market for this unique product offered only by St. Jude Medical. 
We also plan to establish St. Jude Medical's proprietary Burst therapy as the dominant spinal cord stimulation waveform to achieve superior pain relief across rechargeable and rechargeable-free devices. Recent SUNBURST trial results demonstrated a reduction or elimination of Paresthesia in 91% of patients. That, coupled with our ability to upgrade implanted devices with new waveforms upon FDA and CE Mark approvals, is expected to drive market share. We think it is important to look at this market from the perspective of the share catcher opportunity for advanced waveforms. 
In regards to the current worldwide revenue mix of tonic devices versus advanced waveforms, we see the market as approximately 90% tonic and 10% advanced waveforms. Given this, we see a tremendous opportunity to take share where our proprietary Burst Technology is available based on demonstrating superior pain relief and pain preference over tonic in the SUNBURST clinical trial and customer experience to date. 
Within Neuromodulation, the DBS market is more than $500 million and it's expected to grow in the low double digits in 2016. We expect our Infinity DBS system with directional leads to take market share by partnering with key opinion leaders to generate clinical evidence and support its launch and market adoption, ultimately positioning directional lead technology as the future standard of care.
Let's now turn to Cardiovascular. The structural heart market remains highly competitive, and our continued success in cardiovascular depends on our ability to execute on key programs across transcatheter, aortic valve replacement, surgical tissue valves and PCI optimization. The fourth quarter was the first quarter where we had all 4 sizes of the Portico valve available in Europe. Sales results in the fourth quarter were above our internal expectations and physician feedback on the Portico valve was positive. Given these results and feedback, we believe the Portico valve can be a viable competitor in markets where approved. 
We are also working on a next-generation tissue heart valve that builds off of the success we have had with Trifecta. This will be another new product that we expect to discuss at the February analyst and investor meeting. We also expect an FDA panel on PFO in the first half of 2016.
To summarize. We have an extensive pipeline with innovative and differentiating technologies. As Don mentioned earlier, our 2016 guidance calls for comparable constant currency growth of 2% to 4%, which we believe factors in growth opportunities in heart failure, atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation as well as the challenges in CRM and CardioMEMS that we have identified. Our 2016 EPS goal guidance demonstrates continued operating leverage while allowing us to sustain investments necessary to deliver top line results. I believe our overall strategy of surrounding AF, heart failure and neuromodulation is the right strategy. In 2016, we will continue to build a winning culture with a sharp focus on innovation and execution to grow our business and drive shareholder value over the long term. 
With that, we are ready to take your questions, and I'll turn the call over to the moderator."

In fact, we kind of early see double-digit declines in U.S. ICDs for any company in any quarter. And so, Mike, I was wondering if you can give us your views on what's going on? Is this simply share loss because you're off cycle? Or how confident are you that there aren't other issues at stake here in terms of sales force turnover or contracting prowess from some of your larger competitors? And then also I want to see if the timing on MRI safe ICD in the U.S. slipped a little bit relative to the guidance that you just gave?"

The vast majority of the CRM low-voltage issues are really around this product gap. We began to really feel the pressure in Q3. And the other point you made I think is also relevant, and that is around the idea that it puts us in a negative position as it relates to contracting. A couple of points on the contracting side. It is the premium to your product. There is a price premium associated with that product. So not only do we not get to participate in that tier where we have the added impact of negative gross margin in a very high gross margin product lines. So there's some other issues coming into play here with CRM. The road to recovery, I think, is on track with the FDA in the first half, and we're going to remain with that guidance that we expect to have a low-voltage -- the low-voltage MRI safe product in the first half. Along with that, we now have a level of confidence that we're going to receive the high-voltage MRI product in Japan in the first quarter. So we've been able to tighten up those timelines in Japan. So the road to recovery is going to really require several different points. Of course, filling the product gap is primary and we're working on that and we have plans on how we want to execute in that area. The sales force is stable. We've not had a turnover outside of our normal ranges. And we think the product gap has just built up over time and hit an inflection point where we really felt the impact. When we look at the product cadence, and we'll share that with you on the fifth in New York, we think that MPP will be a catalyst. In the international market, we think that the opportunity for us to update and bring our next-generation of an implantable cardiac monitoring system will do 2 things. One, it will be a boost to the sales force and our marketing strategy in Europe and, at the same time, give us the experience and put us in a good position to have a fast launch in first-half 2017 with that product line. So it's a combination of approvals. It's a combination of new technologies. It's, again, strengthening our position in the contracting environment. The final point that I'd make about contracting and the opportunity that will present itself is the AF portfolio and the cadence of AF products. You know that's the same point, same channel.

As you know, we got off to a quick start last year. And about midyear we had a negative determination at first coast, which then spiraled into several articles, resulting in a beginning a process to make a determination. All of that has caused a lot of unrest in the customer base on 2 levels, and it really is around the fee reimbursement. The physician feedback and patient outcomes have been outstanding. And the performance of the product, actually, in the field is better than what we had expected and better than we had seen in the CHAMPION trial. So the product line itself is on track. The business dynamics and the market dynamics, and this is also feedback directly from our customers, this is the product that they've been looking for in trying to get at not only the expense but the quality of life issues on managing this disease. So we think CardioMEMS is an important clinical advancement and will in fact change the way heart failure is managed. The process that we're going through is, first, we continue to work with the local MACs. We're making sure that they have all of the most current data. The latest data from Lancet was very encouraging from a real-world perspective, 31 months of follow-up with a 48% reduction in hospitalization. This is significant data and again bringing the real world perspective into play. At the same time, we've had ongoing discussions with CMS. And so the strategy is really to make sure that our customer base is informed, make sure the local MACs are informed and up-to-date with the latest data, and that we are going through the process, which we will update on February 5 with CMS, to apply for national coverage to make sure that we can begin to plan and begin to work with heart failure centers around the country in getting their programs up and going without a concern that they would make both the time and cost commitment to find out that they could end up in a negative reimbursement situation. So we have short-term strategy. Again, education of the heart failure community and the MACs as well as the work we're doing with CMS. We think the timeline for these things will be first quarter working its way with the submission will take anywhere from 9 to 12 months with CMS."

With the level of experience you have and the background in looking at product pipelines and time-to-market, I think you would be able to make an assessment of exactly how well we are or are not doing in the product development area and our ability to bring innovation into the space. The idea of being able to focus specifically in certain areas and make sure that we are investing in the areas that matter most versus those areas that are most important for each individual product division is an advantage. The -- so I think agility, I think ability to rapidly move assets to course correct, and you'll see some of that. We have not disclosed all of the things that we're working on, and we will give you a better view on the fifth on our ability to do that. As it relates to the selling organizations, I think that we, in fact, when you look at our sales channel and you look at the point of sale and/or the point of service, it's more of a focused product line approach and -- or for lack of a better term, a more traditional selling process. Where the opportunity presents itself is several levels up where in a consolidated way we can sit down with different buying groups, whether they be IDNs or national systems, and speak to them about the entire St. Jude Medical portfolio. And there's a leverage point that gets created there. But -- so that understanding how the structure actually works in the real world is important. So the idea of are we managing R&D effectively, are we getting products into the market that are relevant and important, can we be agile and -- about making high-level decisions, I'd use Thoratec as another example, where we were able to put that deal together very rapidly and get it done because of our structure really facilitating rapid decision-making. So on the fifth, it'll be interesting to have a discussion maybe post meeting and see what your feelings are about what our product cadence looks like. But from a sales channel and distribution standpoint, we are probably more traditional than you might think."

So it's a fairly robust study in terms of -- as you compare it to other postapproval studies. But we are also in the process of looking at additional studies using CardioMEMS. As Mike mentioned and to your point, because of the analysis, one of the things that has happened over the last quarter in addition to the publication of the Lancet data, which showed very good durability long term and great components by both patients and physicians in driving that 48% reduction in heart failure hospitalization over a period of time that averaged 31 [ph] months [ph] also the presentation at AHA of the BDHF trial which was looking at basically taking best practices from every other thing that people could think to do in trying to keep patients out of the hospital and from being able readmitted. So that study, just as a reminder, enrolled over 1,400 patients, and they were patients who were being treated for decapitated heart failure episodes. And the patients were randomized to either get usual care or again kind of using all strategies that people have tried to use in the past, which included pre-discharge heart failure education, regularly scheduled coaching telephone calls from registered nurses as well as remote monitoring of weight and blood pressure and heart rate and tracking of symptoms. And after doing all of that and performing this study at all of the expert academic heart failure centers in California, they found no difference in heart failure readmission rates at 6 months, no difference in the 30-day readmission rates and no difference in mortality at 6 months. So you have now the long-term data coming out of CHAMPION showing great real-world results. And then now another large study looking at alternative therapies. And really, what I'd say is best practice in California at the academic heart failure centers, which is really the folks that were also providing the inputs to the analysis. Although they didn't have the opportunity to really consider those results at the time of their report. But again, you just see all the big tries and big misses in everything to try to keep patients out of the hospital, and the only thing that's been shown to be effective is CardioMEMS."

So the contracting cycles are constantly open and closing, and RFPs are constantly being changed in format. A lot of that due to consolidation in the market as well as new products coming into the space like leadless pacing. The opportunity for us is on any RFPs that are in cycle we'll be able to now bid at that premium level. And those that are not in bid, if we are on contract, we will typically have to go through a process before approval. But if we are on the contract, we'll be able to come into the space. So it's going to be a mixed bag as we work our way through '16. But the cycles are typically, to a large extent, have run through a 12-month cycle. We'll have some of the larger accounts open off cycle again if there are technologies that come into play. And the technology that I think will give us an opportunity is going to be leadless technology as we begin to look at market timing in the U.S. We have a peg right now as first half of '17, but we'll see how exactly things were allowed with the FDA."

So the launch and in the interest of time, it's a significant launch with what I would call our renewed platform coming into the market. So we'll be in the market with a combination of impedance and magnetics with the first sensor-enabled catheters. We just literally have done our first cases in Europe this week. The outcomes were excellent. The physician feedback is incredibly positive. And the important thing about putting a new hardware, new software and new tools in the hands of the EP is the opportunity to build off that platform. So our expectation is that we will return to share capture. Your point of the comps and anniversary-ing TactiCath and Flex is on point. And we think as we roll out these products, we will gather momentum in the EP community. It's -- again, it's not a single product line. It is a platform technology that literally changes the way that we can map and manage AF cases. So there's a lot of opportunity here on the clinical side, lot of opportunity on the tool development side to really have an impact in patient therapy. So we'll have a very comprehensive overview on the fifth. And I think that at that time, you'll be able to model how our AF business will unfold."

When listening to today's call, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on a comparable constant currency basis, which includes Thoratec sales in both comparable years and is adjusted for the impact of currency. 
Please also note, the comparable constant currency sales growth rates in the fourth quarter of 2015 do not include the impact of an extra selling week in the comparable quarter in 2014 resulting from our 52/53-week fiscal year convention. This convention, which has been referenced on previous calls, resulted in 5 fewer selling days in the fourth quarter of 2015 versus the fourth quarter of 2014 and 3 fewer selling days on a year-over-year comparison of full year results. We estimate this variance in selling days decreased our 2015 fourth quarter sales growth rate by 5 to 6 percentage points. For the full year 2015, we estimate this negatively impacted our year-over-year sales growth by approximately 100 basis points. 
Consolidated sales for the fourth quarter totaled $1,447,000,000, a 1% decline from the fourth quarter of last year. Fourth quarter sales included $136 million of Thoratec sales, which was above the guidance range we provided of $125 million to $130 million. Unfavorable foreign currency translations decreased this quarter sales by approximately $91 million. 
For the full year 2015, consolidated sales were $5,541,000,000, up 4% from last year. Unfavorable foreign currency translations decreased 2015 net sales by approximately $413 million. 
During the fourth quarter, we recognized $195 million or $0.69 per share in after-tax charges and amortization expense. For further information regarding these items, please refer to details provided in our press release. Comments during this call referencing fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, including earnings per share or EPS amounts, will be exclusive of these items. 
During the fourth quarter of 2015, the federal research and development tax credit was permanently extended, including 2015, on a retroactive basis. As a result, during the fourth quarter, we recorded a $16 million benefit to income tax expense, which increased EPS by $0.06, representing a cumulative catch-up adjustment of this credit for the first 9 months of 2015. Comments during this call referencing fourth quarter 2015 EPS would be exclusive of this item. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.02 for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to adjusted EPS of $1.08 in the fourth quarter of 2014. We estimate that on a constant currency basis, fourth quarter EPS increased 11%. For the full year 2015, adjusted EPS was $3.94 compared to adjusted EPS of $4.17 for the full year 2014. We estimate that on a constant currency basis, full year adjusted EPS increased 11%. 
Before we discuss our financial results for 2015 and offer our sales and earnings guidance for 2016, let me comment on foreign currency. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2015, we used exchange rates which assumed that each euro would translate into about $1.10 to $1.15 and each JPY 118 to JPY 123 would translate into USD 1. For the fourth quarter, the actual average exchange rate for the yen was consistent with these assumptions, while the euro was slightly unfavorable. In addition, certain unhedged currencies were unfavorable to our expectations. As a result, the impact of currency was approximately $11 million or $0.02 of EPS, unfavorable to the midpoint of the guidance we provided last quarter. 
In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2016, we're assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.05 to $1.10 and for the yen, each JPY 115 to JPY 120 would translate into USD 1. Using these exchange rate assumptions, we estimate that foreign currency translations will reduce total reported sales for 2016 by approximately $120 million to $140 million versus 2015, including approximately $45 million to $55 million in the first quarter.
Now for the discussion of sales by product category. For the fourth quarter, total Cardiac Rhythm Management, or CRM, sales were $580 million, a 10% decline from last year's fourth quarter, including $40 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. Sales results were driven by weakness in the U.S., which declined due to MRI product gaps in both our low-voltage and ICD product segments. 
For the fourth quarter, ICD sales were $358 million, an 11% decline from last year's fourth quarter. U.S. ICD sales were $209 million. International ICD sales were $149 million, including $22 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations.
For low-voltage devices, sales for the fourth quarter totaled $222 million, a 7% decline from last year's fourth quarter. In the United States, pacemaker sales were $85 million. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $137 million, including $18 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. Our strong international growth was driven by our competitive pacer portfolio in Europe and Japan, with continued adoption of our Assurity MRI-safe pacemaker. As a reminder, we launched this product line in Japan during the third quarter of 2015. 
Atrial Fibrillation, or AF, product sales for the fourth quarter totaled $276 million, up 4%, including $18 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. Although there was a difficult comparison this quarter given last year's U.S. TactiCath launch, our worldwide AF business continued to demonstrate strong growth driven by continued adoption of our FlexAbility and TactiCath ablation catheters. Due to the successful launch of these products in 2015, we estimate we gained more than 4 points of share in the U.S. ablation catheter market. In addition, we experienced an increase in sales of our other AF products, demonstrating pull-through from ablation catheter sales.
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $327 million, a 2% increase from last year's fourth quarter, including $27 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. International sales, up 6%, were driven by the first full quarter launch of all 4 sizes in our Portico family of transcatheter valves. We also continued to see strong growth in our FFR, OCT and LAA products. In the U.S., sales were driven by growth in CardioMEMS on a year-over-year basis, partially offset by weakness in traditional heart valves. For modeling purposes only, we expect full year 2016 CardioMEMS sales to be approximately $65 million, which is simply the annualized run rate of our fourth quarter 2015 sales number. Given the uncertainty around upcoming reimbursement decisions, we expect to update this estimate on our April earnings call.
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $128 million, up 9%, as we continue to take share on a global basis with the most comprehensive neuromodulation portfolio on the market, allowing us to treat chronic pain patients through the pain continuum. In the U.S., we saw a continued strong adoption of our upgradable Protégé MRI platform. Our international spinal cord stimulation business grew over 20% during the quarter, highlighted by approximately 70% growth in Australia. 
The geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical sales in the fourth quarter of 2015 is detailed in our press release. In total, 51% of St. Jude Medical's sales in the fourth quarter came from the U.S., while 49% came from international markets. 
I would now like to provide comparable constant currency revenue guidance for 2016. We expect full year 2016 comparable constant currency sales growth to be in the range of 2% to 4%. We expect first quarter comparable constant currency sales growth to be flat to slightly up. 
On January 13, we issued an 8-K announcing our new revenue reporting structure. Beginning in April, we will report our revenue product categories in the 5 following areas of focus: atrial fibrillation, heart failure, neuromodulation, traditional CRM and cardiovascular. 
The gross profit margin during the fourth quarter was 68.9%, down 220 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily due to a decline of 170 basis points related to the negative impact of currency. This currency impact included certain currencies in markets where we do not have hedging contracts. Additionally, there was a 50 basis point decline related to the continued weakness in our higher-margin U.S. CRM business. For the full year 2015, the gross profit margin was 69.9%, down 180 basis points from 2014, primarily due to 130 basis point impact from currency. For the full year 2016, we expect gross profit margin to be in the range of 69.0% to 69.5%. This expectation includes continued weakness in our U.S. CRM business, a 60 basis point improvement related to the suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax and a 50 to 70 basis point decline driven by the negative currency environment. 
Our fourth quarter SG&A expenses were 30.3% of net sales, an 80 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year 2015, SG&A expenses were 31.9% of net sales. For the full year 2016, we expect this ratio to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.0%. 
Research and development expenses in the fourth quarter and full year 2015 were 12.2% of net sales. For the full year 2016, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of net sales to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.0% as we invest in programs that support our innovation strategy. 
Other expense was $32 million in the fourth quarter and $88 million for the full year 2015. For the full year 2016, we expect other expense of approximately $150 million to $160 million, primarily driven by interest expense on our outstanding debt. 
For the full year 2015, our effective income tax rate was 16.6%. For 2016, we expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of 2015, we had $667 million in cash and cash equivalents and $6.4 billion in total debt. During the fourth quarter, we repaid approximately $700 million of outstanding debt. There were no borrowings outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility available with a group of banks. 
Next, I want to offer some comments regarding our EPS outlook for the first quarter and full year 2016. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the first quarter of 2016, the weighted average outstanding shares used in our diluted EPS calculation will be about 286 million to 288 million shares and the weighted average outstanding shares for the full year 2016 will be about 288 million to 290 million shares. 
For the full year 2016, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $3.95 to $4.05. This expectation includes the impact from negative currency translations, which we estimate, based on our current exchange rate assumptions, will reduce our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.25. On a constant currency basis, this represents adjusted EPS growth of $0.26 to $0.36. To help reconcile the components of this growth, please note the following: EPS accretion related to the Thoratec acquisition in 2016 is expected to be approximately $0.20, of which we plan to reinvest 50%. The temporary repeal of the Medical Device Excise Tax has a $0.07 benefit to our EPS, which we also plan to reinvest in the business. The remaining $0.16 to $0.26 of EPS accretion represents 4% to 7% constant currency growth. The company expects adjusted EPS for the first quarter of 2016 to be in the range of $0.87 to $0.89, which represents constant currency growth of 5% to 8%. 
I will now turn the call over to Mike."

Over the past few months, I've had the opportunity to talk with many of yo",2166,"Thanks, Don. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. As most of you are aware, this is my first earnings call as St. Jude Medical's President and Chief Executive Officer. Over the past few months, I've had the opportunity to talk with many of you. And the main question I get is, ""What can we expect under your leadership?"" So I wanted to start there. 
First, we have a solid strategy in place. We are leading the market in our strategy to surround the patient care continuum in AF, heart failure and neuromodulation. Within these areas, we're bringing to market innovative, relevant technologies that help our customers treat patients throughout key stages of care. We are positioning ourselves to be the partner of choice in these targeted disease state areas. That is our primary focus and long-term goal. 
Short term, we have some work to do to address current pressures in our business. This is my immediate focus, and something our cross-functional leadership team has their complete attention on as well. Cross-functional collaboration is Key. We are working to fully leverage our One St. Jude Medical structure to move quickly and address key challenges and opportunities globally and ensure we are executing on the basics: innovating in the right areas, getting new products to market and paving the path to get those products into the hands of our customers in a high quality, timely fashion. So innovation and execution is what really matters. Our people and culture are a top priority for me and our focus is on building an energized and accountable team that innovates and executes. 
We saw in our fourth quarter performance positive results, where we effectively launched new innovative products. Fourth quarter sales were over $1.4 billion, with strong growth in both AF and neuromodulation as well as in our recently acquired Thoratec mechanical circulatory support business. The Thoratec acquisition was the largest in our history, and we are pleased with both the integration efforts and the sales momentum to date. 
At the beginning of 2015, we said that our success would depend on performance in AF, neuromodulation and CardioMEMS. As we closed out the year, we achieved success in 2 of those 3 areas. We still have work to do to grow our CardioMEMS business. While it is on track from the perspective of patient care, physician demand and economic impact, the technology remains under pressure from a reimbursement standpoint. 
Going into 2015, we were well positioned to grow EPS faster than sales and we delivered this by growing adjusted EPS by 11% on a year-over-year basis with 2015 revenue growth of approximately 4% and above-market growth in key areas, including AF and neuromodulation. Our strong growth in AF, neuromodulation in our recently acquired Thoratec business was offset by underperformance in CRM which, along with currency headwinds, put pressure on gross margin. We focused on disciplined expense management and cost-saving initiatives to deliver operating leverage, and grew EPS quicker than sales. 
Building off of our experience in 2015, our plan for 2016 continues to leverage our core strengths, primarily in technologies to treat and manage AF, heart failure and neuromodulation. We continue to see attractive growth rates from our international business due to strong results from a number of new product launches, which we believe is a key leading indicator for future U.S. sales performance. 
I'd like to provide an overview of our business in these core areas. Starting with AF. This market is growing in the low teens and is underpenetrated, with approximately 2.5% of the diagnosed symptomatic AF patient population receiving ablation. Since growth in this area is largely driven by ablation procedures, St. Jude Medical is well positioned to be the provider of choice to our EP customers with the strongest and most comprehensive portfolio. Contact force technology is quickly moving to standard of care for RF ablation therapy, and we are uniquely positioned to benefit from this trend, given the strength of data supporting our TactiCath ablation catheter. In 2016, we expect to make important additions to our EP portfolio, including the EnSite Precision Cardiac Mapping System, with sensor-enabled catheters and advanced user interface. In 2016, we will have the most comprehensive launch of new products in our AF portfolio. This system was designed in collaboration with key opinion leaders from around the world, and the initial feedback received from the physicians and global thought leaders validates our confidence in this new mapping system. At our February 5 Analyst/Investor Meeting, we will also unveil plans for our next-generation insertable cardiac monitor, which we expect to be available in international markets in the second half of 2016. 
With our heart failure business, our new reporting structure includes CRT products, CardioMEMS and LVADs. We are developing technologies that position us as the global leader in heart failure management. We uniquely enable patient care from early symptoms to advanced heart failure, regardless of type.
CardioMEMS is the cornerstone of our heart failure program. We are the only company with an FDA-approved remote hemodynamic monitoring device, and we plan to continue to develop this new market and expand clinical evidence to drive adoption and reimbursement globally. 
We were encouraged by the early collaboration with CMS to establish a New Technology Add-On Payment and the Transitional APC Pass-Through Payment Status that help to determine payment for hospitals. 
I also want to highlight the November 2015 edition of The Lancet, which published a prospective longitudinal analysis that demonstrated the long-term effectiveness of the CardioMEMS heart failure system. This prospective data from the CHAMPION study showed that after a mean of 31 months of follow-up, heart failure patients managed with CardioMEMS had a 48% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations compared to patients managed with the current standard of care.
Despite the evidence that pulmonary artery pressure-guided heart failure management is superior to clinical assessment alone and the CMS-established New Technology Add-On and pass-through pathway payments, some of our customers are facing reimbursement challenges, which have slowed our growth. We have a comprehensive plan in place to address these challenges in 2016. We are continuing to work with national payers and regional MACs to educate them on the latest published data and real-world experience to ensure patient access to this important technology. And we are now in discussion with CMS to create a national coverage determination for implanted hemodynamic monitoring in order to establish clear coverage guidelines for CardioMEMS and increase access and coverage pathways for Medicare-eligible patients nationwide. We plan to update you on our progress during our Analyst and Investor Meeting on February 5. 
Our acquisition of Thoratec added the market leader in left ventricular assist devices, or LVADs, to our heart failure portfolio. We expect the LVAD market to grow mid-single digits in 2016, and we expect to continue taking share. We have been pleased with the results of our HeartMate 3 launch internationally and the HeartMate 3 U.S. IDE clinical study, MOMENTUM, is making good progress. A key priority for 2016 is to expand global market access to this technology. We also expect meaningful accretion from the Thoratec transaction in the first year, and plan to reinvest a portion of this accretion to drive sales growth.
We continue to be the leader in the CRT-D and CRT-P markets with our quadripolar pacing options. Our MultiPoint Pacing, or MPP, already differentiates our technology from competitors in markets where it's approved. We continue to expect this technology to be approved in the U.S. in the first half of 2016. Our growth in Europe during 2015 was supported by the continued adoption of MPP. We now offer the most comprehensive product portfolio to treat patients across their entire care continuum and to help hospitals manage this complex and expensive disease. 
Next, I'd like to discuss our traditional Cardiac Rhythm Management business, which now includes our core ICD devices and pacemakers. Although we will experience pressure in the CRM market in 2016, this business continues to generate significant revenue and cash flow. We expect the U.S to continue to be a challenging market for us in 2016 due to our temporary product gap with MRI-compatible devices. We anticipate FDA approval for our MRI-compatible pacemaker in the first half of 2016 and MRI-compatible ICD in the first half of 2017. We're also expecting approval of our MRI-compatible ICD in Japan during the first half of 2016. We have demonstrated successful share recovery in Europe and Japan, where we have been a late entrant into the MRI-compatible market, and expect a similar result in the U.S. In addition, our leadless pacing technology, Nanostim, is scheduled to be discussed at the FDA panel meeting on February 18.
We have transformed our neuromodulation business and are now positioned to establish St. Jude Medical as the global technology leader. We are the only company with a portfolio that has the ability to treat the continuum of care for chronic pain patients with radiofrequency ablation, St. Jude Medical's proprietary SCS burst waveform with upgradable capability and dorsal root ganglion, or DRG, therapy. The chronic pain market is almost $2 billion and is growing in the mid- to high single digits. We believe our differentiated technology will drive customer preference for a broader pain portfolio. Through 2 recent strategic acquisitions, compelling clinical data and a focus on innovative technologies to address key barriers to adoption, we are able to offer unique proprietary solutions and are changing the landscape of the chronic pain management market. 
We plan to focus on establishing DRG as the standard of care for targeted pain syndromes. DRG is currently available in Europe and Australia, and we expect U.S. approval in the first half of 2016. The recent 12-month follow-up data presented at NANS in December demonstrated DRG's sustained and superior pain relief and improved therapeutic targeting. We are working to contract with new customers in Europe and expand the market for this unique product offered only by St. Jude Medical. 
We also plan to establish St. Jude Medical's proprietary Burst therapy as the dominant spinal cord stimulation waveform to achieve superior pain relief across rechargeable and rechargeable-free devices. Recent SUNBURST trial results demonstrated a reduction or elimination of paresthesia in 91% of patients. That, coupled with our ability to upgrade implanted devices with new waveforms upon FDA and CE Mark approvals, is expected to drive market share. We think it is important to look at this market from the perspective of the share capture opportunity for advanced waveforms. 
In regards to the current worldwide revenue mix of tonic devices versus advanced waveforms, we see the market as approximately 90% tonic and 10% advanced waveforms. Given this, we see a tremendous opportunity to take share where our proprietary Burst Technology is available based on demonstrating superior pain relief and pain preference over tonic in the SUNBURST clinical trial and customer experience to date. 
Within neuromodulation, the DBS market is more than $500 million and it's expected to grow in the low double digits in 2016. We expect our Infinity DBS system with directional leads to take market share by partnering with key opinion leaders to generate clinical evidence and support its launch and market adoption, ultimately positioning directional lead technology as the future standard of care.
Let's now turn to cardiovascular. The structural heart market remains highly competitive, and our continued success in cardiovascular depends on our ability to execute on key programs across transcatheter, aortic valve replacement, surgical tissue valves and PCI optimization. The fourth quarter was the first quarter where we had all 4 sizes of the Portico valve available in Europe. Sales results in the fourth quarter were above our internal expectations, and physician feedback on the Portico valve was positive. Given these results and feedback, we believe the Portico valve can be a viable competitor in markets where approved. 
We are also working on a next-generation tissue heart valve that builds off of the success we have had with Trifecta. This will be another new product that we expect to discuss at the February Analyst and Investor Meeting. We also expect an FDA panel on PFO in the first half of 2016.
To summarize. We have an extensive pipeline with innovative and differentiating technologies. As Don mentioned earlier, our 2016 guidance calls for comparable constant currency growth of 2% to 4%, which we believe factors in growth opportunities in heart failure, atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation as well as the challenges in CRM and CardioMEMS that we have identified. Our 2016 EPS goal guidance demonstrates continued operating leverage while allowing us to sustain investments necessary to deliver top line results. I believe our overall strategy of surrounding AF, heart failure and neuromodulation is the right strategy. In 2016, we will continue to build a winning culture with a sharp focus on innovation and execution to grow our business and drive shareholder value over the long term. 
With that, we are ready to take your questions, and I'll turn the call over to the moderator."

As it's gotten a lot of discussion, the magnitude of the declines in the U.S. ICD business definitely surprised many. In fact, we kind of rarely see double-digit declines in U.S. ICDs for any company in any quarter. And so Mike, I was wondering if you could give us your views on -- what's going on? Is this simply share loss because you're off cycle? Or how confident are you that there aren't other issues at stake here in terms of sales force turnover or contracting prowess from some of your larger competitors? And then also I want to see if the timing on MRI-safe ICD in the U.S. slipped a little bit relative to the guidance that you just gave."

The vast majority of the CRM low-voltage issues are really around this product gap. We began to really feel the pressure in Q3. And the other point you made, I think, is also relevant, and that is around the idea that it put us in a negative position as it relates to contracting. A couple of points on the contracting side. It is the premium to your product. There is a price premium associated with that product. So not only do we not get to participate in that tier, we have the added impact of negative gross margin in a very high gross margin product line. So there's some other issues coming into play here with CRM. The road to recovery, I think, is on track with the FDA in the first half, and we're going to remain with that guidance that we expect to have a low-voltage -- the low-voltage, MRI-safe product in the first half. Along with that, we now have a level of confidence that we're going to receive the high-voltage MRI product in Japan in the first quarter. So we've been able to tighten up those time lines in Japan. So the road to recovery is going to really require several different points. Of course, filling the product gap is primary, and we're working on that. And we have plans on how we want to execute in that area. The sales force is stable. We've not had a turnover outside of our normal ranges. And we think the product gap has just built up over time and hit an inflection point where we really felt the impact. When we look at the product cadence, and we'll share that with you on the fifth in New York, we think that MPP will be a catalyst. In the international market, we think that the opportunity for us to update and bring our next-generation of an implantable cardiac monitoring system will do 2 things. One, it'll be a boost to the sales force and our marketing strategy in Europe and, at the same time, give us the experience and put us in a good position to have a fast launch in first half 2017 with that product line. So it's a combination of approvals. It's a combination of new technologies. It's, again, strengthening our position in the contracting environment. The final point that I'd make about contracting, and the opportunity that will present itself, is the AF portfolio and the cadence of AF products. You know that's the same goal point, same channel. The electrophysiology community is looking forward to the new AF products, and I'm sure we'll get into that, both here on the call as well as in New York where we will lay out that line and what our strategy is going through '16 and '17. But the overall impact for us in the market will be from a total EP perspective. And so when I look at and we plan around our recovery in CRM, it includes the entire EP portfolio."

As you know, we got off to a quick start last year. And about midyear we had a negative determination at First Coast, which then spiraled into several articles, resulting in Novitas beginning a process to make a determination. All of that has caused a lot of unrest in the customer base on 2 levels, and it really is around the fee reimbursement. The physician feedback and patient outcomes have been outstanding. And the performance of the product, actually, in the field, is better than what we had expected and better than we had seen in the CHAMPION trial. So the product line itself is on track. The business dynamics and the market dynamics -- and this is also feedback directly from our customers -- this is the product that they've been looking for in trying to get at not only the expense but the quality of life issues on managing this disease. So we think CardioMEMS is an important clinical advancement and will, in fact, change the way heart failure is managed. The process that we're going through is, first, we continue to work with the local MACs. We're making sure that they have all of the most current data. The latest data from Lancet was very encouraging from a real-world perspective, 31 months of follow-up with a 48% reduction in hospitalization. This is significant data and, again, bringing the real world perspective into play. At the same time, we've had ongoing discussions with CMS. And so the strategy is really to make sure that our customer base is informed, make sure the local MACs are informed and up-to-date with the latest data, and that we're going through the process, which we will update on February 5 with CMS, to apply for national coverage to make sure that we can begin to plan and begin to work with heart failure centers around the country in getting their programs up and going without a concern that they would make both the time and cost commitment to find out that they could end up in a negative reimbursement situation. So we have short-term strategy, again, education of the heart failure community and the MACs as well as the work that we're doing with CMS. We think the time line for these things will be first quarter, working its way with the submission, will take anywhere from 9 to 12 months with CMS."

And that's the -- the pending point is what has really created the headwind, as everybody waits to see what's going to happen relative to stocking orders. And there's a lot of work and time that gets consumed in putting your program up in place. And so there's a hole, if you will, in that area. And that would be Novitas, which is about 12 states. And then First Coast is mostly Florida. It leaps out of the state but, obviously, a significant state and place. And so the outcome of that is large populations, large heart failure centers and areas that we had focused in initially. And so our fastest-growing areas where we're in: Florida, Texas, up the East Coast and into New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and these have all been impacted. And so that's what we're seeing here, is really the largest, most populated areas are being affected most. And this is also where we had our largest footprint. And that's why we're so focused on continuing our efforts to make sure that we are getting the data in front of the right people and helping them make their decisions based on the clinical outcomes."

And then the last question is more of a structural question. There appear to be, across the industry, a number of examples where companies that have consolidated structures, particularly across product lines and previously distinct end markets, into similar organizations in order to cut costs, have resulted in decreased productivity, more R&D challenges. And the companies that have maintained decentralized structures across business units that have their own separate, independent R&D sales channels and so forth, end up flourishing. And so my question is, does St. Jude have the structure right with this push over the last several years to One St. Jude, where you consolidated CRM and neuro and you keep consolidating within cardiovascular? Is the structure right across the organization?"

I think probably the most appropriate way for you to make an assessment is as you come out of the February 5 meeting and you look at our product cadence across the key areas in which we're focused, with the level of experience you have and the background in looking at product pipelines and time-to-market, I think you would be able to make an assessment of exactly how well we are or are not doing in the product development area and our ability to bring innovation into the space. The idea of being able to focus specifically in certain areas and make sure that we are investing in the areas that matter most versus those areas that are most important for each individual product division is an advantage. The -- so I think agility, I think ability to rapidly move assets to course correct -- and you'll see some of that. We have not disclosed all of the things that we're working on, and we will give you a better view on the fifth on our ability to do that. As it relates to the selling organizations, I think that we, in fact, at -- when you look at our sales channel and you look at the point of sale and/or the point of service, it's more of a focused product line approach and -- or for lack of a better term, a more traditional selling process. Where the opportunity presents itself is several levels up where, in a consolidated way, we can sit down with different buying groups, whether they be IDNs or national systems, and speak to them about the entire St. Jude Medical portfolio. And there's a leverage point that gets created there. But -- so that the -- understanding how the structure actually works in the real world is important. So the idea of are we managing R&D effectively, are we getting products into the market that are relevant and important, can we be agile and -- about making high-level decisions -- I'd use Thoratec as another example, where we were able to put that deal together very rapidly and get it done because of our structure, really facilitating rapid decision making. So on the fifth, it'll be interesting to have a discussion maybe post meeting and see what your feelings are about what our product cadence looks like. But from a sales channel and distribution standpoint, we are probably more traditional than you might think."

We've heard that there may be single-center publications coming, there may be a collaboration between high-volume centers to capture real-world outcomes that are in the works.

As it's, actually, a bit unusual in terms of a postmarket study, in that it's not just focused on safety and it incorporates in real-world effectiveness data as well, looking at rates of hospitalizations, looking at patients as their own control. So it's a fairly robust study in terms of -- as you compare it to other postapproval studies. But we are also in the process of looking at additional studies using CardioMEMS. As Mike mentioned and, to your point, because of the ICER-CTAF analysis, one of the things that has happened in the last quarter, in addition to the publication of The Lancet data, which showed very good durability long term and great compliance by both patients and physicians in driving that 48% reduction in heart failure hospitalization over a period of time that averaged 31 months. There's also the presentation at AHA of the BEAT-HF trial, which was looking at basically taking best practices from every other thing that people could think to do in trying to keep patients out of the hospital and from being readmitted. So that study, just as a reminder, enrolled over 1,400 patients, and they were patients who were being treated for decompensated heart failure episodes. And the patients were randomized to either get usual care or, again, kind of using all strategies that people have tried to use in the past, which included pre-discharge heart failure education, regularly scheduled coaching telephone calls from registered nurses as well as remote monitoring of weight and blood pressure and heart rate and tracking of symptoms. And after doing all of that and performing this study at all of the expert academic heart failure centers in California, they found no difference in heart failure readmission rates at 6 months, no difference in the 30-day readmission rates and no difference in mortality at 6 months. So you have now the long-term data coming out of CHAMPION showing great real-world results. And then now another large study looking at alternative therapies. And really, what I'd say is best practice in California at the academic heart failure centers, which is really the folks that were also providing the inputs to the CTAF-ICER analysis, although they didn't have the opportunity to really consider those results at the time of their report. But again, you just see all the big tries and big misses in everything to try to keep patients out of the hospital, and the only thing that's been shown to be effective is CardioMEMS."

So our expectation is that we will return to share capture. Your point of the comps and anniversary-ing TactiCath and Flex is on point.

When listening to today's call, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on a comparable constant currency basis, which includes Thoratec sales in both comparable years and is adjusted for the impact of currency. 
Please also note, the comparable constant currency sales growth rates in the fourth quarter of 2015 do not include the impact of an extra selling week in the comparable quarter in 2014 resulting from our 52/53-week fiscal year convention. This convention, which has been referenced on previous calls, resulted in 5 fewer selling days in the fourth quarter of 2015 versus the fourth quarter of 2014 and 3 fewer selling days on a year-over-year comparison of full year results. We estimate this variance in selling days decreased our 2015 fourth quarter sales growth rate by 5 to 6 percentage points. For the full year 2015, we estimate this negatively impacted our year-over-year sales growth by approximately 100 basis points. 
Consolidated sales for the fourth quarter totaled $1,447,000,000, a 1% decline from the fourth quarter of last year. Fourth quarter sales included $136 million of Thoratec sales, which was above the guidance range we provided of $125 million to $130 million. Unfavorable foreign currency translations decreased this quarter's sales by approximately $91 million. 
For the full year 2015, consolidated sales were $5,541,000,000, up 4% from last year. Unfavorable foreign currency translations decreased 2015 net sales by approximately $413 million. 
During the fourth quarter, we recognized $195 million or $0.69 per share in after-tax charges and amortization expense. For further information regarding these items, please refer to details provided in our press release. Comments during this call referencing fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, including earnings per share or EPS amounts, will be exclusive of these items. 
During the fourth quarter of 2015, the federal research and development tax credit was permanently extended, including 2015, on a retroactive basis. As a result, during the fourth quarter, we recorded a $16 million benefit to income tax expense, which increased EPS by $0.06, representing a cumulative catch-up adjustment of this credit for the first 9 months of 2015. Comments during this call referencing fourth quarter 2015 EPS will be exclusive of this item. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.02 for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to adjusted EPS of $1.08 in the fourth quarter of 2014. We estimate that on a constant currency basis, fourth quarter EPS increased 11%. For the full year 2015, adjusted EPS was $3.94 compared to adjusted EPS of $4.17 for the full year 2014. We estimate that on a constant currency basis, full year adjusted EPS increased 11%. 
Before we discuss our financial results for 2015 and offer our sales and earnings guidance for 2016, let me comment on foreign currency. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2015, we used exchange rates which assumed that each euro would translate into about $1.10 to $1.15 and each JPY 118 to JPY 123 would translate into USD 1. For the fourth quarter, the actual average exchange rate for the yen was consistent with these assumptions, while the euro was slightly unfavorable. In addition, certain unhedged currencies were unfavorable to our expectations. As a result, the impact of currency was approximately $11 million or $0.02 of EPS, unfavorable to the midpoint of the guidance we provided last quarter. 
In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2016, we're assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.05 to $1.10 and for the yen, each JPY 115 to JPY 120 would translate into USD 1. Using these exchange rate assumptions, we estimate that foreign currency translations will reduce total reported sales for 2016 by approximately $120 million to $140 million versus 2015, including approximately $45 million to $55 million in the first quarter.
Now for the discussion of sales by product category. For the fourth quarter, total Cardiac Rhythm Management, or CRM, sales, were $580 million, a 10% decline from last year's fourth quarter, including $40 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. Sales results were driven by weakness in the U.S., which declined due to MRI product gaps in both our low-voltage and ICD product segments. 
For the fourth quarter, ICD sales were $358 million, an 11% decline from last year's fourth quarter. U.S. ICD sales were $209 million. International ICD sales were $149 million, including $22 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations.
For low-voltage devices, sales for the fourth quarter totaled $222 million, a 7% decline from last year's fourth quarter. In the United States, pacemaker sales were $85 million. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $137 million, including $18 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. Our strong international growth was driven by our competitive pacer portfolio in Europe and Japan, with continued adoption of our Assurity MRI-safe pacemaker. As a reminder, we launched this product line in Japan during the third quarter of 2015. 
Atrial Fibrillation, or AF, product sales for the fourth quarter totaled $276 million, up 4%, including $18 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. Although there was a difficult comparison this quarter given last year's U.S. TactiCath launch, our worldwide AF business continued to demonstrate strong growth driven by continued adoption of our FlexAbility and TactiCath ablation catheters. Due to the successful launch of these products in 2015, we estimate we gained more than 4 points of share in the U.S. ablation catheter market. In addition, we experienced an increase in sales of our other AF products, demonstrating pull-through from ablation catheter sales.
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $327 million, a 2% increase from last year's fourth quarter, including $27 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. International sales, up 6%, were driven by the first full quarter launch of all 4 sizes in our Portico family of transcatheter valves. We also continued to see strong growth in our FFR, OCT and LAA products. In the U.S., sales were driven by growth in CardioMEMS on a year-over-year basis, partially offset by weakness in traditional heart valves. For modeling purposes only, we expect full year 2016 CardioMEMS sales to be approximately $65 million, which is simply the annualized run rate of our fourth quarter 2015 sales number. Given the uncertainty around upcoming reimbursement decisions, we expect to update this estimate on our April earnings call.
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $128 million, up 9%, as we continue to take share on a global basis with the most comprehensive neuromodulation portfolio on the market, allowing us to treat chronic pain patients through the pain continuum. In the U.S., we saw a continued strong adoption of our upgradable Protégé MRI platform. Our international spinal cord stimulation business grew over 20% during the quarter, highlighted by approximately 70% growth in Australia. 
The geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical sales in the fourth quarter of 2015 is detailed in our press release. In total, 51% of St. Jude Medical's sales in the fourth quarter came from the U.S., while 49% came from international markets. 
I would now like to provide comparable constant currency revenue guidance for 2016. We expect full year 2016 comparable constant currency sales growth to be in the range of 2% to 4%. We expect first quarter comparable constant currency sales growth to be flat to slightly up. 
On January 13, we issued an 8-K announcing our new revenue reporting structure. Beginning in April, we will report our revenue product categories in the 5 following areas of focus: atrial fibrillation, heart failure, neuromodulation, traditional CRM and cardiovascular. 
The gross profit margin during the fourth quarter was 68.9%, down 220 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily due to a decline of 170 basis points related to the negative impact of currency. This currency impact included certain currencies in markets where we do not have hedging contracts. Additionally, there was a 50 basis point decline related to the continued weakness in our higher-margin U.S. CRM business. For the full year 2015, the gross profit margin was 69.9%, down 180 basis points from 2014, primarily due to 130 basis point impact from currency. For the full year 2016, we expect gross profit margin to be in the range of 69.0% to 69.5%. This expectation includes continued weakness in our U.S. CRM business, a 60 basis point improvement related to the suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax and a 50 to 70 basis point decline driven by the negative currency environment. 
Our fourth quarter SG&A expenses were 30.3% of net sales, an 80 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year 2015, SG&A expenses were 31.9% of net sales. For the full year 2016, we expect this ratio to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.0%. 
Research and development expenses in the fourth quarter and full year 2015 were 12.2% of net sales. For the full year 2016, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of net sales to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.0% as we invest in programs that support our innovation strategy. 
Other expense was $32 million in the fourth quarter and $88 million for the full year 2015. For the full year 2016, we expect Other expense of approximately $150 million to $160 million, primarily driven by interest expense on our outstanding debt. 
For the full year 2015, our effective income tax rate was 16.6%. For 2016, we expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of 2015, we had $667 million in cash and cash equivalents and $6.4 billion in total debt. During the fourth quarter, we repaid approximately $700 million of outstanding debt. There were no borrowings outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility available with a group of banks. 
Next, I want to offer some comments regarding our EPS outlook for the first quarter and full year 2016. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the first quarter of 2016, the weighted average outstanding shares used in our diluted EPS calculation will be about 286 million to 288 million shares and the weighted average outstanding shares for the full year 2016 will be about 288 million to 290 million shares. 
For the full year 2016, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $3.95 to $4.05. This expectation includes the impact from negative currency translations, which we estimate, based on our current exchange rate assumptions, will reduce our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.25. On a constant currency basis, this represents adjusted EPS growth of $0.26 to $0.36. To help reconcile the components of this growth, please note the following: EPS accretion related to the Thoratec acquisition in 2016 is expected to be approximately $0.20, of which we plan to reinvest 50%. The temporary repeal of the Medical Device Excise Tax has a $0.07 benefit to our EPS, which we also plan to reinvest in the business. The remaining $0.16 to $0.26 of EPS accretion represents 4% to 7% constant currency growth. The company expects adjusted EPS for the first quarter of 2016 to be in the range of $0.87 to $0.89, which represents constant currency growth of 5% to 8%. 
I will now turn the call over to Mike."
301667,312541051,921590,"St. Jude Medical Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","St. Jude Medical, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Don. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. As most of you are aware, this is my first earnings call as St. Jude Medical's President and Chief Executive Officer. Over the past few months, I've had the opportunity to talk with many of yo",2168,"Thanks, Don. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. As most of you are aware, this is my first earnings call as St. Jude Medical's President and Chief Executive Officer. Over the past few months, I've had the opportunity to talk with many of you. And the main question I get is, ""What can we expect under your leadership?"" So I wanted to start there. 
First, we have a solid strategy in place. We are leading the market in our strategy to surround the patient care continuum in AF, heart failure and neuromodulation. Within these areas, we're bringing to market innovative, relevant technologies that help our customers treat patients throughout key stages of care. We are positioning ourselves to be the partner of choice in these targeted disease state areas. That is our primary focus and long-term goal. 
Short term, we have some work to do to address current pressures in our business. This is my immediate focus, and something our cross-functional leadership team has their complete attention on as well. Cross-functional collaboration is key. We are working to fully leverage our One St. Jude Medical structure to move quickly and address key challenges and opportunities globally and ensure we are executing on the basics: innovating in the right areas, getting new products to market and paving the path to get those products into the hands of our customers in a high quality, timely fashion. So innovation and execution is what really matters. Our people and culture are a top priority for me and our focus is on building an energized and accountable team that innovates and executes. 
We saw in our fourth quarter performance positive results, where we effectively launched new innovative products. Fourth quarter sales were over $1.4 billion, with strong growth in both AF and neuromodulation as well as in our recently acquired Thoratec mechanical circulatory support business. The Thoratec acquisition was the largest in our history, and we are pleased with both the integration efforts and the sales momentum to date. 
At the beginning of 2015, we said that our success would depend on performance in AF, neuromodulation and CardioMEMS. As we closed out the year, we achieved success in 2 of those 3 areas. We still have work to do to grow our CardioMEMS business. While it is on track from the perspective of patient care, physician demand and economic impact, the technology remains under pressure from a reimbursement standpoint. 
Going into 2015, we were well positioned to grow EPS faster than sales and we delivered this by growing adjusted EPS by 11% on a year-over-year basis with 2015 revenue growth of approximately 4% and above-market growth in key areas, including AF and neuromodulation. Our strong growth in AF, neuromodulation and our recently acquired Thoratec business was offset by underperformance in CRM which, along with currency headwinds, put pressure on gross margin. We focused on disciplined expense management and cost-saving initiatives to deliver operating leverage, and grew EPS quicker than sales. 
Building off of our experience in 2015, our plan for 2016 continues to leverage our core strengths, primarily in technologies to treat and manage AF, heart failure and neuromodulation. We continue to see attractive growth rates from our international business due to strong results from a number of new product launches, which we believe is a key leading indicator for future U.S. sales performance. 
I'd like to provide an overview of our business in these core areas. Starting with AF. This market is growing in the low teens and is underpenetrated, with approximately 2.5% of the diagnosed symptomatic AF patient population receiving ablation. Since growth in this area is largely driven by ablation procedures, St. Jude Medical is well positioned to be the provider of choice to our EP customers with the strongest and most comprehensive portfolio. Contact force technology is quickly moving to standard of care for RF ablation therapy, and we are uniquely positioned to benefit from this trend, given the strength of data supporting our TactiCath ablation catheter. In 2016, we expect to make important additions to our EP portfolio, including the EnSite Precision Cardiac Mapping System, with sensor-enabled catheters and an advanced user interface. In 2016, we will have the most comprehensive launch of new products in our AF portfolio. This system was designed in collaboration with key opinion leaders from around the world, and the initial feedback received from the physicians and global thought leaders validates our confidence in this new mapping system. At our February 5 Analyst/Investor Meeting, we will also unveil plans for our next-generation insertable cardiac monitor, which we expect to be available in international markets in the second half of 2016. 
With our heart failure business, our new reporting structure includes CRT products, CardioMEMS and LVADs. We are developing technologies that position us as the global leader in heart failure management. We uniquely enable patient care from early symptoms to advanced heart failure, regardless of type.
CardioMEMS is the cornerstone of our heart failure program. We are the only company with an FDA-approved remote hemodynamic monitoring device, and we plan to continue to develop this new market and expand clinical evidence to drive adoption and reimbursement globally. 
We were encouraged by the early collaboration with CMS to establish a New Technology Add-On Payment and the Transitional APC Pass-Through Payment Status that helped to determine payment for hospitals. 
I also want to highlight the November 2015 edition of The Lancet, which published a prospective longitudinal analysis that demonstrated the long-term effectiveness of the CardioMEMS heart failure system. This prospective data from the CHAMPION study showed that after a mean of 31 months of follow-up, heart failure patients managed with CardioMEMS had a 48% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations compared to patients managed with the current standard of care.
Despite the evidence that pulmonary artery pressure-guided heart failure management is superior to clinical assessment alone and the CMS-established New Technology Add-On and pass-through pathway payments, some of our customers are facing reimbursement challenges, which have slowed our growth. We have a comprehensive plan in place to address these challenges in 2016. We are continuing to work with national payers and regional MACs to educate them on the latest published data and real-world experience to ensure patient access to this important technology. And we are now in discussion with CMS to create a national coverage determination for implanted hemodynamic monitoring in order to establish clear coverage guidelines for CardioMEMS and increase access and coverage pathways for Medicare-eligible patients nationwide. We plan to update you on our progress during our Analyst and Investor Meeting on February 5. 
Our acquisition of Thoratec added the market leader in left ventricular assist devices, or LVADs, to our heart failure portfolio. We expect the LVAD market to grow mid-single digits in 2016, and we expect to continue taking share. We have been pleased with the results of our HeartMate 3 launch internationally and the HeartMate 3 U.S. IDE clinical study, MOMENTUM, is making good progress. A key priority for 2016 is to expand global market access to this technology. We also expect meaningful accretion from the Thoratec transaction in the first year, and plan to reinvest a portion of this accretion to drive sales growth.
We continue to be the leader in the CRT-D and CRT-P markets with our quadripolar pacing options. Our MultiPoint Pacing, or MPP, already differentiates our technology from competitors in markets where it is approved. We continue to expect this technology to be approved in the U.S. in the first half of 2016. Our growth in Europe during 2015 was supported by the continued adoption of MPP. We now offer the most comprehensive product portfolio to treat patients across their entire care continuum and to help hospitals manage this complex and expensive disease. 
Next, I'd like to discuss our traditional Cardiac Rhythm Management business, which now includes our core ICD devices and pacemakers. Although we will experience pressure in the CRM market in 2016, this business continues to generate significant revenue and cash flow. We expect the U.S to continue to be a challenging market for us in 2016 due to our temporary product gap with MRI-compatible devices. We anticipate FDA approval for our MRI-compatible pacemaker in the first half of 2016 and MRI-compatible ICD in the first half of 2017. We're also expecting approval of our MRI-compatible ICD in Japan during the first half of 2016. We have demonstrated successful share recovery in Europe and Japan, where we have been a late entrant into the MRI-compatible market, and expect a similar result in the U.S. In addition, our leadless pacing technology, Nanostim, is scheduled to be discussed at the FDA panel meeting on February 18.
We have transformed our neuromodulation business and are now positioned to establish St. Jude Medical as the global technology leader. We are the only company with a portfolio that has the ability to treat the continuum of care for chronic pain patients with radiofrequency ablation, St. Jude Medical's proprietary SCS burst waveform with upgradable capability and dorsal root ganglion, or DRG, therapy. The chronic pain market is almost $2 billion and is growing in the mid- to high single digits. We believe our differentiated technology will drive customer preference for a broader pain portfolio. Through 2 recent strategic acquisitions, compelling clinical data and a focus on innovative technologies to address key barriers to adoption, we are able to offer unique proprietary solutions and are changing the landscape of the chronic pain management market. 
We plan to focus on establishing DRG as the standard of care for targeted pain syndromes. DRG is currently available in Europe and Australia, and we expect U.S. approval in the first half of 2016. The recent 12-month follow-up data presented at NANS in December demonstrated DRG's sustained and superior pain relief and improved therapeutic targeting. We are working to contract with new customers in Europe and expand the market for this unique product offered only by St. Jude Medical. 
We also plan to establish St. Jude Medical's proprietary Burst therapy as the dominant spinal cord stimulation waveform to achieve superior pain relief across rechargeable and rechargeable-free devices. Recent SUNBURST trial results demonstrated a reduction or elimination of paresthesia in 91% of patients. That, coupled with our ability to upgrade implanted devices with new waveforms upon FDA and CE Mark approvals, is expected to drive market share. We think it is important to look at this market from the perspective of the share capture opportunity for advanced waveforms. 
In regards to the current worldwide revenue mix of tonic devices versus advanced waveforms, we see the market as approximately 90% tonic and 10% advanced waveforms. Given this, we see a tremendous opportunity to take share where our proprietary Burst Technology is available based on demonstrating superior pain relief and pain preference over tonic in the SUNBURST clinical trial and customer experience to date. 
Within neuromodulation, the DBS market is more than $500 million and it's expected to grow in the low double digits in 2016. We expect our Infinity DBS system with directional leads to take market share by partnering with key opinion leaders to generate clinical evidence and support its launch and market adoption, ultimately positioning directional lead technology as the future standard of care.
Let's now turn to cardiovascular. The structural heart market remains highly competitive, and our continued success in cardiovascular depends on our ability to execute on key programs across transcatheter, aortic valve replacement, surgical tissue valves and PCI optimization. The fourth quarter was the first quarter where we had all 4 sizes of the Portico valve available in Europe. Sales results in the fourth quarter were above our internal expectations, and physician feedback on the Portico valve was positive. Given these results and feedback, we believe the Portico valve can be a viable competitor in markets where approved. 
We are also working on a next-generation tissue heart valve that builds off of the success we have had with Trifecta. This will be another new product that we expect to discuss at the February Analyst and Investor Meeting. We also expect an FDA panel on PFO in the first half of 2016.
To summarize. We have an extensive pipeline with innovative and differentiating technologies. As Don mentioned earlier, our 2016 guidance calls for comparable constant currency growth of 2% to 4%, which we believe factors in growth opportunities in heart failure, atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation as well as the challenges in CRM and CardioMEMS that we have identified. Our 2016 EPS goal guidance demonstrates continued operating leverage while allowing us to sustain investments necessary to deliver top line results. I believe our overall strategy of surrounding AF, heart failure and neuromodulation is the right strategy. In 2016, we will continue to build a winning culture with a sharp focus on innovation and execution to grow our business and drive shareholder value over the long term. 
With that, we are ready to take your questions, and I'll turn the call over to the moderator."

As it's gotten a lot of discussion, the magnitude of the declines in the U.S. ICD business definitely surprised many. In fact, we kind of rarely see double-digit declines in U.S. ICDs for any company in any quarter. And so Mike, I was wondering if you could give us your views on what's going on? Is this simply share loss because you're off cycle? Or how confident are you that there aren't other issues at stake here in terms of sales force turnover or contracting problems from some of your larger competitors? And then also I want to see if the timing on MRI-safe ICD in the U.S. has slipped a little bit relative to the guidance that you just gave."

The vast majority of the CRM low-voltage issues are really around this product gap. We began to really feel the pressure in Q3. And the other point you made, I think, is also relevant, and that is around the idea that it put us in a negative position as it relates to contracting. A couple of points on the contracting side. It is the premium tier product. There is a price premium associated with that product. So not only do we not get to participate in that tier, we have the added impact of negative gross margin in a very high gross margin product line. So there's some other issues coming into play here with CRM. The road to recovery, I think, is on track with the FDA in the first half, and we're going to remain with that guidance that we expect to have a low-voltage -- the low-voltage, MRI-safe product in the first half. Along with that, we now have a level of confidence that we're going to receive the high-voltage MRI product in Japan in the first quarter. So we've been able to tighten up those time lines in Japan. So the road to recovery is going to really require several different points. Of course, filling the product gap is primary, and we're working on that. And we have plans on how we want to execute in that area. The sales force is stable. We've not had a turnover outside of our normal ranges. And we think the product gap has just built up over time and hit an inflection point where we really felt the impact. When we look at the product cadence, and we'll share that with you on the 5th in New York, we think that MPP will be a catalyst. In the international market, we think that the opportunity for us to update and bring our next-generation of an implantable cardiac monitoring system will do 2 things. One, it'll be a boost to the sales force and our marketing strategy in Europe and, at the same time, give us the experience and put us in a good position to have a fast launch in first half 2017 with that product line. So it's a combination of approvals. It's a combination of new technologies. It's, again, strengthening our position in the contracting environment. The final point that I'd make about contracting, and the opportunity that will present itself, is the AF portfolio and the cadence of AF products. You know that's the same goal point, same channel. The electrophysiology community is looking forward to the new AF products, and I'm sure we'll get into that, both here on the call as well as in New York where we will lay out that line and what our strategy is going through '16 and '17. But the overall impact for us in the market will be from a total EP perspective. And so when I look at and we plan around our recovery in CRM, it includes the entire EP portfolio."

As you know, we got off to a quick start last year. And about midyear we had a negative determination at First Coast, which then spiraled into several articles, resulting in Novitas beginning a process to make a determination. All of that has caused a lot of unrest in the customer base on 2 levels, and it really is around the fee reimbursement. The physician feedback and patient outcomes have been outstanding. And the performance of the product, actually, in the field, is better than we had expected and better than we had seen in the CHAMPION trial. So the product line itself is on track. The business dynamics and the market dynamics -- and this is also feedback directly from our customers -- this is the product that they've been looking for in trying to get at not only the expense but the quality of life issues of managing this disease. So we think CardioMEMS is an important clinical advancement and will, in fact, change the way heart failure is managed. The process that we're going through is, first, we continue to work with the local MACs. We're making sure that they have all of the most current data. The latest data from Lancet was very encouraging from a real-world perspective, 31 months of follow-up with a 48% reduction in hospitalization. This is significant data and, again, bringing the real world perspective into play. At the same time, we've had ongoing discussions with CMS. And so the strategy is really to make sure that our customer base is informed, make sure the local MACs are informed and up-to-date with the latest data, and that we're going through the process, which we will update on February 5 with CMS, to apply for national coverage to make sure that we can begin to plan and begin to work with heart failure centers around the country in getting their programs up and going without a concern that they would make both time and cost commitment to find out that they could end up in a negative reimbursement situation. So we have short-term strategy, again, education of the heart failure community and the MACs as well as the work that we're doing with CMS. We think the timeline for these things will be first quarter, working its way-- with the submission, will take anywhere from 9 to 12 months with CMS."

There appear to be, across the industry, a number of examples where companies that have consolidated structures, particularly across product lines and previously distinct end markets, into similar organizations in order to cut costs, have resulted in decreased productivity, more R&D challenges. And the companies that have maintained decentralized structures across business units and have their own separate, independent R&D sales channels and so forth, end up flourishing. And so my question is, does St. Jude have the structure right with this push over the last several years to one, St. Jude, where you consolidated CRM and neuro and you keep consolidating within cardiovascular? Is the structure right across the organization?"

I think probably the most appropriate way for you to make an assessment is as you come out of the February 5 meeting and you look at our product cadence across the key areas in which we're focused, with the level of experience you have and the background in looking at product pipelines and time-to-market, I think you would be able to make an assessment of exactly how well we are or are not doing in the product development area and our ability to bring innovation into the space. The idea of being able to focus specifically in certain areas and make sure that we are investing in the areas that matter most versus those areas that are most important for each individual product division is an advantage. The -- so I think agility, I think ability to rapidly move assets to course correct -- and you'll see some of that. We have not disclosed all of the things that we're working on, and we will give you a better view on the 5th on our ability to do that. As it relates to the selling organizations, I think that we, in fact, at -- when you look at our sales channel and you look at the point of sale and/or the point of service, it's more of a focused product line approach and -- or for lack of a better term, a more traditional selling process. Where the opportunity presents itself is several levels up where, in a consolidated way, we can sit down with different buying groups, whether they be IDNs or national systems, and speak to them about the entire St. Jude Medical portfolio. And there's a leverage point that gets created there. But -- so that the -- understanding how the structure actually works in the real world is important. So the idea of are we managing R&D effectively, are we getting products into the market that are relevant and important, can we be agile and -- about making high-level decisions -- I'd use Thoratec as another example, where we were able to put that deal together very rapidly and get it done because of our structure, really facilitating rapid decision making. So on the 5th, it'll be interesting to have a discussion maybe post meeting and see what your feelings are about what our product cadence looks like. But from a sales channel and distribution standpoint, we are probably more traditional than you might think."

As it's, actually, a bit unusual in terms of a postmarket study, in that it's not just focused on safety and it incorporates in real-world effectiveness data as well, looking at rates of hospitalizations, looking at patients as their own control. So it's a fairly robust study in terms of -- as you compare it to other postapproval studies. But we are also in the process of looking at additional studies using CardioMEMS. As Mike mentioned and to your point, because of the ICER-CTAF analysis, one of the things that has happened in the last quarter, in addition to the publication of The Lancet data, which showed very good durability long term and great compliance by both patients and physicians in driving that 48% reduction in heart failure hospitalization over a period of time that averaged 31 months. There's also the presentation at AHA of the BEAT-HF trial, which was looking at basically taking best practices from every other thing that people could think to do in trying to keep patients out of the hospital and from being readmitted. So that study, just as a reminder, enrolled over 1,400 patients, and they were patients who were being treated for decompensated heart failure episodes. And the patients were randomized to either get usual care or, again, kind of using all strategies that people have tried to use in the past, which included pre-discharge heart failure education, regularly scheduled coaching telephone calls from registered nurses as well as remote monitoring of weight and blood pressure and heart rate and tracking of symptoms. And after doing all of that and performing this study at all of the expert academic heart failure centers in California, they found no difference in heart failure readmission rates at 6 months, no difference in the 30-day readmission rates and no difference in mortality at 6 months. So you have now the long-term data coming out of CHAMPION showing great real-world results. And then now another large study looking at alternative therapies. And really, what I'd say is best practice in California at the academic heart failure centers, which is really the folks that were also providing the inputs to the CTAF-ICER analysis, although they didn't have the opportunity to really consider those results at the time of their report. But again, you just see all the big tries and big misses in everything to try to keep patients out of the hospital, and the only thing that's been shown to be effective is CardioMEMS."

When listening to today's call, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on a comparable constant currency basis, which includes Thoratec sales in both comparable years and is adjusted for the imp",1905,"Thank you, Mike. When listening to today's call, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on a comparable constant currency basis, which includes Thoratec sales in both comparable years and is adjusted for the impact of currency. 
Please also note, the comparable constant currency sales growth rates in the fourth quarter of 2015 do not include the impact of an extra selling week in the comparable quarter in 2014 resulting from our 52/53-week fiscal year convention. This convention, which has been referenced on previous calls, resulted in 5 fewer selling days in the fourth quarter of 2015 versus the fourth quarter of 2014 and 3 fewer selling days on a year-over-year comparison of full year results. We estimate this variance in selling days decreased our 2015 fourth quarter sales growth rate by 5 to 6 percentage points. For the full year 2015, we estimate this negatively impacted our year-over-year sales growth by approximately 100 basis points. 
Consolidated sales for the fourth quarter totaled $1,447,000,000, a 1% decline from the fourth quarter of last year. Fourth quarter sales included $136 million of Thoratec sales, which was above the guidance range we provided of $125 million to $130 million. Unfavorable foreign currency translations decreased this quarter's sales by approximately $91 million. 
For the full year 2015, consolidated sales were $5,541,000,000, up 4% from last year. Unfavorable foreign currency translations decreased 2015 net sales by approximately $413 million. 
During the fourth quarter, we recognized $195 million or $0.69 per share in after-tax charges and amortization expense. For further information regarding these items, please refer to details provided in our press release. Comments during this call referencing fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, including earnings per share or EPS amounts, will be exclusive of these items. 
During the fourth quarter of 2015, the federal research and development tax credit was permanently extended, including 2015, on a retroactive basis. As a result, during the fourth quarter, we recorded a $16 million benefit to income tax expense, which increased EPS by $0.06, representing a cumulative catch-up adjustment of this credit for the first 9 months of 2015. Comments during this call referencing fourth quarter 2015 EPS will be exclusive of this item. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.02 for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to adjusted EPS of $1.08 in the fourth quarter of 2014. We estimate that on a constant currency basis, fourth quarter EPS increased 11%. For the full year 2015, adjusted EPS was $3.94 compared to adjusted EPS of $4.17 for the full year 2014. We estimate that on a constant currency basis, full year adjusted EPS increased 11%. 
Before we discuss our financial results for 2015 and offer our sales and earnings guidance for 2016, let me comment on foreign currency. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2015, we used exchange rates which assumed that each euro would translate into about $1.10 to $1.15 and each JPY 118 to JPY 123 would translate into USD 1. For the fourth quarter, the actual average exchange rate for the yen was consistent with these assumptions, while the euro was slightly unfavorable. In addition, certain unhedged currencies were unfavorable to our expectations. As a result, the impact of currency was approximately $11 million or $0.02 of EPS, unfavorable to the midpoint of the guidance we provided last quarter. 
In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2016, we're assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.05 to $1.10 and for the yen, each JPY 115 to JPY 120 would translate into USD 1. Using these exchange rate assumptions, we estimate that foreign currency translations will reduce total reported sales for 2016 by approximately $120 million to $140 million versus 2015, including approximately $45 million to $55 million in the first quarter.
Now for the discussion of sales by product category. For the fourth quarter, total Cardiac Rhythm Management, or CRM, sales, were $580 million, a 10% decline from last year's fourth quarter, including $40 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. Sales results were driven by weakness in the U.S., which declined due to MRI product gaps in both our low-voltage and ICD product segments. 
For the fourth quarter, ICD sales were $358 million, an 11% decline from last year's fourth quarter. U.S. ICD sales were $209 million. International ICD sales were $149 million, including $22 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations.
For low-voltage devices, sales for the fourth quarter totaled $222 million, a 7% decline from last year's fourth quarter. In the United States, pacemaker sales were $85 million. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $137 million, including $18 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. Our strong international growth was driven by our competitive pacer portfolio in Europe and Japan, with continued adoption of our Assurity MRI-safe pacemaker. As a reminder, we launched this product line in Japan during the third quarter of 2015. 
Atrial Fibrillation, or AF, product sales for the fourth quarter totaled $276 million, up 4%, including $18 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. Although there was a difficult comparison this quarter given last year's U.S. TactiCath launch, our worldwide AF business continued to demonstrate strong growth driven by continued adoption of our FlexAbility and TactiCath ablation catheters. Due to the successful launch of these products in 2015, we estimate we gained more than 4 points of share in the U.S. ablation catheter market. In addition, we experienced an increase in sales of our other AF products, demonstrating pull-through from ablation catheter sales.
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $327 million, a 2% increase from last year's fourth quarter, including $27 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. International sales, up 6%, were driven by the first full quarter launch of all 4 sizes in our Portico family of transcatheter valves. We also continued to see strong growth in our FFR, OCT and LAA products. In the U.S., sales were driven by growth in CardioMEMS on a year-over-year basis, partially offset by weakness in traditional heart valves. For modeling purposes only, we expect full year 2016 CardioMEMS sales to be approximately $65 million, which is simply the annualized run rate of our fourth quarter 2015 sales number. Given the uncertainty around upcoming reimbursement decisions, we expect to update this estimate on our April earnings call.
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $128 million, up 9%, as we continue to take share on a global basis with the most comprehensive neuromodulation portfolio on the market, allowing us to treat chronic pain patients through the pain continuum. In the U.S., we saw a continued strong adoption of our upgradable Protégé MRI platform. Our international spinal cord stimulation business grew over 20% during the quarter, highlighted by approximately 70% growth in Australia. 
The geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical sales in the fourth quarter of 2015 is detailed in our press release. In total, 51% of St. Jude Medical's sales in the fourth quarter came from the U.S., while 49% came from international markets. 
I would now like to provide comparable constant currency revenue guidance for 2016. We expect full year 2016 comparable constant currency sales growth to be in the range of 2% to 4%. We expect first quarter comparable constant currency sales growth to be flat to slightly up. 
On January 13, we issued an 8-K announcing our new revenue reporting structure. Beginning in April, we will report our revenue product categories in the 5 following areas of focus: atrial fibrillation, heart failure, neuromodulation, traditional CRM and cardiovascular. 
The gross profit margin during the fourth quarter was 68.9%, down 220 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily due to a decline of 170 basis points related to the negative impact of currency. This currency impact included certain currencies in markets where we do not have hedging contracts. Additionally, there was a 50 basis point decline related to the continued weakness in our higher-margin U.S. CRM business. For the full year 2015, the gross profit margin was 69.9%, down 180 basis points from 2014, primarily due to 130 basis point impact from currency. For the full year 2016, we expect gross profit margin to be in the range of 69.0% to 69.5%. This expectation includes continued weakness in our U.S. CRM business, a 60 basis point improvement related to the suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax and a 50 to 70 basis point decline driven by the negative currency environment. 
Our fourth quarter SG&A expenses were 30.3% of net sales, an 80 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year 2015, SG&A expenses were 31.9% of net sales. For the full year 2016, we expect this ratio to be in the range of 31.5% to 32.0%. 
Research and development expenses in the fourth quarter and full year 2015 were 12.2% of net sales. For the full year 2016, we expect R&D expenses as a percentage of net sales to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.0% as we invest in programs that support our innovation strategy. 
Other expense was $32 million in the fourth quarter and $88 million for the full year 2015. For the full year 2016, we expect Other expense of approximately $150 million to $160 million, primarily driven by interest expense on our outstanding debt. 
For the full year 2015, our effective income tax rate was 16.6%. For 2016, we expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of 2015, we had $667 million in cash and cash equivalents and $6.4 billion in total debt. During the fourth quarter, we repaid approximately $700 million of outstanding debt. There were no borrowings outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility available with a group of banks. 
Next, I want to offer some comments regarding our EPS outlook for the first quarter and full year 2016. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the first quarter of 2016, the weighted average outstanding shares used in our diluted EPS calculation will be about 286 million to 288 million shares and the weighted average outstanding shares for the full year 2016 will be about 288 million to 290 million shares. 
For the full year 2016, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $3.95 to $4.05. This expectation includes the impact from negative currency translations, which we estimate, based on our current exchange rate assumptions, will reduce our adjusted EPS by approximately $0.25. On a constant currency basis, this represents adjusted EPS growth of $0.26 to $0.36. To help reconcile the components of this growth, please note the following: EPS accretion related to the Thoratec acquisition in 2016 is expected to be approximately $0.20, of which we plan to reinvest 50%. The temporary repeal of the Medical Device Excise Tax has a $0.07 benefit to our EPS, which we also plan to reinvest in the business. The remaining $0.16 to $0.26 of EPS accretion represents 4% to 7% constant currency growth. The company expects adjusted EPS for the first quarter of 2016 to be in the range of $0.87 to $0.89, which represents constant currency growth of 5% to 8%. 
I will now turn the call over to Mike."

Over the past few months, I've had the opportunity to talk with many of yo",2168,"Thanks, Don. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. As most of you are aware, this is my first earnings call as St. Jude Medical's President and Chief Executive Officer. Over the past few months, I've had the opportunity to talk with many of you. And the main question I get is, ""What can we expect under your leadership?"" So I wanted to start there. 
First, we have a solid strategy in place. We are leading the market in our strategy to surround the patient care continuum in AF, heart failure and neuromodulation. Within these areas, we're bringing to market innovative, relevant technologies that help our customers treat patients throughout key stages of care. We are positioning ourselves to be the partner of choice in these targeted disease state areas. That is our primary focus and long-term goal. 
Short term, we have some work to do to address current pressures in our business. This is my immediate focus, and something our cross-functional leadership team has their complete attention on as well. Cross-functional collaboration is key. We are working to fully leverage our One St. Jude Medical structure to move quickly and address key challenges and opportunities globally and ensure we are executing on the basics: innovating in the right areas, getting new products to market and paving the path to get those products into the hands of our customers in a high quality, timely fashion. So innovation and execution is what really matters. Our people and culture are a top priority for me and our focus is on building an energized and accountable team that innovates and executes. 
We saw in our fourth quarter performance positive results, where we effectively launched new innovative products. Fourth quarter sales were over $1.4 billion, with strong growth in both AF and neuromodulation as well as in our recently acquired Thoratec mechanical circulatory support business. The Thoratec acquisition was the largest in our history, and we are pleased with both the integration efforts and the sales momentum to date. 
At the beginning of 2015, we said that our success would depend on performance in AF, neuromodulation and CardioMEMS. As we closed out the year, we achieved success in 2 of those 3 areas. We still have work to do to grow our CardioMEMS business. While it is on track from the perspective of patient care, physician demand and economic impact, the technology remains under pressure from a reimbursement standpoint. 
Going into 2015, we were well positioned to grow EPS faster than sales and we delivered this by growing adjusted EPS by 11% on a year-over-year basis with 2015 revenue growth of approximately 4% and above-market growth in key areas, including AF and neuromodulation. Our strong growth in AF, neuromodulation in our recently acquired Thoratec business was offset by underperformance in CRM which, along with currency headwinds, put pressure on gross margin. We focused on disciplined expense management and cost-saving initiatives to deliver operating leverage, and grew EPS quicker than sales. 
Building off of our experience in 2015, our plan for 2016 continues to leverage our core strengths, primarily in technologies to treat and manage AF, heart failure and neuromodulation. We continue to see attractive growth rates from our international business due to strong results from a number of new product launches, which we believe is a key leading indicator for future U.S. sales performance. 
I'd like to provide an overview of our business in these core areas. Starting with AF. This market is growing in the low teens and is underpenetrated, with approximately 2.5% of the diagnosed symptomatic AF patient population receiving ablation. Since growth in this area is largely driven by ablation procedures, St. Jude Medical is well positioned to be the provider of choice to our EP customers with the strongest and most comprehensive portfolio. Contact force technology is quickly moving to standard of care for RF ablation therapy, and we are uniquely positioned to benefit from this trend, given the strength of data supporting our TactiCath ablation catheter. In 2016, we expect to make important additions to our EP portfolio, including the EnSite Precision Cardiac Mapping System, with sensor-enabled catheters and an advanced user interface. In 2016, we will have the most comprehensive launch of new products in our AF portfolio. This system was designed in collaboration with key opinion leaders from around the world, and the initial feedback received from the physicians and global thought leaders validates our confidence in this new mapping system. At our February 5 Analyst/Investor Meeting, we will also unveil plans for our next-generation insertable cardiac monitor, which we expect to be available in international markets in the second half of 2016. 
With our heart failure business, our new reporting structure includes CRT products, CardioMEMS and LVADs. We are developing technologies that position us as the global leader in heart failure management. We uniquely enable patient care from early symptoms to advanced heart failure, regardless of type.
CardioMEMS is the cornerstone of our heart failure program. We are the only company with an FDA-approved remote hemodynamic monitoring device, and we plan to continue to develop this new market and expand clinical evidence to drive adoption and reimbursement globally. 
We were encouraged by the early collaboration with CMS to establish a New Technology Add-On Payment and the Transitional APC Pass-Through Payment Status that helped to determine payment for hospitals. 
I also want to highlight the November 2015 edition of The Lancet, which published a prospective longitudinal analysis that demonstrated the long-term effectiveness of the CardioMEMS heart failure system. This prospective data from the CHAMPION study showed that after a mean of 31 months of follow-up, heart failure patients managed with CardioMEMS had a 48% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations compared to patients managed with the current standard of care.
Despite the evidence that pulmonary artery pressure-guided heart failure management is superior to clinical assessment alone and the CMS-established New Technology Add-On and pass-through pathway payments, some of our customers are facing reimbursement challenges, which have slowed our growth. We have a comprehensive plan in place to address these challenges in 2016. We are continuing to work with national payers and regional MACs to educate them on the latest published data and real-world experience to ensure patient access to this important technology. And we are now in discussion with CMS to create a national coverage determination for implanted hemodynamic monitoring in order to establish clear coverage guidelines for CardioMEMS and increase access and coverage pathways for Medicare-eligible patients nationwide. We plan to update you on our progress during our Analyst and Investor Meeting on February 5. 
Our acquisition of Thoratec added the market leader in left ventricular assist devices, or LVADs, to our heart failure portfolio. We expect the LVAD market to grow mid-single digits in 2016, and we expect to continue taking share. We have been pleased with the results of our HeartMate 3 launch internationally and the HeartMate 3 U.S. IDE clinical study, MOMENTUM, is making good progress. A key priority for 2016 is to expand global market access to this technology. We also expect meaningful accretion from the Thoratec transaction in the first year, and plan to reinvest a portion of this accretion to drive sales growth.
We continue to be the leader in the CRT-D and CRT-P markets with our quadripolar pacing options. Our MultiPoint Pacing, or MPP, already differentiates our technology from competitors in markets where it is approved. We continue to expect this technology to be approved in the U.S. in the first half of 2016. Our growth in Europe during 2015 was supported by the continued adoption of MPP. We now offer the most comprehensive product portfolio to treat patients across their entire care continuum and to help hospitals manage this complex and expensive disease. 
Next, I'd like to discuss our traditional Cardiac Rhythm Management business, which now includes our core ICD devices and pacemakers. Although we will experience pressure in the CRM market in 2016, this business continues to generate significant revenue and cash flow. We expect the U.S to continue to be a challenging market for us in 2016 due to our temporary product gap with MRI-compatible devices. We anticipate FDA approval for our MRI-compatible pacemaker in the first half of 2016 and MRI-compatible ICD in the first half of 2017. We're also expecting approval of our MRI-compatible ICD in Japan during the first half of 2016. We have demonstrated successful share recovery in Europe and Japan, where we have been a late entrant into the MRI-compatible market, and expect a similar result in the U.S. In addition, our leadless pacing technology, Nanostim, is scheduled to be discussed at the FDA panel meeting on February 18.
We have transformed our neuromodulation business and are now positioned to establish St. Jude Medical as the global technology leader. We are the only company with a portfolio that has the ability to treat the continuum of care for chronic pain patients with radiofrequency ablation, St. Jude Medical's proprietary SCS burst waveform with upgradable capability and dorsal root ganglion, or DRG, therapy. The chronic pain market is almost $2 billion and is growing in the mid- to high single digits. We believe our differentiated technology will drive customer preference for a broader pain portfolio. Through 2 recent strategic acquisitions, compelling clinical data and a focus on innovative technologies to address key barriers to adoption, we are able to offer unique proprietary solutions and are changing the landscape of the chronic pain management market. 
We plan to focus on establishing DRG as the standard of care for targeted pain syndromes. DRG is currently available in Europe and Australia, and we expect U.S. approval in the first half of 2016. The recent 12-month follow-up data presented at NANS in December demonstrated DRG's sustained and superior pain relief and improved therapeutic targeting. We are working to contract with new customers in Europe and expand the market for this unique product offered only by St. Jude Medical. 
We also plan to establish St. Jude Medical's proprietary Burst therapy as the dominant spinal cord stimulation waveform to achieve superior pain relief across rechargeable and rechargeable-free devices. Recent SUNBURST trial results demonstrated a reduction or elimination of paresthesia in 91% of patients. That, coupled with our ability to upgrade implanted devices with new waveforms upon FDA and CE Mark approvals, is expected to drive market share. We think it is important to look at this market from the perspective of the share capture opportunity for advanced waveforms. 
In regards to the current worldwide revenue mix of tonic devices versus advanced waveforms, we see the market as approximately 90% tonic and 10% advanced waveforms. Given this, we see a tremendous opportunity to take share where our proprietary Burst Technology is available based on demonstrating superior pain relief and pain preference over tonic in the SUNBURST clinical trial and customer experience to date. 
Within neuromodulation, the DBS market is more than $500 million and it's expected to grow in the low double digits in 2016. We expect our Infinity DBS system with directional leads to take market share by partnering with key opinion leaders to generate clinical evidence and support its launch and market adoption, ultimately positioning directional lead technology as the future standard of care.
Let's now turn to cardiovascular. The structural heart market remains highly competitive, and our continued success in cardiovascular depends on our ability to execute on key programs across transcatheter, aortic valve replacement, surgical tissue valves and PCI optimization. The fourth quarter was the first quarter where we had all 4 sizes of the Portico valve available in Europe. Sales results in the fourth quarter were above our internal expectations, and physician feedback on the Portico valve was positive. Given these results and feedback, we believe the Portico valve can be a viable competitor in markets where approved. 
We are also working on a next-generation tissue heart valve that builds off of the success we have had with Trifecta. This will be another new product that we expect to discuss at the February Analyst and Investor Meeting. We also expect an FDA panel on PFO in the first half of 2016.
To summarize. We have an extensive pipeline with innovative and differentiating technologies. As Don mentioned earlier, our 2016 guidance calls for comparable constant currency growth of 2% to 4%, which we believe factors in growth opportunities in heart failure, atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation as well as the challenges in CRM and CardioMEMS that we have identified. Our 2016 EPS goal guidance demonstrates continued operating leverage while allowing us to sustain investments necessary to deliver top line results. I believe our overall strategy of surrounding AF, heart failure and neuromodulation is the right strategy.

First question is on U.S. ICDs and the second question is on the Q1 guidance. First, on U.S. ICDs. As it's gotten a lot of discussion, the magnitude of the declines in the U.S. ICD business definitely surprised many. In fact, we kind of rarely see double-digit declines in U.S. ICDs for any company in any quarter. And so Mike, I was wondering if you could give us your views on what's going on? Is this simply share loss because you're off cycle? Or how confident are you that there aren't other issues at stake here in terms of sales force turnover or contracting prowess from some of your larger competitors? And then also I want to see if the timing on MRI-safe ICD in the U.S. has slipped a little bit relative to the guidance that you just gave."

The vast majority of the CRM low-voltage issues are really around this product gap. We began to really feel the pressure in Q3. And the other point you made, I think, is also relevant, and that is around the idea that it put us in a negative position as it relates to contracting. A couple of points on the contracting side. It is the premium tier product. There is a price premium associated with that product. So not only do we not get to participate in that tier, we have the added impact of negative gross margin in a very high gross margin product line. So there's some other issues coming into play here with CRM. The road to recovery, I think, is on track with the FDA in the first half, and we're going to remain with that guidance that we expect to have a low-voltage -- the low-voltage, MRI-safe product in the first half. Along with that, we now have a level of confidence that we're going to receive the high-voltage MRI product in Japan in the first quarter. So we've been able to tighten up those time lines in Japan. So the road to recovery is going to really require several different points. Of course, filling the product gap is primary, and we're working on that. And we have plans on how we want to execute in that area. The sales force is stable. We've not had a turnover outside of our normal ranges. And we think the product gap has just built up over time and hit an inflection point where we really felt the impact. When we look at the product cadence, and we'll share that with you on the 5th in New York, we think that MPP will be a catalyst. In the international market, we think that the opportunity for us to update and bring our next-generation of an implantable cardiac monitoring system will do 2 things. One, it'll be a boost to the sales force and our marketing strategy in Europe and, at the same time, give us the experience and put us in a good position to have a fast launch in first half 2017 with that product line. So it's a combination of approvals. It's a combination of new technologies. It's, again, strengthening our position in the contracting environment. The final point that I'd make about contracting, and the opportunity that will present itself, is the AF portfolio and the cadence of AF products. You know that's the same goal point, same channel. The electrophysiology community is looking forward to the new AF products, and I'm sure we'll get into that, both here on the call as well as in New York where we will lay out that line and what our strategy is going through '16 and '17. But the overall impact for us in the market will be from a total EP perspective. And so when I look at and we plan around our recovery in CRM, it includes the entire EP portfolio."

As you know, we got off to a quick start last year. And about midyear we had a negative determination at First Coast, which then spiraled into several articles, resulting in Novitas beginning a process to make a determination. All of that has caused a lot of unrest in the customer base on 2 levels, and it really is around the fee reimbursement. The physician feedback and patient outcomes have been outstanding. And the performance of the product, actually, in the field, is better than we had expected and better than we had seen in the CHAMPION trial. So the product line itself is on track. The business dynamics and the market dynamics -- and this is also feedback directly from our customers -- this is the product that they've been looking for in trying to get at not only the expense but the quality of life issues of managing this disease. So we think CardioMEMS is an important clinical advancement and will, in fact, change the way heart failure is managed. The process that we're going through is, first, we continue to work with the local MACs. We're making sure that they have all of the most current data. The latest data from Lancet was very encouraging from a real-world perspective, 31 months of follow-up with a 48% reduction in hospitalization. This is significant data and, again, bringing the real world perspective into play. At the same time, we've had ongoing discussions with CMS. And so the strategy is really to make sure that our customer base is informed, make sure the local MACs are informed and up-to-date with the latest data, and that we're going through the process, which we will update on February 5 with CMS, to apply for national coverage to make sure that we can begin to plan and begin to work with heart failure centers around the country in getting their programs up and going without a concern that they would make both time and cost commitment to find out that they could end up in a negative reimbursement situation. So we have short-term strategy, again, education of the heart failure community and the MACs as well as the work that we're doing with CMS. We think the timeline for these things will be first quarter, working its way-- with the submission, will take anywhere from 9 to 12 months with CMS."

I think probably the most appropriate way for you to make an assessment is as you come out of the February 5 meeting and you look at our product cadence across the key areas in which we're focused, with the level of experience you have and the background in looking at product pipelines and time-to-market, I think you would be able to make an assessment of exactly how well we are or are not doing in the product development area and our ability to bring innovation into the space. The idea of being able to focus specifically in certain areas and make sure that we are investing in the areas that matter most versus those areas that are most important for each individual product division is an advantage.

As it relates to the selling organizations, I think that we, in fact, at -- when you look at our sales channel and you look at the point of sale and/or the point of service, it's more of a focused product line approach and -- or for lack of a better term, a more traditional selling process. Where the opportunity presents itself is several levels up where, in a consolidated way, we can sit down with different buying groups, whether they be IDNs or national systems, and speak to them about the entire St. Jude Medical portfolio.

So the idea of are we managing R&D effectively, are we getting products into the market that are relevant and important, can we be agile and -- about making high-level decisions -- I'd use Thoratec as another example, where we were able to put that deal together very rapidly and get it done because of our structure, really facilitating rapid decision making. So on the 5th, it'll be interesting to have a discussion maybe post meeting and see what your feelings are about what our product cadence looks like. But from a sales channel and distribution standpoint, we are probably more traditional than you might think."

So I just was curious about the strategy to build out the body of clinical evidence. We've heard that there may be single-center publications coming, there may be a collaboration between high-volume centers to capture real-world outcomes that are in the works. But is St. Jude planning on sponsoring any other trials? Are you going to rely on the postapproval study? And when can we see early results for the postapproval study and not only to bolster reimbursement issues but also clinician adoption?"

We are focused on the postapproval study. As it's, actually, a bit unusual in terms of a postmarket study, in that it's not just focused on safety and it incorporates in real-world effectiveness data as well, looking at rates of hospitalizations, looking at patients as their own control. So it's a fairly robust study in terms of -- as you compare it to other postapproval studies. But we are also in the process of looking at additional studies using CardioMEMS. As Mike mentioned and to your point, because of the ICER-CTAF analysis, one of the things that has happened in the last quarter, in addition to the publication of The Lancet data, which showed very good durability long term and great compliance by both patients and physicians in driving that 48% reduction in heart failure hospitalization over a period of time that averaged 31 months. There's also the presentation at AHA of the BEAT-HF trial, which was looking at basically taking best practices from every other thing that people could think to do in trying to keep patients out of the hospital and from being readmitted. So that study, just as a reminder, enrolled over 1,400 patients, and they were patients who were being treated for decompensated heart failure episodes. And the patients were randomized to either get usual care or, again, kind of using all strategies that people have tried to use in the past, which included pre-discharge heart failure education, regularly scheduled coaching telephone calls from registered nurses as well as remote monitoring of weight and blood pressure and heart rate and tracking of symptoms. And after doing all of that and performing this study at all of the expert academic heart failure centers in California, they found no difference in heart failure readmission rates at 6 months, no difference in the 30-day readmission rates and no difference in mortality at 6 months. So you have now the long-term data coming out of CHAMPION showing great real-world results. And then now another large study looking at alternative therapies. And really, what I'd say is best practice in California at the academic heart failure centers, which is really the folks that were also providing the inputs to the CTAF-ICER analysis, although they didn't have the opportunity to really consider those results at the time of their report. But again, you just see all the big tries and big misses in everything to try to keep patients out of the hospital, and the only thing that's been shown to be effective is CardioMEMS."

The opportunity for us is, on any RFPs that are in cycle, we'll be able to now bid at that premium level. And those that are not in bid, if we are on contract, we will typically have to go through a process before approval. But if we're on the contract, we'll be able to come into the space. So it's going to be a mixed bag as we work our way through '16. But the cycles are typically, to a large extent, have run through a 12-month cycle. We'll have some of the larger accounts open off-cycle again, if there are technologies that come into play. And the technology that I think will give us an opportunity is going to be leadless technology as we begin to look at market timing in the U.S. We have it pegged right now as first half '17, but we'll see how exactly things roll out with the FDA."

So our expectation is that we will return to share capture. Your point of the comps and anniversary-ing TactiCath and Flex is on point.

Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our first quarter 2016 financial results as well as a schedule detailing reported and constant currency sales results by business area. This press release is available on the St.",1297,"Thank you, Mike. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our first quarter 2016 financial results as well as a schedule detailing reported and constant currency sales results by business area. This press release is available on the St. Jude Medical website. 
For participants on today's call, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on a comparable constant currency basis, which includes Thoratec sales in both comparable years and are adjusted for the impact of currency. 
Sales for the quarter totaled $1,448,000,000, up 2% from the first quarter of last year. Unfavorable foreign currency translations decreased this  quarter's sales by approximately $42 million. 
During the first quarter, we recognized $164 million or $0.57 per share in net after-tax special charges and amortization expense. For further information regarding these items, please refer to details provided in our press release. Comments during this call referencing first quarter results and guidance for 2016, including EPS amounts, will be exclusive of these items. 
Adjusted earnings per share were $0.90 for the first quarter of 2016 compared to adjusted EPS of $0.93 in the first quarter of 2015. We estimate that on a constant currency basis, first quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 9%.
Before we discuss our first quarter 2016 sales results by product category, with guidance for the second quarter and the remainder of 2016, let me provide a few comments about currency exchange rates. As discussed on prior calls, the 2 most significant currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2016, we used exchange rates which assume that each euro would translate into about $1.05 to $1.10 and for the yen each JPY 115 to JPY 120 would translate into USD 1. For the first quarter, the actual average exchange rates for the euro and the yen were consistent with these ranges. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the second quarter and the remainder of 2016, we are now assuming each euro will translate into about $1.11 to $1.16 and we now expect each JPY 106 to JPY 111 to translate into USD 1. Additionally, we have assumed that changes in various other currencies that impact our results. These changes and assumptions regarding currency exchange rates increased our total forecasted sales for the remainder of 2016 by approximately $85 million, and we now estimate that foreign currency translations will reduce our total reported sales for 2016 by approximately $35 million to $55 million versus 2015, including approximately $10 million to $15 million in the second quarter. 
I will now walk through first quarter results and our new product categories, Heart Failure, Atrial Fibrillation, Neuromodulation, Cardiovascular and traditional Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM. We issued an 8-K on January 13 detailing the products in these new categories as well as historical St. Jude Medical sales for each category. 
For the first quarter, total Heart Failure sales were $374 million, which grew 2% from last year's first quarter. Sales of HeartMate 3 during the quarter drove strong double-digit year-over-year growth of left ventricular assist devices, or LVADs, and we now assume the LVAD market is growing in the high single digits. We continue to expect full year 2016 CardioMEMS sales to be approximately $65 million. 
Atrial Fibrillation, or AF, product sales for the first quarter totaled $291 million, up 9%. Although there was a difficult comparison this quarter given last year's ablation catheter launches, our worldwide AF business continued to demonstrate strong growth. We expect to continue to take share in the AF market this year with the continued adoption of our ablation catheter portfolio and the worldwide launch of our EnSite precision mapping system. 
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the first quarter of 2016 were $116 million, up approximately 10% as we continue to take share on a global basis with the most comprehensive neuromodulation portfolio in the market. 
Total traditional CRM sales for the first quarter of 2016 were $366 million, down 7%. Sales results were largely driven by weakness in the U.S., which declined primarily due to MRI product gaps in both our low-voltage and ICD product segments. 
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the first quarter of 2016 were $301 million, up 3%. We expect sales in cardiovascular to accelerate as we expand our TAVR sales and launch our Trifecta GT tissue valve in the U.S. and European markets.
Turning to sales guidance. We continue to expect our full-year comparable constant currency sales growth rate for 2016 to be in the range of 2% to 4% and expect comparable constant currency sales growth in the second quarter to be in the range of 1% to 3%. 
The gross profit margin during the first quarter was 68.7%, down 210 basis points from the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to a decline of 150 basis points related to the negative impact of currency. Additionally, there was a 60 basis point decline related to the continued weakness in our margin -- in our higher-margin U.S. CRM business. 
Please note that our gross profit margin in the first quarter included the final $7 million of Medical Device Excise Tax cost amortized from inventory to cost of sales. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect gross profit margin to be in the range of 69.0% to 69.5%. This expectation includes continued weakness in our U.S. CRM business, a 60 basis point improvement related to the suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax and a 50 to 60 basis point decline driven by the negative currency environment. 
Our first quarter SG&A expenses were 31.6% of net sales, a 200 basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2015. For the full year 2016, we now expect this ratio to be in the range of 31.3% to 31.8%. 
Research and development expenses in the first quarter of 2016 were 13.0% of net sales. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect R&D expenses to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.0% of net sales.
Other expense was $41 million in the first quarter. For the full year 2016, we now expect other expense of approximately $155 million to $165 million, primarily driven by interest expense on our outstanding debt. 
For the first quarter, our effective income tax rate was 15.9%. For full year 2016, we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $325 million in cash and cash equivalents and $6.1 billion in total debt. During the first quarter, we repaid approximately $400 million of outstanding debt. There were no borrowings outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility available with a group of banks.
Next I want to offer some comments regarding our EPS outlook for the second quarter and the full year 2016. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the second quarter of 2016, the weighted average outstanding shares used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about 287 million to 288 million shares and the weighted average shares outstanding for the full year 2016 will be about 288 million to 290 million share. 
For the full year 2016, we now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.01 to $4.11. The adjustment this quarter to our annual EPS guidance of $0.06  primarily represents the impact of our favorable currency expectations for the remainder of the year. The company expects adjusted EPS for the second quarter of 2016 to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.07. 
I will now turn it back to Mike."

First quarter results reinforced our confidence that we are focused on the right priorities and are making progress against the objectives we discussed at our Annual Investor Meeting in February. As a reminder, we told investors that we would successfully execute against 4 key priorities to set the stage for accelerating growth in 2017. Those priorities are: Successfully launch key products to drive sales growth, establish U.S. reimbursement for CardioMEMS nationwide, successfully integrate our Thoratec acquisition and execute the plan for recovery U.S. CRM. 
Before addressing each of these items in my comments today, I would like to briefly highlight that year-to-date we have achieved a number of important milestones that support our objectives, including 10 regulatory approvals. Some of those approvals include our Axium DRG system MultiPoint Pacing and Quartet leads here in the U.S. In Japan, we received approval for our OPTIS mobile system, MRI-compatible Ellipse ICD and MRI conditional labeling on our Quadra Assura CRT-D device. In Europe, we received approval for MRI labeling for Nanostim. The launch and supporting these important product approvals are underway, and we are pleased with our progress so far. 
For the first quarter, sales grew 2%, which is at the high end of our guidance range. I am pleased with our ability to continue to drive adjusted EPS growth at approximately 9% constant currency, above the high end of our guidance range, while at the same time funding innovation to drive future growth.
Our international business grew approximately 4% in the quarter, driven by growth in left atrial appendage or LAA closure, LVADs, TAVR, Optical Coherence Tomography or OCT, the OPTIS mobile system with co-registration and the expansion of our quadripolar lead portfolio. We view the performance of our innovative products when launched internationally as a leading performance indicator for when these products are approved and launched in the U.S. In addition, our portfolio of commercially available products around the world continues to grow. 
I will now discuss our progress in our areas of focus. As many of you know, we have been working to expand our Heart Failure portfolio through recent acquisitions and internal innovation. Our teams are actively working with governments, payers, hospitals and physicians worldwide to expand market access to these proven technology solutions across the Heart Failure continuum. While our success with MPP and HeartMate 3 are driving growth, we continue to actively address challenges with reimbursement for our CardioMEMS heart failure system and, in late January, we applied for a national coverage determination from CMS. We expect formal acceptance of our submission in Q2 and anticipate this to be a 9- to 12-month process before we have a final decision.
Clinical evidence supporting strong effectiveness of the CardioMEMS heart failure system continues to grow, with more than 30 key publications and abstracts published to date. We are pleased that the Journal of the American College of Cardiology recently accepted for publication data that was presented at the 2015 HRS meeting. This retrospective analysis of the CHAMPION trial data shows monitoring pulmonary artery pressure is able to prompt therapeutic changes that improve heart failure management and, in turn, reduce hospitalizations. 
As importantly, we continue to see real-world commercial experience data that is as strong as or stronger than our initial CHAMPION data. For example, real world data recently presented at the American College of Cardiology Annual Meeting showed improved quality of life metrics and improvements in exercise capacity for patients monitored with our CardioMEMS device. We believe real world data, combined with a growing body of clinical evidence in support of CardioMEMS, continues to demonstrate the tremendous value this important technology offers for improving patient care and reducing overall cost. 
To increase our focus on expanding the market for CardioMEMS and LVADs, we have leveraged the legacy Thoratec sales structure to form a combined dedicated U.S. Heart Failure organization. Our first quarter sales give us confidence that we are on track to achieve our previously issued sales guidance of $65 million in 2016. 
We closed on our acquisition of Thoratec about 6 months ago, and our integration process is essentially complete. This important milestone is a full quarter ahead of our initial expectations. As Don mentioned, LVAD sales in the quarter were strong. Much of this success can be linked to our integration efforts that have included a strong focus on clinical and sales execution and the improved clinical experience that our customers have observed with HeartMate 3. Customers have also shared that they have enjoyed a seamless transition without disruption over the course of this integration process. Since its launch in October 2015, we have implanted HeartMate 3 in centers across 15 different countries internationally and are now implanting in all 4 of the largest heart failure centers in Germany, which make up approximately 20% of the European LVAD market. Access to these accounts can be attributed to the strong relationships that St. Jude Medical has cultivated over the years. There will be a number of presentations later this month at the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplant meeting supporting both HeartMate II and 3, including HeartMate 3 CE Mark 12-month data and real-world experience in the Kazakhstan study.
Turning to our CRT portfolio. We recently received FDA approval for our MultiPoint Pacing, or MPP, technology. For our Quadra CRT-D and CRT-P devices along with 2 complimentary Quartet left ventricular leads, further strengthening our differentiation in the treatment of heart failure. 
MPP is a first-to-market technology provided only by St. Jude Medical, which we believe will become the next standard of care in CRT therapy and builds upon our success as the leader in CRT therapy options. In addition to MPP, we intend on adding a feature to our CRT portfolio called [indiscernible] AV, which is in response to the growing importance of CRT optimization. We expect this technology to be available to customers in the U.S. during the second quarter of 2016.
Our European experience has shown that MPP can provide improved acute hemodynamic response as well as an improved chronic responded rate for CRT therapy. Recent data presented at ACC demonstrated optimization of LV pacing sites by means of hemodynamic and electrical delay plus MPP resulted in statistically significant improvements in New York Heart Association class heart failure Packer index and remodeling versus standard CRT therapy. We will present data at the upcoming Heart Rhythm Society Meeting in May, as we were recently informed that the results from our IDE trial have been accepted to be presented as a late-breaking clinical trial session. We also recently completed enrollment in our 1,800-patient MORE-CRT MPP Study, which will provide the largest data set regarding the ability of MPP to reduce the percentage of patients who are nonresponders to CRT. Other studies are also expected to be published in the near term that demonstrate MPP's effectiveness in improving the response to CRT at 1 year.
With MPP, we have continued to advance CRT therapy by delivering better outcomes for patients and physicians. We believe this is an important next-generation technology that differentiates St. Jude Medical and will allow us to grow our market share in this important segment as well as in CRT-P, where we are already the clear market leader.
Moving to our traditional CRM business. First quarter dynamics were similar to those experienced in the fourth quarter of 2015. While we continue to experience challenge in this business, particularly in the U.S., we continue to believe our competitive position will improve throughout the year.
In Japan, we launched our MRI safe ICD, which drove strong high-voltage performance in that geography, and we expect our pending launch of MPP to continue to strengthen our CRM business in Japan.
Turning to our U.S. high-voltage business. I would like to highlight that we are still on track to begin our global IDE trial for the MRI safe ICD with first implants in Europe later this month and remain on track for a U.S. launch during the first half of 2017. 
Earlier this quarter, Nanostim received its CE Mark for MRI compatibility. St. Jude Medical has long been at the forefront of leadless pacing technology. We look forward to bring Nanostim, the world's longest lasting leadless pacemaker with the industry's least invasive and smallest delivery system to the market to ensure broad patient access to this important therapy. We continue to work with FDA regarding our Nanostim leadless pacemaker and continue to expect FDA approval of Nanostim in the second half of 2016.
In the U.S., we remain in discussions with FDA regarding approval of our Assurity MRI pacemaker, which is the smallest and longest lasting device in the market. Based on these discussions, we now expect approval and launch of our Assurity MRI pacemakers in the second half of 2016. We think not having an MRI compatible pacemaker until the second half of 2016 will cost us approximately $15 million to $20 million in 2016 revenue. However, we are not changing our total sales guidance because we believe continued improvement in U.S. field execution and our strong expected product cadence and our broader electrophysiology business will offset that gap.
The CRM market remains an important area of our business, and it's a vital part of the care continuum for patients who suffer from a variety of cardiovascular diseases. I want to emphasize that we think about our traditional CRM products in context of the overall electrophysiology business because that is how our customers make purchasing decisions. Both our sales organization and our customers are excited about the strength of our entire electrophysiology pipeline that is expected yet this year.
For instance, while sales of our next-generation confirm insertable cardiac monitor, or ICM, will not be reported in our traditional CRM category, once approved, we believe this product will be a driver for our CRM business. As a reminder, we believe this Next Generation Confirm will be a disruptor in the market and a significant differentiator for St. Jude Medical. We anticipate this device will be the first commercially available Bluetooth-enabled and smartphone-capable ICM. We are on track to submit for U.S. and European regulatory approvals in the second half of 2016.
So while our traditional CRM business continues to be under pressure, particularly in the U.S., we are continuing to work on getting MRI compatible low-voltage approved in 2016 and high-voltage products to market in the first half of 2017. 
At the same time, we are continuing to grow other related segments of our business. In electrophysiology, this pipeline includes our Next Generation Confirm insertable cardiac monitor, MultiPoint Pacing, EnSite Precision, Nanostim and [indiscernible] AV product launches, which are all on track and will allow us to continue to contract competitively with hospitals, offset traditional CRM share loss and set the stage for traditional CRM share recapture in 2017.
Turning to our AF business, where our comprehensive product portfolio is again a key differentiator for St. Jude Medical. We saw a 9% growth in the quarter. We're excited about our AF position given the strong cadence of new launches and consistent double-digit growth across our TactiCath and FlexAbility ablation catheters. We expect to continue our successful limited launch of EnSite Precision in Europe and we'll initiate a full launch in Europe during the second quarter. In the U.S., we filed our regulatory submissions associated with EnSite Precision in the first quarter and expect to initiate a full launch of our new EnSite Precision system in the U.S. in the second half of 2016. This will be the largest and most comprehensive launch in the history of our AF portfolio and stands to revolutionize the cardiac mapping segment with a flexible precise and automated mapping system. To date, more than 600 procedures have been performed with EnSite Precision in Europe with existing EnSite users as well as by KOLs, who have historically favored competitive systems. Feedback on the use of EnSite precision has been overwhelmingly positive in regards to its ability, reliability, speed and unique features, including the AutoMap system. Included in this launch will be a series of sensor-enabled catheters that will allow further penetration of our proprietary MediGuide platform. We continue to review our AF business as a highlight in 2016 as we gain share with the successful launch of EnSite Precision and the continued adoption of both TactiCath and FlexAbility. We expect to leverage the strong portfolio of new products in conjunction with our CRM business to strengthen our contracting position with U.S. hospitals.
Our first quarter neuromodulation results represent another bright spot in the quarter as we continue to successfully execute against our strategy of surrounding chronic pain with spinal cord stimulation, or SCS, as well as DRG and radiofrequency ablation. We grew 10% in the first quarter and believe we took share with our innovative SCS platform. Plans are underway to establish St. Jude Medical's proprietary Burst therapy as a new standard advanced waveform in SCS and to achieve superior pain relief across rechargeable and recharge-free devices. We saw strong growth in our international SCS business with continued adoption of Burst therapy, growing approximately 2x the international SCS market growth rate. We remain on track and are preparing to bring our Burst Technology to the U.S. in the second half of 2016.
We are pleased with the progress we are making with the launch of PROCLAIM, the only upgradable recharge-free device on the market, which is expanding the SCS market as the adoption of this technology is moving more quickly than originally modeled. In fact, we are noticing a significant shift in our SCS product mix to PROCLAIM. This momentum signals to US that physicians are highly interested in implanting products that provide them the ability to upgrade software platforms to instantly access new technology upon regulatory approval and our customers realize the benefits of a device that does not require recharging. 
Our Axium Neurostimulator System for DRG or dorsal root ganglion stimulation expands our chronic pain portfolio in the almost 2 billion chronic pain market to treat patients who suffer from complex regional pain syndrome and positions DRG therapy as a clinically validated market expansion story. The recent 12-month follow-up data in DRG presented at NANS last December demonstrated DRG stimulation sustain superior pain relief and improve therapeutic targeting. Since our commercial launch in the U.S. a few weeks ago, we have received strong enthusiasm from the clinical community and are on track to complete approximately 100 cases in the first month. We have implanted a successful training program with initial case experiences going very smoothly, providing life-changing results for patients.
We have begun to implant our innovative Infinity DBS platform in Europe with the first cases happening earlier this month. We continue to expect FDA approval in the second half of 2016. We believe our Infinity platform is the first platform engineered to fuel patient independence with an app-based Bluetooth wireless communication platform and our directional lead technology. This is a first-of-its-kind technology providing a more patient-centric intuitive technology for patients battling Parkinson's disease, central tremor and dystonia. We continue to be excited with the potential that our neuromodulation business offers as these products are launched and adopted worldwide.
Turning to our cardiovascular portfolio. We continue to execute on our innovation strategy with a focus of bringing to market new technology that will allow us to take share while supporting market growth in our more traditional business segments. We remain encouraged by the momentum of our Portico TAVR system which continued from last year into the first quarter. We saw implants per week increased throughout the past 2 quarters and continue to receive positive reviews regarding Portico's ease of delivery, hemodynamic performance and reduced need for pacemaker implants relative to next-generation valves.
The IDE study continues to enroll, and we are targeting complete enrollment in the study in the second half of 2016. Additionally, our next-generation tissue valve, Trifecta with glide technology, just launched this month in Europe and with an expected launch in the U.S. during the second quarter. 
In regards to our PFO closure device, we look forward to the FDA panel meeting that has now been scheduled for May 24. Recall that at last year's Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics Conference, 10-year follow-up RESPECT data showed in the attempt to treat arm of the study that when subsequent strokes were restricted to cryptogenic stroke, there was a 54% relative risk reduction in recurrent cryptogenic stroke to the PFO closure group as compared to medical management. This compelling data was statistically significant.
Our HeartMate percutaneous heart pump or PHP device addresses a large growing market and provides meaningful enhancements to the available competitive offerings. Enrolling patients in this IDE study continues to be a high priority for us, and we are gaining traction as we are adding several high-volume centers in the U.S. In addition, we continue to have good discussions with the FDA regarding our renal denervation IDE study, and we continue to expect to begin that study later this year.
During the first quarter, we demonstrated our ability to execute against our strategy, delivering on our investment and innovation and drive market demand for our products. With 10 product approvals and major product launches in key regions in the first quarter, we are off to a good start in 2016. We are on track to do what we said we were going to do in terms of delivering sales and adjusted EPS growth. We continue to gain momentum in Heart Failure with our recent launch of MPP and strong results from our HeartMate portfolio. In AF, we are demonstrating strong growth with continued share gain in ablation catheters and an unprecedented opportunity with the launch of EnSite precision. Our neuromodulation business continues to be a bright spot with above-market growth due to our innovative product portfolio. We have a path for traditional CRM share recapture and believe our expected product cadence in our electrophysiology business sets the stage for momentum in 2017. 
This is a challenging but exciting time for St. Jude Medical. I believe that we are focused on the right objectives. As the healthcare environment continues to evolve, we are building new capabilities and expanding our comprehensive solutions for the treatment of expensive epidemic disease. Our focus on innovation and execution is driving results, and we have never been better positioned for worldwide market leadership in Atrial Fibrillation, Heart Failure and Neuromodulation. 
Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'd like to open the call up for questions."

The thing to remember about our traditional CRM business is you have to look at it in context of the overall EP business. And that's the way the EP is looking at this business. So product launches across EP are just critically important. And of course, MPP would be a great example. We've talked a lot about MPP and we really need to work to make sure that this technology is fully appreciated by our customers and, frankly, by the Street. It's not simply iteration of quadripolar technology. MPP was developed to really solve significant problem that the EP has in the CRT-D MP space, which is the nonresponder group. This, in some centers, they'll tell you it's as high as 30%. So the idea that there is now a technology that will help reduce the amount of nonresponders, it's significant not just in patient care but also as it relates to the cost of care. Secondly, there's a technology that we are introducing Sync [ph] AV and when you take the combination of optimized location, optimization of the management of the device as well as optimized timing, we think the results can be even more promising than we're seeing now. So HRS will be an exciting time for us. The paper has been accepted there, and that's where the initial data will come out. The other second factor is MORE-CRT, that's going to be the largest study ever. And over the years, if you look at technologies like quad where you begin to change the way medicine is practiced and actually set the standard of care, it's often requires multiple studies and multiple trials. MPP will have 2 significant trials with MORE-CRT just completing and now going to the process of follow-up. And over 60 publications and papers drafted about single-site performance of the product. So we think that, that cadence of products going into the second half will be extremely important for us to offset the delay in our labeling for MRI. And as we pointed out, we think that delay is approximately $5 million a quarter. And with the cadence of products that we anticipate coming into the market, we are confident that we'll be able to offset that. As it relates to the delay, we've been working closely with the FDA on this. And remember, this is a full PMA, requiring review from both the pharma and device side. We believe that we've been working very closely with them over the last several months particularly and think we're on a good track to meet the requirements that they've outlined. I would say that as we look at the submission, we have high confidence that we'll get to the results that are required, and we decided it would be prudent to move the time out and make sure that this submission is appropriate, on track and will be successful. And so that's the delay that we have. We think it's a manageable delay when you look at the overall product cadence. And we also think that we'll in fact achieve the labeling this year."

As it relates to building out our sales force, specifically targeted in Europe, we're moving from independent to direct on a country-by-country basis. That process and progress is ahead of schedule. We specifically targeted Germany, it's the most important market in Europe. And the team, the sales team over there has really executed at very high level. We're now in 4 key sites, are contracting in Europe, the tender process is being developed, and we think that we are on track to continue to take share in Europe as well as the U.S. The last comment I'd like to make about the Thoratec integration. The hard part of acquisitions is always in the outcome associated with the integration, and it's really been a very successful integration with excellent results, both internationally, U.S. and the division itself. In the U.S., we are so pleased with the performance of that team that we thought it would be a good idea, and we are seeing the early results here of actually combining our CardioMEMS team in with that Heart Failure group led by that senior executive, Ed [indiscernible], who's done a great job in transition. The results so far have indicated that our implant rates continue to improve, giving us confidence that we can achieve the target of $65 million by year-end. So I think we're on a good track from both a product standpoint, the combination of heart failure and access to the top labs and sales forces around the world that are very focused at launching new technology and taking share.

Since the presentation is still upcoming, I don't want to give too many details, but I recommend that everybody attend the sessions and read about that to get a better idea of the details surrounding the strokes as we've looked at the individual events. We don't see any systematic trends that are concerning. Also keep in mind that the CE Mark study represents very initial experience with the HeartMate 3, that's always a learning curve with all devices, but especially with LVADs and getting a feel for the appropriate implant techniques. I'd also say that just in our commercial experience, we are monitoring that, as you imagine, very carefully and we don't see any signals that would raise any concerns."

So the international numbers were strong and driven to a large extent by the expansion of MPP and the execution of that sales force has been very good in that space, and I would characterize that as a true international upside. So Europe, Asia and Latin America all had pretty strong performance. And in the markets where we have MPP, we clearly have an advantage in growth. On the -- in the U.S., it came down to a series of changes that we made both organizationally, refocusing to the field and resetting the expectations around what we want to achieve in 2016. And one of the big factors in the national sales meeting we conducted was laying out the pipeline and getting people ready to go into the market with a significant series of new products. And so this is always exciting to the EP community, when they have an opportunity to meet with our sales reps and our sales management and we lay out the product cadence and we talk about how we can bring that technology into their site. And one of the areas that's probably most exciting is the lab, the fully integrated lab. So when you think about the technology required to do that, it is unique to St. Jude Medical. We are the only company that can provide a full highly advanced, the most advanced EP lab in the world. And going in and talking about our product portfolio in that context re-energizes the electrophysiologists and reminds them of the innovations St. Jude Medical is bringing to the market. So I think that probably has helped us from an execution standpoint. And again, we absolutely believe that in the context of these product approvals and the achievement of that MRI labeling, if you look in Japan, for instance, where they received a labeling, they're up high double digits in the aftermath of the approval of that label. So we think as we get towards the end of '16 and we develop a momentum going into '17, we will be a share recapture story in the traditional CRM space."

We've had very positive discussions with the CMS organization. We put together, with their guidance and with the guidance of several different advocacies and constituents, physicians and ACC and so forth, the heart failure community have all stepped up and are participating in this process. And the data, as I know you know, the data continues to get better. And what we're caught in here is not unusual, I think, on a go-forward basis, it's our understanding that the CMS is very busy. It's one of the reasons that our submission hasn't been accepted yet is that the local MACs are becoming more and more restrictive as it relates to cost management. And innovation is now going to either be delayed or go through a more torturous path to get to the patient community. And the local MACs, not all of them, but some of the local MACs look at an annual budget and they're managing within an annual budget. When you look at the value proposition of a product like CardioMEMS, it's 2, 3, 5, 10 years of value, working against a system that's looking at an annual perspective. So if you want to put in context why we have the problem, well that's the cause of the problem. The idea that we'll go through the process, one point that we just learned is that CMS has extended the add-on payment in their latest ruling, so they remain committed and positive about the technology. And we think that we'll have to go through this process. And quite frankly, unless there's some changes from a legislative perspective, other companies are going to have to go through the same process as it relates to reimbursement. On the more positive side, I'd say that some of the private payers are starting to show interest and are beginning to work with us as well as the VA. And so we not completely abandoned those areas, Novitas and FCSO, there are still people that are committed to the technology and are using it. So the fact is that we're going to go through the process. We've scheduled a number that we think is achievable. And again, I talked about positive implant rates, a nice reduction in stock shelf. That ratio has now crossed over. And we're feeling positive about the centers that are open, beginning to use CardioMEMS in their normal course of treatment. And that was the goal. And so we'll build the beachhead. We'll work to achieve the NCD. And I think that we will truly end up with the standard of care in heart failure management with CardioMEMS."

The strategy that we refer to often is surrounding these disease states where we want the deepest and broadest portfolios and we're certainly on track to achieve that. In AF, we will be first to market with advanced sensor-enabled catheters. We have both the FlexAbility and the TactiCath, and I'd like to remind you that we do not have TactiCath in Japan until the second half of '16, and we do not have TactiCath or FlexAbility in China until the end of the year, beginning of '17, depending on how the regulatory process rolls out. So the results have been, to a large extent, in Europe and the U.S. And we're talking about mid-teens growth in the ablation segment, with right now a pause, if you will, on the capital side as physicians and hospitals are waiting for Precision. But the depth and breadth of the AF and the ability to sit and meet with physicians, I had a team and I got to meet some personally about a week and a half ago and just how impressed they are when they came in and we have an entire lab and they are working in an entire suite. And every component that they required to do an AF case, including all of the tools, and at this point I'd say we have the most advanced tools, are all there and will be introduced into the market this year and next year. So on AF, we're extremely positive. We do think the EP does look at their specialty as device in AF in many cases. And so there is the pullthrough opportunity, there is the collective contracting opportunity, and so there's areas for us to exercise strategically across the broadest platform available in the market. In neuro, it's a real success story for us because we have not fully launched the entire portfolio. And if you look at our growth in Europe with Burst, you're talking about high double-digit growth in Europe with Burst Technology. The platform, both the rechargeable and the recharge-free technologies, the peripherals are now on a smart technology, so patients are using and doctors are using iPads and iTouch, all far advanced from a Bluetooth capability of any of our competitors. The DBS system and the opportunity to get into the DBS system with another breakthrough technology and the Infinity lead, where we can steer the energy and provide the physician more options and opportunities to work with patients, a lot of excitement about that launch yet this year. So we think those 2 portfolios are exactly defined our long-term strategy."

But maybe you can go into a little more detail on CRM, and specifically what I am wondering as I look at the share loss that you guys have experienced during this MRI product gap, it's the more share that's ever moved since the recall whereas Boston Scientific has not experienced the same amount of share shift. So I'm just hoping you can go through your thoughts and if there's anything that's changed in the commercial landscape and whether your competitors are being more successful with bundling across multiple specialties and how you might respond to that once you do fill that product gap and if that is in fact a relevant point of discussion?"

We made some substantial changes in our leadership team and in our refocusing of our marketing messages and training associated with the new product launches. And I think what the result is that we have a reenergized sales force that has some expectations about what we need to achieve in 2016. So I think that Boston obviously also under stress without the label, has managed that over the last 2 quarters better than we have. I think we've done a better job in Q1. I think that we'll do a better job as we go through the year. And again, we've modeled and planned to be able to manage the product gap until we get it.

And the wave of interest is really around Burst, it's around our lead technology and it's around upgradability. And then you add into that DRG. And the DRG story is still really unfolding here. The U.S. demand for DRG, it's a little more complicated relative to reimbursement outside the U.S., a little more straightforward in the U.S. And we are struggling to keep up with the training demand from patients, from physicians who want to treat patients. I'll also say that -- and it's north of 60% we're estimating early on here, our patients that would not be considered for standard SCS devices. And so you're looking at the potential of a 2-market expansion story that could develop year-over-year. So when you look at that portfolio, you look at where we are, just like in AF and what we're building out in Heart Failure, we're at the early end of the process in RF ablation. We've got the most advanced SCS system. We're bringing advanced waveforms and we're the only company that can upgrade waveform technology and advances in the industry without [indiscernible]. And we're doing this all on cutting edge peripherals using our Bluetooth capability. You put DRG in there and then you add DBS, which puts us into the deep brain space with brand-new platform, hardware as well as software and peripherals. And we had an excited sales force. This is a sales force that has always performed even in the most difficult of times, and it's great fun to be with them and around them because they're as excited, as you can imagine, and looking forward to the competition. As it relates to Nevro, it's an underpenetrated space. The idea that Nevro is going to help be an expander, there'll be some share loss in the market. We're working to not be one of the companies that are giving up some share loss, but the idea that there's innovation coming into the space and driving the total size of the market, which is so underpenetrated, long term, this is probably good outcome."

Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our first quarter 2016 financial results as well as a schedule detailing reported and constant currency sales results by business area. This press release is available on the St. Jude Medical website. 
For participants on today's call, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on a comparable constant currency basis, which includes Thoratec sales in both comparable years, and are adjusted for the impact of currency. 
Sales for the quarter totaled $1,448,000,000, up 2% from the first quarter of last year. Unfavorable foreign currency translations decreased this  quarter's sales by approximately $42 million. 
During the first quarter, we recognized $164 million or $0.57 per share in net after-tax special charges and amortization expense. For further information regarding these items, please refer to details provided in our press release. Comments during this call referencing first quarter results and guidance for 2016, including EPS amounts, will be exclusive of these items. 
Adjusted earnings per share were $0.90 for the first quarter of 2016 compared to adjusted EPS of $0.93 in the first quarter of 2015. We estimate that on a constant currency basis, first quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 9%.
Before we discuss our first quarter 2016 sales results by product category with guidance for the second quarter and the remainder of 2016, let me provide a few comments about currency exchange rates. 
As discussed on prior calls, the 2 most significant currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2016, we used exchange rates which assume that each euro would translate into about $1.05 to $1.10; and for the yen, each JPY 115 to JPY 120 would translate into USD 1. For the first quarter, the actual average exchange rates for the euro and the yen were consistent with these ranges. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the second quarter and the remainder of 2016, we are now assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.11 to $1.16, and we now expect each JPY 106 to JPY 111 to translate into USD 1. Additionally, we have assumed changes in various other currencies that impact our results. These changes and assumptions regarding currency exchange rates increased our total forecasted sales for the remainder of 2016 by approximately $85 million, and we now estimate that foreign currency translations will reduce our total reported sales for 2016 by approximately $35 million to $55 million versus 2015, including approximately $10 million to $15 million in the second quarter. 
I will now walk through first quarter results in  our new product categories: heart failure, atrial fibrillation, neuromodulation, cardiovascular and traditional cardiac rhythm management or CRM. We issued an 8-K on January 13 detailing the products in these new categories as well as historical St. Jude Medical sales for each category. 
For the first quarter, total heart failure sales were $374 million, which grew 2% from last year's first quarter. Sales of HeartMate 3 during the quarter drove strong double-digit year-over-year growth of left ventricular assist devices, or LVADs, and we now assume the LVAD market is growing in the high single digits. We continue to expect full year 2016 CardioMEMS sales to be approximately $65 million. 
Atrial fibrillation, or AF, product sales for the first quarter totaled $291 million, up 9%. Although there was a difficult comparison this quarter given last year's ablation catheter launches, our worldwide AF business continued to demonstrate strong growth. We expect to continue to take share in the AF market this year with the continued adoption of our ablation catheter portfolio and the worldwide launch of our EnSite Precision mapping system. 
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the first quarter of 2016 were $116 million, up approximately 10% as we continue to take share on a global basis with the most comprehensive neuromodulation portfolio in the market. 
Total traditional CRM sales for the first quarter of 2016 were $366 million, down 7%. Sales results were largely driven by weakness in the U.S., which declined primarily due to MRI product gaps in both our low-voltage and ICD product segments. 
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the first quarter of 2016 were $301 million, up 3%. We expect sales in cardiovascular to accelerate as we expand our TAVR sales and launch our Trifecta GT tissue valve in the U.S. and European markets.
Turning to sales guidance. We continue to expect our full year comparable constant currency sales growth rate for 2016 to be in the range of 2% to 4% and expect comparable constant currency sales growth in the second quarter to be in the range of 1% to 3%. 
The gross profit margin during the first quarter was 68.7%, down 210 basis points from the first quarter of 2015 primarily due to a decline of 150 basis points related to the negative impact of currency. Additionally, there was a 60 basis point decline related to the continued weakness in our margin -- in our higher-margin U.S. CRM business. 
Please note that our gross profit margin in the first quarter included the final $7 million of Medical Device Excise Tax costs amortized from inventory to cost of sales. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect gross profit margin to be in the range of 69.0% to 69.5%. This expectation includes continued weakness in our U.S. CRM business, a 60 basis point improvement related to the suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax and a 50 to 60 basis point decline driven by the negative currency environment. 
Our first quarter SG&A expenses were 31.6% of net sales, a 200 basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2015. For the full year 2016, we now expect this ratio to be in the range of 31.3% to 31.8%. 
Research and development expenses in the first quarter of 2016 were 13.0% of net sales. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect R&D expenses to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.0% of net sales.
Other expense was $41 million in the first quarter. For the full year 2016, we now expect other expense of approximately $155 million to $165 million, primarily driven by interest expense on our outstanding debt. 
For the first quarter, our effective income tax rate was 15.9%. For full year 2016, we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $325 million in cash and cash equivalents and $6.1 billion in total debt. During the first quarter, we repaid approximately $400 million outstanding debt. There were no borrowings outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility available with a group of banks.
Next, I want to offer some comments regarding our EPS outlook for the second quarter and the full year 2016. 
In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the second quarter of 2016, the weighted average outstanding shares used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about 287 million to 288 million shares, and the weighted average shares outstanding for the full year 2016 will be about 288 million to 290 million shares. 
For the full year 2016, we now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.01 to $4.11. The adjustment this quarter to our annual EPS guidance of $0.06  primarily represents the impact of our favorable currency expectations for the remainder of the year. The company expects adjusted EPS for the second quarter of 2016 to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.07. 
I will now turn it back to Mike."

First quarter results reinforced our confidence that we are focused on the right priorities and are making progress against the objectives we discussed at our annual investor meeting in Fe",3113,"Thank you, Don, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. First quarter results reinforced our confidence that we are focused on the right priorities and are making progress against the objectives we discussed at our annual investor meeting in February. As a reminder, we told investors that we would successfully execute against 4 key priorities to set the stage for accelerating growth in 2017. Those priorities are: successfully launch key products to drive sales growth, establish U.S. reimbursement for CardioMEMS nationwide, successfully integrate our Thoratec acquisition and execute the plan for recovery in U.S. CRM. 
Before addressing each of these items in my comments today, I would like to briefly highlight that year-to-date we have achieved a number of important milestones that support our objectives, including 10 regulatory approvals. Some of those approvals include our Axium DRG system, MultiPoint Pacing and Quartet leads here in the U.S. In Japan, we received approval for our OPTIS Mobile System, MRI-compatible Ellipse ICD and MRI conditional labeling on our Quadra Assura CRT-D device. In Europe, we received approval for MRI labeling for Nanostim. The launches supporting these important product approvals are under way, and we are pleased with our progress so far. 
For the first quarter, sales grew 2%, which is at the high end of our guidance range. I am pleased with our ability to continue to drive adjusted EPS growth at approximately 9% constant currency, above the high end of our guidance range, while at the same time funding innovation to drive future growth.
Our International business grew approximately 4% in the quarter, driven by growth in left atrial appendage, or LAA, closure; LVADs; TAVR; optical coherence tomography or OCT; the OPTIS Mobile System with co-registration; and the expansion of our quadripolar lead portfolio. We view the performance of our innovative products when launched internationally as a leading performance indicator for when these products are approved and launched in the U.S. In addition, our portfolio of commercially available products around the world continues to grow. 
I will now discuss our progress in our areas of focus. 
As many of you know, we have been working to expand our heart failure portfolio through recent acquisitions and internal innovation. Our teams are actively working with governments, payers, hospitals and physicians worldwide to expand market access to these proven technology solutions across the heart failure continuum. While our success with MPP and HeartMate 3 are driving growth, we continue to actively address challenges with reimbursement for our CardioMEMS heart failure system, and, in late January, we applied for national coverage determination from CMS. We expect formal acceptance of our submission in Q2 and anticipate this to be a 9- to 12-month process before we have a final decision.
Clinical evidence supporting strong effectiveness of the CardioMEMS heart failure system continues to grow with more than 30 key publications and abstracts published to date. We are pleased that The Journal of the American College of Cardiology recently accepted for publication data that was presented at the 2015 HRS meeting. This retrospective analysis of the CHAMPION trial data shows monitoring pulmonary artery pressure is able to prompt therapeutic changes that improve heart failure management and, in turn, reduce hospitalizations. 
As importantly, we continue to see real-world commercial experience data that is as strong as or stronger than our initial CHAMPION data. For example, real-world data recently presented at The American College of Cardiology annual meeting showed improved quality of life metrics and improvements in exercise capacity for patients monitored with our CardioMEMS device. We believe real-world data, combined with the growing body of clinical evidence in support of CardioMEMS, continues to demonstrate the tremendous value this important technology offers for improving patient care and reducing overall cost. 
To increase our focus on expanding the market for CardioMEMS and LVADs, we have leveraged the legacy Thoratec sales structure to form a combined dedicated U.S. heart failure organization. Our first quarter sales give us confidence that we are on track to achieve our previously issued sales guidance of $65 million in 2016. 
We closed on our acquisition of Thoratec about 6 months ago and our integration process is essentially complete. This important milestone is a full quarter ahead of our initial expectations. As Don mentioned, LVAD sales in the quarter were strong. Much of this success can be linked to our integration efforts that have included a strong focus on clinical and sales execution and the improved clinical experience that our customers have observed with HeartMate 3. Customers have also shared that they have enjoyed a seamless transition without disruption over the course of this integration process. Since its launch in October 2015, we have implanted HeartMate 3 in centers across 15 different countries internationally and are now implanting in all 4 of the largest heart failure centers in Germany, which make up approximately 20% of the European LVAD market. Access to these accounts can be attributed to the strong relationships that St. Jude Medical has cultivated over the years. 
There will be a number of presentations later this month at the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplant (sic) [ International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation ] meeting supporting both HeartMate 2 and 3, including HeartMate 3 CE Mark 12-month data and real-world experience in the Kazakhstan study.
Turning to our CRT portfolio. We recently received FDA approval for our MultiPoint Pacing, or MPP, technology, for our Quadra CRT-D and CRT-P devices, along with 2 complementary Quartet left ventricular leads, further strengthening our differentiation in the treatment of heart failure. 
MPP is a first-to-market technology provided only by St. Jude Medical, which we believe will become the next standard of care in CRT therapy and builds upon our success as the leader in CRT therapy options. In addition to MPP, we intend on adding a feature to our CRT portfolio called SYNCAV, which is in response to the growing importance of CRT optimization. We expect this technology to be available to customers in the U.S. during the second quarter of 2016.
Our European experience has shown that MPP can provide improved acute hemodynamic response as well as an improved chronic responder rate for CRT therapy. Recent data presented at ACC demonstrated optimization of LV pacing sites by means of hemodynamic and electrical delay plus MPP resulted in statistically significant improvements in New York Heart Association Class heart failure Packer [ph] index and remodeling versus standard CRT therapy. We will present data at the upcoming Heart Rhythm Society meeting in May as we were recently informed that the results from our IDE trial have been accepted to be presented as a late-breaking clinical trial session. We also recently completed enrollment in our 1,800-patient MORE-CRT MPP Study, which will provide the largest data set regarding the ability of MPP to reduce the percentage of patients who are nonresponders to CRT. Other studies are also expected to be published in the near term that demonstrate MPP's effectiveness in improving the response to CRT at 1 year.
With MPP, we have continued to advance CRT therapy by delivering better outcomes for patients and physicians. We believe this is an important next-generation technology that differentiates St. Jude Medical and will allow us to grow our market share in this important segment as well as in CRT-P, where we are already the clear market leader.
Moving to our traditional CRM business. First quarter dynamics were similar to those experienced in the fourth quarter of 2015. While we continue to experience challenge in this business, particularly in the U.S., we continue to believe our competitive position will improve throughout the year.
In Japan, we launched our MRI-safe ICD, which drove strong high-voltage performance in that geography, and we expect our pending launch of MPP to continue to strengthen our CRM business in Japan.
Turning to our U.S. high-voltage business. I would like to highlight that we are still on track to begin our global IDE trial for the MRI-safe ICD with first implants in Europe later this month and remain on track for a U.S. launch during the first half of 2017. 
Earlier this quarter, Nanostim received its CE Mark for MRI compatibility. St. Jude Medical has long been at the forefront of leadless pacing technology. We look forward to bring Nanostim, the world's longest-lasting leadless pacemaker with the industry's least invasive and smallest delivery system, to the market to ensure broad patient access to this important therapy. We continue to work with FDA regarding our Nanostim leadless pacemaker and continue to expect FDA approval of Nanostim in the second half of 2016.
In the U.S., we remain in discussions with FDA regarding approval of our Assurity MRI pacemaker, which is the smallest and longest-lasting device in the market. Based on these discussions, we now expect approval and launch of our Assurity MRI pacemakers in the second half of 2016. We think not having an MRI-compatible pacemaker until the second half of 2016 will cost us approximately $15 million to $20 million in 2016 revenue. However, we are not changing our total sales guidance because we believe continued improvement in U.S. field execution and our strong expected product cadence and our broader electrophysiology business will offset that gap.
The CRM market remains an important area of our business and is a vital part of the care continuum for patients who suffer from a variety of cardiovascular diseases. I want to emphasize that we think about our traditional CRM products in context of the overall electrophysiology business because that is how our customers make purchasing decisions. Both our sales organization and our customers are excited about the strength of our entire electrophysiology pipeline that is expected yet this year.
For instance, while sales of our next-generation Confirm Insertable Cardiac Monitor (sic) [ Confirm Implantable Cardiac Monitor ], or ICM, will not be reported in our traditional CRM category, once approved we believe this product will be a driver for our CRM business. As a reminder, we believe this next-generation Confirm will be a disruptor in the market and a significant differentiator for St. Jude Medical. We anticipate this device will be the first commercially available, Bluetooth-enabled and smartphone-capable ICM. We are on track to submit for U.S. and European regulatory approvals in the second half of 2016.
So while our traditional CRM business continues to be under pressure, particularly in the U.S., we are continuing to work on getting MRI-compatible low voltage approved in 2016 and high-voltage products to market in the first half of 2017. 
At the same time, we are continuing to grow other related segments of our business. In electrophysiology, this pipeline includes our next-generation Confirm Insertable Cardiac Monitor (sic) [ Confirm Implantable Cardiac Monitor ] MultiPoint Pacing, EnSite Precision, Nanostim and SYNCAV product launches, which are all on track and will allow us to continue to contract competitively with hospitals, offset traditional CRM share loss and set the stage for traditional CRM share recapture in 2017.
Turning to our AF business where our comprehensive product portfolio is again a key differentiator for St. Jude Medical. We saw a 9% growth in the quarter. We're excited about our AF position given the strong cadence of new launches and consistent double-digit growth across our TactiCath and FlexAbility ablation catheters. 
We expect to continue our successful limited launch of EnSite Precision in Europe and will initiate a full launch in Europe during the second quarter. In the U.S., we filed our regulatory submissions associated with EnSite Precision in the first quarter and expect to initiate a full launch of our new EnSite Precision system in the U.S. in the second half of 2016. This will be the largest and most comprehensive launch in the history of our AF portfolio and stands to revolutionize the cardiac mapping segment with a flexible, precise and automated mapping system. 
To date, more than 600 procedures have been performed with EnSite Precision in Europe with existing EnSite users as well as by KOLs, who have historically favored competitive systems. Feedback on the use of EnSite Precision has been overwhelmingly positive in regards to its ability, reliability, speed and unique features, including the AutoMap system. Included in this launch will be a series of sensor-enabled catheters that will allow further penetration of our proprietary MediGuide platform. 
We continue to view our AF business as a highlight in 2016 as we gain share with the successful launch of EnSite Precision and the continued adoption of both TactiCath and FlexAbility. We expect to leverage this strong portfolio of new products in conjunction with our CRM business to strengthen our contracting position with U.S. hospitals.
Our first quarter neuromodulation results represent another bright spot in the quarter as we continued to successfully execute against our strategy of surrounding chronic pain with spinal cord stimulation, or SCS, as well as DRG and radiofrequency ablation. We grew 10% in the first quarter and believe we took share with our innovative SCS platform. Plans are under way to establish St. Jude Medical's proprietary Burst therapy as a new standard advanced waveform in SCS and to achieve superior pain relief across rechargeable and recharge-free devices. We saw strong growth in our international SCS business with continued adoption of Burst therapy growing approximately twice the international SCS market growth rate. We remain on track and are preparing to bring our Burst Technology to the U.S. in the second half of 2016.
We are pleased with the progress we are making with the launch of PROCLAIM, the only upgradable recharge-free device on the market, which is expanding the SCS market as the adoption of this technology is moving more quickly than originally modeled. In fact, we are noticing a significant shift in our SCS product mix to PROCLAIM. This momentum signals to us that physicians are highly interested in implanting products that provide them the ability to upgrade software platforms to instantly access new technology upon regulatory approval and that customers realize the benefits of a device that does not require recharging. 
Our Axium Neurostimulator System for DRG, or dorsal root ganglion, stimulation expands our chronic pain portfolio in the almost $2 billion chronic pain market to treat patients who suffer from Complex Regional Pain Syndrome and positions DRG therapy as a clinically validated market expansion story. The recent 12-month follow-up data in DRG presented at NANS last December demonstrated DRG stimulation sustain superior pain relief and improve therapeutic targeting. Since our commercial launch in the U.S. a few weeks ago, we have received strong enthusiasm from the clinical community and are on track to complete approximately 100 cases in the first month. We have implanted a successful training program with initial case experiences going very smoothly, providing life-changing results for patients.
We have begun to implant our innovative Infinity DBS platform in Europe with the first cases happening earlier this month. We continue to expect FDA approval in the second half of 2016. We believe our own Infinity platform is the first platform engineered to fuel patient independence with an app-based Bluetooth wireless communication platform and our directional lead technology. This is a first-of-its-kind technology, providing a more patient-centric, intuitive technology for patients battling Parkinson's disease, essential tremor and dystonia. We continue to be excited with the potential that our neuromodulation business offers as these products are launched and adopted worldwide.
Turning to our cardiovascular portfolio. We continue to execute on our innovation strategy with a focus of bringing to market new technology that will allow us to take share while supporting market growth in our more traditional business segments. We remain encouraged by the momentum of our Portico TAVR system, which continued from last year into the first quarter. We saw implants per week increased throughout the past 2 quarters and continue to receive positive reviews regarding Portico's ease of delivery, hemodynamic performance and reduced need for pacemaker implants relative to next-generation valves.
The IDE study continues to enroll, and we are targeting to complete enrollment in the study in the second half of 2016. Additionally, our next-generation tissue valve, Trifecta with Glide Technology, just launched this month in Europe and with an expected launch in the U.S. during the second quarter. 
In regards to our PFO closure device, we look forward to the FDA panel meeting that has now been scheduled for May 24. Recall that at last year's Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics conference, 10-year follow-up RESPECT data showed in the attempt to treat arm of the study that when subsequent strokes were restricted to cryptogenic stroke, there was a 54% relative risk reduction in recurrent cryptogenic stroke to the PFO closure group as compared to medical management. This compelling data was statistically significant.
Our HeartMate Percutaneous Heart Pump, or PHP, device addresses a large, growing market and provides meaningful enhancements to the available competitive offerings. Enrolling patients in this IDE study continues to be a high priority for us, and we are gaining traction as we are adding several high-volume centers in the U.S. In addition, we continue to have good discussions with the FDA regarding our renal denervation IDE study, and we continue to expect to begin that study later this year.
During the first quarter, we demonstrated our ability to execute against our strategy, deliver on our investment in innovation and drive market demand for our products. With 10 product approvals and major product launches in key regions in the first quarter, we are off to a good start in 2016. We are on track to do what we said we were going to do in terms of delivering sales and adjusted EPS growth. We continue to gain momentum in heart failure with our recent launch of MPP and strong results from our HeartMate portfolio. In AF, we are demonstrating strong growth with continued share gain in ablation catheters and an unprecedented opportunity with the launch of EnSite Precision. Our neuromodulation business continues to be a bright spot with above-market growth due to our innovative product portfolio. We have a path for traditional CRM share recapture and believe our expected product cadence in our electrophysiology business sets the stage for momentum in 2017. 
This is a challenging but exciting time for St. Jude Medical. I believe that we are focused on the right objectives. As the health care environment continues to evolve, we are building new capabilities and expanding our comprehensive solutions for the treatment of expensive epidemic disease. Our focus on innovation and execution is driving results, and we have never been better positioned for worldwide market leadership in atrial fibrillation, heart failure and neuromodulation. 
Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'd like to open the call up for questions."

The thing to remember about our traditional CRM business is you have to look at it in context of the overall EP business. And that's the way the EP is looking at this business. So product launches across EP are just critically important. And of course, MPP would be a great example. We've talked a lot about MPP, and we really need to work to make sure that this technology is fully appreciated by our customers and, frankly, by The Street. It's not simply an iteration of quadripolar technology. MPP was developed to really solve a significant problem that the EP has in the CRT-D MP space, which is the nonresponder group. This -- in some centers, they'll tell you it's as high as 30%. So the idea that there is now a technology that will help reduce the amount of nonresponders, it's significant not just in patient care but also as it relates to the cost of care. Secondly, there's a technology that we're introducing, SYNCAV, and when you take the combination of optimized location, optimization of the management of the device as well as optimized timing, we think the results can be even more promising than we're seeing now. So HRS will be an exciting time for us. The paper has been accepted there, and that's where the initial data will come out. The other -- second factor is MORE-CRT. That's going to be the largest study ever. And over the years, if you look at technologies like quad where you begin to change the way medicine is practiced and actually set the standard of care, it often requires multiple studies and multiple trials. MPP will have 2 significant trials with MORE-CRT just completing and now going to the process of follow-up and over 60 publications and papers drafted about single-site performance of the product. So we think that, that cadence of products going into the second half will be extremely important for us to offset the delay in our labeling for MRI. And as we pointed out, we think that delay is approximately $5 million a quarter. And with the cadence of products that we anticipate coming into the market, we're confident that we'll be able to offset that. As it relates to the delay, we've been working closely with the FDA on this. And remember, this is a full PMA requiring review from both the pharma and device side. We believe that we've been working very closely with them over the last several months particularly and think we're on a good track to meet the requirements that they've outlined. I would say that as we look at the submission, we have high confidence that we'll get to the results that are required, and we decided it would be prudent to move the time out and make sure that this submission is appropriate, on track and will be successful. And so that's the delay that we have. We think it's a manageable delay when you look at the overall product cadence. And we also think that we'll in fact achieve the labeling this year."

The -- as it relates to building out our sales force specifically targeted in Europe, we're moving from independent to direct on a country-by-country basis. That process and progress is ahead of schedule. We specifically targeted Germany. It's the most important market in Europe. And the team -- the sales team over there has really executed at very high level. We're now in the 4 key sites, are contracting in Europe. The tender process is being developed, and we think that we're on track to continue to take share in Europe as well as the U.S. The last comment I'd like to make about the Thoratec integration, the hard part of acquisitions is always in the outcome associated with the integration, and it's really been a very successful integration with excellent results, both internationally, U.S. and in the division itself. In the U.S., we're so pleased with the performance of that team that we thought it would be a good idea, and we're seeing the early results here, of actually combining our CardioMEMS team in with that heart failure group led by that senior executive, Ed [indiscernible], who's done a great job in transition. The results so far have indicated that our implant rates continue to improve, giving us confidence that we can achieve the target of $65 million by year-end. So I think we're on a good track from both a product standpoint, the combination of heart failure and access to the top labs and the sales forces around the world that are very focused at launching new technology and taking share. So with that, let me turn it over to Eric. He's got laryngitis, but he is going to [indiscernible] further [ph]."

But the delay is really around the review of the 6 systems and how they all come together. It's software, hardware, some peripheral changes and some new catheters that are also involved here that are sensor-enabled catheters that are brand new to the industry. And so that's the challenge. And again, we're working very closely with the FDA. It's just the significance and the size of the overall submission. So you're -- look, we're literally talking about a completely updated system across the board. And so that -- there lies the delay in the process.

Obviously, from a year-over-year perspective, still pretty weak, but you did see in the United States a sequential improvement in the traditional ICD business. And so I was wondering if you could just talk about what drove that sequential improvement because it actually is a sequentially normally seasonally weak quarter for you and yet you drove a little bit of upside in the business relative to Q4. So can you just talk about what the drivers of that improvement were in Q1? And maybe just talk about some of the changes in the business that you've made that make you think you're on the right track. So I'm talking now besides the pipeline."

So the International numbers were strong and driven to a large extent by the expansion of MPP. And the execution of that sales force has been very good in that space, and I would characterize that as a true International upside. So Europe, Asia and Latin America all had pretty strong performance. And in the markets where we had MPP, we clearly have an advantage in growth. On the -- in the U.S., it came down to a series of changes that we made, both organizationally, refocusing of the field and resetting the expectations around what we want to achieve in 2016. And one of the big factors in the national sales meeting that we conducted was laying out the pipeline and getting people ready to go into the market with a significant series of new products. And so this is always exciting to the EP community, when they have an opportunity to meet with our sales reps and our sales management and we lay out the product cadence and we talk about how we can bring that technology into their site. And one of the areas that's probably most exciting is the lab, the fully integrated lab. So when you think about the technology required to do that, it is unique to St. Jude Medical. We are the only company that can provide a full highly advanced, the most advanced EP lab in the world. And going in and talking about our product portfolio in that context re-energizes the electrophysiologists and reminds them of the innovations St. Jude Medical is bringing to the market. So I think that probably has helped us from an execution standpoint. And again, we absolutely believe that in the context of these product approvals and the achievement of that MRI labeling, if you look in Japan, for instance, where they received a labeling, they're up high double digits in the aftermath of the approval of that label. So we think as we get towards the end of '16 and we develop a momentum going into '17, we will be a share recapture story in the traditional CRM space."

We've had very positive discussions with the CMS organization. We've put together with their guidance and with the guidance of several different advocacies and constituents, physicians in ACC and so forth, the heart failure community have all stepped up and are participating in this process. And the data -- as I know you know, the data continues to get better. And what we're caught in here is not unusual, I think, on a go-forward basis. It's our understanding that the CMS is very busy. It's one of the reasons that our submission hasn't been accepted yet, is that the local MACs are becoming more and more restrictive as it relates to cost management. And innovation is now going to either be delayed or go through a more torturous path to get to the patient community. And the local MACs, not all of them but some local MACs look at an annual budget and they're managing within an annual budget. When you look at the value proposition of a product like CardioMEMS, it's 2, 3, 5, 10 years of value and working against a system that's looking at an annual perspective. So if you want to put in context why we have the problem, well, that's the cause of the problem. The idea that we'll go through the process, one point that we just learned is that CMS has extended the add-on payment in their latest ruling. So they remain committed and positive about the technology. And we think that we'll have to go through this process. And quite frankly, unless there's some changes from a legislative perspective, other companies are going to have to go through the same process as it relates to reimbursement. On the more positive side, I'd say that some of the private payers are starting to show interest and are beginning to work with us as well as the VA. And so we have not completely abandoned those areas. Novitas and FCSO, there are still people that are committed to the technology and are using it. So the fact is that we're going to go through the process. We've scheduled a number that we think is achievable. And again, I talked about positive implant rates, a nice reduction in stock shelf. That ratio has now crossed over. And we're feeling positive about the centers that are open, beginning to use CardioMEMS in a -- in their normal course of treatment, and that was the goal. And so we'll build a beachhead. We'll work to achieve the NCD. And I think that we will truly end up with a standard of care in heart failure management with CardioMEMS."

The strategy that we refer too often is surrounding these disease states where we want the deepest and broadest portfolios, and we are certainly on track to achieve that. In AF, we will be first to market with the advanced sensor-enabled catheters. We have both the FlexAbility and the TactiCath, and I'd like to remind you that we do not have TactiCath in Japan until the second half of '16 and we do not have TactiCath or FlexAbility in China until the end of the year, beginning of '17 depending on how the regulatory process rolls out. So the results have been, to a large extent, in Europe and the U.S. And we're talking about mid-teens growth in the ablation segment with right now a pause, if you will, on the capital side as physicians and hospitals are waiting for Precision. The -- but the depth and breadth of the AF and the ability to sit and meet with physicians. I had a team in, I got to meet some personally about 1 1/2 weeks ago and just how impressed they are when they come in. And we have an entire lab and they're working in an entire suite. And every component that they require to do an AF case, including all of the tools, and at this point I'd say we have the most advanced tools, are all there and will be introduced into the market this year and next year. The -- so on AF, we're extremely positive. We do think the EP does look at their specialty as device in AF in many cases. And so there is the pull-through opportunity. There is the collective contracting opportunity. And so there's areas for us to exercise strategically across that -- the broadest platform available in the market. In neuro, it's a real success story for us because we have not fully launched the entire portfolio. And if you look at our growth in Europe with Burst, you're talking about high double-digit growth in Europe with Burst Technology. The platform, both the rechargeable and the recharge-free technologies, the peripherals are now on a smart technology. So patients are using and doctors are using iPads and iTouch, all far advanced, from a Bluetooth capability, of any of our competitors. The DBS System and the opportunity to get into the DBS system with another breakthrough technology and the Infinity lead, where we can steer the energy and provide the physician more options and opportunities to work with patients, a lot of excitement about that launch yet this year. So we think those 2 portfolios are -- exactly define our long-term strategy."

We've made some substantial changes in our leadership team and in our refocusing of our marketing messages and training associated with the new product launches. And I think what the result is that we have a re-energized sales force that has some expectations about what we need to achieve in 2016.

That's twice the growth rate in Europe. And the wave of interest is really around Burst. It's around the -- our lead technology and it's around upgradability. And then you add into that DRG. And the DRG story is still really unfolding here. The U.S. demand for DRG, it's a little bit more complicated relative to reimbursement outside the U.S., a little bit more straightforward in the U.S. And the -- we are struggling to keep up with the training demand from patients -- from physicians who want to treat patients. I'll also say that -- and it's north of 60% we're estimating early on here, our patients that would not be considered for standard SCS devices. And so you're looking at the potential of a 2-market expansion story that could develop year-over-year. So when you look at that portfolio, you look at where we are, just like in AF and what we're building out in heart failure, we're at the early end of the process in RF ablation. We've got the most advanced SCS system. We're bringing advanced waveforms and we're the only company that can upgrade waveform technology and advances in the industry without an ex [ph] plant. And we're doing this all on cutting-edge peripherals using our Bluetooth capability. You put DRG in there and then you add DBS, which puts us into the deep brain space with brand-new platform, hardware as well as software and peripherals, and we had an excited sales force. This is a sales force that has always performed even in the most difficult of times, and it's great fun to be with them and around them because they're as excited, as you can imagine, and looking forward to the competition. As it relates to Nevro, it's an underpenetrated space. The idea that Nevro is going to help be an expander, there'll be some share loss in the market. We're working to not be one of the companies that are giving up some share loss, but the idea that there's innovation coming into the space and driving the total size of the market, which is so underpenetrated, long term this is probably a good outcome."

For participants on today's call, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on a comparable constant currency basis, which includes Thoratec sales in both comparable years, and are adjusted for the impact of currency. 
Sales for the quarter totaled $1,448,000,000, up 2% from the first quarter of last year. Unfavorable foreign currency translations decreased this  quarter's sales by approximately $42 million. 
During the first quarter, we recognized $164 million or $0.57 per share in net after-tax special charges and amortization expense. For further information regarding these items, please refer to details provided in our press release. Comments during this call referencing first quarter results and guidance for 2016, including EPS amounts, will be exclusive of these items. 
Adjusted earnings per share were $0.90 for the first quarter of 2016 compared to adjusted EPS of $0.93 in the first quarter of 2015. We estimate that on a constant currency basis, first quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 9%.
Before we discuss our first quarter 2016 sales results by product category with guidance for the second quarter and the remainder of 2016, let me provide a few comments about currency exchange rates. 
As discussed on prior calls, the 2 most significant currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2016, we used exchange rates which assumed that each euro would translate into about $1.05 to $1.10; and for the yen, each JPY 115 to JPY 120 would translate into USD 1. For the first quarter, the actual average exchange rates for the euro and the yen were consistent with these ranges. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the second quarter and the remainder of 2016, we are now assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.11 to $1.16, and we now expect each JPY 106 to JPY 111 to translate into USD 1. Additionally, we have assumed changes in various other currencies that impact our results. These changes and assumptions regarding currency exchange rates increased our total forecasted sales for the remainder of 2016 by approximately $85 million, and we now estimate that foreign currency translations will reduce our total reported sales for 2016 by approximately $35 million to $55 million versus 2015, including approximately $10 million to $15 million in the second quarter. 
I will now walk through first quarter results in  our new product categories: heart failure, atrial fibrillation, neuromodulation, cardiovascular and traditional cardiac rhythm management, or CRM. We issued an 8-K on January 13 detailing the products in these new categories as well as the historical St. Jude Medical sales for each category. 
For the first quarter, total heart failure sales were $374 million, which grew 2% from last year's first quarter. Sales of HeartMate 3 during the quarter drove strong double-digit year-over-year growth of left ventricular assist devices, or LVADs, and we now assume the LVAD market is growing in the high single digits. We continue to expect full year 2016 CardioMEMS sales to be approximately $65 million. 
Atrial fibrillation, or AF, product sales for the first quarter totaled $291 million, up 9%. Although there was a difficult comparison this quarter given last year's ablation catheter launches, our worldwide AF business continued to demonstrate strong growth. We expect to continue to take share in the AF market this year with the continued adoption of our ablation catheter portfolio and the worldwide launch of our EnSite Precision mapping system. 
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the first quarter of 2016 were $116 million, up approximately 10% as we continue to take share on a global basis with the most comprehensive neuromodulation portfolio in the market. 
Total traditional CRM sales for the first quarter of 2016 were $366 million, down 7%. Sales results were largely driven by weakness in the U.S., which declined primarily due to MRI product gaps in both our low-voltage and ICD product segments. 
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the first quarter of 2016 were $301 million, up 3%. We expect sales in cardiovascular to accelerate as we expand our TAVR sales and launch our Trifecta GT tissue valve in the U.S. and European markets.
Turning to sales guidance. We continue to expect our full year comparable constant currency sales growth rate for 2016 to be in the range of 2% to 4% and expect comparable constant currency sales growth in the second quarter to be in the range of 1% to 3%. 
The gross profit margin during the first quarter was 68.7%, down 210 basis points from the first quarter of 2015 primarily due to a decline of 150 basis points related to the negative impact of currency. Additionally, there was a 60 basis point decline related to the continued weakness in our margin -- in our higher-margin U.S. CRM business. 
Please note that our gross profit margin in the first quarter included the final $7 million of Medical Device Excise Tax costs amortized from inventory to cost of sales. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect gross profit margin to be in the range of 69.0% to 69.5%. This expectation includes continued weakness in our U.S. CRM business, a 60 basis point improvement related to the suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax and a 50 to 60 basis point decline driven by the negative currency environment. 
Our first quarter SG&A expenses were 31.6% of net sales, a 200 basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2015. For the full year 2016, we now expect this ratio to be in the range of 31.3% to 31.8%. 
Research and development expenses in the first quarter of 2016 were 13.0% of net sales. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect R&D expenses to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.0% of net sales.
Other expense was $41 million in the first quarter. For the full year 2016, we now expect other expense of approximately $155 million to $165 million, primarily driven by interest expense on our outstanding debt. 
For the first quarter, our effective income tax rate was 15.9%. For full year 2016, we continue to expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $325 million in cash and cash equivalents and $6.1 billion in total debt. During the first quarter, we repaid approximately $400 million of outstanding debt. There were no borrowings outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility available with a group of banks.
Next, I want to offer some comments regarding our EPS outlook for the second quarter and the full year 2016. 
In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the second quarter of 2016, the weighted average outstanding shares used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about 287 million to 288 million shares, and the weighted average shares outstanding for the full year 2016 will be about 288 million to 290 million shares. 
For the full year 2016, we now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.01 to $4.11. The adjustment this quarter to our annual EPS guidance of $0.06  primarily represents the impact of our favorable currency expectations for the remainder of the year. The company expects adjusted EPS for the second quarter of 2016 to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.07. 
I will now turn it back to Mike."

First quarter results reinforce our confidence that we are focused on the right priorities and are making progress against the objectives we discussed at our annual investor meeting in Feb",3110,"Thank you, Don, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. First quarter results reinforce our confidence that we are focused on the right priorities and are making progress against the objectives we discussed at our annual investor meeting in February. As a reminder, we told investors that we would successfully execute against 4 key priorities to set the stage for accelerating growth in 2017. Those priorities are: successfully launch key products to drive sales growth, establish U.S. reimbursement for CardioMEMS nationwide, successfully integrate our Thoratec acquisition and execute the plan for recovery in U.S. CRM. 
Before addressing each of these items in my comments today, I would like to briefly highlight that year-to-date, we have achieved a number of important milestones that support our objectives, including 10 regulatory approvals. Some of those approvals include our Axium DRG system, MultiPoint Pacing and Quartet leads here in the U.S. In Japan, we received approval for our OPTIS Mobile System, MRI-compatible Ellipse ICD and MRI conditional labeling on our Quadra Assura CRT-D device. In Europe, we received approval for MRI labeling for Nanostim. The launches supporting these important product approvals are under way, and we are pleased with our progress so far. 
For the first quarter, sales grew 2%, which is at the high end of our guidance range. I am pleased with our ability to continue to drive adjusted EPS growth at approximately 9% constant currency, above the high end of our guidance range, while at the same time funding innovation to drive future growth.
Our International business grew approximately 4% in the quarter, driven by growth in left atrial appendage, or LAA, closure; LVADs; TAVR; optical coherence tomography, or OCT; the OPTIS Mobile System with co-registration; and the expansion of our quadripolar lead portfolio. We view the performance of our innovative products when launched internationally as a leading performance indicator for when these products are approved and launched in the U.S. In addition, our portfolio of commercially available products around the world continues to grow. 
I will now discuss our progress in our areas of focus. 
As many of you know, we have been working to expand our heart failure portfolio through recent acquisitions and internal innovation. Our teams are actively working with governments, payers, hospitals and physicians worldwide to expand market access to these proven technology solutions across the heart failure continuum. While our success with MPP and HeartMate 3 are driving growth, we continue to actively address challenges with reimbursement for our CardioMEMS heart failure system, and in late January, we applied for a national coverage determination from CMS. We expect formal acceptance of our submission in Q2 and anticipate this to be a 9- to 12-month process before we have a final decision.
Clinical evidence supporting strong effectiveness of the CardioMEMS heart failure system continues to grow, with more than 30 key publications and abstracts published to date. We are pleased that The Journal of the American College of Cardiology recently accepted for publication data that was presented at the 2015 HRS meeting. This retrospective analysis of the CHAMPION trial data shows monitoring pulmonary artery pressure is able to prompt therapeutic changes that improve heart failure management and, in turn, reduce hospitalizations. 
As importantly, we continue to see real-world commercial experience data that is as strong as or stronger than our initial CHAMPION data. For example, real-world data recently presented at The American College of Cardiology annual meeting showed improved quality of life metrics and improvements in exercise capacity for patients monitored with our CardioMEMS device. We believe real-world data, combined with the growing body of clinical evidence in support of CardioMEMS, continues to demonstrate the tremendous value this important technology offers for improving patient care and reducing overall costs. 
To increase our focus on expanding the market for CardioMEMS and LVADs, we have leveraged the legacy Thoratec sales structure to form a combined dedicated U.S. heart failure organization. Our first quarter sales give us confidence that we are on track to achieve our previously issued sales guidance of $65 million in 2016. 
We closed on our acquisition of Thoratec about 6 months ago, and our integration process is essentially complete. This important milestone is a full quarter ahead of our initial expectations. As Don mentioned, LVAD sales in the quarter were strong. Much of this success can be linked to our integration efforts that have included a strong focus on clinical in sales execution and the improved clinical experience that our customers have observed with HeartMate 3. Customers have also shared that they have enjoyed a seamless transition without disruption over the course of this integration process. Since its launch in October 2015, we have implanted HeartMate 3 in centers across 15 different countries internationally and are now implanting in all 4 of the largest heart failure centers in Germany, which make up approximately 20% of the European LVAD market. Access to these accounts can be attributed to the strong relationships that St. Jude Medical has cultivated over the years. 
There will be a number of presentations later this month at the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplant (sic) [ International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation ] meeting supporting both HeartMate 2 and 3, including HeartMate 3 CE Mark 12-month data and real-world experience in the Kazakhstan study.
Turning to our CRT portfolio. We recently received FDA approval for our MultiPoint Pacing, or MPP, technology for our Quadra CRT-D and CRT-P devices, along with 2 complementary Quartet left ventricular leads, further strengthening our differentiation in the treatment of heart failure. 
MPP is a first-to-market technology provided only by St. Jude Medical, which we believe will become the next standard of care in CRT therapy and builds upon our success as the leader in CRT therapy options. In addition to MPP, we intend on adding a feature to our CRT portfolio called SYNCAV, which is in response to the growing importance of CRT optimization. We expect this technology to be available to customers in the U.S. during the second quarter of 2016.
Our European experience has shown that MPP can provide improved acute hemodynamic response as well as an improved chronic responder rate for CRT therapy. Recent data presented at ACC demonstrated optimization of LV pacing sites by means of hemodynamic and electrical delay plus MPP resulted in statistically significant improvements in New York Heart Association class heart failure Packer index and remodeling versus standard CRT therapy. We will present data at the upcoming Heart Rhythm Society meeting in May, as we were recently informed that the results from our IDE trial have been accepted to be presented as a late-breaking clinical trial session. We also recently completed enrollment in our 1,800-patient MORE-CRT MPP Study, which will provide the largest data set regarding the ability of MPP to reduce the percentage of patients who are nonresponders to CRT. Other studies are also expected to be published in the near term that demonstrate MPP's effectiveness in improving the response to CRT at 1 year.
With MPP, we have continued to advance CRT therapy by delivering better outcomes for patients and physicians. We believe this is an important next-generation technology that differentiates St. Jude Medical and will allow us to grow our market share in this important segment as well as in CRT-P, where we are already the clear market leader.
Moving to our traditional CRM business. First quarter dynamics were similar to those experienced in the fourth quarter of 2015. While we continue to experience challenge in this business, particularly in the U.S., we continue to believe our competitive position will improve throughout the year.
In Japan, we launched our MRI-safe ICD, which drove strong high-voltage performance in that geography, and we expect our pending launch of MPP to continue to strengthen our CRM business in Japan.
Turning to our U.S. high-voltage business. I would like to highlight that we are still on track to begin our global IDE trial for the MRI-safe ICD with first implants in Europe later this month and remain on track for a U.S. launch during the first half of 2017. 
Earlier this quarter, Nanostim received its CE Mark for MRI compatibility. St. Jude Medical has long been at the forefront of leadless pacing technology. We look forward to bringing Nanostim, the world's longest-lasting leadless pacemaker with the industry's least invasive and smallest delivery system, to the market to ensure broad patient access to this important therapy. We continue to work with FDA regarding our Nanostim leadless pacemaker and continue to expect FDA approval of Nanostim in the second half of 2016.
In the U.S., we remain in discussions with FDA regarding approval of our Assurity MRI pacemaker, which is the smallest and longest-lasting device in the market. Based on these discussions, we now expect approval and launch of our Assurity MRI pacemakers in the second half of 2016. We think not having an MRI-compatible pacemaker until the second half of 2016 will cost us approximately $15 million to $20 million in 2016 revenue. However, we are not changing our total sales guidance because we believe continued improvement in U.S. field execution and our strong expected product cadence in our broader electrophysiology business will offset that gap.
The CRM market remains an important area of our business and is a vital part of the care continuum for patients who suffer from a variety of cardiovascular diseases. I want to emphasize that we think about our traditional CRM products in context of the overall electrophysiology business because that is how our customers make purchasing decisions. Both our sales organization and our customers are excited about the strength of our entire electrophysiology pipeline that is expected yet this year.
For instance, while sales from our next-generation Confirm Insertable Cardiac Monitor (sic) [ Confirm Implantable Cardiac Monitor ], or ICM, will not be reported in our traditional CRM category, once approved, we believe this product will be a driver for our CRM business. As a reminder, we believe this next-generation Confirm will be a disruptor in the market and a significant differentiator for St. Jude Medical. We anticipate this device will be the first commercially available Bluetooth-enabled and smartphone-capable ICM. We are on track to submit for U.S. and European regulatory approvals in the second half of 2016.
So while our traditional CRM business continues to be under pressure, particularly in the U.S., we are continuing to work on getting MRI-compatible low voltage approved in 2016 and high-voltage products to market in the first half of 2017. 
At the same time, we are continuing to grow other related segments of our business. In electrophysiology, this pipeline includes our next-generation Confirm Insertable Cardiac Monitor (sic) [ Confirm Implantable Cardiac Monitor ] MultiPoint Pacing, EnSite Precision, Nanostim and SYNCAV product launches, which are all on track and will allow us to continue to contract competitively with hospitals, offset traditional CRM share loss and set the stage for traditional CRM share recapture in 2017.
Turning to our AF business, where our comprehensive product portfolio is again a key differentiator for St. Jude Medical, we saw a 9% growth in the quarter. We're excited about our AF position given the strong cadence of new launches and consistent double-digit growth across our TactiCath and FlexAbility ablation catheters. 
We expect to continue our successful limited launch of EnSite Precision in Europe and will initiate a full launch in Europe during the second quarter. In the U.S., we filed our regulatory submissions associated with EnSite Precision in the first quarter and expect to initiate a full launch of our new EnSite Precision system in the U.S. in the second half of 2016. This will be the largest and most comprehensive launch in the history of our AF portfolio and stands to revolutionize the cardiac mapping segment with a flexible, precise and automated mapping system. 
To date, more than 600 procedures have been performed with EnSite Precision in Europe with existing EnSite users as well as by KOLs, who have historically favored competitive systems. Feedback on the use of EnSite Precision has been overwhelmingly positive in regards to stability, reliability, speed and unique features, including the AutoMap system. Included in this launch will be a series of sensor-enabled catheters that will allow further penetration of our proprietary MediGuide platform. 
We continue to view our AF business as a highlight in 2016 as we gain share with the successful launch of EnSite Precision and the continued adoption of both TactiCath and FlexAbility. We expect to leverage this strong portfolio of new products in conjunction with our CRM business to strengthen our contracting position with U.S. hospitals.
Our first quarter neuromodulation results represent another bright spot in the quarter as we continued to successfully execute against our strategy of surrounding chronic pain with spinal cord stimulation, or SCS, as well as DRG and radiofrequency ablation. We grew 10% in the first quarter and believe we took share with our innovative SCS platform. Plans are under way to establish St. Jude Medical's proprietary Burst therapy as a new standard advanced waveform in SCS and to achieve superior pain relief across rechargeable and recharge-free devices. We saw strong growth in our international SCS business with continued adoption of Burst therapy, growing approximately twice the international SCS market growth rate. We remain on track and are preparing to bring our Burst Technology to the U.S. in the second half of 2016.
We are pleased with the progress we are making with the launch of PROCLAIM, the only upgradable recharge-free device on the market, which is expanding the SCS market as the adoption of this technology is moving more quickly than originally modeled. In fact, we are noticing a significant shift in our SCS product mix to PROCLAIM. This momentum signals to us that physicians are highly interested in implanting products that provide them the ability to upgrade software platforms to instantly access new technology upon regulatory approval and that customers realize the benefits of a device that does not require recharging. 
Our Axium Neurostimulator System for DRG, or dorsal root ganglion, stimulation expands our chronic pain portfolio in the almost $2 billion chronic pain market to treat patients who suffer from Complex Regional Pain Syndrome and positions DRG therapy as a clinically validated market expansion story. The recent 12-month follow-up data on DRG presented at NANS last December demonstrated DRG stimulation sustained superior pain relief and improve therapeutic targeting. Since our commercial launch in the U.S. a few weeks ago, we have received strong enthusiasm from the clinical community and are on track to complete approximately 100 cases in the first month. We have implanted a successful training program with initial case experiences going very smoothly, providing life-changing results for patients.
We have begun to implant our innovative Infinity DBS platform in Europe, with the first cases happening earlier this month. We continue to expect FDA approval in the second half of 2016. We believe our Infinity platform is the first platform engineered to fuel patient independence with an app-based Bluetooth wireless communication platform and our directional lead technology. This is a first-of-its-kind technology, providing a more patient-centric, intuitive technology for patients battling Parkinson's disease, essential tremor and dystonia. We continue to be excited with the potential that our neuromodulation business offers as these products are launched and adopted worldwide.
Turning to our cardiovascular portfolio. We continue to execute on our innovation strategy with a focus of bringing to market new technology that will allow us to take share while supporting market growth in our more traditional business segments. We remain encouraged by the momentum of our Portico TAVR system, which continued from last year into the first quarter. We saw implants per week increase throughout the past 2 quarters and continue to receive positive reviews regarding Portico's ease of delivery, hemodynamic performance and reduced need for pacemaker implants relative to next-generation valves.
The IDE study continues to enroll, and we are targeting complete enrollment in the study in the second half of 2016. Additionally, our next-generation tissue valve, Trifecta with Glide Technology, just launched this month in Europe and with an expected launch in the U.S. during the second quarter. 
In regards to our PFO closure device, we look forward to the FDA panel meeting that has now been scheduled for May 24. Recall that at last year's Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics conference, 10-year follow-up RESPECT data showed in the attempt to treat arm of the study that when subsequent strokes were restricted to cryptogenic stroke, there was a 54% relative risk reduction in recurrent cryptogenic stroke to the PFO closure group as compared to medical management. This compelling data was statistically significant.
Our HeartMate Percutaneous Heart Pump, or PHP, device addresses a large, growing market and provides meaningful enhancements to the available competitive offerings. Enrolling patients in this IDE study continues to be a high priority for us, and we are gaining traction as we are adding several high-volume centers in the U.S. In addition, we continue to have good discussions with the FDA regarding our renal denervation IDE study, and we continue to expect to begin that study later this year.
During the first quarter, we demonstrated our ability to execute against our strategy, deliver on our investment in innovation and drive market demand for our products. With 10 product approvals and major product launches in key regions in the first quarter, we are off to a good start in 2016. We are on track to do what we said we were going to do in terms of delivering sales and adjusted EPS growth. We continue to gain momentum in heart failure with our recent launch of MPP and strong results from our HeartMate portfolio. In AF, we are demonstrating strong growth with continued share gain in ablation catheters and an unprecedented opportunity with the launch of EnSite Precision. Our neuromodulation business continues to be a bright spot with above-market growth due to our innovative product portfolio. We have a path for traditional CRM share recapture and believe our expected product cadence in our electrophysiology business sets the stage for momentum in 2017. 
This is a challenging but exciting time for St. Jude Medical. I believe that we are focused on the right objectives. As the health care environment continues to evolve, we are building new capabilities and expanding our comprehensive solutions for the treatment of expensive epidemic disease. Our focus on innovation and execution is driving results, and we have never been better positioned for worldwide market leadership in atrial fibrillation, heart failure and neuromodulation. 
Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'd like to open the call up for questions."

The thing to remember about our traditional CRM business is you have to look at it in context of the overall EP business. And that's the way the EP is looking at this business. So product launches across EP are just critically important. And of course, MPP would be a great example. We've talked a lot about MPP, and we really need to work to make sure that this technology is fully appreciated by our customers and, frankly, by The Street. It's not simply an iteration of quadripolar technology. MPP was developed to really solve a significant problem that the EP has in the CRT-D MP space, which is the nonresponder group. This -- in some centers, they'll tell you it's as high as 30%. So the idea that there is now a technology that will help reduce the amount of nonresponders, it's significant not just in patient care but also as it relates to the cost of care. Secondly, there's a technology that we're introducing, SYNCAV, and when you take the combination of optimized location, optimization of the management of the device as well as optimized timing, we think the results can be even more promising than we're seeing now. So HRS will be an exciting time for us. The paper has been accepted there, and that's where the initial data will come out. The other -- second factor is MORE-CRT. That's going to be the largest study ever. And over the years, as you look at technologies like quad where you begin to change the way medicine is practiced and actually set the standard of care, it often requires multiple studies and multiple trials. MPP will have 2 significant trials with MORE-CRT just completing and now going to the process of follow-up and over 60 publications and papers drafted about single-site performance of the product. So we think that, that cadence of products going into the second half will be extremely important for us to offset the delay in our labeling for MRI. And as we pointed out, we think that delay is approximately $5 million a quarter. And with the cadence of products that we anticipate coming into the market, we're confident that we'll be able to offset that. As it relates to the delay, we've been working closely with the FDA on this. And remember, this is a full PMA, requiring review from both the pharma and device side. We believe that we've been working very closely with them over the last several months particularly and think we're on a good track to meet the requirements that they've outlined. I would say that as we look at the submission, we have high confidence that we'll get to the results that are required, and we decided it would be prudent to move the time out and make sure that this submission is appropriate, on track and will be successful. And so that's the delay that we have. We think it's a manageable delay when you look at the overall product cadence. And we also think that we will in fact achieve the labeling this year."

And the performance of HeartMate 3 in the study has been not only very well received but it I think is really setting the standard here, and we're looking forward to the data being presented and clarifying just how good the performance of the product has been. The -- as it relates to building out our sales force specifically targeted in Europe, we're moving from independent to direct on a country-by-country basis. That process and progress is ahead of schedule. We specifically targeted Germany. It's the most important market in Europe. And the team -- the sales team over there has really executed at a very high level. We're now in the 4 key sites, are contracting, or in Europe, the tender process is being developed, and we think that we're on track to continue to take share in Europe as well as the U.S. The last comment I'd like to make about the Thoratec integration, the hard part of acquisitions is always in the outcome associated with the integration, and it's really been a very successful integration with excellent results, both internationally, U.S. and in the division itself. In the U.S., we're so pleased with the performance of that team that we thought it would be a good idea, and we're seeing the early results here, of actually combining our CardioMEMS team in with that heart failure group led by that senior executive, Ed Recklin [ph], who's done a great job in transition. The results so far have indicated that our implant rates continue to improve, giving us confidence that we can achieve the target of $65 million by year-end. So I think we're on a good track from both a product standpoint, the combination of heart failure and access to the top labs and sales forces around the world that are very focused at launching new technology and taking share. So with that, let me turn it over to Eric. He's got laryngitis, but he is going to [indiscernible]."

Since the presentations are still upcoming, I don't want to give too many details, but I'd recommend that you -- that everybody attend the sessions and read about that to get a better idea of the details surrounding the strokes. As we've looked at the individual events, we don't see any systematic trends that are concerning. Also, keep in mind that the CE Mark study represents the very initial experience with the HeartMate 3. And there's always a learning curve with all devices, but especially with LVADs and getting a feel for the appropriate implant techniques. I'd also say that just in our commercial experience, we're monitoring that, as you might imagine, very carefully, and we don't see any signals that would raise any concerns."

So the International numbers were strong and driven to a large extent by the expansion of MPP.

So Europe, Asia and Latin America all had pretty strong performance. And in the markets where we had MPP, we clearly had an advantage in growth. On the -- in the U.S., it came down to a series of changes that we made, both organizationally, a refocusing of the field and resetting the expectations around what we want to achieve in 2016. And one of the big factors in the national sales meeting that we conducted was laying out the pipeline and getting people ready to go into the market with a significant series of new products. And so this is always exciting to the EP community, when they have an opportunity to meet with our sales reps and our sales management and we lay out the product cadence and we talk about how we can bring that technology into their site. And one of the areas that's probably most exciting is the lab, the fully integrated lab. So when you think about the technology required to do that, it is unique to St. Jude Medical. We are the only company that can provide a full highly advanced, the most advanced, EP lab in the world. And going in and talking about our product portfolio in that context re-energizes the electrophysiologists and reminds them of the innovations St. Jude Medical is bringing into the market. So I think that probably has helped us from an execution standpoint. And again, we absolutely believe that in the context of these product approvals and the achievement of that MRI labeling, if you look in Japan, for instance, where they received the labeling, they're up high double digits in the aftermath of the approval of that label. So we think as we get towards the end of '16 and we develop a momentum going into '17, we will be a share recapture story in the traditional CRM space."

We've had very positive discussions with the CMS organization. We've put together with their guidance and with the guidance of several different advocacies and constituents, physicians in ACC and so forth, the heart failure community have all stepped up and are participating in this process. And the data -- as I know you know, the data continues to get better. And what we're caught in here is not unusual, I think, on a go-forward basis. It's our understanding that CMS is very busy. It's one of the reasons that our submission hasn't been accepted yet is that the local MACs are becoming more and more restrictive as it relates to cost management. And innovation is now going to either be delayed or go through a more torturous path to get to the patient community. And the local MACs, not all of them, but some of the local MACs look at an annual budget and they're managing within an annual budget. When you look at the value proposition of a product like CardioMEMS, it's 2, 3, 5, 10 years of value working against a system that's looking at an annual perspective. So if you want to put in context why we had the problem, well, that's the cause of the problem. The idea that we'll go through the process, one point that we just learned is that CMS has extended the add-on payment in their latest ruling. So they remain committed and positive about the technology. And we think that we'll have to go through this process. And quite frankly, unless there's some changes from a legislative perspective, other companies are going to have to go through this same process as it relates to reimbursement. On the more positive side, I'd say that some of the private payers are starting to show interest and are beginning to work with us as well as the VA. And so we have not completely abandoned those areas with Novitas and FCSO. There are still people that are committed to the technology and are using it. So the fact is that we're going to go through the process. We've scheduled a number that we think is achievable. And again, I talked about positive implant rates, a nice reduction in stock shelf. That ratio has now crossed over. And we're feeling positive about the centers that are open, beginning to use CardioMEMS in a -- in their normal course of treatment, and that was the goal. And so we'll build a beachhead. We'll work to achieve the NCD. And I think that we will truly end up with the standard of care in heart failure management with CardioMEMS."

The strategy that we refer to often is surrounding these disease states where we want the deepest and broadest portfolios, and we are certainly on track to achieve that. In AF, we will be first to market with advanced sensor-enabled catheters. We have both the FlexAbility and the TactiCath, and I'd like to remind you that we do not have TactiCath in Japan until the second half of '16, and we do not have TactiCath or FlexAbility in China until the end of the year, beginning of '17 depending on how the regulatory process rolls out. So the results have been, to a large extent, in Europe and the U.S. And we're talking about mid-teens growth in the ablation segment with right now a pause, if you will, on the capital side as physicians and hospitals are waiting for Precision. The -- but the depth and breadth of the AF and the ability to sit and meet with physicians, I had a team in, I got to meet some personally about 1 1/2 weeks ago and just how impressed they are when they come in. And we have an entire lab and they're working in an entire suite. And every component that they require to do an AF case, including all of the tools, and at this point I'd say we have the most advanced tools, are all there and will be introduced into the market this year and next year. The -- so on AF, we're extremely positive. We do think the EP does look at their specialty as device and AF in many cases. And so there is the pull-through opportunity. There is the collective contracting opportunity. And so there's areas for us to exercise strategically across that -- the broadest platform available in the market. In neuro, it's a real success story for us because we have not fully launched the entire portfolio. And if you look at our growth in Europe with Burst, you're talking about high double-digit growth in Europe with Burst Technology. The platform, both the rechargeable and the recharge-free technologies, the peripherals are now on a smart technology. So patients are using and doctors are using iPads and iTouch, all far advanced, from a Bluetooth capability, of any of our competitors. The DBS System and the opportunity to get into the DBS system with another breakthrough technology in the Infinity lead, where we can steer the energy and provide the physician more options and opportunities to work with patients, a lot of excitement about that launch yet this year.

And the DRG story is still really unfolding here. The U.S. demand for DRG, it's a little bit more complicated relative to reimbursement outside the U.S., a little bit more straightforward in the U.S. And the -- we are struggling to keep up with the training demand from patients -- from physicians who want to treat patients. I'll also say that -- and it's north of 60% we're estimating early on here, are patients that would not be considered for standard SCS devices. And so you're looking at the potential of a 2-market expansion story that could develop year-over-year. So when you look at that portfolio, you look at where we are, just like in AF and what we're building out in heart failure, we're at the early end of the process in RF ablation. We've got the most advanced SCS system. We're bringing advanced waveforms in. We're the only company that can upgrade waveform technology and advances in the industry without an explant.

Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our second quarter 2016 financial results as well as a schedule detailing reported and comparable constant currency sales results by business area. This press release is available",671,"Thank you, Mike. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our second quarter 2016 financial results as well as a schedule detailing reported and comparable constant currency sales results by business area. This press release is available on the St. Jude Medical website. For participants on today's call, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on a comparable constant currency basis, which includes Thoratec sales in both comparable years, and are adjusted for the impact of currency. 
Sales for the quarter totaled $1,562,000,000, up 2% from the second quarter of last year. Unfavorable foreign currency translations decreased this quarter's sales by approximately $6 million. 
During the second quarter, we recognized $67 million or $0.23 per share in net after-tax special charges, acquisition-related costs and amortization expense. For further information regarding these items, please refer to details provided in our press release. Comments during this call referencing second quarter results will be exclusive of these items. 
Adjusted earnings per share were $1.06 for the second quarter of 2016 compared to adjusted EPS of $1.03 in the second quarter of 2015. We estimate that on a constant currency basis, second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 7%. 
Before we discuss our second quarter 2016 sales results by product category, let me provide a few comments about currency exchange rates. As discussed on prior calls, the 2 most significant currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the second quarter 2016, we used exchange rates, which assume that each euro will translate into about $1.11 to $1.16; and for the yen, each JPY 106 to JPY 111 will translate into USD 1. For the second quarter, the actual average exchange rates for the euro and the yen were consistent with these ranges. I will now walk through second quarter results in our new product categories: Heart failure, atrial fibrillation, neuromodulation, cardiovascular and traditional cardiac rhythm management. 
For the second quarter, total heart failure sales were $384 million, down 1% from last year's second quarter. Sales results reflect strong global growth in LVAD sales, offset by the impact of U.S. CRM sales weakness in our CRT product segment. 
Atrial fibrillation or AF product sales for the second quarter totaled $324 million, up 13%. Our worldwide AF business again demonstrated strong growth with the continued adoption of our ablation catheter portfolio and our initial launch of EnSite Precision in European markets. 
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the second quarter of 2016 were $140 million, up approximately 20% as we continue to take share on a global basis with the most comprehensive neuromodulation portfolio in the market. 
Total traditional CRM sales for the second quarter of 2016 were $395 million, down 7%. Sales results were largely driven by weakness in U.S., which declined primarily due to MRI product gaps in both our low-voltage and ICD product segments. 
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the second quarter of 2016 were $319 million, up 2%. 
Turning to the income statement. The gross profit margin during the second quarter were 69.3%, down 100 basis points from the second quarter of 2015, primarily due to a decline of 90 basis points related to the negative impact of currency. Additionally, there was a 60 basis point decline related to the continued weakness in our higher-margin U.S. CRM business. These negative factors were partially offset by the year-over-year benefit of the repeal of the Medical Device Excise Tax, which improved our gross profit margin in the quarter by 60 basis points. 
Our second quarter SG&A expenses were 31.2% of net sales, 130 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2015. Research and development expenses in the second quarter were 12.3% of net sales. Other expense was $43 million in the second quarter, primarily driven by interest expense on our outstanding debt. And our effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 15.3%. 
I will now turn it back to Mike."

I appreciate everyone joining us this morning. As you heard, second quarter results were in line with previously issued guidance. Our momentum continues to build across our business with numerous product approvals and launches. In internat",2319,"Thank you, Don. I appreciate everyone joining us this morning. As you heard, second quarter results were in line with previously issued guidance. Our momentum continues to build across our business with numerous product approvals and launches. In international markets, where we generally have more products available for sale, we grew 7% on a comparable constant currency basis. The strong performance of our international business gives us confidence that where we have a full portfolio of emerging technologies, including MRI safe devices, HeartMate 3, EnSite Precision and our proprietary Burst technology, we can deliver the top-tier growth that we expect. As an organization, we remain focused on our strategic plan of surrounding the states and delivering results we committed to earlier this year. Our results this quarter, particularly in our international business, continue to give us confidence that our strategy will bring us back to top-tier growth. 
Starting with our heart failure portfolio. Through our strategic acquisitions and organic growth, we have created the broadest and most innovative heart failure medical device portfolio in the world. Our investment in this space illustrates our commitment to work with governments, hospitals and physicians on solutions for this global expensive epidemic disease. In the second quarter, we launched MultiPoint Pacing, or MPP, in the U.S. and are executing on our contracting strategy for this breakthrough treatment option for CRT patients who are not responsive to other pacing options. The clinical evidence for MPP is growing, with data showing more improved acute and chronic hemodynamic response, which includes increased injection fraction rates and improved reverse modeling. We also have evidence demonstrating improved clinical heart failure response rates. MPP adoption increased throughout the quarter, and initial feedback in the U.S. has been positive with electrophysiologists' understanding need for this technology to help reduce nonresponder rates. Nonresponder rates account for about 1/3 of the total population of patients receiving CRT therapy. 
We are also excited about recent and upcoming launches in the U.S., Europe and Japan for our SYNCAV CRT software algorithm, which automatically adjusts pacing based on real-time changes in A patient's cardiac condition. This technology provides yet another option for patients who are not responsive to traditional pacing solutions and also helps physicians further improve treatment of patients who have responded positively to traditional CRT. We view this expanded portfolio as establishing a new standard of care in CRT. 
Our CardioMEMS heart failure system is the cornerstone of our heart failure portfolio, and we are committed to ensuring there is established reimbursement and clear guidelines for this important technology. Recently, the European Society of Cardiology included CardioMEMS in its issued guidelines as directed therapy management and as a monitoring tool for heart failure patients. We view this recognition of the clinical importance of CardioMEMS by a leading medical society as a sign of the growing support for this technology. 
As previously mentioned, we have also filed for national coverage determination with CMS and are awaiting formal acceptance for our submission from the agency. 
In the LVAD space, we have completed the integration of Thoratec and are pleased with the results and strong adoption of HeartMate 3 by the clinical community. Since the launch of HeartMate 3 last October, feedback from customers continues to reflect the positive clinical outcomes experienced in the CE Mark trial. We continue to capture share in international markets and are pleased with the approximately 50% comparable constant-currency growth of our international LVAD business. 
In addition to our strong results, the clinical evidence surrounding HeartMate 3 continues to grow. The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplant held its Annual Meeting in April, featuring very positive data on both HeartMate 2 and 3, including the HeartMate 3's CE Mark 12-month data and real-world experience in the Kazakhstan study. The roadmap study also showed that 48% of patients at 2 years improved at least 1 New York heart Association class compared to only 13% in the optimal medical management group. Additionally, 30-day mortality within the LVAD group was only 1%, which is equivalent to optimal medical management. Looking ahead, we expect to present the HeartMate 3 U.S. IDE short-term data before the end of this year. 
Moving to our global AF business. It grew by 13% driven by continued success of our ablation catheter business and a limited European launch of our new EnSite Precision Cardiac Mapping System. Our comprehensive AF product portfolio is a key differentiator for St. Jude Medical. It demonstrates our core strength in surrounding disease state with the most innovative and complete solution across multiple product segment such as access, guidance, diagnostics, visualization, recording, mapping, navigation and advanced ablation. AF remains one of the most attractive MedTech markets, and we believe we are well positioned for future growth with EnSite Precision. We are encouraged by the results to date of our launch in Europe with over 3,000 cases already performed and continued positive feedback. 
Our advanced mapping portfolio grew approximately 20% constant currency in Europe with EnSite Precision as compared to essentially flat growth in the U.S. where we await approval. We continue to expect U.S. approval and launch of EnSite Precision in the second half of 2016. 
I will now turn to our neuromodulation business. We continue to capture share in our neuromodulation business and grow at above market rates as illustrated by second quarter global constant currency growth of 20%. This is the seventh consecutive quarter in which we have taken share. Since the U.S. launch of our DRG system, we have received positive feedback from our customers with the field experiencing exceptional outcomes and trialing [ph] success during our targeted rollout phase. DRG is designed for focal pain conditions, often characterized by nerve injury, and it can be debilitating to patients. Our early real-world experience confirm our findings in the ACCURATE IDE study, which demonstrated sustained and superior pain relief over tonic [ph] stimulation. We view DRG as a market expansion story and part of our larger strategy to surround chronic pain. 
Another bright spot in our neuromodulation portfolio is Burst technology. We continue to see strong enthusiasm in the international markets and still expect FDA approval in the second half of 2016. We are also encouraged by the broader adoption of our advanced SCS therapies and have seen a shift to our nonrechargeable prodigy platform, which now makes up approximately 50% of our U.S. mix. Although still early, we are hearing very positive feedback on the launch of our new Infinity deep brain stimulation or DBS system and directional lead in Europe. This system is available in maintenance-free and long-lasting recharge free systems. Similar to our SCS systems, the Infinity platform is upgradable, which provides patients the potential to access new therapy advances as they are approved. The U.S. market makes up more than half of the $500 million global DBS market with only 1 competitor. We are very excited about our innovation here and remain on track for U.S. approval in the second half of 2016. With the most comprehensive neuromodulation technology, we expect to remain share-takers for the foreseeable future. 
In our cardiovascular portfolio, we had several important regulatory and sales milestones that support our ability to execute on our innovation strategy, bringing to market new technologies to take share while supporting market growth in our more traditional business segments. We were pleased by the positive outcome of the FDA PFO panel in May. The advisory panel responded favorably to the technology and clinical results, voting that the safety, effectiveness and benefits of the [indiscernible] or PFO occluder outweigh potential risks. This device presents an important treatment option for patients with a PFO who have suffered a stroke of unknown cause and live at risk and in fear of suffering additional strokes. The discussion during the meeting and resulting vote is an important step toward approval of the technology in the U.S. We look forward to additional discussions with the FDA in the coming months and expect approval in the second half of this year. 
Our Portico sales during the quarter were strong which supports our belief that we can take share in the TAVR market in Europe. In the U.S., we continue to accelerate enrollment in our IDE study and recently received approval to add global sites. Implanting physicians tell us that our TAVR device is the easiest to use and they are impressed with our device retrievability and low pacemaker rate. Our success during the quarter gives us confidence that our TAVR program will drive growth in the future. 
Building on our foundation of leadership in heart valve technology, we launched our next-generation Trifecta with Glide Technology in Europe and in the U.S. during the quarter and are executing on our launch plan. We're in the middle of a successful product launch in Europe and expect to see similar results in the U.S. as we expand the rollout. While surgical valves as a segment is declining, we view it as an important part of our comprehensive strategy of surrounding disease states in general and valvular heart disease more specifically. 
Our game-changing OCT technology was a bright spot in the quarter, growing nearly 20% on a constant currency basis. These results were driven by our new OPTIS mobile system with angiographic coregistration an, enhanced state optimization software. OPTIS mobile offers physicians an efficient way to optimize catheter-based procedures in the treatment of vascular disease by combining diagnostic tools designed to improve patient outcomes into 1 portable device. The imaging advancements offered with the OPTIS Mobile System allow physicians to clearly visualize complex cardiac anatomy and evaluate how to best proceed during percutaneous coronary interventions or PCI. 
In addition, we have received positive physician feedback on our OPTIS metallic stand optimization software, which is available in some international markets and delivers tools to further improve stent sizing and placement while providing deployment and placement assessment with drug eluting and metal stents. Our PCI optimization business grew approximately 9% constant currency during the quarter, which gives us confidence that we are focused on the right markets with the right technology to generate strong growth for the foreseeable future. 
While we continue to see pressure in our more mature cardiovascular businesses, we remain confident that we are focused on Apple's [ph] based technologies in the appropriate growth area such as PCI optimization, TAVR and Percutaneous Heart Pumps to help drive growth back to the mid-single digits on an annual basis. 
Moving toward traditional CRM business. Similar to the past several quarters, our U.S. CRM business was challenged, primarily due to the MRI safe product gap in both low- and high-voltage devices. We remain confident that this issue is transient and will resolve itself once we receive FDA approval of our MRI safe pacemakers and ICDs, which we continue to expect in the second half of 2016 and the first half of 2017, respectively. As we have said in the past, our experience in international markets shows that once we receive approval for these devices, our share returns in short order. The most recent example of this was in Japan, where we received approval early this year for our MRI-safe ICD, which led to Japan ICD growth revenue of over 30% constant currency in the second quarter. It is this experience and our continued ability to gain share in Europe that give us confidence our share will return once we receive approval of MRI-safe devices in the U.S. 
In the evolving health care landscape, it is more important than ever to be able to work with our customers to contract along the cardiovascular service line. We believe we are unrivaled in the depth and breadth of our AF, heart failure and CRM portfolio, particularly once we receive MRI-safe labeling. We are already able to offer contracting solutions to our customers with important innovation in markets where we are improved, including MPP, SYNCAV, EnSite Precision, LAA closure, Nanostim, ablation catheters. And once approved, we look forward to including the next-generation, disruptive confirm and insertable cardiac monitor technology. In fact, I think we are better positioned now than ever before to work with the electrophysiologist in every case. We look forward to bringing this technology to the U.S. in the near future to drive growth similar to what we have seen in our international markets. 
Before we conclude, I would like to give a brief update on our pending transaction with Abbott. It has been about 80 days since we announced the transaction, and I've spent a lot of time with [indiscernible] Abbott's Chairman and CEO. I'm confident that we will bring together 2 industry leaders with shared passion for patients, innovation and a strong team culture. We have established an integration team with functional area leaders from our respective organizations working to prepare for a seamless integration after the deal closes, which we currently expect to occur by the end of 2016. While we are still early in the process, I can share that employees are extremely excited about the opportunity for our combined organization to be even more competitive in the market. Together, we will hold #1 or #2 market positions across a broad range of cardiovascular diseases, as well as in diabetes, chronic pain, movement disorders and vision care. I thought it would be worth mentioning that since the announcement, I've had many opportunities to hear from our customers, patients, investors and other external stakeholders that I've been extremely encouraged that the vast majority of people I've spoken with share our enthusiasm for this transaction. The strategic rationale was clear as is our shared vision to create the world's premier medical device company. I am confident in the power of our combined organization and its significant impact we can have on helping physicians and patients around the world. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, we will conclude the call and turn it back over to the moderator for replay information."

In the second quarter, we launched MultiPoint Pacing, or MPP, in the U.S. and are executing on our contracting strategy for this breakthrough treatment option for CRT patients who are not responsive to other pacing options. The clinical evidence for MPP is growing, with data showing more improved acute and chronic hemodynamic response, which includes increased ejection fraction rates and improved reverse modeling. We also have evidence demonstrating improved clinical heart failure response rates. MPP adoption increased throughout the quarter, and initial feedback in the U.S. has been positive with electrophysiologist understanding need for this technology to help reduce nonresponder rates. Nonresponder rates account for about 1/3 of the total population of patients receiving CRT therapy. 
We are also excited about recent and upcoming launches in the U.S., Europe and Japan for our SyncAV CRT software algorithm, which automatically adjust pacing based on real-time changes in a patient's cardiac condition. This technology provides yet another option for patients who are not responsive to traditional pacing solutions and also helps physicians further improve treatment of patients who have responded positively to traditional CRT. We view this expanded portfolio as establishing a new standard of care in CRT. 
Our CardioMEMS heart failure system is the cornerstone of our heart failure portfolio, and we are committed to ensuring there is established reimbursement and clear guidelines for this important technology. Recently, the European Society of Cardiology included CardioMEMS in its issued guidelines as directive therapy management and as a monitoring tool for heart failure patients. We view this recognition of the clinical importance of CardioMEMS by a leading medical society as a sign of the growing support for this technology. As previously mentioned, we have also filed for national coverage determination with CMS and are awaiting formal acceptance for our submission from the agency. 
In the LVAD space, we have completed the integration of Thoratec and are pleased with the results and strong adoption of HeartMate 3 by the clinical community. Since the launch of HeartMate 3 last October, feedback from customers continues to reflect the positive clinical outcomes experienced in the CE Mark trial. We continue to capture share in international markets and are pleased with the approximately 50% comparable constant currency growth of our international LVAD business. 
In addition to our strong results, the clinical evidence surrounding HeartMate 3 continues to grow. The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplant held its Annual Meeting in April, featuring very positive data on both HeartMate 2 and 3, including the HeartMate 3's CE Mark 12-month data and real-world experience in the Kazakhstan study. The roadmap study also showed that 48% of patients at 2 years improved at least 1 New York Heart Association class compared to only 13% in the optimal medical management group. Additionally, 30-day mortality within the LVAD group was only 1%, which is equivalent to optimal medical management. Looking ahead, we expect to present the HeartMate 3 U.S. IDE short-term data before the end of this year. 
Moving to our global AF business. It grew by 13% driven by continued success of our ablation catheter business and a limited European launch of our new EnSite Precision Cardiac Mapping System. Our comprehensive AF product portfolio is a key differentiator for St. Jude Medical. It demonstrates our core strength in surrounding disease state with the most innovative and complete solution across multiple product segment such as access, guidance, diagnostics, visualization, recording, mapping, navigation and advanced ablation. AF remains one of the most attractive MedTech markets, and we believe we are well positioned for future growth with EnSite Precision. We are encouraged by the results to date of our launch in Europe with over 3,000 cases already performed and continued positive feedback. Our advanced mapping portfolio grew approximately 20% constant currency in Europe with EnSite Precision as compared to essentially flat growth in the U.S., where we await approval. We continue to expect U.S. approval and launch of EnSite Precision in the second half of 2016. 
I will now turn to our neuromodulation business. We continue to capture share in our neuromodulation business and grow at above-market rates as illustrated by second quarter global constant currency growth of 20%. This is the seventh consecutive quarter in which we have taken share. Since the U.S. launch of our DRG system, we have received positive feedback from our customers with the field experiencing exceptional outcomes and trialing success during our targeted rollout phase. DRG is designed for focal pain conditions, often characterized by nerve injury, and it can be debilitating to patients. Our early real-world experience confirm our findings in the ACCURATE IDE study, which demonstrated sustained and superior pain relief over tonic stimulation. We view DRG as a market expansion story and part of our larger strategy to surround chronic pain. 
Another bright spot in our neuromodulation portfolio is Burst Technology. We continue to see strong enthusiasm in the international markets and still expect FDA approval in the second half of 2016. We are also encouraged by the broader adoption of our advanced SCS therapies and have seen a shift to our nonrechargeable prodigy platform, which now makes up approximately 50% of our U.S. mix. Although still early, we are hearing very positive feedback on the launch of our new Infinity deep brain stimulation, or DBS, system and directional lead in Europe. This system is available in maintenance-free and long-lasting recharge-free systems. Similar to our SCS systems, the Infinity platform is upgradable, which provides patients the potential to access new therapy advances as they are approved. The U.S. market makes up more than half of the $500 million global DBS market with only 1 competitor. We are very excited about our innovation here and remain on track for U.S. approval in the second half of 2016. With the most comprehensive neuromodulation technology, we expect to remain share takers for the foreseeable future. 
In our cardiovascular portfolio, we had several important regulatory and sales milestones that support our ability to execute on our innovation strategy, bringing to market new technologies to take share while supporting market growth in our more traditional business segments. We were pleased by the positive outcome of the FDA PFO panel in May. The advisory panel responded favorably to the technology and clinical results, voting that the safety, effectiveness and benefits of the AMPLATZER PFO occluder outweigh potential risks. This device presents an important treatment option for patients with a PFO, who have suffered a stroke of unknown cause and live at risk and in fear of suffering additional strokes. The discussion during the meeting and resulting vote is an important step toward approval of the technology in the U.S. We look forward to additional discussions with the FDA in the coming months and expect approval in the second half of this year. 
Our Portico sales during the quarter were strong, which supports our belief that we can take share in the TAVR market in Europe. In the U.S., we continue to accelerate enrollment in our IDE study and recently received approval to add global sites. Implanting physicians tell us that our TAVR device is the easiest to use, and they are impressed with our device retrievability and low pacemaker rate. Our success during the quarter gives us confidence that our TAVR program will drive growth in the future. 
Building on our foundation of leadership in heart valve technology, we launched our next-generation Trifecta with Glide Technology in Europe and in the U.S. during the quarter and are executing on our launch plan. We are in the middle of a successful product launch in Europe and expect to see similar results in the U.S. as we expand the rollout. While surgical valves as a segment is declining, we view it as an important part of our comprehensive strategy of surrounding disease states in general and valvular heart disease more specifically. 
Our game-changing OCT technology was a bright spot in the quarter, growing nearly 20% on a constant currency basis. These results were driven by our new OPTIS mobile system with angiographic coregistration an, enhanced stent optimization software. OPTIS mobile offers physicians an efficient way to optimize catheter-based procedures for the treatment of vascular disease by combining diagnostic tools designed to improve patient outcomes into 1 portable device. The imaging advancements offered with the OPTIS Mobile System allow physicians to clearly visualize complex cardiac anatomy and evaluate how to best proceed during percutaneous coronary interventions, or PCI. 
In addition, we have received positive physician feedback on our OPTIS metallic stent optimization software, which is available in some international markets and delivers tools to further improve stent sizing and placement, while providing deployment and placement assessment for drug-eluting and bare-metal stents. Our PCI optimization business grew approximately 9% constant currency during the quarter, which gives us confidence that we are focused on the right markets with the right technology to generate strong growth for the foreseeable future. 
While we continue to see pressure in our more mature cardiovascular businesses, we remain confident that we are focused on outcomes-based technologies in the appropriate growth area such as PCI optimization, TAVR and Percutaneous Heart Pumps to help drive growth back to the mid-single digits on an annual basis. 
Moving to our traditional CRM business. Similar to the past several quarters, our U.S. CRM business was challenged, primarily due to the MRI safe product gap in both low- and high-voltage devices. We remain confident that this issue is transient and will resolve itself once we receive FDA approval of our MRI safe pacemakers and ICDs, which we continue to expect in the second half of 2016 and the first half of 2017, respectively. As we have said in the past, our experience in international markets shows that once we receive approval for these devices, our share returns in short order. The most recent example of this was in Japan, where we received approval early this year for our MRI-safe ICD, which led to Japan ICD growth revenue of over 30% constant currency in the second quarter. It is this experience and our continued ability to gain share in Europe that give us confidence our share will return once we receive approval of MRI-safe devices in the U.S. 
In the evolving health care landscape, it is more important than ever to be able to work with our customers to contract along the cardiovascular service line. We believe we are unrivaled in the depth and breadth of our AF, heart failure and CRM portfolio, particularly once we receive MRI-safe labeling. We are already able to offer contracting solutions to our customers with important innovation in markets where we are improved, including MPP, SyncAV, EnSite Precision, LAA closure, Nanostim, ablation catheters. And once approved, we look forward to including the next-generation, disruptive confirm and insertable cardiac monitor technology. In fact, I think we are better positioned now than ever before to work with the electrophysiologist in every case. We look forward to bringing this technology to the U.S. in the near future to drive growth similar to what we have seen in our international markets. 
Before we conclude, I would like to give a brief update on our pending transaction with Abbott. It has been about 80 days since we announced the transaction, and I've spent a lot of time with Miles White, Abbott's Chairman and CEO. I am confident that we will bring together 2 industry leaders with a shared passion for patients, innovation and a strong team culture. We have established an integration team with functional area leaders from our respective organizations working to prepare for a seamless integration after the deal closes, which we currently expect to occur by the end of 2016. While we are still early in the process, I can share that employees are extremely excited about the opportunity for our combined organization to be even more competitive in the market. Together, we will hold #1 or #2 market positions across a broad range of cardiovascular diseases as well as in diabetes, chronic pain, movement disorders and vision care. 
I thought it would be worth mentioning that since the announcement, I've had many opportunities to hear from our customers, patients, investors and other external stakeholders that I've been extremely encouraged that the vast majority of people I've spoken with share our enthusiasm for this transaction. The strategic rationale was clear as is our shared vision to create the world's premier medical device company. I am confident in the power of our combined organization and the significant impact we can have on helping physicians and patients around the world.

Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our second quarter 2016 financial results as well as a schedule detailing reported and comparable constant currency sales results by business area. This press release is available",673,"Thank you, Mike. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our second quarter 2016 financial results as well as a schedule detailing reported and comparable constant currency sales results by business area. This press release is available on the St. Jude Medical website. For participants on today's call, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on a comparable constant currency basis, which includes Thoratec sales in both comparable years and are adjusted for the impact of currency. 
Sales for the quarter totaled $1,562,000,000, up 2% from the second quarter of last year. Unfavorable foreign currency translations decreased this quarter's sales by approximately $6 million. 
During the second quarter, we recognized $67 million or $0.23 per share in net after-tax special charges, acquisition-related costs and amortization expense. For further information regarding these items, please refer to details provided in our press release. Comments during this call referencing second quarter results will be exclusive of these items. 
Adjusted earnings per share were $1.06 for the second quarter of 2016 compared to adjusted EPS of $1.03 in the second quarter of 2015. We estimate that on a constant currency basis, second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 7%. 
Before we discuss our second quarter 2016 sales results by product category, let me provide a few comments about currency exchange rates. As discussed on prior calls, the 2 most significant currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the second quarter 2016, we used exchange rates which assume that each euro would translate into about $1.11 to $1.16. And for the yen, each JPY 106 to JPY 111 would translate into USD 1. For the second quarter, the actual average exchange rates for the euro and the yen were consistent with these ranges. 
I will now walk through second quarter results in our new product categories: heart failure, atrial fibrillation, neuromodulation, cardiovascular and traditional cardiac rhythm management. 
For the second quarter, total heart failure sales were $384 million, down 1% from last year's second quarter. Sales results reflect strong global growth in LVAD sales, offset by the impact of U.S. CRM sales weakness in our CRT product segment. 
Atrial fibrillation, or AF, product sales for the second quarter totaled $324 million, up 13%. Our worldwide AF business again demonstrated strong growth with the continued adoption of our ablation catheter portfolio and our initial launch of EnSite Precision in European markets. 
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the second quarter of 2016 were $140 million, up approximately 20% as we continue to take share on a global basis with the most comprehensive neuromodulation portfolio in the market. 
Total traditional CRM sales for the second quarter of 2016 were $395 million, down 7%. Sales results were largely driven by weakness in the U.S., which declined primarily due to MRI product gaps in both our low-voltage and ICD product segments. 
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the second quarter of 2016 were $319 million, up 2%. 
Turning to the income statement. The gross profit margin during the second quarter was 69.3%, down 100 basis points from the second quarter of 2015, primarily due to a decline of 90 basis points related to the negative impact of currency. Additionally, there was a 60 basis point decline related to the continued weakness in our higher-margin U.S. CRM business. These negative factors were partially offset by the year-over-year benefit of the repeal of the Medical Device Excise Tax, which improved our gross profit margin in the quarter by 60 basis points. 
Our second quarter SG&A expenses were 31.2% of net sales, a 130 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2015. Research and development expenses in the second quarter were 12.3% of net sales. Other expense was $43 million in the second quarter, primarily driven by interest expense on our outstanding debt, and our effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 15.3%. 
I will now turn it back to Mike."

In international markets, where we generally have more products available for sale, we grew 7% on a comparable constant currency basis. The strong performance of our international business gives us confidence that where we have a full portfolio of emerging technologies, including MRI safe devices, HeartMate 3, EnSite Precision and our proprietary Burst Technology, we can deliver the top-tier growth that we expect. 
As an organization, we remain focused on our strategic plan of surrounding disease states and delivering the results we committed to earlier this year.

Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our second quarter 2016 financial results as well as a schedule detailing reported and comparable constant currency sales results by business area. This press release is available",673,"Thank you, Mike. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our second quarter 2016 financial results as well as a schedule detailing reported and comparable constant currency sales results by business area. This press release is available on the St. Jude Medical website. For participants on today's call, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on a comparable constant currency basis, which includes Thoratec sales in both comparable years and are adjusted for the impact of currency. 
Sales for the quarter totaled $1,562,000,000, up 2% from the second quarter of last year. Unfavorable foreign currency translations decreased this quarter's sales by approximately $6 million. 
During the second quarter, we recognized $67 million or $0.23 per share in net after-tax special charges, acquisition-related costs and amortization expense. For further information regarding these items, please refer to details provided in our press release. Comments during this call referencing second quarter results will be exclusive of these items. 
Adjusted earnings per share were $1.06 for the second quarter of 2016 compared to adjusted EPS of $1.03 in the second quarter of 2015. We estimate that on a constant currency basis, second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 7%. 
Before we discuss our second quarter 2016 sales results by product category, let me provide a few comments about currency exchange rates. As discussed on prior calls, the 2 most significant currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the second quarter 2016, we used exchange rates which assume that each euro would translate into about $1.11 to $1.16. And for the yen, each JPY 106 to JPY 111 would translate into USD 1. For the second quarter, the actual average exchange rates for the euro and the yen were consistent with these ranges. 
I will now walk through second quarter results in our new product categories: heart failure, atrial fibrillation, neuromodulation, cardiovascular and traditional cardiac rhythm management. 
For the second quarter, total heart failure sales were $384 million, down 1% from last year's second quarter. Sales results reflect strong global growth in LVAD sales, offset by the impact of U.S. CRM sales weakness in our CRT product segment. 
Atrial fibrillation, or AF, product sales for the second quarter totaled $324 million, up 13%. Our worldwide AF business again demonstrated strong growth with the continued adoption of our ablation catheter portfolio and our initial launch of EnSite Precision in European markets. 
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the second quarter of 2016 were $140 million, up approximately 20% as we continue to take share on a global basis with the most comprehensive neuromodulation portfolio in the market. 
Total traditional CRM sales for the second quarter of 2016 were $395 million, down 7%. Sales results were largely driven by weakness in the U.S., which declined primarily due to MRI product gaps in both our low-voltage and ICD product segments. 
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the second quarter of 2016 were $319 million, up 2%. 
Turning to the income statement. The gross profit margin during the second quarter was 69.3%, down 100 basis points from the second quarter of 2015, primarily due to a decline of 90 basis points related to the negative impact of currency. Additionally, there was a 60 basis point decline related to the continued weakness in our higher-margin U.S. CRM business. These negative factors were partially offset by the year-over-year benefit of the repeal of the Medical Device Excise Tax, which improved our gross profit margin in the quarter by 60 basis points. 
Our second quarter SG&A expenses were 31.2% of net sales, a 130 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2015. Research and development expenses in the second quarter were 12.3% of net sales. Other expense was $43 million in the second quarter, primarily driven by interest expense on our outstanding debt, and our effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 15.3%. 
I will now turn it back to Mike."

As you heard, second quarter results were in line with previously issued guidance. Our momentum continues to build across our business with numerous product approvals and launches. 
In international markets, where we generally have more products available for sale, we grew 7% on a comparable constant currency basis. The strong performance of our international business gives us confidence that where we have a full portfolio of emerging technologies, including MRI safe devices, HeartMate 3, EnSite Precision and our proprietary Burst Technology, we can deliver the top-tier growth that we expect. 
As an organization, we remain focused on our strategic plan of surrounding disease states and delivering the results we committed to earlier this year. Our results this quarter, particularly in our international business, continue to give us confidence that our strategy will bring us back to top-tier growth. 
Starting with our heart failure portfolio. Through our strategic acquisitions and organic growth, we have created the broadest and most innovative heart failure medical device portfolio in the world. Our investment in this space illustrates our commitment to work with governments, hospitals and physicians on solutions for this global expensive epidemic disease. In the second quarter, we launched MultiPoint Pacing, or MPP, in the U.S. and are executing on our contracting strategy for this breakthrough treatment option for CRT patients who are not responsive to other pacing options. The clinical evidence for MPP is growing, with data showing more improved acute and chronic hemodynamic response, which includes increased ejection fraction rates and improved reverse modeling. We also have evidence demonstrating improved clinical heart failure response rates. MPP adoption increased throughout the quarter, and initial feedback in the U.S. has been positive with electrophysiologists understanding need for this technology to help reduce nonresponder rates. Nonresponder rates account for about 1/3 of the total population of patients receiving CRT therapy. 
We are also excited about recent and upcoming launches in the U.S., Europe and Japan for our SyncAV CRT software algorithm, which automatically adjust pacing based on real-time changes in a patient's cardiac condition. This technology provides yet another option for patients who are not responsive to traditional pacing solutions and also helps physicians further improve treatment of patients who have responded positively to traditional CRT. We view this expanded portfolio as establishing a new standard of care in CRT. 
Our CardioMEMS heart failure system is the cornerstone of our heart failure portfolio, and we are committed to ensuring there is established reimbursement and clear guidelines for this important technology. Recently, the European Society of Cardiology included CardioMEMS in its issued guidelines as directed therapy management and as a monitoring tool for heart failure patients. We view this recognition of the clinical importance of CardioMEMS by a leading medical society as a sign of the growing support for this technology. As previously mentioned, we have also filed for national coverage determination with CMS and are awaiting formal acceptance of our submission from the agency. 
In the LVAD space, we have completed the integration of Thoratec and are pleased with the results and strong adoption of HeartMate 3 by the clinical community. Since the launch of HeartMate 3 last October, feedback from customers continues to reflect the positive clinical outcomes experienced in the CE Mark trial. We continue to capture share in international markets and are pleased with the approximately 50% comparable constant currency growth of our international LVAD business. 
In addition to our strong results, the clinical evidence surrounding HeartMate 3 continues to grow. The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplant held its Annual Meeting in April, featuring very positive data on both HeartMate 2 and 3, including the HeartMate 3's CE Mark 12-month data and real-world experience in the Kazakhstan study. The ROADMAP study also showed that 48% of patients at 2 years improved at least 1 New York Heart Association class compared to only 13% in the optimal medical management group. Additionally, 30-day mortality within the LVAD group was only 1%, which is equivalent to optimal medical management. Looking ahead, we expect to present the HeartMate 3 U.S. IDE short-term data before the end of this year. 
Moving to our global AF business. It grew by 13% driven by continued success of our ablation catheter business and a limited European launch of our new EnSite Precision Cardiac Mapping System. Our comprehensive AF product portfolio is a key differentiator for St. Jude Medical. It demonstrates our core strength in surrounding the disease state with the most innovative and complete solution across multiple product segment such as access, guidance, diagnostics, visualization, recording, mapping, navigation and advanced ablation. AF remains one of the most attractive MedTech markets, and we believe we are well positioned for future growth with EnSite Precision. We are encouraged by the results to date of our launch in Europe with over 3,000 cases already performed and continued positive feedback. Our advanced mapping portfolio grew approximately 20% constant currency in Europe with EnSite Precision as compared to essentially flat growth in the U.S., where we await approval. We continue to expect U.S. approval and launch of EnSite Precision in the second half of 2016. 
I will now turn to our neuromodulation business. We continue to capture share in our neuromodulation business and grow at above-market rates as illustrated by second quarter global constant currency growth of 20%. This is the seventh consecutive quarter in which we have taken share. Since the U.S. launch of our DRG system, we have received positive feedback from our customers with the field experiencing exceptional outcomes and trialing success during our targeted rollout phase. DRG is designed for focal pain conditions, often characterized by nerve injury, and it can be debilitating to patients. Our early real-world experience confirm our findings in the ACCURATE IDE study, which demonstrated sustained and superior pain relief over tonic stimulation. We view DRG as a market expansion story and part of our larger strategy to surround chronic pain. 
Another bright spot in our neuromodulation portfolio is Burst Technology. We continue to see strong enthusiasm in the international markets and still expect FDA approval in the second half of 2016. We are also encouraged by the broader adoption of our advanced SCS therapies and have seen a shift to our nonrechargeable Prodigy platform, which now makes up approximately 50% of our U.S. mix. Although still early, we are hearing very positive feedback on the launch of our new Infinity deep brain stimulation, or DBS, system and directional lead in Europe. This system is available in maintenance-free and long-lasting recharge-free systems. Similar to our SCS systems, the Infinity platform is upgradable, which provides patients the potential to access new therapy advances as they are approved. The U.S. market makes up more than half of the $500 million global DBS market with only 1 competitor. We are very excited about our innovation here and remain on track for U.S. approval in the second half of 2016. With the most comprehensive neuromodulation technology, we expect to remain share takers for the foreseeable future. 
In our cardiovascular portfolio, we had several important regulatory and sales milestones that support our ability to execute on our innovation strategy, bringing to market new technologies to take share while supporting market growth in our more traditional business segments. We were pleased by the positive outcome of the FDA PFO panel in May. The advisory panel responded favorably to the technology and clinical results, voting that the safety, effectiveness and benefits of the AMPLATZER PFO Occluder outweigh potential risks. This device presents an important treatment option for patients with a PFO, who have suffered a stroke of unknown cause and live at risk and in fear of suffering additional strokes. The discussion during the meeting and resulting vote is an important step toward approval of the technology in the U.S. We look forward to additional discussions with the FDA in the coming months and expect approval in the second half of this year. 
Our Portico sales during the quarter were strong, which supports our belief that we can take share in the TAVR market in Europe. In the U.S., we continue to accelerate enrollment in our IDE study and recently received approval to add global sites. Implanting physicians tell us that our TAVR device is the easiest to use, and they are impressed with our device retrievability and low pacemaker rate. Our success during the quarter gives us confidence that our TAVR program will drive growth in the future. 
Building on our foundation of leadership in heart valve technology, we launched our next-generation Trifecta with Glide Technology in Europe and in the U.S. during the quarter and are executing on our launch plan. We are in the middle of a successful product launch in Europe and expect to see similar results in the U.S. as we expand the rollout. While surgical valves as a segment is declining, we view it as an important part of our comprehensive strategy of surrounding disease states in general and valvular heart disease more specifically. 
Our game-changing OCT technology was a bright spot in the quarter, growing nearly 20% on a constant currency basis. These results were driven by our new OPTIS mobile system with angiographic coregistration and enhanced stent optimization software. OPTIS mobile offers physicians an efficient way to optimize catheter-based procedures for the treatment of vascular disease by combining diagnostic tools designed to improve patient outcomes into one portable device. The imaging advancements offered with the OPTIS Mobile System allow physicians to clearly visualize complex cardiac anatomy and evaluate how to best proceed during percutaneous coronary interventions, or PCI. 
In addition, we have received positive physician feedback on our OPTIS metallic stent optimization software, which is available in some international markets and delivers tools to further improve stent sizing and placement, while providing deployment and placement assessment for drug-eluting and bare-metal stents. Our PCI optimization business grew approximately 9% constant currency during the quarter, which gives us confidence that we are focused on the right markets with the right technology to generate strong growth for the foreseeable future. 
While we continue to see pressure in our more mature cardiovascular businesses, we remain confident that we are focused on outcomes-based technologies in the appropriate growth area such as PCI optimization, TAVR and Percutaneous Heart Pumps to help drive growth back to the mid-single digits on an annual basis. 
Moving to our traditional CRM business. Similar to the past several quarters, our U.S. CRM business was challenged, primarily due to the MRI safe product gap in both low- and high-voltage devices. We remain confident that this issue is transient and will resolve itself once we receive FDA approval of our MRI safe pacemakers and ICDs, which we continue to expect in the second half of 2016 and the first half of 2017, respectively. As we have said in the past, our experience in international markets shows that once we receive approval for these devices, our share returns in short order. The most recent example of this was in Japan, where we received approval early this year for our MRI-safe ICD, which led to Japan ICD growth revenue of over 30% constant currency in the second quarter. It is this experience and our continued ability to gain share in Europe that give us confidence our share will return once we receive approval of MRI-safe devices in the U.S. 
In the evolving health care landscape, it is more important than ever to be able to work with our customers to contract along the cardiovascular service line. We believe we are unrivaled in the depth and breadth of our AF, heart failure and CRM portfolio, particularly once we receive MRI-safe labeling. We are already able to offer contracting solutions to our customers with important innovation in markets where we are improved (sic) [approved] including MPP, SyncAV, EnSite Precision, LAA closure, Nanostim, ablation catheters. And once approved, we look forward to including the next-generation, disruptive Confirm, an insertable cardiac monitor technology. In fact, I think we are better positioned now than ever before to work with the electrophysiologist in every case. We look forward to bringing this technology to the U.S. in the near future to drive growth similar to what we have seen in our international markets. 
Before we conclude, I would like to give a brief update on our pending transaction with Abbott. It has been about 80 days since we announced the transaction, and I've spent a lot of time with Miles White, Abbott's Chairman and CEO. I am confident that we will bring together 2 industry leaders with a shared passion for patients, innovation and a strong team culture. We have established an integration team with functional area leaders from our respective organizations working to prepare for a seamless integration after the deal closes, which we currently expect to occur by the end of 2016. While we are still early in the process, I can share that employees are extremely excited about the opportunity for our combined organization to be even more competitive in the market. Together, we will hold #1 or #2 market positions across a broad range of cardiovascular diseases as well as in diabetes, chronic pain, movement disorders and vision care. 
I thought it would be worth mentioning that since the announcement I've had many opportunities to hear from our customers, patients, investors and other external stakeholders, that I've been extremely encouraged that the vast majority of people I've spoken with share our enthusiasm for this transaction. The strategic rationale is clear as is our shared vision to create the world's premier medical device company. I am confident in the power of our combined organization and the significant impact we can have on helping physicians and patients around the world.

For participants on today's call, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on a comparable constant-currency basis, which includes Thoratec sales in both comparable years and are adjusted for the impact of currency. 
Sales for the quarter totaled $1,499,000,000, up 2% from the third quarter of last year. Favorable foreign currency translations increased this quarter's sales by approximately $5 million. During the third quarter, we recognized $74 million or $0.26 per share in net after-tax charges, primarily related to amortization of intangible assets, product field action costs and litigation costs and acquisition-related costs. For further information regarding these items, please refer to details provided in our press release. Comments during this call referencing third quarter results will be exclusive of these items. 
Adjusted earnings per share were $0.99 for the third quarter of 2016 compared to adjusted EPS of $0.97 in the third quarter of 2015. We estimate that on a constant-currency basis, third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 5%. 
For the third quarter, total heart failure sales were $351 million, down 3% from last year's third quarter. Sales results reflect the impact of U.S. CRM sales weakness on our CRT product segment, partially offset by strong growth in LVAD sales. 
Atrial fibrillation or AF product sales for the third quarter totaled $316 million, up 12%. Our worldwide AF business again demonstrated strong growth, driven by continued global adoption of our new ablation catheter portfolio and initial launch of EnSite Precision in European markets. 
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the third quarter of 2016 were $141 million, up approximately 17% as we continue to see the benefits of our comprehensive product portfolio to treat chronic pain through BurstDR, dorsal root ganglion or DRG and radiofrequency ablation or RFA. 
Total traditional CRM sales for the third quarter of 2016 were $378 million, down 7%. Sales results were largely driven by weakness in the U.S., which declined primarily due to MRI product gaps in both our low-voltage and ICD product segments. 
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the third quarter of 2016 were $313 million, up 7%, driven by continued strong growth of our Portico transcatheter valves in Europe as well as over 30% growth in our optical coherence tomography or OCT platform. 
Turning to the income statement. The gross profit margin during the third quarter was 68.7%, down 80 basis points from the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to a decline of 100 basis points related to the negative impact of currency. Additionally, there was a 50 basis point decline related to the continued weakness in our higher-margin U.S. CRM business. These negative factors were partially offset by the year-over-year benefit of the repeal of the Medical Device Excise Tax, which improved our gross profit margin in the quarter by 60 basis points. 
Our third quarter SG&A expenses were 31% of net sales, a 40 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015. Research and development expenses in the third quarter were 12.2% of net sales. Other expense was $41 million in the third quarter, primarily driven by interest expense on our outstanding debt. And our effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 16.1%.

As you heard from Don, we delivered 2% top line growth in the third quarter, which was in line with Wall Street estimates. It's important to understand that while in line, 2% doesn't capture all of the areas where our business excelled this quarter. We view our 8% comparable constant-currency growth in the international markets during the quarter as a positive signal that where we have a complete portfolio of approved, innovative products, we can deliver top-tier growth. We also continue to face challenges, particularly in U.S. CRM growth, where we are waiting on key MRI product approvals. 
Our strategy of surrounding disease states with innovation continues to demonstrate strong results, as evidenced by our performance in atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation in particular. In recent months, we have secured a number of important product approvals across our portfolio that will help us generate future growth. The approval of our exclusive BurstDR stimulation in the U.S. will help us continue to offer the industry's broadest range of therapies for patients with chronic pain. Approvals in the U.S. and Europe for Infinity deep brain stimulation system will help us bring a new option to physicians managing patients with movement disorders. 
We expect additional product approvals during the fourth quarter to drive further sales growth in 2017. These include FDA approval for our MRI-safe pacemakers and our EnSite Precision mapping system. And in Europe, we expect to receive approval for our next-generation CONFIRM RX implantable cardiac monitor technology before the end of the year. Our results this quarter, particularly our international sales performance, coupled with our recent and upcoming product launches reinforce our confidence that we are well positioned to accelerate sales on a global basis. 
Starting with our heart failure business. We continue to view our sales as having a clear competitive advantage in heart failure with the most comprehensive portfolio of medical device solutions in the world. According to the American Heart Association, there will be 870,000 new cases annually of heart failure in the U.S. alone. This is a large market, and our investment in this space illustrates our commitment to finding medical device solutions to help manage this global epidemic disease. 
In the third quarter, LVAD sales grew approximately 10% on a global basis, with strong double-digit growth in international markets due to the continued clinical acceptance of HeartMate 3. We are pleased that we have been able to continue capturing significant share in the international markets and expect the HeartMate 3 U.S. IDE short-term data presentation at the American Heart Association meeting in November. 
Our CardioMEMS heart failure system remains the only FDA-approved pulmonary artery pressure monitor proven to significantly reduce heart failure, hospital admissions and improved quality of life in New York Heart Association Class III patients. As we have previously discussed, we have filed for national coverage determination with CMS and are waiting formal acceptance of our submission. The clinical and economic evidence supporting CardioMEMS continues to grow, and we are committed to working with payers, agencies and medical societies to establish reimbursement and clearer guidelines for this important technology. 
Moving to our global AF business. We continue to see double-digit growth and a strong market driven by ongoing solid global growth in TactiCath and FlexAbility ablation catheters and the EnSite Precision mapping system in Europe. Our comprehensive portfolio remains a key differentiator for St. Jude Medical and demonstrates our core strength in surrounding the disease state. We have the most innovative and complete solutions across multiple product segments in AF, and the success of our ablation catheter business and our new EnSite Precision Cardiac Mapping system continue to capture market share. 
Similar to previous quarters, our advanced mapping portfolio grew approximately 20% in the international markets as compared to the U.S. sales declining low single digits, where we continue to wait FDA approval. As we announced earlier this month, after a successful limited launch in Europe of our EnSite Precision mapping system, we are now in a full launch across Europe and continue to expect FDA approval in the U.S. this year. 
We also started our Amulet U.S. IDE trial for patients in need of left atrial appendage closure to reduce their risk of stroke with our next-generation AMPLATZER Amulet device. This device is the market leader in Europe and was developed to provide physicians additional treatment options to improve patient care. The trial will take us 1 step closer to bringing this important technology to patients in the U.S. and is off to a good start as we initiate clinical sites and begin enrolling patients. We also expect to announce results from the Amulet observational clinical study in a late-breaking clinical trial session in [indiscernible] at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics, or TCT, conference on November 2. This study enroll more than 800 patients and will be a good proxy for our experience in Europe to date. 
Finally, we continue to expect CE Mark approval of our Confirm RX insertable cardiac monitor in Europe this quarter and also expect to file for FDA approval this quarter. 
I'd like to now turn to our neuromodulation business, which has never been stronger, giving us an unprecedented opportunity to bring leading innovation to chronic pain patients as well as those suffering from movement disorders. As illustrated by third quarter global constant-currency growth of 17%, we have now clearly established ourselves as the industry technology leader in this space with the broadest portfolio of solutions and latest innovation in Deep Brain Stimulation, or DBS; spinal cord stimulation, or SCS; and DRG therapies. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter in which we have taken share with our leading portfolio of new products in new markets. With our portfolio, our goal is to become the market share leader in this space. 
The launch of our Axium DRG system, which is designed for focal pain conditions often characterized by nerve injury that can be debilitating to patients, continues to receive positive physician feedback with successful training, patient trialing and strong clinical outcomes. We believe DRG will become the standard of care for difficult-to-treat chronic pain in specific areas of the lower body, such as the foot, knee, hip or groin. Further, we remain confident that DRG is a market expansion story. 
The fourth quarter is expected to be a significant quarter for our neuromodulation franchise as we launch the industry's first BurstDR stimulator in the U.S. a new superior SCS option for patients suffering from chronic pain as well as the industry's first directional lead for DBS. Early this month, we received approval and a notable superiority claim from FDA for our unique BurstDR therapy for chronic pain. We are pleased to offer patients a variety of device options with our BurstDR stimulation mode, including our recharge free PROCLAIM device and our rechargeable prodigy device. The option of our proclaimed recharge free device is resonating well with patients as our U.S. mix of these devices was above 60% in the third quarter. The approval of BurstDR also enables us to upgrade devices in patients previously receiving rechargeable PROTEGE and recharge free PROCLAIM devices, giving additional patients access to this important innovative therapy. 
Another technology worth mentioning is our Invisible Trial system with the industry's first Bluetooth-enabled system and first on-body trial system. During the third quarter in the U.S., over 90% of our trial systems utilized the Invisible Trial system. Similar to other markets where BurstDR has been approved, including Europe and Australia, we expect BurstDR-enabled devices to take share in the approximate $1.2 billion chronic pain market in the U.S. 
We also received FDA approval for Infinity DBS system with directional lead. The $300 million U.S. DBS market, which makes up more than half of the $500 million global DBS market is dominated by only 1 competitor with outdated technology. Our innovative Infinity system features a number of first, including an Apple iPad Mini programming system, Bluetooth wireless communication and a directional lead to steer therapy to avoid stimulating undesirable areas, which is an industry-first in the U.S. market. We hear from customers that directional leads should quickly become the standard of care for DBS implants. This new Infinity system represents a major step forward in our DBS product portfolio as it provides patients the best possible experience with their therapy, while also helping physicians manage their patients more efficiently and effectively. 
Turning to our cardiovascular business. We were pleased to return above mid-single-digit growth. Our game-changing OCT technology and TAVR program were bright spots quarter, with OCT growing over 30% on a global basis and TAVR taking share in Europe as we continue to penetrate new accounts with our Portico valve. Specifically on LCT, we expect this technology to be a significant contributor to growth in the fourth quarter in 2017 as clinical evidence continues to build. New physician reimbursement in the U.S. begins on January 1, 2017 and physicians increased utilization. In addition, our recently launched [indiscernible] optimization software provides actionable information that allows physicians to better plant stent placement and evaluate procedural outcomes. We believe the clinical community will increasingly transition away from [indiscernible] to  OCT. In fact, the first late-breaking clinical trial presentation at TCT is the data from our ILUMIEN 3 trial, which evaluated image-guided stent placement with OCT versus [indiscernible] versus angiography. We believe this will be an important presentation for interventional cardiologists. We also expect that the emergence of our bioabsorbable stent in the market, which is best visualized with OCT technology, will be another driver of growth for OCT. 
Earlier this month, we received FDA approval of our latest FFR wire, PressureWire X with excellent durability and wireless connectivity. The OCT and FFR market make up an approximate $450 million global market, with St. Jude Medical being the clear market leader. We plan to continue to drive PCI optimization with technology development and a legacy of robust clinical data, providing strong clinical and economic outcomes. 
With a positive FDA panel behind us, we still expect FDA approval of the AMPLATZER PFO occluder before year end. Upon approval, this will be the first FDA approved PFO occluder on the market in the U.S. and an important treatment option for patients with a PFO who have suffered stroke of unknown cause and live at risk and in fear of suffering additional strokes. 
At TCT, final long-term outcomes from the RESPECT trial will be presented in the main arena on November 1. This data will provide new insight on the longest term follow-up in the most comprehensive PFO stroke trial to date. We expect it to provide important new information regarding the clinical effectiveness of PFO closure and it's important as a compelling treatment option for patients with a history of stroke and a PFO. 
Before I discuss our traditional CRM sales results, I'd like to address our global medical device advisory announced last week concerning a subset of St. Jude Medical's ICD and CRT-D devices. This advisory is based on the potential for the impact of devices to experience premature battery depletion as a result of short circuits associated with the formation of lithium deposits. While the risk of premature battery depletion is low, 0.21%, we have partnered with regulatory agencies, leading experts and our medical advisory board to ensure physicians have the information they need to best care for their patients. Our highest priority is the safety of patients depending on our life-sustaining technology. We build safeguards such as vibratory alerts into our devices and have focused on remote monitoring because of its proven capability as an early warning indicator for physicians of their patients' health overall as well as their device health. All of our ICD and CRT-D devices are designed to deliver a vibratory alert when the battery is nearing its end of life. This means that our patients will experience several vibrating sensations in their chest directly from the device as an indicator for them to contact their physicians immediately to be evaluated for a potential device replacement. Situations like this advisory significantly underscores yet another important safety benefit of remote monitoring. There's already long-term data, which was presented at HRS 2015, as a late-breaking clinical trial that found patients with cardiac devices who use remote monitoring have significantly fewer hospitalizations than patients who do not use or hear with the technology. The findings were a result of a 5-year study, one of the largest to date on remote monitoring technologies. 
Turning back to our results. Similar to previous quarters, our traditional CRM franchise remains challenged in the U.S., primarily due to the fact that we do not have an MRI safe device approved. We believe that our challenges in this area will resolve once we receive FDA approval of our MRI safe pacemakers, which we continue to expect in the fourth quarter of 2016. We also expect to file our submissions seeking FDA approval for our high-voltage MRI in the fourth quarter, keeping us on track for an approval in the first half of 2017. 
Global traditional CRM sales declined 7% on a comparable constant currency basis with the U.S. declining approximately 17%. As we said last quarter, our experience in international markets shows that once we receive approval for these devices, our share returns quickly. International sales grew approximately 2% constant currency on the strength of ICD market share capture in Japan due to the recent launch of our MRI safe ICD, with Japan traditional ICDs growing over 40% constant currency year-over-year in the quarter. It is this experience, in addition to others, that give us confidence our share will return once we receive approval of MRI safe devices in the U.S. 
We continue to view ourselves as best positioned to serve the EP with our diverse product portfolio across CRM and AF. This position will only strengthen with the approval of MRI devices in the U.S. as well as with the approval of our next-generation Confirm RX insertable cardiac monitor and EnSite Precision Mapping system. 
Next, I would like to note that we continue to move forward as planned with the Abbott transaction and remain on track to close by the end of the year. To facilitate regulatory approvals of the transaction globally, we announced earlier this week that we will be divesting our [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] vascular closure devices. We expect these transactions to close in conjunction with the broader Abbott acquisition. Until that time, St. Jude Medical continues to manufacture and sell these devices. 
Additionally, our shareholder vote is scheduled for October 26. We consider these both key milestones in the process and are pleased with the overall progress we are making as we prepare for a seamless integration. We have identified the senior leadership team that will lead the newly combined organization upon close and monitor to continue leading such an exceptional team and business. We believe our pending transaction represents the right path forward for our company and shareholders, and I'm excited about our collective vision to create the world's premier medical device company. 
Before concluding today's call, I'll briefly address recent speculation about commentary from Muddy Waters and med sec in the marketplace. We continue to believe that their allegations against St. Jude Medical products are without merit and are motivated to drive down our company stock at the expense of shareholders for their own financial gain. They have engaged in, and we expect them to continue to engage in, tactics to sensationalize, confuse and misrepresent, all towards achieving their own personal financial goals. Importantly, their self-interested attempts to mislead doctors and patients demonstrates a total disregard for the patients whose lives depend on our devices. Patients, physicians and caregivers deserve better, and certainly, our shareholders deserve better. 
To be clear, we take the cybersecurity of our devices very seriously. We have spent years working with third-party experts and researchers in this space with that we can assess potential vulnerabilities, prioritize real-world threat levels and then develop appropriate safeguards as part of our product development process and life cycle. For example, we have released 7 different security updates alone to [indiscernible] since 2013. We have also worked with regulatory and government agencies to help develop and implement standards to improve cybersecurity. This has been our commitment long before Muddy Waters and med sec showed up and will be our commitment long after they have moved on. So while we are being falsely portrayed as an organization that does not take this seriously, the facts are to the contrary. As always, the safety and security of patients will continue to be our first priority. 
In conclusion, as an organization, we are committed to accelerating growth through innovation that improves outcomes and reduces costs along the patient care continuum. Our results this quarter, particularly across all categories internationally and in our U.S. neuromodulation, atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular product categories reflect our ability to execute on our strategic plan. It is our goal to continue to lead with innovation and return St. Jude Medical to a top-tier growth company. 
Thank you for joining us today. And with that, we will conclude the call and turn it back over to the moderator for replay information."

This press release is availab",587,"Thank you, Mike. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our third quarter 2016 financial results as well as a schedule detailing reported and comparable constant-currency sales results by product category. This press release is available on the St. Jude Medical website. For participants on today's call, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on a comparable constant-currency basis, which includes Thoratec sales in both comparable years and are adjusted for the impact of currency. 
Sales for the quarter totaled $1,499,000,000, up 2% from the third quarter of last year. Favorable foreign currency translations increased this quarter's sales by approximately $5 million. During the third quarter, we recognized $74 million or $0.26 per share in net after-tax charges, primarily related to amortization of intangible assets, product field action costs and litigation costs and acquisition-related costs. For further information regarding these items, please refer to details provided in our press release. Comments during this call referencing third quarter results will be exclusive of these items. 
Adjusted earnings per share were $0.99 for the third quarter of 2016 compared to adjusted EPS of $0.97 in the third quarter of 2015. We estimate that on a constant-currency basis, third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 5%. 
For the third quarter, total heart failure sales were $351 million, down 3% from last year's third quarter. Sales results reflect the impact of U.S. CRM sales weakness on our CRT product segment, partially offset by strong growth in LVAD sales. 
Atrial fibrillation or AF product sales for the third quarter totaled $316 million, up 12%. Our worldwide AF business again demonstrated strong growth, driven by continued global adoption of our new ablation catheter portfolio and initial launch of EnSite Precision in European markets. 
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the third quarter of 2016 were $141 million, up approximately 17% as we continue to see the benefits of our comprehensive product portfolio to treat chronic pain through BurstDR, dorsal root ganglion or DRG and radiofrequency ablation or RFA. 
Total traditional CRM sales for the third quarter of 2016 were $378 million, down 7%. Sales results were largely driven by weakness in the U.S., which declined primarily due to MRI product gaps in both our low-voltage and ICD product segments. 
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the third quarter of 2016 were $313 million, up 7%, driven by continued strong growth of our Portico transcatheter valves in Europe as well as over 30% growth in our optical coherence tomography or OCT platform. 
Turning to the income statement. The gross profit margin during the third quarter was 68.7%, down 80 basis points from the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to a decline of 100 basis points related to the negative impact of currency. Additionally, there was a 50 basis point decline related to the continued weakness in our higher-margin U.S. CRM business. These negative factors were partially offset by the year-over-year benefit of the repeal of the Medical Device Excise Tax, which improved our gross profit margin in the quarter by 60 basis points. 
Our third quarter SG&A expenses were 31% of net sales, a 40 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015. Research and development expenses in the third quarter were 12.2% of net sales. Other expense was $41 million in the third quarter, primarily driven by interest expense on our outstanding debt. And our effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 16.1%.

As you heard from Don, we delivered 2% top line growth in the third quarter, which was in line with Wall Street estimates. It's important to understand that while in line, 2% doesn't capture all of the areas where our business excelled this quarter. We view our 8% comparable constant-currency growth in the international markets during the quarter as a positive signal that where we have a complete portfolio of approved, innovative products, we can deliver top-tier growth. We also continue to face challenges, particularly in U.S. CRM growth, where we are waiting on key MRI product approvals. 
Our strategy of surrounding disease states with innovation continues to demonstrate strong results, as evidenced by our performance in atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation in particular. In recent months, we have secured a number of important product approvals across our portfolio that will help us generate future growth. The approval of our exclusive BurstDR stimulation in the U.S. will help us continue to offer the industry's broadest range of therapies for patients with chronic pain. Approvals in the U.S. and Europe for Infinity deep brain stimulation system will help us bring a new option to physicians managing patients with movement disorders. 
We expect additional product approvals during the fourth quarter to drive further sales growth in 2017. These include FDA approval for our MRI-safe pacemakers and our EnSite Precision mapping system. And in Europe, we expect to receive approval for our next-generation CONFIRM RX implantable cardiac monitor technology before the end of the year. Our results this quarter, particularly our international sales performance, coupled with our recent and upcoming product launches reinforce our confidence that we are well positioned to accelerate sales on a global basis. 
Starting with our heart failure business. We continue to view our sales as having a clear competitive advantage in heart failure with the most comprehensive portfolio of medical device solutions in the world. According to the American Heart Association, there will be 870,000 new cases annually of heart failure in the U.S. alone. This is a large market, and our investment in this space illustrates our commitment to finding medical device solutions to help manage this global epidemic disease. 
In the third quarter, LVAD sales grew approximately 10% on a global basis, with strong double-digit growth in international markets due to the continued clinical acceptance of HeartMate 3. We are pleased that we have been able to continue capturing significant share in the international markets and expect the HeartMate 3 U.S. IDE short-term data presentation at the American Heart Association meeting in November. 
Our CardioMEMS heart failure system remains the only FDA-approved pulmonary artery pressure monitor proven to significantly reduce heart failure, hospital admissions and improved quality of life in New York Heart Association Class III patients. As we have previously discussed, we have filed for national coverage determination with CMS and are waiting formal acceptance of our submission. The clinical and economic evidence supporting CardioMEMS continues to grow, and we are committed to working with payers, agencies and medical societies to establish reimbursement and clearer guidelines for this important technology. 
Moving to our global AF business. We continue to see double-digit growth and a strong market driven by ongoing solid global growth in TactiCath and FlexAbility ablation catheters and the EnSite Precision mapping system in Europe.

International sales grew approximately 2% constant currency on the strength of ICD market share capture in Japan due to the recent launch of our MRI-safe ICD, with Japan traditional ICDs growing over 40% constant currency year-over-year in the quarter. It is this experience, in addition to others, that give us confidence our share will return once we receive approval of MRI-safe devices in the U.S. 
We continue to view ourselves as best positioned to serve the EP with our diverse product portfolio across CRM and AF. This position will only strengthen with the approval of MRI devices in the U.S. as well as with the approval of our next-generation CONFIRM RX insertable cardiac monitor and EnSite Precision mapping system. 
Next, I'd like to note that we continue to move forward as planned with the Abbott transaction and remain on track to close by the end of the year. To facilitate regulatory approvals of the transaction globally, we announced earlier this week that we will be divesting our Angio-Seal and Femoseal vascular closure devices. We would expect these transactions to close in conjunction with the broader Abbott acquisition. Until that time, St. Jude Medical continues to manufacture and sell these devices. Additionally, our shareholder vote is scheduled for October 26. We consider these both key milestones in the process and are pleased with the overall progress we are making as we prepare for a seamless integration. 
We have identified the senior leadership team that will lead the newly combined organization upon close, and I'm honored to continue leading such an exceptional team and business. We believe our pending transaction represents the right path forward for our company and shareholders, and I am excited about our collective vision to create the world's premier medical device company. 
Before concluding today's call, I'll briefly address recent speculation about commentary from Muddy Waters and MedSec in the marketplace. We continue to believe that their allegations against St. Jude Medical products are without merit and are motivated to drive down our company stock at the expense of shareholders for their own financial gain. They have engaged in and we expect them to continue to engage in tactics to sensationalize, confuse and misrepresent, all towards achieving their own personal financial goals. Importantly, their self-interested attempts to mislead doctors and patients demonstrates a total disregard for the patients whose lives depend on our devices. Patients, physicians and caregivers deserve better, and certainly, our shareholders deserve better. 
To be clear, we take the cybersecurity of our devices very seriously. We have spent years working with third-party experts and researchers in this space so that we can assess potential vulnerabilities, prioritize real-world threat levels and then develop appropriate safeguards as part of our product development process and life cycle. For example, we have released 7 different security updates alone to Merlin@home since 2013. 
We have also worked with regulatory and government agencies to help develop and implement standards to improve cybersecurity. This has been our commitment long before Muddy Waters and MedSec showed up and will be our commitment long after they have moved on. So while we are being falsely portrayed as an organization that does not take this seriously, the facts are to the contrary. As always, the safety and security of patients will continue to be our first priority. 
In conclusion, as an organization, we are committed to accelerating growth through innovation that improves outcomes and reduces costs along the patient care continuum. Our results this quarter, particularly across all categories internationally and in our U.S. neuromodulation, atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular product categories, reflect our ability to execute on our strategic plan. It is our goal to continue to lead with innovation and return St. Jude Medical to a top-tier growth company.

Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our third quarter 2016 financial results as well as a schedule detailing reported and comparable constant currency sales results by product category. This press release is availab",593,"Thank you, Mike. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our third quarter 2016 financial results as well as a schedule detailing reported and comparable constant currency sales results by product category. This press release is available on the St. Jude Medical website. For participants on today's call, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on a comparable constant currency basis, which includes Thoratec sales in both comparable years and are adjusted for the impact of currency. 
Sales for the quarter totaled $1,499,000,000, up 2% from the third quarter of last year. Favorable foreign currency translations increased this quarter's sales by approximately $5 million. During the third quarter, we recognized $74 million or $0.26 per share in net after-tax charges, primarily related to amortization of intangible assets, product field action costs and litigation costs and acquisition related costs. For further information regarding these items, please refer to details provided in our press release. Comments during this call referencing third quarter results will be exclusive of these items. 
Adjusted earnings per share were $0.99 for the third quarter of 2016 compared to adjusted EPS of $0.97 in the third quarter of 2015. We estimate that on a constant currency basis, third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 5%. 
For the third quarter, total heart failure sales were $351 million, down 3% from last year's third quarter. Sales results reflect the impact of U.S. CRM sales weakness on our CRT product segment, partially offset by strong growth in LVAD sales. 
Atrial fibrillation or AF product sales for the third quarter totaled $316 million, up 12%. Our worldwide AF business again demonstrated strong growth, driven by continued global adoption of our new ablation catheter portfolio and initial launch of EnSite Precision in European markets. 
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the third quarter of 2016 were $141 million, up approximately 17% as we continue to see the benefits of our comprehensive product portfolio to treat chronic pain through BurstDR, dorsal root ganglion or DRG and radiofrequency ablation or RFA. 
Total traditional CRM sales for the third quarter of 2016 were $378 million, down 7%. Sales results were largely driven by weakness in the U.S., which declined primarily due to MRI product gaps in both our low voltage and ICD product segments. 
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the third quarter of 2016 were $313 million, up 7%, driven by continued strong growth of our Portico transcatheter valves in Europe as well as over 30% growth in our optical coherence tomography or OCT platform. 
Turning to the income statement. The gross profit margin during the third quarter was 68.7%, down 80 basis points from the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to a decline of 100 basis points related to the negative impact of currency. Additionally, there was a 50 basis point decline related to the continued weakness in our higher margin U.S. CRM business. These negative factors were partially offset by the year-over-year benefit of the repeal of the Medical Device Excise Tax, which improved our gross profit margin in the quarter by 60 basis points. 
Our third quarter SG&A expenses were 31% of net sales, a 40 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015. Research and development expenses in the third quarter were 12.2% of net sales. Other expense was $41 million in the third quarter, primarily driven by interest expense on our outstanding debt. And our effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 16.1%. 
I will now turn it back to Mike."

As you heard from Don, we delivered 2% top line growth in the third quarter, which was in line with Wall Street estimates. It's important to understand that while in line, 2% doesn't capture all of the areas where our business excelled this quarter. We view our 8% comparable constant currency growth in the international markets during the quarter as a positive signal that where we have a complete portfolio of approved, innovative products, we can deliver top-tier growth. We also continue to face challenges, particularly in U.S. CRM growth, where we are waiting on key MRI product approvals. 
Our strategy of surrounding disease states with innovation continues to demonstrate strong results, as evidenced by our performance in atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation in particular. In recent months, we have secured a number of important product approvals across our portfolio that will help us generate future growth. The approval of our exclusive BurstDR stimulation in the U.S. will help us continue to offer the industry's broadest range of therapies for patients with chronic pain. Approvals in the U.S. and Europe for Infinity deep brain stimulation system will help us bring a new option to physicians managing patients with movement disorders. 
We expect additional product approvals during the fourth quarter to drive further sales growth in 2017. These include FDA approval for our MRI-safe pacemakers and our EnSite Precision mapping system. And in Europe, we expect to receive approval for our next-generation CONFIRM RX implantable cardiac monitor technology before the end of the year. Our results this quarter, particularly our international sales performance, coupled with our recent and upcoming product launches reinforce our confidence that we are well positioned to accelerate sales on a global basis. 
Starting with our heart failure business. We continue to view our sales as having a clear competitive advantage in heart failure with the most comprehensive portfolio of medical device solutions in the world. According to the American Heart Association, there will be 870,000 new cases annually of heart failure in the U.S. alone. This is a large market, and our investment in this space illustrates our commitment to finding medical device solutions to help manage this global epidemic disease. 
In the third quarter, LVAD sales grew approximately 10% on a global basis, with strong double-digit growth in international markets due to the continued clinical acceptance of HeartMate 3. We are pleased that we have been able to continue capturing significant share in the international markets and expect the HeartMate 3 U.S. IDE short-term data presentation at the American Heart Association meeting in November. 
Our CardioMEMS heart failure system remains the only FDA-approved pulmonary artery pressure monitor proven to significantly reduce heart failure hospital admissions and improved quality of life in New York Heart Association Class III patients. As we have previously discussed, we have filed for national coverage determination with CMS and are waiting formal acceptance of our submission. The clinical and economic evidence supporting CardioMEMS continues to grow, and we are committed to working with payers, agencies and medical societies to establish reimbursement and clearer guidelines for this important technology. 
Moving to our global AF business. We continue to see double-digit growth and a strong market driven by ongoing solid global growth in TactiCath and FlexAbility ablation catheters and the EnSite Precision mapping system in Europe. Our comprehensive portfolio remains a key differentiator for St. Jude Medical and demonstrates our core strength in surrounding the disease state. We have the most innovative and complete solutions across multiple product segments in AF, and the success of our ablation catheter business and our new EnSite Precision Cardiac Mapping system continue to capture market share. 
Similar to previous quarters, our advanced mapping portfolio grew approximately 20% in the international markets as compared to the U.S. sales declining low single digits, while we continue to wait FDA approval. As we announced earlier this month, after a successful limited launch in Europe of our EnSite Precision mapping system, we are now in a full launch across Europe and continue to expect FDA approval in the U.S. this year. 
We also started our Amulet U.S. IDE trial for patients in need of left atrial appendage closure to reduce their risk of stroke with our next-generation AMPLATZER Amulet device. This device is the market leader in Europe and was developed to provide physicians additional treatment options to improve patient care. The trial will take us one step closer to bringing this important technology to patients in the U.S. and is off to a good start as we initiate clinical sites and begin enrolling patients. 
We also expect to announce results from the Amulet observational clinical study in a late-breaking clinical trial session in the main arena at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics or TCT conference on November 2. This study enrolled more than 800 patients and will be a good proxy for our experience in Europe to date. Finally, we continue to expect CE Mark approval of our CONFIRM RX insertable cardiac monitor in Europe this quarter and also expect to file for FDA approval this quarter. 
I'd like to now turn to our neuromodulation business, which has never been stronger, giving us an unprecedented opportunity to bring leading innovation to chronic pain patients as well as those suffering from movement disorders. As illustrated by third quarter global constant currency growth of 17%, we have now clearly established ourselves as the industry technology leader in this space with the broadest portfolio of solutions and latest innovation in deep brain stimulation or DBS, spinal cord stimulation or SCS and DRG therapies. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter in which we have taken share with our leading portfolio of new products in new markets. With our portfolio, our goal is to become the market share leader in this space. 
The launch of our Axium DRG system, which is designed for focal pain conditions often characterized by nerve injury that can be debilitating to patients, continues to receive positive physician feedback with successful training, patient trialing and strong clinical outcomes. We believe DRG will become the standard of care for difficult-to-treat chronic pain in specific areas of the lower body, such as the foot, knee, hip or groin. Further, we remain confident that DRG is a market-expansion story. 
The fourth quarter is expected to be a significant quarter for our neuromodulation franchise as we launch the industry's first BurstDR stimulator in the U.S., a new superior SCS option for patients suffering from chronic pain as well as the industry's first directional lead for DBS. Earlier this month, we received approval and a notable superiority claim from FDA for our unique BurstDR therapy for chronic pain. We are pleased to offer patients a variety of device options with our BurstDR stimulation mode, including our recharge-free PROCLAIM device and our rechargeable Prodigy device. 
The option of our PROCLAIM recharge-free device is resonating well with patients as our U.S. mix of these devices was above 60% in the third quarter. The approval of BurstDR also enables us to upgrade devices in patients previously receiving rechargeable Protégé  and recharge-free PROCLAIM devices, giving additional patients access to this important innovative therapy. 
Another technology worth mentioning is our Invisible Trial system with the industry's first Bluetooth-enabled system and first on-body trial system. During the third quarter in the U.S., over 90% of our trial systems utilized the Invisible Trial system. Similar to other markets where BurstDR has been approved, including Europe and Australia, we expect BurstDR-enabled devices to take share in the approximate $1.2 billion chronic pain market in the U.S. 
We also received FDA approval for Infinity DBS system with directional lead. The $300 million U.S. DBS market, which makes up more than half of the $500 million global DBS market is dominated by only 1 competitor with outdated technology. Our innovative Infinity system features a number of firsts, including an Apple iPad mini programming system, Bluetooth wireless communication and a directional lead to steer therapy to avoid stimulating undesirable areas, which is an industry-first in the U.S. market. 
We hear from our customers that directional leads should quickly become the standard of care for DBS implants. This new Infinity system represents a major step forward in our DBS product portfolio as it provides patients the best possible experience with their therapy while also helping physicians manage their patients more efficiently and effectively. 
Turning to our cardiovascular business. We were pleased to return to above mid-single-digit growth. Our game changing OCT technology and TAVR program were bright spots this quarter, with OCT growing over 30% on a global basis and TAVR taking share in Europe as we continue to penetrate new accounts with our Portico valve. Specifically on OCT, we expect this technology to be a significant contributor to growth in the fourth quarter in 2017 as clinical evidence continues to build. New physician reimbursement in the U.S. begins on January 1, 2017, and physicians increased utilization. 
In addition, our recently launched stent optimization software provides actionable information that allows physicians to better plan stent placement and evaluate procedural outcomes. We believe the clinical community will increasingly transition away from IVUS to OCT. In fact, the first late breaking clinical trial presentation at TCT is the data from our ILUMIEN 3 trial, which evaluated image guided stent placement with OCT versus IVUS versus angiography. We believe this will be an important presentation for interventional cardiologists. We also expect that the emergence of our bioabsorbable stent in the market, which is best visualized with OCT technology, will be another driver of growth for OCT. 
Earlier this month, we received FDA approval of our latest FFR wire, PressureWire X, with excellent steer-ability and wireless connectivity. The OCT and FFR market make up an approximate $450 million global market with St. Jude Medical being the clear market leader. We plan to continue to drive PCI optimization with technology development and a legacy of robust clinical data providing strong clinical and economic outcomes. 
With a positive FDA panel behind us, we still expect FDA approval of the AMPLATZER PFO Occluder before year-end. Upon approval, this will be the first FDA-approved PFO occluder on the market in the U.S. and an important treatment option for patients with a PFO who have suffered stroke of unknown cause and live at risk and in fear of suffering additional strokes. 
At TCT, final long-term outcomes from the RESPECT trial will be presented in the main arena on November 1. This data will provide new insight on the longest term follow-up in the most comprehensive PFO stroke trial to date. We expect it to provide important new information regarding the clinical effectiveness of PFO closure and its importance as a compelling treatment option for patients with a history of stroke and a PFO. 
Before I discuss our traditional CRM sales results, I'd like to address our global medical device advisory announced last week concerning a subset of St. Jude Medical's ICD and CRT-D devices. This advisory is based on the potential for the impacted devices to experience premature battery depletion as a result of short circuits associated with the formation of lithium deposits. While the risk of premature battery depletion is low, 0.21%, we have partnered with regulatory agencies, leading experts and our medical advisory board to ensure physicians have the information they need to best care for their patients. 
Our highest priority is the safety of patients depending on our life-sustaining technology. We build safeguards, such as vibratory alerts, into our devices and have focused on remote monitoring because of its proven capability as an early warning indicator for physicians of their patients' health overall as well as their device health. All of our ICD and CRT-D devices are designed to deliver a vibratory alert when the battery is nearing its end of life. This means that our patients will experience several vibrating sensations in their chest directly from the device as an indicator for them to contact their physicians immediately to be evaluated for a potential device replacement. 
Situations like this advisory significantly underscores yet another important safety benefit of remote monitoring. There is already long-term data, which was presented at HRS 2015, as a late-breaking clinical trial that found patients with cardiac devices who use remote monitoring have significantly fewer hospitalizations than patients who do not use or adhere with the technology. The findings were a result of a 5-year study, one of the largest to date on remote monitoring technologies. 
Turning back to our results. Similar to previous quarters, our traditional CRM franchise remains challenged in the U.S., primarily due to the fact that we do not have an MRI-safe device approved. We believe that our challenges in this area will resolve once we receive FDA approval of our MRI-safe pacemakers, which we continue to expect in the fourth quarter of 2016. We also expect to file our submissions seeking FDA approval for a high-voltage MRI in the fourth quarter, keeping us on track for an approval in the first half of 2017. 
Global traditional CRM sales declined 7% on a comparable constant-currency basis, with the U.S. declining approximately 17%. As we said last quarter, our experience in international markets shows that once we receive approval for these devices, our share returns quickly. International sales grew approximately 2% constant currency on the strength of ICD market share capture in Japan due to the recent launch of our MRI-safe ICD, with Japan traditional ICDs growing over 40% constant currency year-over-year in the quarter. It is this experience, in addition to others, that give us confidence our share will return once we receive approval of MRI-safe devices in the U.S. 
We continue to view ourselves as best positioned to serve the EP with our diverse product portfolio across CRM and AF. This position will only strengthen with the approval of MRI devices in the U.S. as well as with the approval of our next-generation CONFIRM RX insertable cardiac monitor and EnSite Precision mapping system. 
Next, I'd like to note that we continue to move forward as planned with the Abbott transaction and remain on track to close by the end of the year. To facilitate regulatory approvals of the transaction globally, we announced earlier this week that we will be divesting our Angio-Seal and Femoseal vascular closure devices. We would expect these transactions to close in conjunction with the broader Abbott acquisition. Until that time, St. Jude Medical continues to manufacture and sell these devices. Additionally, our shareholder vote is scheduled for October 26. We consider these both key milestones in the process and are pleased with the overall progress we are making as we prepare for a seamless integration.

We believe our pending transaction represents the right path forward for our company and shareholders, and I am excited about our collective vision to create the world's premier medical device company.

We continue to believe that their allegations against St. Jude Medical products are without merit and are motivated to drive down our company stock at the expense of shareholders for their own financial gain.

Adjusted earnings per share were $0.99 for the third quarter of 2016 compared to adjusted EPS of $0.97 in the third quarter of 2015. We estimate that on a constant currency basis, third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 5%. 
For the third quarter, total heart failure sales were $351 million, down 3% from last year's third quarter. Sales results reflect the impact of U.S. CRM sales weakness on our CRT product segment, partially offset by strong growth in LVAD sales. 
Atrial fibrillation or AF product sales for the third quarter totaled $316 million, up 12%. Our worldwide AF business again demonstrated strong growth, driven by continued global adoption of our new ablation catheter portfolio and initial launch of EnSite Precision in European markets. 
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the third quarter of 2016 were $141 million, up approximately 17% as we continue to see the benefits of our comprehensive product portfolio to treat chronic pain through BurstDR, dorsal root ganglion or DRG and radiofrequency ablation or RFA. 
Total traditional CRM sales for the third quarter of 2016 were $378 million, down 7%. Sales results were largely driven by weakness in the U.S., which declined primarily due to MRI product gaps in both our low voltage and ICD product segments. 
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the third quarter of 2016 were $313 million, up 7%, driven by continued strong growth of our Portico transcatheter valves in Europe as well as over 30% growth in our optical coherence tomography or OCT platform. 
Turning to the income statement. The gross profit margin during the third quarter was 68.7%, down 80 basis points from the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to a decline of 100 basis points related to the negative impact of currency. Additionally, there was a 50 basis point decline related to the continued weakness in our higher margin U.S. CRM business. These negative factors were partially offset by the year-over-year benefit of the repeal of the Medical Device Excise Tax, which improved our gross profit margin in the quarter by 60 basis points. 
Our third quarter SG&A expenses were 31% of net sales, a 40 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015. Research and development expenses in the third quarter were 12.2% of net sales. Other expense was $41 million in the third quarter, primarily driven by interest expense on our outstanding debt. And our effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 16.1%. 
I will now turn it back to Mike."

As you heard from Don, we delivered 2% top line growth in the third quarter, which was in line with Wall Street estimates. It's important to understand that while in line, 2% doesn't capture all of the areas where our business excelled this quarter. We view our 8% comparable constant currency growth in the international markets during the quarter as a positive signal that where we have a complete portfolio of approved, innovative products, we can deliver top-tier growth. We also continue to face challenges, particularly in U.S. CRM growth, where we are waiting on key MRI product approvals. 
Our strategy of surrounding disease states with innovation continues to demonstrate strong results, as evidenced by our performance in atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation in particular. In recent months, we have secured a number of important product approvals across our portfolio that will help us generate future growth. The approval of our exclusive BurstDR stimulation in the U.S. will help us continue to offer the industry's broadest range of therapies for patients with chronic pain. Approvals in the U.S. and Europe for Infinity deep brain stimulation system will help us bring a new option to physicians managing patients with movement disorders. 
We expect additional product approvals during the fourth quarter to drive further sales growth in 2017. These include FDA approval for our MRI-safe pacemakers and our EnSite Precision mapping system. And in Europe, we expect to receive approval for our next-generation CONFIRM RX implantable cardiac monitor technology before the end of the year. Our results this quarter, particularly our international sales performance, coupled with our recent and upcoming product launches reinforce our confidence that we are well positioned to accelerate sales on a global basis. 
Starting with our heart failure business. We continue to view our sales as having a clear competitive advantage in heart failure with the most comprehensive portfolio of medical device solutions in the world. According to the American Heart Association, there will be 870,000 new cases annually of heart failure in the U.S. alone. This is a large market, and our investment in this space illustrates our commitment to finding medical device solutions to help manage this global epidemic disease. 
In the third quarter, LVAD sales grew approximately 10% on a global basis, with strong double-digit growth in international markets due to the continued clinical acceptance of HeartMate 3. We are pleased that we have been able to continue capturing significant share in the international markets and expect the HeartMate 3 U.S. IDE short-term data presentation at the American Heart Association meeting in November. 
Our CardioMEMS heart failure system remains the only FDA-approved pulmonary artery pressure monitor proven to significantly reduce heart failure hospital admissions and improved quality of life in New York Heart Association Class III patients. As we have previously discussed, we have filed for national coverage determination with CMS and are waiting formal acceptance of our submission. The clinical and economic evidence supporting CardioMEMS continues to grow, and we are committed to working with payers, agencies and medical societies to establish reimbursement and clearer guidelines for this important technology. 
Moving to our global AF business. We continue to see double-digit growth and a strong market driven by ongoing solid global growth in TactiCath and FlexAbility ablation catheters and the EnSite Precision mapping system in Europe. Our comprehensive portfolio remains a key differentiator for St. Jude Medical and demonstrates our core strength in surrounding the disease state. We have the most innovative and complete solutions across multiple product segments in AF, and the success of our ablation catheter business and our new EnSite Precision Cardiac Mapping system continue to capture market share. 
Similar to previous quarters, our advanced mapping portfolio grew approximately 20% in the international markets as compared to the U.S. sales declining low single digits, while we continue to wait FDA approval. As we announced earlier this month, after a successful limited launch in Europe of our EnSite Precision mapping system, we are now in a full launch across Europe and continue to expect FDA approval in the U.S. this year. 
We also started our Amulet U.S. IDE trial for patients in need of left atrial appendage closure to reduce their risk of stroke with our next-generation AMPLATZER Amulet device. This device is the market leader in Europe and was developed to provide physicians additional treatment options to improve patient care. The trial will take us one step closer to bringing this important technology to patients in the U.S. and is off to a good start as we initiate clinical sites and begin enrolling patients. 
We also expect to announce results from the Amulet observational clinical study in a late-breaking clinical trial session in the main arena at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics or TCT conference on November 2. This study enrolled more than 800 patients and will be a good proxy for our experience in Europe to date. Finally, we continue to expect CE Mark approval of our CONFIRM RX insertable cardiac monitor in Europe this quarter and also expect to file for FDA approval this quarter. 
I'd like to now turn to our neuromodulation business, which has never been stronger, giving us an unprecedented opportunity to bring leading innovation to chronic pain patients as well as those suffering from movement disorders. As illustrated by third quarter global constant currency growth of 17%, we have now clearly established ourselves as the industry technology leader in this space with the broadest portfolio of solutions and latest innovation in deep brain stimulation or DBS, spinal cord stimulation or SCS and DRG therapies. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter in which we have taken share with our leading portfolio of new products in new markets. With our portfolio, our goal is to become the market share leader in this space. 
The launch of our Axium DRG system, which is designed for focal pain conditions often characterized by nerve injury that can be debilitating to patients, continues to receive positive physician feedback with successful training, patient trialing and strong clinical outcomes. We believe DRG will become the standard of care for difficult-to-treat chronic pain in specific areas of the lower body, such as the foot, knee, hip or groin. Further, we remain confident that DRG is a market-expansion story. 
The fourth quarter is expected to be a significant quarter for our neuromodulation franchise as we launch the industry's first BurstDR stimulator in the U.S., a new superior SCS option for patients suffering from chronic pain as well as the industry's first directional lead for DBS. Earlier this month, we received approval and a notable superiority claim from FDA for our unique BurstDR therapy for chronic pain. We are pleased to offer patients a variety of device options with our BurstDR stimulation mode, including our recharge-free PROCLAIM device and our rechargeable Prodigy device. 
The option of our PROCLAIM recharge-free device is resonating well with patients as our U.S. mix of these devices was above 60% in the third quarter. The approval of BurstDR also enables us to upgrade devices in patients previously receiving rechargeable Protégé  and recharge-free PROCLAIM devices, giving additional patients access to this important innovative therapy. 
Another technology worth mentioning is our Invisible Trial system with the industry's first Bluetooth-enabled system and first on-body trial system. During the third quarter in the U.S., over 90% of our trial systems utilized the Invisible Trial system. Similar to other markets where BurstDR has been approved, including Europe and Australia, we expect BurstDR-enabled devices to take share in the approximate $1.2 billion chronic pain market in the U.S. 
We also received FDA approval for Infinity DBS system with directional lead. The $300 million U.S. DBS market, which makes up more than half of the $500 million global DBS market is dominated by only 1 competitor with outdated technology. Our innovative Infinity system features a number of firsts, including an Apple iPad mini programming system, Bluetooth wireless communication and a directional lead to steer therapy to avoid stimulating undesirable areas, which is an industry-first in the U.S. market. 
We hear from our customers that directional leads should quickly become the standard of care for DBS implants. This new Infinity system represents a major step forward in our DBS product portfolio as it provides patients the best possible experience with their therapy while also helping physicians manage their patients more efficiently and effectively. 
Turning to our cardiovascular business. We were pleased to return to above mid-single-digit growth. Our game changing OCT technology and TAVR program were bright spots this quarter, with OCT growing over 30% on a global basis and TAVR taking share in Europe as we continue to penetrate new accounts with our Portico valve. Specifically on OCT, we expect this technology to be a significant contributor to growth in the fourth quarter in 2017 as clinical evidence continues to build. New physician reimbursement in the U.S. begins on January 1, 2017, and physicians increased utilization. 
In addition, our recently launched stent optimization software provides actionable information that allows physicians to better plan stent placement and evaluate procedural outcomes. We believe the clinical community will increasingly transition away from IVUS to OCT. In fact, the first late breaking clinical trial presentation at TCT is the data from our ILUMIEN 3 trial, which evaluated image guided stent placement with OCT versus IVUS versus angiography. We believe this will be an important presentation for interventional cardiologists. We also expect that the emergence of our bioabsorbable stent in the market, which is best visualized with OCT technology, will be another driver of growth for OCT. 
Earlier this month, we received FDA approval of our latest FFR wire, PressureWire X, with excellent steer-ability and wireless connectivity. The OCT and FFR market make up an approximate $450 million global market with St. Jude Medical being the clear market leader. We plan to continue to drive PCI optimization with technology development and a legacy of robust clinical data providing strong clinical and economic outcomes. 
With a positive FDA panel behind us, we still expect FDA approval of the AMPLATZER PFO Occluder before year-end. Upon approval, this will be the first FDA-approved PFO occluder on the market in the U.S. and an important treatment option for patients with a PFO who have suffered stroke of unknown cause and live at risk and in fear of suffering additional strokes. 
At TCT, final long-term outcomes from the RESPECT trial will be presented in the main arena on November 1. This data will provide new insight on the longest term follow-up in the most comprehensive PFO stroke trial to date. We expect it to provide important new information regarding the clinical effectiveness of PFO closure and its importance as a compelling treatment option for patients with a history of stroke and a PFO. 
Before I discuss our traditional CRM sales results, I'd like to address our global medical device advisory announced last week concerning a subset of St. Jude Medical's ICD and CRT-D devices. This advisory is based on the potential for the impacted devices to experience premature battery depletion as a result of short circuits associated with the formation of lithium deposits. While the risk of premature battery depletion is low, 0.21%, we have partnered with regulatory agencies, leading experts and our medical advisory board to ensure physicians have the information they need to best care for their patients. 
Our highest priority is the safety of patients depending on our life-sustaining technology. We build safeguards, such as vibratory alerts, into our devices and have focused on remote monitoring because of its proven capability as an early warning indicator for physicians of their patients' health overall as well as their device health. All of our ICD and CRT-D devices are designed to deliver a vibratory alert when the battery is nearing its end of life. This means that our patients will experience several vibrating sensations in their chest directly from the device as an indicator for them to contact their physicians immediately to be evaluated for a potential device replacement. 
Situations like this advisory significantly underscores yet another important safety benefit of remote monitoring. There is already long-term data, which was presented at HRS 2015, as a late-breaking clinical trial that found patients with cardiac devices who use remote monitoring have significantly fewer hospitalizations than patients who do not use or adhere with the technology. The findings were a result of a 5-year study, one of the largest to date on remote monitoring technologies. 
Turning back to our results. Similar to previous quarters, our traditional CRM franchise remains challenged in the U.S., primarily due to the fact that we do not have an MRI-safe device approved. We believe that our challenges in this area will resolve once we receive FDA approval of our MRI-safe pacemakers, which we continue to expect in the fourth quarter of 2016. We also expect to file our submissions seeking FDA approval for a high-voltage MRI in the fourth quarter, keeping us on track for an approval in the first half of 2017. 
Global traditional CRM sales declined 7% on a comparable constant-currency basis, with the U.S. declining approximately 17%. As we said last quarter, our experience in international markets shows that once we receive approval for these devices, our share returns quickly. International sales grew approximately 2% constant currency on the strength of ICD market share capture in Japan due to the recent launch of our MRI-safe ICD, with Japan traditional ICDs growing over 40% constant currency year-over-year in the quarter. It is this experience, in addition to others, that give us confidence our share will return once we receive approval of MRI-safe devices in the U.S. 
We continue to view ourselves as best positioned to serve the EP with our diverse product portfolio across CRM and AF. This position will only strengthen with the approval of MRI devices in the U.S. as well as with the approval of our next-generation CONFIRM RX insertable cardiac monitor and EnSite Precision mapping system. 
Next, I'd like to note that we continue to move forward as planned with the Abbott transaction and remain on track to close by the end of the year. To facilitate regulatory approvals of the transaction globally, we announced earlier this week that we will be divesting our Angio-Seal and Femoseal vascular closure devices. We would expect these transactions to close in conjunction with the broader Abbott acquisition. Until that time, St. Jude Medical continues to manufacture and sell these devices. Additionally, our shareholder vote is scheduled for October 26. We consider these both key milestones in the process and are pleased with the overall progress we are making as we prepare for a seamless integration. 
We have identified the senior leadership team that will lead the newly combined organization upon close, and I'm honored to continue leading such an exceptional team and business. We believe our pending transaction represents the right path forward for our company and shareholders, and I am excited about our collective vision to create the world's premier medical device company. 
Before concluding today's call, I'll briefly address recent speculation about commentary from Muddy Waters and MedSec in the marketplace. We continue to believe that their allegations against St. Jude Medical products are without merit and are motivated to drive down our company stock at the expense of shareholders for their own financial gain. They have engaged in and we expect them to continue to engage in tactics to sensationalize, confuse and misrepresent, all towards achieving their own personal financial goals. Importantly, their self-interested attempts to mislead doctors and patients demonstrates a total disregard for the patients whose lives depend on our devices. Patients, physicians and caregivers deserve better, and certainly, our shareholders deserve better. 
To be clear, we take the cybersecurity of our devices very seriously. We have spent years working with third-party experts and researchers in this space so that we can assess potential vulnerabilities, prioritize real world threat levels and then develop appropriate safeguards as part of our product development process and life cycle. For example, we have released 7 different security updates alone to Merlin@home since 2013. 
We have also worked with regulatory and government agencies to help develop and implement standards to improve cybersecurity. This has been our commitment long before Muddy Waters and MedSec showed up and will be our commitment long after they have moved on. So while we are being falsely portrayed as an organization that does not take this seriously, the facts are to the contrary. As always, the safety and security of patients will continue to be our first priority. 
In conclusion, as an organization, we are committed to accelerating growth through innovation that improves outcomes and reduces costs along the patient care continuum. Our results this quarter, particularly across all categories internationally and in our U.S. neuromodulation, atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular product categories, reflect our ability to execute on our strategic plan. It is our goal to continue to lead with innovation and return St. Jude Medical to a top-tier growth company. 
Thank you for joining us today. And with that, we will conclude the call and turn it back over to the moderator for replay information."
