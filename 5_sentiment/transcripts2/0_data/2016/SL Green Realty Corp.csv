Thank you, and I appreciate everybody calling in this afternoon to review our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. Before we jump into, I just want to mentioned that Andrew Matthias is going to be joining in by phone from the orthopedics office with cell phone in hand because he sort of suffered an injury but we won't let that hold him back from the call. And Steve Durels also calling in remotely, but available for Q&A, as I guess the stress and tension of an active year-end and beginning of January took a toll on him physically as well, but we wouldn't keep him from the call either. So we are all here and I just want to express our enthusiasm about the operating performance that we ended 2015 on a relative high note. As I think most of you had an opportunity to see in the investor conference in December, we're feeling good about the fact that our buildings are extremely well leased and general well leased with below market rents that are taking up 15% to 20% in some cases in the recent quarters. We have a modest amount of lease expirations in the coming years, and that is matched with a modest amount of debt maturities, which -- both of which we actively managed over the years to make sure that we're leading into markets where things are more uncertain. We have good 10-year of lease maturities and good 10-year debt maturities. We are substantially complete with our redevelopment projects at 280 Park, 10 East 53rd Street, smaller project over at 16 Court Street, the important aspect there being: A, the buildings are all well-positioned now like the rest of our portfolio; and B, all that capital is now behind us. And speaking of that capital, the remaining capital to fund for the Viacom and city leases are now reduced in the aggregate to under $200 million, which will be spread over the next few [ph] years, so that number has also been mitigated to a great extent over time. 
Turning first, what I'd like to do is hit some of the questions and topics that have been raised in some of the analyst notes that we've seen in the past 24 hours or so and then open it up to Q&A.
So I guess beginning with Manhattan leasing market, office market in particular. We ended the quarter with 416,000 square feet of leasing at a mark-to-market rent that are up about 20%. So obviously a big end to the year. We're very happy with that. I think that was sort of on or ahead of schedule. We slightly exceeded our 2.2 million square feet of velocity for the full year. But you should recall that we did advertise a pretty significant pipeline of leasing activity during the investor conference. And obviously now we continue to capitalize on that pipeline, not only through December but also in January. We've announced some leases as of yesterday, some big deals and a good way to kick off the new year with Omnicom, Music Choice and Nordstrom's, along with some other leasing in January, that brings the total -- the first month of the year to about 310,000 square feet of leasing in January.
So clearly, that is us executing on that pipeline. And now obviously, we're very focused on continuing to build that pipeline for future quarters. 
As a footnote to the Omnicom deal because we got the question, it does represent a reduction in space at the news building, but we are actively working on a lease to absorb the remaining space. So I think we feel pretty good about where we are positioned with that space and that asset at this time. 
Even after that December, January activity, the pipeline still stands today in excess of 1.1 million square feet, with more than half of that amount consisting of leases that are either out for signature or are in advanced stages of negotiation.
So that leaves us this year with about 800,000 square feet left to lease on a portfolio of nearly 30 [ph] million [ph] square feet. That's obviously a very small and manageable amount for us to be managing this year. Therefore, a lot of our attention, a lot of Steve's attention, Steve's attention will be focused on the expirations in 2017 where at the moment, exploration stand at about 1.7 million square feet. But I do want to add that the pipeline I mentioned earlier consists of about 650,000 square feet of leases that expire in '17. So obviously, one month into the year, we are already working hard on mitigating and reducing 2017's exposure. In '18, we go back to a more normalized -- below normalized expiration amount of 1 million square feet. So I think we feel very good about '16, '17 and '18 where we stand in terms of availabilities, pipeline. Our portfolio was 97.1% leased over that extraordinary amount of space, which I think is a real achievement and a real testament to this team to be able to keep these buildings at such a high level performance.
With all of that said, we look at the current market environment and look at how we think it may affect job creation going forward, and how that may turn -- in turn translates into demand for space. And I would say that those 2 which are highly connected, we expect to see a bit of a rollback in job creation for the first time in the past 4 or 5 years in New York City, and I'll get into stats on that. And in turn, that, that will have an impact on leasing velocities, which we do expect will begin to slow sometime in the second half of the year.
So I think as far as we're concerned with the guidance we had given, about 45 to 50 days ago at the investor conference, we still feel like all of that was somewhere between priced in or forecasted into our goals and objectives for the year, and we still feel very good about where we stand, both for leasing velocity for 2016. Got [ph] 2 million square feet mark-to-market, which we set a very high bar for ourselves for same-store NOI and leasing velocity. Looking at the portfolio where we stand almost a month into the year, we feel good and can affirm those levels for sure. But we do see headwinds that we think are fairly -- should be fairly expected for an economy that has been producing greater than 2% job growth for 5 consecutive years that is -- far outpaces the numbers nationally. It also far outpaces historical norm in New York City. And whereas last year, 2015, there was about 87,000 or 88,000 private sector jobs created in New York City, about 30,000 of which we were using. We would expect that number to still be significant, but probably more in the order of 50,000 to 60,000 jobs created this year, and hence 12,000 to 16,000 office-using jobs created in 2016. So by historical standards, in excess of 1% job growth, still a very good number, but it does reflect a slowing of this unprecedented rate of growth, and I think businesses catch their breath over 4 or 5 years of significant expansionary period. But with these numbers, we do think that absorption will stay positive and that we'll be able to maintain our rent spreads and our occupancy levels.
Looking at the retail leasing market and what we've been able to accomplish there, we're joined today by Brett Herschenfeld who fields some comments. Brett, as you saw in the investor conference, leads our division and has more to say. I think at the retail it's generally still very positive aspect and positive part of our strategy for 2016. Although as we had said and probably for 12 to 18 months now, we do see signs of slowing sales in certain corridors, in certain of these submarkets, most notably some of the large rebranded retailers, maybe on Fifth and Upper Madison are experiencing sales that would prevent these rents from continuing to rise. Whether or not there will be any pullback in rent is yet to see. But our embedded retail rents across the board are about 100% below market. That's a number that you should recall from the investor conference, 100% below market. So whether the rents stay the same, go up a bit or even pullback 5% to 10%, I would say to you that there's still significant, significant upside in the retail portfolio. We're still very bullish about the prospects of meeting our growth objectives which last year was $30 million in the growth portfolio. This year, it's about $32 million in the growth portfolio. And then I think for the 5 years thereafter, we projected somewhere in the order of $45 million or so incremental, mostly out of the growth in the retail portfolio. So that, I would say, is still highly achievable whether the rents are at market, whether there's a slight pullback in that market. We still have very good demand in retail as you saw with that 40,000 square foot plus Nordstrom lease we're able to sign at 3 Columbus. I think that's a great mark. You saw we got the Armani deal done in end of November, beginning of December, at rents for Upper East Side Madison that are very, very reflective of today's market rents. SoHo, I think is kind of a tale of 2 areas for some of the product along Broadway is probably losing a little bit of velocity, but on the side streets where we focused on Green Street and Spring Street and elsewhere, we still see very, very good demand from smaller retailers for those kind of boutique and unique spaces. And I think we'll have more to say about that this year as we continue to lease up assets, like 110 Greene Street and"

I don't think we really have a retail exposure of any note other than 655th , which we continue to work.

I don't think we really have a retail exposure of any note other than 655th , which we continue to work. Been to the finish line a couple of times but haven't been across the finish line, so that's one asset we hold in a joint venture out of the myriad of assets in retail where we'll be working hard this year to get at least. But the rest of it I would say is either put to bed or has significant, significant upside given our low basis in those assets and the low rents in place. 
Looking at the investment market. 2015, you recall Isaac Zion saying that we had record volumes. I don't have the number in front of me, but I want it to be able in excess of $60 billion of commercial transaction activity. Through the [indiscernible] there was more transactions that rounded out the year in December. And I know our constituency likes to look at just what's at the moment, not what happened 3 or 6 or 9 months ago. And in that regard, I would point you in the direction of 4 sort of interesting transactions, all of which we believe are either -- well all under contract, for the most part. I don't think any are closed yet. 
There's 1285, 6 a deal which Scott was doing, which is I think a very good down the middle deal for Scott. It was a 4.4%, 4.5% stabilized, going in yield and stabilized yield. So it's about a 4.5 [ph] cap going in. It's under 1,000 foot, 950 a foot for a Sixth Avenue product, and a large transaction, so in that large transactions of $1.7 billion or more can still get done and capitalized in this market. 787 7th, they're again going through a yield of 4.5 [ph], 4.6 [ph], which is similar to the yield that we were able to achieve on 11 Madison. But here, we look at 787 as having above market rents. And we think that there'll be pressure and execution to keep those yields at those levels as opposed to the Madison deal, which was contractually there with upside and the downside. The per foot there was 1,150 a foot on that deal on 7th and that's $1,950,000,000 purchase price. Then we have 2 other deals, which may not be quite as well known or appreciated by our shareholders and these are very recent. 853rd [ph] Avenue is a deal that's being done, at least what our reconnaissance are telling us, it's around $875 [ph] a foot. a sub-3.5% going in the yield. There will be real work there to kind of rework that tenancy in order to get up to a 5 or 5.5 or so stabilized year, but that would be some time now, probably 5 years or more out in time, and that's the deal, that's about $460 million of price. And lastly 405 Park is rumored to be under contract at a purchase price of $240 million. But more importantly, at a price per foot of $1,450 per foot. Stabilized basis we project will be closer to $1,600 [ph] per foot. That was about a 3% going on yield. And I would say this transaction doesn't just flat at 280 Park, picks it up and puts it on a pedestal. The investment market as evidenced by those 4 deals, I would say, is still alive and well. Although, like with the leasing market, we put caveat a here. We do expect a slowdown in the transaction volume. We certainly do not expect the record levels that we saw last year or anything close to it. In part that's going to be particularly due to what we think will be some softness in the areas of condos and hotels where we think that this market will probably -- take a more strict view of pricing with respect to those assets. However, just to draw a distinction, we do think that well leased and well-located commercial assets will still be in demand. I will even use the words high demand, because there's still few and far between and there's still a lot of equity looking to invest in this market that's just going to be very particular now that the kind of assets you want to be in. And for those high demand assets, I think cap rates will remain exactly where they were in that 4% to 4.5% range, or even in some cases, 3.5% to 4% to 4.5% range for the best assets. 
However, further on these commercial assets, there are the transitional types of assets that require significant redevelopment, reposition and leasing execution. There we would expect hurdle IRR rates. Not cap rates, but IRRs to increase maybe 50, 75, maybe even depending on location, 100 basis points in threshold returns for these sort of transitional assets.
So clearly, I think that the deals I just rolled you through and a view of the market flatters the 11 Madison deal, even more so. I said in the investor conference, I thought it was one of the best deals this company has ever done, because it's high-quality asset with high-quality tenants. The financing was put away long-term at 4%, limited downside and very significant long-term upside. Not only that, but it allowed us to get out of some of these assets, where I think of that there will be more and more market headwinds for this year. So our timing, I think, was excellent both on the quality, I think our sales were well executed. And all in all, I think it certainly bears out the strategy that we've laid out for everybody. 
Look at acquisitions and dispositions now for 2016. I just want to address this issue. I've seen a lot of reports about net acquirers, net acquirers. We tackled the question in the investor conference, I want to hit it on here, I'm sure I'll hit it on again in Q&A. When we put up numbers for goals, those are gross numbers, gross numbers, gross means gross of joint ventures. So $1 billion of acquisition is $1 billion of product, it's not $1 billion of wholly-owned product. As you know, we do wholly-owned and we do joint ventures, like Tower 46, a joint venture. 10 East 53rd was a joint venture. Those are 2 of our recent -- more recent asset buys.
So when you see $1 billion of acquisition and $700 million of dispositions, or $750 [ph] million [ph] of dispositions, that does not imply $250 [ph] million [ph] of equity issued nor debt leverage up. It just doesn't. What it implies is that we believe that during this year, we might see 1 or 2 interesting opportunities to exercise on them, may be, and if we do, we'll do it in a way where they are may be funding by sales or equity period. There should be no ambiguity about that eventhough we continue to read about expanding the balance sheet or levering up or issuing equity, none of which we did as part of last year's what we called rubric, nor would it be part of this year's business plan. I don't think we've issued equity since the first quarter of last year. 
So that's been a concern, I would sort of take that concern off the table in terms of whether or not we're going to be net acquirers or not. I think it's going to be a neutral position. And whether we do the full [ph] $1 [ph] billion or not, that will sort of be dependent on the opportunities we see in the market. It's easy to say when the market gets tight, don't do anything, we don't exactly agree with that. We think you have to moderate your investment approach. Recall that the Citibank building, 383 90 Granite was the deal we closed on, I believe, in December of 2007, okay? And we made a lot of money on that deal, both in terms of return and capital gains. So you have to be choosy, you have to be creative, you have to make sure it's well-capitalized. But I think a blanket statement that no deals get done would be inconsistent and not the right thing to say, nor is anyone finding that this is an expansionary market for SL Green. We're going to be very, very discerning on purchases as we are at this point in the market. In 2007, we I think we literally did 2 deals, that one and a small other. 2008, nothing. In 2009 or '10, again because you can't sit on your hands, we did 510 Madison Avenue debt deal, which turned out to be one of the most exceptional VP assets we ever did. We were first, we were early in that sort of cycled upswing. So I think we're doing the right things on the acquisition side. And I think there's the opportunity to make good deals. But if we don't see them out there, then you won't see the acquisitions growth take, and we'll be focusing, I guess, instead on simply dispositions. 
So on the dispositions front, there's one in particular to take note of that particular 380, 390 Greenwich, which we talked about in the investor conference as being: A, highly likely to occur; and B, part of our capital plan. I did see in 1 or 2 reports the word surprised. Surprise exercise by Citi. There can be no surprise. There can only be what we say in the investor conference about the high likelihood of Citi exercising in December turned into an actual exercise in January. And the reason why we our standard at deal A, it allows us to close out a very profitable position, investment position, we took in the asset: But two, it will result in a reduction of indebtedness gearing of one full term. So between $1.45 billion of debt and the $350 million of net equity pay down or thereabout net equity proceeds, there will be about 1 full turn of debt reduction associated with that resolution of asset. Not a surprise because we put that there as kind of a pro forma investment as to how the gearing gets, not only to where our leverage levels were in 2015 at the beginning which were already reduced, but gets reduced further. 
Second, we have other sources of equity that we would look to capitalize on this year, either for reinvestment or further debt reduction beyond 380 or 390. And clearly, 11 Madison -- again, no surprises, I said on the call right after we purchased it, that it was one particular asset that we might JV, re-JV after purchase. If we do that, there is no tax impediment to a joint venture. It's set up as a tick, so it's relatively easy to joint venture and still maintain that tax protection that we structured in the balance of the investment, and it's the kind of investment that has attraction in good markets and bad. There are other assets we are looking at now that we can sell in this market, that we'll still receive a very good reception from foreign and domestic investors, that I think you will see us execute on as part of reaching our goal for the year. But on one hand, while the market orients into those kind of assets in terms of dispositions, it will make us choosier and pickier in other assets where there's more execution and this may not be the right time to optimally sell those assets, in which case we'll just continue to hold those for the future or execute upon them ourselves.
Lastly, before I open up to Q&A because I noticed this is an unusually long introduction, we have One Vanderbilt. There were literally questions about whether there's any update, leasing status to which we did 45 days ago. I don't know what to say to that rather than reiterate what I said in December, which is this is an asset that tenants will be taking possession of sometime generally in late 2019 and '20. Therefore at the end of 2015, beginning 2016, it's far too early for most of these tenants to make that kind of space commitment. Most of the larger tenants are looking for space commitments at around 2018, early '19. And One Vanderbilt is not intended to be designed for the 1 [ph] million square-foot user. It's more in line for the 50,000 to 400,000 square foot user. Those kind of users make their decisions later in the cycle, generally 2 to 3 years in advance of possession dates, such that the meat of the leasing for One Vanderbilt will likely be in 2017 and '18.
So that's where we are in that. In terms of funding plan for One Vanderbilt, we laid out a funding plan in December. I was asked whether we changed our funding plan. So the answer is no, we haven't changed our funding plan. It is still our plan to obtain construction financing in the first half of this year and then joint venture financing in the second half of the year. I would imagine 45 days from now we'll be saying the same thing, although obviously we do adapt as the markets adapt. However, I just wanted to go a little further, not only on the plan but on the numbers, to give you a sense of how confident we feel in the execution of One Vanderbilt. Given the monies we already have invested in the project, all the monies through the end of '15 and the 230-some-odd [ph] million dollars we project to expand out of cash flow in 2016, we should need to fund beyond that no further equity into the deal once we obtain construction financing and JV financing. We have modeled it in a way such that the balance of the project, which is the bulk of the construction, will be funded out of a conventionally structured loan and roughly a 50% JV partner. That will require not only no money invested into the deal after the end of this year, but actually will result to money back to SL Green as kind of profit, if you will, over and above our invested basis.
So that is what we'll call plan A. The Plan B would be a construction financing. We sell other assets, and we would have the ability to fund the remaining equity over the ensuing 4 or 5 years, essentially out of cash flow. There would be no need for equity issuance or lever up the Omni construction loan to fund the equity portion because we generally fund out of this company $200 million to $250 million more of redevelopment or development capital annually. And that would be an amount sufficient over that period of time to fund the balance of the equity in the event we couldn't or we chose not to JV the asset. However, the reception we believe in the market for partners for this asset is exceptionally strong, and therefore we think plan A is far more likely than plan B. 
So with that said, we'll take some more questions on that in the Q&A session. But that is how we see having that One Vanderbilt project funded in a way that puts no liquidity pressure on the company whatsoever. 
So with that, I'd like to open up for Q&A."

And then when we get to the levels we feel are the right gearing levels at the end of the cycle, then we're looking for a very opportunistic investments. So that thresholds rise. We're looking for very opportunistic investments, which we always generally are. And they're few and far between. I know people like to think in choppy markets, that means there will be a plethora of deals. This market is so solid right now generally, and you saw it a lot in '08, '09. Over half of the inventories owned by 12 or 15 of the best capitalized players in the city, so you just don't get these sort of highly distressed situations. So my point is if you see 1 or 2 this year -- next year doesn't matter, if you see 1 or 2 really solid deals and you act on them because they don't come along that often, but I guess the default assumption is most of the money raised through capital raising activities is going to reduce the line of credit, which was there as our source of liquidity to grow the portfolio and take advantage of the market over the past 4 or 5 years."

I think that the composition of what we may sell may change, because I think different assets will sell better in this market, so that may change. But the aggregate volumes we're not revising. And most importantly, I think from a portfolio and company performance level, when we're looking at things like expenses, margins, leasing volumes, occupancy, mark-to-market, NOI, we feel very, very strong about that. So remember, New York City projects 60,000 plus of new job growth. That's a very positive market. I just want to -- it's not a -- I would not use the term bearish market. If the city is going to grow by 60,000 private sector jobs, that would be in most markets be -- in most time periods for New York City considered very solid and enviable. It's not just at the same level it was last year. Those are stats we recently come cross. And I've always said that we tend to look at the job growth stats which is kind of a leading indicator.

So I don't think we invest to create FFO, but obviously we invest to create cash flow and profits, and FFO is a result of that. But I think we're always trying to be very selective about what we buy. I think that's why we have the portfolio we have today, which is I think second bar none in terms of quality and positioning. And we also are probably the most active recyclers of capital, so that we are always generally looking first to monetizing gains and reinvesting them to drive value, which in turn drives FFO.

But because we're so leased, we have opportunity to push those marginal rents higher than we normally would, because we have very little space available and not a whole lot expiring. And a lot of other landlords are in that same situation. So we will certainly be responsive to the market, but we're also holding our rents that can push those rents."

So I mean, this market becomes like an asterisk, to the relevant market for this asset, which is 5 to 6 years forward, and you have your JV equity in place such that we would have no further equity commitment. So without a financing risk and without any further equity component, that makes it an easier goal to move forward than not. So I think that the level of leasing will be known in '17 or '18. I would say, at least on a spec basis, that's the date, which we'll be reassessing or assessing the project.

And you don't see a lot of conduit loans in New York City, because they're all large loans, either single asset or sort of dominant pieces of bigger securitizations. I do think that these locations, we've been highlighting since the fall, does create opportunity in our structured finance book. And as sizing of senior loans changes due to higher cost and more conservative underwriting or less players in the market, it does generally improve the subordinate debt market. And we're either taking less risk or able to charge more for our capital. So I look for more impact on the structured finance book than on New York City assets, where I think there's still very robust commercial Bank market. There is a robust CMBS market for large assets. I don't see risk retention really playing that much into those assets."

Thank you, and I appreciate everybody calling in this afternoon to review our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. Before we jump into it, I just want to mentioned that Andrew Mathias is going to be joining in by phone from the orthopedist's office with cell phone in hand, because he sort of suffered an injury, but wouldn't let that hold him back from the call. And Steve Durels also calling in remotely, but available for Q&A, as I guess the stress and tension of an active year-end and beginning of January took a toll on him physically as well, but wouldn't keep him from the call either. So we are all here and just want to express our enthusiasm about the operating performance that we ended 2015 on a relative high note. As I think, most of you had an opportunity to see at the investor conference in December, we're feeling very good about the fact that our buildings are extremely well leased and generally well leased, with below-market rents that are ticking up 15% to 20% in some cases in the recent quarters. We have a modest amount of lease expirations in the coming years, and that is matched with a modest amount of debt maturities, which -- both of which were actively managed over the years to make sure that leading into markets where things are more uncertain. We have good tenure of lease maturities and good tenure of debt maturities. We are substantially complete with our redevelopment projects at 280 Park, 10 East 53rd Street; smaller project over at 16 Court Street. The important aspect there being: a, the buildings are all well positioned now like the rest of our portfolio; and b, all of that capital is now behind us. And speaking about capital, the remaining capital to fund for the Viacom and city leases are now reduced in the aggregate to under $200 million, which will be spread over the next few years. So that number has also been mitigated to a great extent over time.
Turning first, what I'd like to do is hit some of the questions and topics that have been raised in some of the analysts' notes that we've seen in the past 24 hours or so, and then open it up to Q&A.
So I guess beginning with Manhattan leasing market, office market in particular. We ended the quarter with 416,000 square feet of leasing at a mark-to-market rents that were up about 20%. So, obviously, a big end to the year. We're very happy with that. I think that was sort of on or ahead of schedule. We slightly exceeded our 2.2 million square feet of velocity for the full yea, but you should recall that we did advertise a pretty significant pipeline of leasing activity during the investor conference. And obviously, now we continue to capitalize on that pipeline not only through December but also in January. We've announced some leases as of yesterday, some big deals and a good way to kick off the New Year with Omnicom, Music Choice and Nordstrom, along with some other leasing in January, that brings the total -- the first month of the year to about 310,000 square feet of leasing in January.
So clearly, that is us executing on that pipeline. And now obviously, we're very focused on continuing to build that pipeline for future quarters. 
As a footnote to the Omnicom deal, because we got the question, it does represent a reduction in space at the news building, but we are actively working on a lease to absorb the remaining space. So I think we feel pretty good about where we are positioned with that space and that asset at this time.
Even after that December-January activity, the pipeline still stands today in excess of 1.1 million square feet, with more than half of that amount, consisting of leases that are either out for signature or are in advanced stages of negotiation.
So that leaves us this year with about 800,000 square feet left to lease on a portfolio of nearly 30 million square feet. That is  obviously a very small and manageable amount for us to be handling this year. Therefore, a lot of our attention, a lot of Steve's attention and Steve's attention will be focused on the expirations in 2017, where at the moment, exploration stand at about 1.7 million square feet. But I do want to add that the pipeline I mentioned earlier consists of about 650,000 square feet of leases that expire in '17. So obviously, one month into the year, we are already working hard on mitigating and reducing 2017's exposure. In '18, we go back to a more normalized -- below normalized expiration amount of 1 million square feet. So I think we feel very good about '16, '17 and '18 where we stand in terms of availabilities, pipeline. Our portfolio was 97.1% leased over that extraordinary amount of space, which, I think, is a real achievement and a real testament to this team to be able to keep these buildings at such a high level of performance.
With all of that said, we look at the current market environment and look at how we think it may affect job creation going forward, and how that may turn -- in turn translates into demand for space. And I would say that those 2, which are highly connected, we expect to see a bit of a rollback in job creation for the first time in the past 4 or 5 years in New York City, and I'll get into some stats on that. And in turn, that, that will have an impact on leasing velocities which we do expect will begin to slow sometime in the second half of the year.
So I think, as far as we are concerned with the guidance we had given about 45 to 50 days ago at the investor conference, we still feel like all of that was somewhere between priced in or forecasted into our goals and objectives for the year. And we still feel very good about where we stand, both for leasing velocity for 2016, about 2 million square feet mark-to-market, which we set a very high bar for ourselves on the same-store NOI and leasing velocity. Looking at the portfolio where we stand almost a month into the year, we feel good and can affirm those levels for sure. But we do see headwinds that we think are fairly -- should be fairly expected for an economy that has been producing greater than 2% job growth for 5 consecutive years, that is -- far outpaces the numbers nationally. It also far outpaces historical normative in New York City. And whereas last year, 2015, there was about 87,000 or 88,000 private sector jobs created in New York City, about 30,000 of which we were office-using. We would expect that number to still be significant, but probably more in the order of 50,000 to 60,000 jobs created this year, and hence 12,000 to 16,000 office-using jobs created in 2016. So by historical standards, in excess of 1% job growth, still a very good number, but it does reflect a slowing of this unprecedented rate of growth, as I think businesses sort of catch their breath over 4 or 5 years of significant expansionary period. But with these numbers, we do think that absorption will stay positive, and that we'll be able to maintain our rent spreads and our occupancy levels.
Looking at the retail leasing market and what we've been able to accomplish there, we're joined today by Brett Herschenfeld who fields some comments. Brett, as you recall, you saw in the investor conference, leads our SLG retail division and will have more to say. But I think that the retail is generally still very positive aspect and is positive part of our strategy for 2016. Although, as we had said and probably for 12 to 18 months now, we do see signs of slowing sales in certain condos, in certain of these submarkets, most notably some of the luxury branded retailers, maybe on Fifth and Upper Madison, are experiencing sales that would prevent these rents from continuing to rise. Whether or not there will be any pullback in rent is yet to see, but our embedded retail rents across the board are about 100% below market. That's a number that you should recall from the investor conference, 100% below market. So whether the rents stay the same, go up a bit, or even pullback 5% or 10%, I would say to you that there's still significant, significant upside in the retail portfolio. We're still very bullish about the prospects of meeting our growth objectives, which last year, it was $30 million in the growth portfolio; this year, it's about $32 million in the growth portfolio. And then I think for the 5 years thereafter, we projected something in the order of $45 million or so incremental, mostly out of the growth in retail portfolio. So that, I would say, is still highly achievable whether the rents are at market, whether there's a slight pullback in that market. We still have very good demand in retail as you saw with that 40,000 square foot plus Nordstrom lease we're able to sign at 3 Columbus. I think that's a great mark. You saw we got the Armani deal done back in end of November, beginning of December, at rents for Upper Madison -- Upper East Side Madison that are very, very reflective of today's market rents. Soho, I think is kind of a tale of 2 areas, but some of the products along Broadway is probably losing a little bit of velocity, but on the side streets, where we focused on Green Street and Spring Street and elsewhere, we still see very, very good demand from the smaller retailers for those kind of boutique and unique spaces. And I think we'll have more to say about that this year as we continue to lease up assets, like 110 Greene Street and"

So those are real bright spots. I don't think we really have a retail exposure of any note other than 650 Fifth, which we continue to work on, had been to the finish line a couple of times on that, but haven't yet crossed the finish line. So that's one asset we hold in a joint venture out of the myriad of assets we own in retail where we'll be working hard this year to get at least. But the rest of it, I would say, is either put to bed or has significant, significant upside, given our low basis in those assets and the low rents in place. 
Looking at the investment market. 2015, you recall Isaac Zion saying that we had record volumes. I don't have the number in front of me, but I want to say, with an excess of $60 billion of commercial transaction activity [indiscernible] and there was more transactions that rounded out the year in December. And I know our constituency likes to look at just what's of the moment, not what happened 3 or 6 or 9 months ago. And in that regard, I would point you in the direction of 4 sort of interesting transactions, all of which we believe are either -- well, all under contracts, for the most part. I don't think any are closed yet. 
This 1285 Sixth, which is a deal that Scott Rechler was doing, which is, I think, a very good down the middle deal for Scott. It was -- it's a 4.4%, 4.5% stabilized -- going-in yield and stabilized yield. So it's about a 4.5% cap going in. It's under 1,000 foot, 950 a foot for Sixth Avenue product and a large transaction, so in that large transactions of $1.7 billion or more can still get done and capitalized in this market. 787 Seventh there, again, going-in yield about 4.5%, 4.6%, which is similar to the yield that we were able to achieve on 11 Madison. But here, we look at 787 is having above-market rents. And we think that there'll be pressure in execution to keep those yields at those levels, as opposed to on 11 Madison deal, which was contractually there with upside and no downside. The per foot there was $1,150 a foot for that deal on Seventh and that's $1,950,000,000 purchase price. Then we have 2 other deals, which may not be quite as well known or appreciated by our shareholders, and these are very recent. 853 Avenue is a deal that's being done, at least our -- what our reconnaissance tell us, this is around $875 a foot, a sub-3.5% going-in yield. There will be real work there to kind of rework that tenancy in order to get up to a 5% or 5.5% or so stabilized yield, but that would be some time now, probably 5 years or more out in time. And that's the deal, that's about $460 million of price. And lastly, 405 Park is rumored to be under contract at a purchase price of $240 million. But more importantly, at a price per foot of $1,450 per foot, stabilized basis, we project it'll be closer to $1,600 per foot. That was about a 3% going-in yield. And I would say, this transaction doesn't just flatter 280 Park, it picks it up and puts it on a pedestal. So the investment market, as evidenced by those 4 deals, I would say, is still alive and well. Although, like with the leasing market, we put a caveat here. We do expect a slowdown in the transaction volume. We certainly do not expect the record levels that we saw last year or anything close to it. In part, that's going to be particularly due to, what we think, will be some softness in the areas of condos and hotels, where we think that this market will probably take a more strict view of pricing with respect to those assets. However, just to draw a distinction, we do think that well-leased and well-located commercial assets will still be in demand. I would even use the words ""high demand"" because there's still few and far between and there's still a lot of equity looking to invest in this market, they're just going to be very particular now about the kinds of assets they want to be in. And for those high-demand assets, I think, cap rates will remain exactly where they were in that 4% to 4.5% range, or even in some cases, 3.5% to 4% to 4.5% range for the best assets.
However, further on these commercial assets, there are the transitional types of assets that require significant redevelopment, reposition and leasing execution. There we would expect hurdle -- IRR hurdle rates, not cap rates, but IRRs to increase maybe 50, 75, maybe even depending on location, 100 basis points in threshold returns for these sort of transitional assets.
So clearly, I think that the deals I just rolled you through and our view of the market flatters the 11 Madison deal even more so. I said in the investor conference, I thought it was one of the best deals this company has ever done, because it's a high-quality asset with high-quality tenants. The financing was put away long term at 4%, limited downside and very significant long-term upside. Not only that, but it allowed us to get out of some of these transitional assets, where I think that there will be more market headwinds this year. So our timing, I think, was excellent, both on the [indiscernible]. I think our sales were well executed. And all in all, I think it certainly bears out the strategy that we've laid out for everybody. 
Look at acquisitions and dispositions now for 2016. I just want to address this issue. I've seen a lot of reports about net acquirers.  We tackled the question in the investor conference, I want to hit it on here. I'm sure I'll get it again in Q&A. When we put up numbers for goals, those are gross numbers, gross numbers, gross means gross of joint ventures. So $1 billion of acquisition is $1 billion of product, it's not $1 billion of wholly-owned product. As you know, we do wholly-owned and we do joint ventures, like Tower 46, a joint venture. 10 East 53rd was a joint venture. Those are 2 of our recent -- more recent office asset buys.
So when you see $1 billion of acquisition and $700 million of dispositions, or $750 million dispositions, that does not imply $250 million of equity issued nor debt leverage up. It just doesn't. What it implies is that we believe that during this year, we might see 1 or 2 interesting opportunities to exercise on them maybe. And if we do, we'll do it in a way where they are either funded entirely by sales or with JV equity period. There is no -- should be no ambiguity about that even though we continue to read about expanding the balance sheet or levering up or issuing equity, none of which, we did as part of last year's what we called room work, nor would it be part of this year's business plan. I don't think we've issued equity since the first quarter of last year. 
So that's been a concern. I would sort of take that concern off the table in terms of whether or not we're going to be net acquirers or not. I think it's going to be a neutral position, and whether we do the full $1 billion or not, that will sort of be dependent on the opportunities we see in the market. It's easy to say, well, when the market gets tight, don't do anything. We don't exactly agree with that. We think that you have to moderate your investment approach. Recall that the Citibank building, 388-390 Greenwich was a deal we closed on, I believe, in December of 2007, okay? And we made a lot of money on that deal, both in terms of total return and capital gain. So you have to be choosy, you have to be creative, you have to make sure it's well capitalized. But I think a blanket statement that no deals get done would be inconsistent and not the right thing to say nor is anyone buying that this is an expansionary market for SL Green. We're going to be very, very discerning on our purchases as we always are at this point in the market. In 2007, I think, we did literally 2 deals, that one and the small other; 2008, nothing; and 2009 or '10, again, because you can't just sit on your hands, we did 510 Madison Avenue debt deal, which turned out to be one of our most exceptional DPE assets we ever did. We were first, we were early in that sort of cycle of upswing. So I think we're going to -- I think we're doing the right things on the acquisition side, and I think there's the opportunity to make good deals. But if we don't see them out there, then you won't see the acquisitions across the tale [ph], and we'll be focusing, I guess, instead on simply dispositions. 
So on the dispositions front, there's one, in particular, to take note of that 380-390 Greenwich, which we talked about at the investor conference as being: a, highly likely to occur; and b, part of our capital plan. I did see in 1 or 2 reports the word ""surprise"", surprise exercised by Citi. There can be no surprise. There can only be what we say in that investor conference about the high likelihood of Citi exercising in December, turned into an actual exercise in January. And the reason why we are fancied at deal a, it allows us to close out a very profitable position -- investment position we took in the asset. But 2, it will result in a reduction of indebtedness gearing of one full term. So between $1.45 billion of debt and this $350 million of net equity paydown or thereabout net equity proceeds, there will be about 1 full turn of debt reduction associated with that resolution of asset. Not a surprise because that's we put that there as kind of a pro forma investment as to how the gearing gets, not only to where our leverage levels were in 2015 at the beginning, which were already reduced, but gets reduced further. 
Second, we have other sources of equity that we would look to capitalize on this year, either for reinvestment or further debt reduction beyond 380-390. And clearly, 11 Madison, again, no surprises, I said on the call right after we purchased it, that it was one particular asset that we might JV -- re-JV after purchase. If we do that, there is no tax impediment to a joint venture. It's set up as a tick, so it's relatively easy to joint venture of that asset and still maintain the tax protection that we structured in the balance of the investment. And it's the kind of investment that has attraction in good markets and bad. There are other assets we are looking at now that we can sell in this market, that we'll still receive a very good reception from foreign and domestic investors, that I think you will see us execute on as part of reaching our goal for the year. But on one hand, while the market orients into those kind of assets in terms of dispositions, it will make us choosier and pickier in other assets where there's more execution and this may not be the right time to optimally sell those assets, in which case, we'll just continue to hold those for the future or execute upon them ourselves.
Lastly, before I open up for Q&A because I know this is an unusually long introduction, we have One Vanderbilt. There were literally questions about whether there's any update in leasing status in what we did 45 days ago. I don't know what to say to that other than reiterate what I said in December, which is, ""This is an asset that tenants will be taking possession of sometime generally in late 2019 and '20."" Therefore, at the end of 2015, beginning 2016, it's far too early for most of these tenants to make that kind of space commitment. Most of the larger tenants today are looking for space commitments at around 2018, early '19. And One Vanderbilt is not intended to be designed for the 1 million square-foot user. It's more in line for the 50,000 to 400,000 square foot user. Those kind of users make their decisions later in the cycle, generally 2 to 3 years in advance of possession date, such that the lead of the leasing for One Vanderbilt will likely be in 2017 and '18.
So that's where we are in that. In terms of funding plan for One Vanderbilt, we laid out a funding plan in December. I was asked whether we changed our funding plan. So the answer is no, we haven't changed the funding plan. It is still our plan to obtain construction financing in the first half of this year and then joint venture financing in the second half of the year. I would imagine 45 days from now we'll say the same thing, although, obviously, we do adapt as the markets adapt. However, I want to just go a little further, not only on the plan but on the numbers, to give you a sense of how confident we feel in the execution of One Vanderbilt. Given the monies we already have invested in the project, all the monies through the end of '15 and the $230-some-odd million we project to expand out of cash flow in 2016, we should need to fund beyond that no further equity into the deal once we obtain construction financing and JV financing. We have modeled it in a way such that the balance of the project, which is the bulk of the construction, will be funded out of a conventionally structured construction loan and roughly a 50% JV partner. That would require not only no money invested into the deal after the end of this year, but actually will result in money back to SL Green as kind of profit, if you will, over and above our invested basis.
So that is what we'll call Plan A. The Plan B would be a construction financing. We sell other assets, and we would have the ability to fund the remaining equity over the ensuing 4 or 5 years, essentially out of cash flow. There would be no need for equity issuance or lever up beyond the construction loan to fund the equity portion, because we generally fund out of this company $200 million to $250 million or more of redevelopment or development capital annually. And that would be an amount sufficient over that period of time to fund the balance of the equity in the event we couldn't or to chose not the JV asset. However, the reception, we believe, in the market for partners for this asset is exceptionally strong, and therefore, we think plan A is far more likely than plan B. 
So with that said, we'll take some more questions on that at the end of -- in the Q&A session. But that is how we see having that One Vanderbilt project funded in a way that puts no liquidity pressure on the company whatsoever. 
So with that, I'd like to open up for Q&A."

So, I think, the investor sentiment, in general, has degraded substantially over the past, call it 50 days or so, even though the property metrics, if you will, have not. There's still -- we see very good access to debt financing. So we think projects will be -- better projects will be refinanced in this market.

You're looking for very opportunistic investments, which we always generally are. And they're few and far between. I know people like to think in choppy markets, that means there will be a plethora of deals. It shows this market is so solid right now generally, and you saw it a lot in '08, '09. Over a half of the inventories owned by 12 or 15 of the best capitalized players in the city, so you just don't get these sort of highly distressed situation. So my point is if you see 1 or 2 this year or next year, it doesn't matter, if you see 1 or 2 really solid deals and you act on them because they just don't come along that often. But I guess the default assumption is that most of the money raised through -- capital raising activities is going to reduce the line of credit, which was there as our source of liquidity to grow the portfolio and take advantage of the market over the past 4 or 5 years."

And because of that, we see opportunity, both in the DPE program, maybe down the road, 1 or 2 asset buys. I had described the $1 billion of acquisition, which was an aspiration goal at the time, as 1 or 2 opportunistic investments. So I don't think that's changed. I mean that's how we looked at it. I think that the composition of what we may sell will change because I think different assets will sell better in this market, so that may change. But the aggregate volumes, we're not revising. And most importantly, I think from a portfolio and company performance level, when we're looking at things like expenses, margins, leasing volumes, occupancy, mark-to-market, NOI, we feel very, very strong about that. So remember, New York City projects 60,000-plus of new job growth. That's a very positive market. I just want to -- it's not a -- I would not use the term bearish market. If the city is going to grow by 60,000 private sector jobs, that would, in most markets, be, in most time periods for New York City, considered very solid and enviable. It's just not at the same level it was last year. Those are stats we've recently come across. And I've always said that we tend to look at the job growth stats as kind of a leading indicator. So with that, I think it is a precursor, if you will, or at least a look into what will still be positive absorption, but potentially a slowing leasing market in the second half."

We try to do it in a way to have recurring and replicable FFO. And I think we've done that about as good as anyone in the sector with an FFO that will be approaching $7 a share this year, and the lion's share of that coming from stabilized commercial portfolio. So I don't think we invest to create FFO but, obviously, we invest to create cash flow and profits, and FFO is a result of that. But I think we're always trying to be very selective about what we buy. I think that's why we have the portfolio we have today, which is, I think, second bar none in terms of quality and positioning. And we also are probably the most active recyclers of capital, so that we're always generally looking first to monetizing gains and reinvesting them to drive value which, in turn, drives FFO. So I think they're very connected, if you will. But the DPE book is always a constant as it relates to the aggregate amount of our real estate portfolio. And that -- those proportions don't really -- haven't changed over the years and don't change much. And if we're going to invest incremental capital this year, it will be done very selectively, whether it's in commercial assets or the DPE book to make what we think will be outsized returns or -- and then only once we are at the sort of the leverage levels that we have set out as targets."

In terms of invested capital to date, or I should say through 2015, that number is $433 million or $250 per square foot, both of which, I think or hope you would agree, is a very, very attractive basis for us to own that land. It gives us complete flexibility, if you will, with respect to the future because we have a very low basis in it. We don't generate cash flow from it, so there's nothing in our current or future numbers. That's an important point, actually. In all the growth numbers we've shown, we've never shown any incremental NOI growth from One Vanderbilt. So the project, it will either be capitalized in a way I mentioned earlier, which would require essentially no further out-of-pocket from SLG, or build it out of cash flow, which I don't think we'll be in a position of having to make that decision, or you can sit on it for a time without any pressure or effect. Not many developers have development sites with that kind of inherent flexibility with no debt and no joint venture pressure to have to perform and meet and no earnings to have to support. So it sits on the balance sheet at very low levels. It has an investment level at a very low level and it gives us the flexibility, which is why we're very comfortable with it."

And Marc, I certainly appreciate your comments that in option 1, using joint venture equity as well as construction loan, you wouldn't have to put any more capital. I'm just curious, as you're thinking about that project and investing that extra $1.7 billion of capital, at what point do you make the decision to move completely forward? Is it at pre-leasing level or is it at a date? Because I do think that there is even, if you use joint venture in a construction loan, still some concern in the marketplace that you're going to move forward with an extraordinarily large development in an uncertain market and one where, clearly, your more subdued comments today would give people more pause. And so I think I'm just trying to understand when and in what sort of environment you would fully move forward with this?"

So you really have to look at what's the environment in '17 and '18 when we would expect the bulk of the leasing to be done. So with regards to a go-no go, to me it's about capitalization and risk mitigation. So to the extent you've got long-term and low-cost construction financing in place, that gets you into the 2020s. So I mean, this market becomes like an asterisk to the relevant market for this asset, which is 5 to 6 years forward, and you have your JV equity in place such that we would have no further equity commitment. So without a financing risk and without any further equity component, that makes it easier ""to move forward"" than not. So I think that the level of leasing will be known in '17 or '18. So I would say, at least on a spec basis, that's the date on which we'll be reassessing -- or assessing the project. But I'm very confident that, that project is going to be met with extraordinary demand on both the debt equity and leasing market. Just -- the meetings we've done to date have kind of codified for us, if you will, just how well received this product is going to be. But again, it's for a much future market. So I think the issue is predominantly capital risk mitigation, which is really in the form of equity bringing in a JV partner."

I think everybody's talking about risk retention for sure and nobody's -- there's still a lot of uncertainty in terms of how the rules are actually going to play out. I think it will have less of an impact, frankly, on large New York City assets and a much more direct impact on financing costs for typical conduit product where today that market have gotten rather efficient. And you don't see a lot of conduit loans in New York City because they're all large loans, either single assets or they're sort of dominant pieces of bigger securitizations. I do think that dislocation, one we've been highlighting since the fall, does create opportunity in our structured finance book and, as sizing of senior loans changes due to higher cost and more conservative underwriting or less players in the market, it does generally improve the subordinate debt market and were either taking less risk or able to charge more for our capital. So I'd look for a more impact in the structured finance book than on New York City assets, where I think there's still a very robust commercial bank market, there is a robust CMBS market for large assets. I don't see risk retention really playing that much into those assets."

Before we jump into it, I just want to mention that Andrew Mathias is going to be joining in by phone from the orthopedist's off",1690,"Okay. Thank you, and I appreciate everybody calling in this afternoon to review our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. Before we jump into it, I just want to mention that Andrew Mathias is going to be joining in by phone from the orthopedist's office with cell phone in hand, because he sort of suffered an injury, but wouldn't let that hold him back from the call. And Steve Durels also calling in remotely, but available for Q&A, as I guess the stress and tension of an active year-end and beginning of January took a toll on him physically as well, but wouldn't keep him from the call either. So we are all here and just want to express our enthusiasm about the operating performance that we ended 2015 on a relative high note. As I think, most of you had an opportunity to see at the investor conference in December, we're feeling very good about the fact that our buildings are extremely well leased and generally well leased, with below-market rents that are ticking up 15% to 20% in some cases in the recent quarters. We have a modest amount of lease expirations in the coming years, and that is matched with a modest amount of debt maturities, which -- both of which were actively managed over the years to make sure that leading into markets where things are more uncertain. We have good tenure of lease maturities and good tenure of debt maturities. We are substantially complete with our redevelopment projects at 280 Park, 10 East 53rd Street; smaller project over at 16 Court Street. The important aspect there being: a, the buildings are all well positioned now like the rest of our portfolio; and b, all of that capital is now behind us. And speaking about capital, the remaining capital to fund for the Viacom and city leases are now reduced in the aggregate to under $200 million, which will be spread over the next few years. So that number has also been mitigated to a great extent over time.
Turning first, what I'd like to do is hit some of the questions and topics that have been raised in some of the analysts' notes that we've seen in the past 24 hours or so, and then open it up to Q&A.
So I guess beginning with Manhattan leasing market, office market in particular. We ended the quarter with 416,000 square feet of leasing at a mark-to-market rents that were up about 20%. So, obviously, a big end to the year. We're very happy with that. I think that was sort of on or ahead of schedule. We slightly exceeded our 2.2 million square feet of velocity for the full year, but you should recall that we did advertise a pretty significant pipeline of leasing activity during the investor conference. And obviously, now we continue to capitalize on that pipeline not only through December but also in January. We've announced some leases as of yesterday, some big deals and a good way to kick off the New Year with Omnicom, Music Choice and Nordstrom, along with some other leasing in January, that brings the total -- the first month of the year to about 310,000 square feet of leasing in January.
So clearly, that is us executing on that pipeline. And now obviously, we're very focused on continuing to build that pipeline for future quarters. 
As a footnote to the Omnicom deal, because we got the question, it does represent a reduction in space at the news building, but we are actively working on a lease to absorb the remaining space. So I think we feel pretty good about where we are positioned with that space and that asset at this time.
Even after that December-January activity, the pipeline still stands today in excess of 1.1 million square feet, with more than half of that amount consisting of leases that are either out for signature or are in advanced stages of negotiation.
So that leaves us this year with about 800,000 square feet left to lease on a portfolio of nearly 30 million square feet. That is  obviously a very small and manageable amount for us to be handling this year. Therefore, a lot of our attention, a lot of Steve's attention and Steve's attention will be focused on the expirations in 2017, where at the moment, exploration stand at about 1.7 million square feet. But I do want to add that the pipeline I mentioned earlier consists of about 650,000 square feet of leases that expire in '17. So obviously, one month into the year, we are already working hard on mitigating and reducing 2017's exposure. In '18, we go back to a more normalized -- below normalized expiration amount of 1 million square feet. So I think we feel very good about '16, '17 and '18 where we stand in terms of availabilities, pipeline. Our portfolio was 97.1% leased over that extraordinary amount of space, which, I think, is a real achievement and a real testament to this team to be able to keep these buildings at such a high level of performance.
With all of that said, we look at the current market environment and look at how we think it may affect job creation going forward, and how that may turn -- in turn translates into demand for space. And I would say that those 2, which are highly connected, we expect to see a bit of a rollback in job creation for the first time in the past 4 or 5 years in New York City, and I'll get into some stats on that. And in turn, that, that will have an impact on leasing velocities which we do expect will begin to slow sometime in the second half of the year.
So I think, as far as we are concerned with the guidance we had given about 45 to 50 days ago at the investor conference, we still feel like all of that was somewhere between priced in or forecasted into our goals and objectives for the year. And we still feel very good about where we stand, both for leasing velocity for 2016, about 2 million square feet mark-to-market, which we set a very high bar for ourselves on the same-store NOI and leasing velocity. Looking at the portfolio where we stand almost a month into the year, we feel good and can affirm those levels for sure. But we do see headwinds that we think are fairly -- should be fairly expected for an economy that has been producing greater than 2% job growth for 5 consecutive years, that is -- far outpaces the numbers nationally. It also far outpaces historical normative in New York City. And whereas last year, 2015, there was about 87,000 or 88,000 private sector jobs created in New York City, about 30,000 of which were office-using. We would expect that number to still be significant, but probably more in the order of 50,000 to 60,000 jobs created this year, and hence 12,000 to 16,000 office-using jobs created in 2016. So by historical standards, in excess of 1% job growth, still a very good number, but it does reflect a slowing of this unprecedented rate of growth, as I think businesses sort of catch their breath over 4 or 5 years of significant expansionary period. But with these numbers, we do think that absorption will stay positive, and that we'll be able to maintain our rent spreads and our occupancy levels.
Looking at the retail leasing market and what we've been able to accomplish there, we're joined today by Brett Herschenfeld who will field some comments. Brett, as you recall, you saw in the investor conference, leads our SLG retail division and will have more to say. But I think that the retail is generally still very positive aspect and is positive part of our strategy for 2016. Although, as we had said and probably for 12 to 18 months now, we do see signs of slowing sales in certain corridors, in certain of these submarkets, most notably some of the luxury branded retailers, maybe on Fifth and Upper Madison, are experiencing sales that would prevent these rents from continuing to rise. Whether or not there will be any pullback in rent is yet to see, but our embedded retail rents across the board are about 100% below market. That's a number that you should recall from the investor conference, 100% below market. So whether the rents stay the same, go up a bit, or even pull back 5% or 10%, I would say to you that there's still significant, significant upside in the retail portfolio. We're still very bullish about the prospects of meeting our growth objectives, which last year, it was $30 million in the growth portfolio; this year, it's about $32 million in the growth portfolio. And then I think for the 5 years thereafter, we projected something in the order of $45 million or so incremental, mostly out of the growth in retail portfolio. So that, I would say, is still highly achievable whether the rents are at market, whether there's a slight pullback in that market. We still have very good demand in retail as you saw with that 40,000 square foot plus Nordstrom lease we're able to sign at 3 Columbus. I think that's a great mark. You saw we got the Armani deal done back in end of November, beginning of December, at rents for Upper Madison -- Upper East Side Madison that are very, very reflective of today's market rents. Soho, I think is kind of a tale of 2 areas, but some of the product along Broadway is probably losing a little bit of velocity, but on the side streets, where we focused on Green Street and Spring Street and elsewhere, we still see very, very good demand from the smaller retailers for those kind of boutique and unique spaces. And I think we'll have more to say about that this year as we continue to lease up assets, like 110 Greene Street and --"

So those are real bright spots. I don't think we really have a retail exposure of any note other than 650 Fifth, which we continue to work on, had been to the finish line a couple of times on that, but haven't yet crossed the finish line. So that's one asset we hold in a joint venture out of the myriad of assets we own in retail where we'll be working hard this year to get at least. But the rest of it, I would say, is either put to bed or has significant, significant upside, given our low basis in those assets and the low rents in place. 
Looking at the investment market. 2015, you recall Isaac Zion saying that we had record volumes. I don't have the number in front of me, but I want to say it was an excess of $60 billion of commercial transaction activity through the date of IC
and there was more transactions that rounded out the year in December. And I know our constituency likes to look at just what's of the moment, not what happened 3 or 6 or 9 months ago. And in that regard, I would point you in the direction of 4 sort of interesting transactions, all of which we believe are either -- well, all under contracts, for the most part. I don't think any are closed yet. 
There's 1285 Sixth, which is a deal that Scott Rechler was doing, which is, I think, a very good down the middle deal for Scott. It was -- it's a 4.4%, 4.5% stabilized -- going-in yield and stabilized yield. So it's about a 4.5% cap going in. It's under 1,000 foot, 950 a foot for Sixth Avenue product and a large transaction, so in that large transactions of $1.7 billion or more can still get done and capitalized in this market. 787 Seventh there, again, going-in yield about 4.5%, 4.6%, which is similar to the yield that we were able to achieve on 11 Madison. But here, we look at 787 as having above-market rents. And we think that there'll be pressure in execution to keep those yields at those levels, as opposed to an 11 Madison deal, which was contractually there with upside and no downside. The per foot there was $1,150 a foot for that deal on Seventh and that's $1,950,000,000 purchase price. Then we have 2 other deals, which may not be quite as well known or appreciated by our shareholders, and these are very recent. 850 Third Avenue is a deal that's being done, at least our -- what our reconnaissance tell us, at around $875 a foot, a sub-3.5% going-in yield. There will be real work there to kind of rework that tenancy in order to get up to a 5% or 5.5% or so stabilized yield, but that would be some time out, probably 5 years or more out in time. And that's the deal, that's about $460 million of price. And lastly, 405 Park is rumored to be under contract at a purchase price of $240 million. But more importantly, at a price per foot of $1,450 per foot, stabilized basis, we project it'll be closer to $1,600 per foot. That was about a 3% going-in yield. And I would say, this transaction doesn't just flatter 280 Park, it picks it up and puts it on a pedestal. So the investment market, as evidenced by those 4 deals, I would say, is still alive and well. Although, like with the leasing market, we put a caveat here. We do expect a slowdown in the transaction volume. We certainly do not expect the record levels that we saw last year or anything close to it. In part, that's going to be particularly due to, what we think, will be some softness in the areas of condos and hotels, where we think that this market will probably take a more strict view of pricing with respect to those assets. However, just to draw a distinction, we do think that well-leased and well-located commercial assets will still be in demand. I would even use the words ""high demand"" because there's still few and far between and there's still a lot of equity looking to invest in this market, they're just going to be very particular now about the kinds of assets they want to be in. And for those high-demand assets, I think, cap rates will remain exactly where they were in that 4% to 4.5% range, or even in some cases, 3.5% to 4% to 4.5% range for the best assets.
However, further on these commercial assets, there are the transitional types of assets that require significant redevelopment, reposition and leasing execution. There we would expect hurdle -- IRR hurdle rates, not cap rates, but IRRs to increase maybe 50, 75, maybe even depending on location, 100 basis points in threshold returns for these sort of transitional assets.
So clearly, I think that the deals I just rolled you through and our view of the market flatters the 11 Madison deal even more so. I said in the investor conference, I thought it was one of the best deals this company has ever done, because it's a high-quality asset with high-quality tenants. The financing was put away long term at 4%, limited downside and very significant long-term upside. Not only that, but it allowed us to get out of some of these transitional assets, where I think that there will be more market headwinds this year. So our timing, I think, was excellent, both on the buy, I think our sells were well executed. And all in all, I think it certainly bears out the strategy that we've laid out for everybody. 
Look at acquisitions and dispositions now for 2016. I just want to address this issue. I've seen a lot of reports about net acquirers.  We tackled the question in the investor conference, I want to hit it on here. I'm sure I'll get it again in Q&A. When we put up numbers for goals, those are gross numbers, gross numbers, gross means gross of joint ventures. So $1 billion of acquisition is $1 billion of product, it's not $1 billion of wholly-owned product. As you know, we do wholly-owned and we do joint ventures, like Tower 46, a joint venture. 10 East 53rd was a joint venture. Those are 2 of our recent -- more recent office asset buys.
So when you see $1 billion of acquisition and $700 million of dispositions, or $750 million of dispositions, that does not imply $250 million of equity issued nor debt leverage up. It just doesn't. What it implies is that we believe that during this year, we might see 1 or 2 interesting opportunities to exercise on them maybe. And if we do, we'll do it in a way where they are either funded entirely by sales or with JV equity. Period. There is no -- should be no ambiguity about that even though we continue to read about expanding the balance sheet or levering up or issuing equity, none of which, we did as part of last year's what we called rubric, nor would it be part of this year's business plan. I don't think we've issued equity since the first quarter of last year. 
So that's been a concern. I would sort of take that concern off the table in terms of whether or not we're going to be net acquirers or not. I think it's going to be a neutral position, and whether we do the full $1 billion or not, that will sort of be dependent on the opportunities we see in the market. It's easy to say, well, when the market gets tight, don't do anything. We don't exactly agree with that. We think that you have to moderate your investment approach. Recall that the Citibank building, 388-390 Greenwich was a deal we closed on, I believe, in December of 2007, okay? And we made a lot of money on that deal, both in terms of total return and capital gain. So you have to be choosy, you have to be creative, you have to make sure it's well capitalized. But I think a blanket statement that no deals get done would be inconsistent and not the right thing to say nor is anyone buying that this is an expansionary market for SL Green. We're going to be very, very discerning on our purchases as we always are at this point in the market. In 2007, I think, we did literally 2 deals, that one and the small other; 2008, nothing; and 2009 or '10, again, because you can't just sit on your hands, we did 510 Madison Avenue debt deal, which turned out to be one of our most exceptional DPE assets we ever did. We were first, we were early in that sort of cycle of upswing. So I think we're going to -- I think we're doing the right things on the acquisition side, and I think there's the opportunity to make good deals. But if we don't see them out there, then you won't see the acquisitions cross the tape, and we'll be focusing, I guess, instead on simply dispositions. 
So on the dispositions front, there's one, in particular, to take note of that 380-390 Greenwich, which we talked about at the investor conference as being: a, highly likely to occur; and b, part of our capital plan. I did see in 1 or 2 reports the word ""surprise,"" surprise exercised by Citi. There can be no surprise. There can only be what we say in that investor conference about the high likelihood of Citi exercising in December, turned into an actual exercise in January. And the reason why we are fancied[ph] at deal a, it allows us to close out a very profitable position -- investment position we took in the asset. But 2, it will result in a reduction of indebtedness gearing of one full term. So between $1.45 billion of debt and this $350 million of net equity paydown or thereabout net equity proceeds, there will be about 1 full turn of debt reduction associated with that resolution of asset. Not a surprise because that's -- we put that there as kind of a pro forma investment as to how the gearing gets, not only to where our leverage levels were in 2015 at the beginning, which were already reduced, but gets reduced further. 
Second, we have other sources of equity that we would look to capitalize on this year, either for reinvestment or further debt reduction beyond 380-390. And clearly, 11 Madison, again, no surprises, I said on the call right after we purchased it, that it was one particular asset that we might JV -- re-JV after purchase. If we do that, there is no tax impediment to a joint venture. It's set up as a tick, so it's relatively easy to joint venture that asset and still maintain the tax protection that we structured in the balance of the investment. And it's the kind of investment that has attraction in good markets and bad. There are other assets we are looking at now that we can sell in this market, that we'll still receive a very good reception from foreign and domestic investors, that I think you will see us execute on as part of reaching our goal for the year. But on one hand, while the market orients into those kind of assets in terms of dispositions, it will make us choosier and pickier in other assets where there's more execution and this may not be the right time to optimally sell those assets, in which case, we'll just continue to hold those for the future or execute upon them ourselves.
Lastly, before I open up for Q&A because I know this is an unusually long introduction, we have One Vanderbilt. There were literally questions about whether there's any update in leasing status in what we did 45 days ago. I don't know what to say to that other than reiterate what I said in December, which is, ""This is an asset that tenants will be taking possession of sometime generally in late 2019 and '20."" Therefore, at the end of 2015, beginning 2016, it's far too early for most of these tenants to make that kind of space commitment. Most of the larger tenants today are looking for space commitments at around 2018, early '19. And One Vanderbilt is not intended to be designed for the 1 million square-foot user. It's more in line for the 50,000 to 400,000 square foot user. Those kind of users make their decisions later in the cycle, generally 2 to 3 years in advance of possession date, such that the lead of the leasing for One Vanderbilt will likely be in 2017 and '18.
So that's where we are in that. In terms of funding plan for One Vanderbilt, we laid out a funding plan in December. I was asked whether we changed our funding plan. So the answer is no, we haven't changed the funding plan. It is still our plan to obtain construction financing in the first half of this year and then joint venture financing in the second half of the year. I would imagine 45 days from now we'll say the same thing, although, obviously, we do adapt as the markets adapt. However, I want to just go a little further, not only on the plan but on the numbers, to give you a sense of how confident we feel in the execution of One Vanderbilt. Given the monies we already have invested in the project, all the monies through the end of '15 and the $230-some-odd million we project to expend out of cash flow in 2016, we should need to fund beyond that no further equity into the deal once we obtain construction financing and JV financing. We have modeled it in a way such that the balance of the project, which is the bulk of the construction, will be funded out of a conventionally structured construction loan and roughly a 50% JV partner. That would require not only no money invested into the deal after the end of this year, but actually would result in money back to SL Green as kind of profit, if you will, over and above our invested basis.
So that is what we'll call Plan A. The Plan B would be a construction financing. We sell other assets, and we would have the ability to fund the remaining equity over the ensuing 4 or 5 years, essentially out of cash flow. There would be no need for equity issuance or lever up beyond the construction loan to fund the equity portion, because we generally fund out of this company $200 million to $250 million or more of redevelopment or development capital annually. And that would be an amount sufficient over that period of time to fund the balance of the equity in the event we couldn't or to chose not to JV the asset. However, the reception, we believe, in the market for partners for this asset is exceptionally strong, and therefore, we think plan A is far more likely than plan B. 
So with that said, we'll take some more questions on that at the end of -- in the Q&A session. But that is how we see having that One Vanderbilt project funded in a way that puts no liquidity pressure on the company whatsoever. 
So with that, I'd like to open up for Q&A."

So, I think, the investor sentiment, in general, has degraded substantially over the past, call it 50 days or so, even though the property metrics, if you will, have not. There's still -- we see very good access to debt financing. So we think projects will be -- better projects will be refinanced in this market. There is a lot of equity capital out there still looking for investment, and the tenant demand for the first month of the year was good and the pipeline remains. However, I would say, for -- what I'll say out of -- I don't know -- out of favor or more secondary tertiary assets, either asset classes or transitional assets, I think, as the financing becomes tougher to obtain for those kinds of projects, you're going to see those kind of projects back up a bit, but I don't think that's going to affect our portfolio in almost all respects."

And then when we get to the levels we feel are the right gearing levels at the end of the cycle, then we're looking for a very opportunistic investment. So the thresholds rise. You're looking for very opportunistic investments, which we always generally are. And they're few and far between. I know people like to think in choppy markets, that means there will be a plethora of deals. It shows this market is so solid right now generally, and you saw it a lot in '08, '09. Over half of the inventories owned by 12 or 15 of the best capitalized players in the city, so you just don't get these sort of highly distressed situation. So my point is if you see 1 or 2 this year or next year, it doesn't matter, if you see 1 or 2 really solid deals and you act on them because they just don't come along that often. But I guess the default assumption is that most of the money raised through  capital raising activities is going to reduce the line of credit, which was there as our source of liquidity to grow the portfolio and take advantage of the market over the past 4 or 5 years."

So remember, New York City projects 60,000-plus of new job growth. That's a very positive market. I just want to -- it's not a -- I would not use the term bearish market. If the city is going to grow by 60,000 private sector jobs, that would, in most markets, be, in most time periods for New York City, considered very solid and enviable.

I think we have tended to stay more senior in the capital stack and take less risk and maintain our yields which I think has been a stated goal of ours. And I think that's going to be consistent in this year. So I think we have a pretty healthy pipeline right now. I think yields have held firm but we've really tried to go consistent with last year and take a little bit less risk while maintaining yields and not try to outperform on yields that get kind of the 8.5-plus percent yield while taking the minimum risk to get there."

We try to do it in a way to have recurring and replicable FFO. And I think we've done that about as good as anyone in the sector with an FFO that will be approaching $7 a share this year, and the lion's share of that coming from stabilized commercial portfolio. So I don't think we invest to create FFO but, obviously, we invest to create cash flow and profits, and FFO is a result of that. But I think we're always trying to be very selective about what we buy. I think that's why we have the portfolio we have today, which is, I think, second bar none in terms of quality and positioning. And we also are probably the most active recyclers of capital, so that we're always generally looking first to monetizing gains and reinvesting them to drive value which, in turn, drives FFO. So I think they're very connected, if you will. But the DPE book is always a constant as it relates to the aggregate amount of our real estate portfolio. And that -- those proportions don't really -- haven't changed over the years and don't change much. And if we're going to invest incremental capital this year, it will be done very selectively, whether it's in commercial assets or the DPE book to make what we think will be outsized returns or -- and then only once we are at the sort of the leverage levels that we have set out as targets."

That's the book balance. In terms of invested capital to date, or I should say through 2015, that number is $433 million or $250 per square foot, both of which, I think or hope you would agree, is a very, very attractive basis for us to own that land. It gives us complete flexibility, if you will, with respect to the future because we have a very low basis in it. We don't generate cash flow from it, so there's nothing in our current or future numbers. That's an important point, actually. In all the growth numbers we've shown, we've never shown any incremental NOI growth from One Vanderbilt. So the project, it will either be capitalized in a way I mentioned earlier, which would require essentially no further out-of-pocket from SLG, or build it out of cash flow, which I don't think we'll be in a position of having to make that decision, or you can sit on it for a time without any pressure or effect. Not many developers have development sites with that kind of inherent flexibility with no debt and no joint venture pressure to have to perform and meet and no earnings to have to support. So it sits on the balance sheet at very low levels. It has an investment balance at a very low level and it gives us the flexibility, which is why we're very comfortable with it."

So I mean, this market becomes like an asterisk to the relevant market for this asset, which is 5 to 6 years forward, and you have your JV equity in place such that we would have no further equity commitment.

I do think debt dislocations we've been highlighting since the fall, does create opportunity in our structured finance book and, as sizing of senior loans changes due to higher cost and more conservative underwriting or less players in the market, it does generally improve the subordinate debt market and we're either taking less risk or able to charge more for our capital.

The sun is shining and the stock is up, and we're glad you joined us for our first quarter earnings call. Andrew is back in the saddle and with us today after his surgery and we look forward to answering all of your questions. But first, a few comments on the quarter and the outlook for the New York market. 
Our Q1 results, by any measure were outstanding and indicative of a company that is firing on all cylinders. By my count, we have done over 70 of these earnings calls since IPO and there were none that I can remember where the earnings results were so complete and so satisfying. 
On this past December 7, we set out for ourselves a host of intentionally challenging and specific goals and objectives with the hope and expectation of meeting all of them in 2016. On January 27 of this year, against global market headwinds, we reaffirmed our guidance, evidencing the confidence we have in our company, ourselves, our market, to continuously deliver superior results on both an absolute and relative basis. This is because our discerning approach to investing in assets with significant growth opportunity and the constant recycling of our portfolio and enables us to generate market-leading earnings growth while also assembling the highest quality property portfolio in New York City.
These activities have resulted in our steadily increasing funds from operations from just $1.70 per share in our first year of being listed on the stock exchange to a normalized amount of approximately $7 per share estimated for 2016, a rate of growth that is unsurpassed in our industry sector.
Overall, New York City remains extremely solid, notwithstanding the dislocations we saw in the financial sector in December, January and the first half of February, volatility that has since leveled off. New York is often perceived to be heavily dependent upon the financial services sector for jobs and office-based demands. The reality, however, is that New York is, by far, the most compelling, diversified and resilient commercial property market in the country, possibly the world, and continues to attract businesses and investment capital, notwithstanding where we are at any one point in time in the market cycle.
Further, New York City dependence on the financial services industry has been reduced as other industry segments have proliferated, such as media, technology, education and health care. In fact, the financial services industry's contribution to incremental leasing absorption has fallen in recent years from 34% of square footage leased to 24% of square footage leased over the last 5 years, thereby reducing occupancy risk if that sector would shed jobs, though we have not witnessed any material shedding. Population, tourism and job growth continues in New York City, with industry profiles more diversified and less reliant on any one sector than ever before.
The first quarter numbers coming out of the Bureau of Labor Statistics were surprisingly strong for the first quarter, as New York City added net new 38,000 private sector jobs, 11,000 of which were in the office-using sectors of business services, fire, the fire sector and information, and that's just in the first 3 months. Obviously, if that pace continues into the second quarter, the city would have to revisit 2016 forecast for private-sector jobs creation, which was reduced by then to a still healthy total of 50,000 net new jobs earlier in the year, when they revised that number. But as I said earlier, almost all of that job creation has been experienced in just these 3 months. 
While the city estimate is lower than the record-setting growth rates over the last 5 years, millions of square feet of positive office space absorption are still expected and we have come out of the gate strong in 2016, with 850,000 [ph] square feet of Manhattan office leases signed in the first quarter alone at a remarkable 39% cash rent mark-to-market.
Furthermore, in the first  21 days of April, just 3 weeks, we have leased an additional 72,000 square feet of Manhattan office space and the near-term leasing pipeline is similarly growing with 1.3 million square feet of Manhattan leases in active leasing negotiations, out for signature or advanced stages of term sheets. 
We are also very pleased to see that asset values in New York continue to hold up from their record levels in 2015, and demand from both domestic and international equity investors and commercial lenders remain strong as evidenced by recent activity which exceeds $6 billion so far, notwithstanding the market pause that we saw in January and February. Investors will be more discerning this year and certain asset classes, like residential condominium projects, hotel and land, will see values fall as investors concentrate on well located, income-producing assets with embedded growth opportunity, the kind of assets that dominate SL Green's portfolio. 
Noncore, or transitional office assets, may see some downward pricing pressure. But as money continues to flow, the quality Manhattan commercial assets, it is likely that their values will remain relatively steadfast. 
From an overall investment capital perspective, we are seeing a continued flow of money from foreign investors, sectors that we highlighted over the past few months and on the last call, Japan, China, Korea, Germany, Canadian money and still money coming from the Middle East. These are investors and nations that regard New York as the safest and most attractive place to invest and diversify their holdings. 
A number of overnight reports may reference to our Q1 results being evidenced as solid New York City market, and certainly that is a major contributing factor. But the much bigger story, in my opinion, is the way in which we have positioned SL Green to be a dominant force with this market and sector, and to drive earnings and increases in shareholder equity while running an aggressive investment-grade portfolio and investment-grade balance sheet that represents less than 40% loan-to-value on a consolidated basis.
We have strategically fortified our company by upgrading and diversifying our portfolio through selective acquisitions and dispositions, expanding business lines but within our market, and by operating the portfolio with a focus on long-term leases, high occupancy levels, low annual lease role and high credit quality tenants. 
Despite our many successes, one significant frustration that we share with all of our investors is the stock price that does not merely reflect those accomplishments, does not correspond to the current value of our underlying assets and undervalues the substantial additional growth embedded in our portfolio. For our shareholders, we will work relentlessly to eliminate value, continue our earnings progression, invest opportunistically, manage our liabilities and build substantial liquidity.
I want to thank you, and we'll open it up for questions."

They were looking at what the effect of the minimum, $15 minimum wage was going to have on jobs in the city. And I think that you have to remember, at 50,000 jobs, it's still by most accounts an extraordinary high number. So I don't think they were looking at it as being conservative or fearful or concerned. I think that was maybe misinterpreted on this call 3 months ago, that a 50,000 job creation number in 5 [ph] sector is somehow a number that has a negative connotation to it. Just to the contrary, it's a strong number. Now will the city exceed that? Clearly if it stays on the path it's on, it will not just exceed it, it will blow it away. But these things have a seasonality into it. And you have to think more than 3 months past to see exactly where things level off. But clearly, sitting here through what hopefully will be worst part of the market for us, I haven't seen that kind of robustness not only in the jobs numbers, but in the leasing statistics, gives us much better confidence as we sit here today."

say to you that this is going to be the premier project, probably in the city, maybe the world, when this is completed. That's how we feel about this project. And that's the kind of feedback we've gotten from every single player we have presented this to. Now in terms of the financing, the financing is going exceedingly well. We still are on track for what we hope will be a closing and completion by the end of the summer, which is what we said on the last call. And then following that, we will focus in on equity capitalizations from JV partners, understanding that we get calls daily on this. We have a queue of potential interested investors that's not measured in the dozens, its measured in the 50 to 100. And it's a matter of us being very deliberate about -- going about this very long-term project to make sure we get it exactly right. And the first order of business is the financing and completion of the demolition, and the beginning of excavation, which starts this summer, the finalization of our marketing materials, which are spectacular, and which many of our investors will get to see in December. And then getting out on the road and finding the right equity investor for us, we're committed to finding a partner for this project. I am confident we will have more than one party to choose from at the end of the day. And we'll be basically just bidding terms for who we think brings the most to the table beyond just capital at the end of the day. So with that, let me turn over to Steve on the leasing side. What's your update there?"

Notwithstanding that we've present this building to significant size tenants. If not once a week, sometimes as many as 2x to 3x a week.

I guess, to the extent the market for sale is still there, but our outlook is worse than other investors, then you would continue to sell. I mean, that would be the natural inclination. If everyone is on the same issue, then it becomes harder to sell, so your sales volumes may take a pause until the market gets better. So we typically look at things -- when a property is ready for sale, when you feel it's matured to a level that it's right to be harvested, it doesn't have any further strategic value for us or the ability to drive NOI over a 5- to 10-year period is below the average trend line for the portfolio, we will be much more readily desirous of either selling or JV-ing that asset and we do that constantly.

Sometimes the market isn't there. But right now, it's excellent. There's a lot of demand for New York City assets.

We show it in the December investor, what the implied NAV looks like in market cap rates. You folks on the sell side have your own NAVs which average about $135 per share through your models. And many of our investors are at that level or higher. So I think that we continue to illuminate that value through sales and we'll do that. Often, I think we've shown an extraordinary ability to one, recycle that capital into very profitable undertakings; and two, at this point in time, the recycling is less necessary because we have so much extraordinary embedded growth in the remainder of the growth portfolio in our retail portfolio, and just to mark-to-market of our stabilized office portfolio. You don't need to do a lot of investing in your marking to market on a cash rent basis well into the double digits and you're leasing up retail assets, like we did with Armani, like we did with McDonalds, like we did with Nordstroms, at rents that are in the x percent higher, multiples higher, 2x 3x, 4x what the expiry rent was.

So I sort of think that there was a lot of uncertainty in the market, that people hadn't thought in the future help.

There is, I think, 1 space remaining about half the floor if I'm correct, that we have significant activity on. And I would hope that in the next -- in the near-term we would go on lease on that vacant space, at which point the building will be basically fully leased at rents that average like $70 a foot in the market that's north of $90 a foot. So it's worked out excellent. It's got long-term debt in place. We will talk to investors. That was something we had talked about setting up JV for future years, stabilization of that, meaning full rent paying is still about, I would say, plus or minus 18 to 24 months off. So I think the maximum execution for something like that could be end of this year, maybe next year. In that regard, it's not part of our guidance, but it's there as a storehouse of cash and liquidities we can monetize in the future to use either for debt repayment or new acquisitions in the future. And by doing so there's little to no tax gain the way we structured by selling that JV interest. So that is one of those sort of well-structured deals and a deal that will be a little bit more opportunistic in our timing for generating those funds and redeploying those funds or for paying down debt."

So let's just clarify one thing upfront on the acquisition targets, which we said on the last call. And said in December Investor and I will say it again now. Those goals that were originally set forth as they always are when we put those goals forth, are gross targets. So it doesn't account for deals we do in joint venture. So I can give you an example. There is a residential asset that we're looking at in pipeline. Very good off market kind of situation, where we might be anywhere between roughly a third to half the asset if that thing turns out, I know if it will or won't. That will be a gross value even though A, our share of it would be far less; and B, joint ventures tend to have secured debts. So the equity component of a JV of an asset tends to be quite small. So when people hear, $1 billion, $1.5 billion of investment activity take equity, and that's the wrong way to think. The equity component of that $1 billion, $1.5 billion is far, far less. That's a B. I would say 4 months into the year, the office goal is probably something we'll reassess in the year, possibly downward, because we certainly don't have a pipeline now that comes anywhere close to that number. But the way these things go, the assets in New York are big. A deal can pop up in the second half of the year, towards the end of the year, that might be of a size to make some kind of dent in that goal. But right now, our focus has really been on the things we talked about, which is consummation of the Citi deal that's done. Certain sales and JVs that we -- are out there in the market that we made good progress with today and continue to work with that through the balance of the year. There is a pipeline of some retail resi and in office asset that could or come not come together between now at the end of the year. If we do, there are deals that we think are going to be highly accretive to value in earnings in the future. Or else in the market like this, we would be more discerning as our other investors. So we're only looking for deals that we think have high value add for somebody like us in this market. But I would say, the office component is probably something that could come in less than originally budgeted. The retail, too early to say. It's only April. It wouldn't make too much sense there. Because the number for retail I think was $500 [ph] million in total. So $500 [ph] million in total, if the 50 [ph] JV its $250 million [ph], but if it's levered at $100-and-some-odd million of investment. We could do that like in December. I couldn't sit here in April and predict it, but I can't say there's nothing near-term in pipeline that would have us reaching those goals any time in the next quarter."

It's really just subject to a couple of outstanding approvals. But that would take care of the lion's share of the Omnicom space, which is over 300,000 square feet. I think the second thing to note about that is that -- and it's a good segue into the following fact which is of that 300,000 square feet, that will knock off a big chunk of our 2017 lease expirations, of which we already signed almost 460,000 square feet of leases for 2017, and have another 500,000 square feet including this deal we talked about in active negotiations.

There's no  I don't see any pressure to do something, and I think what you would call of a large size, unless something extraordinary made sense.

Debt-to-EBITDA, I think is not the best model to use. I know you guys use it and that's the one you like. But there is also a notion of equity or embedded equity, which is more of a loan-to-value concept. And I think because New York is a very liquid market, with anywhere between $40 billion to $70 billion year of transactions, you can get a pretty good handle on the NAV. I know you guys carry pretty high NAV for the company relative to where our stock price is.

The sun is shining and the stock is up, and we're glad you've joined us for our first quarter earnings call. Andrew Mathias is back in the saddle and with us today after his surgery, and we look forward to answering all of your questions, but first, a few comments on the quarter and the outlook for New York city market. Our Q1 results, by any measure were outstanding and indicative of a company that is firing on all cylinders. By my count, we have done over 70 of these earnings calls since IPO, and there were none that I can remember where the earnings results were so complete and so satisfying. 
On this past December 7, we set out for ourselves a host of intentionally challenging and specific goals and objectives with the hope and expectation of meeting all of them in 2016. On January 27 of this year, against global market headwinds, we reaffirmed our guidance, evidencing the confidence we have in our company, ourselves, our market to continuously deliver superior results on both an absolute and relative basis. This is because our discerning approach to investing in assets with significant growth opportunity and the constant recycling of our portfolio enables us to generate market-leading earnings growth, while also assembling the highest quality property portfolio in New York City.
These activities have resulted in our steadily increasing funds from operations from just $1.70 per share in our first year of being listed on the stock exchange to a normalized amount of approximately $7 per share estimated for 2016, a rate of growth that is unsurpassed in our industry sector.
Overall, New York City remains extremely solid, notwithstanding the dislocations we saw in the financial sector in December, January and the first half of February, volatility that has since leveled off. New York is often perceived to be heavily dependent upon the financial services sector for jobs and office-based demand. The reality, however, is that New York is, by far, the most compelling, diversified and resilient commercial property market in the country, possibly the world, and continues to attract businesses and investment capital, notwithstanding where we are at any one point in time in the market cycle.
Further, New York City's dependence on the financial services industry has been reduced, as other industry segments have proliferated, such as media, technology, education and health care. In fact, the financial services industry's contribution to incremental leasing absorption has fallen in recent years from 34% of square footage leased to 24% of square footage leased over the last 5 years, thereby, reducing occupancy risk if that sector were to shed jobs, though we have not witnessed any material shedding. Population, tourism and job growth continue in New York City, with industry profiles more diversified and less reliant on any one sector than ever before.
The first quarter numbers coming out of the Bureau of Labor Statistics were surprisingly strong for the first quarter, as New York City added net new 38,000 private sector jobs, 11,000 of which were in the office using sectors of business services, fire, the fire sector and information, and that's just in the first 3 months. Obviously, if that pace continues into the second quarter, the city would have to revisit its 2016 forecast for private-sector job creation, which was reduced by then to a still healthy total of 50,000 net new jobs earlier in the year when they revised that number. But as I said earlier, almost all of that job creation has been experienced in just these 3 months. 
While the city estimate is lower than the record-setting growth rates over the last 5 years, millions of square feet of positive office space absorption are still expected, and we have come out of the gate strong in 2016 with 850,000 square feet of Manhattan office leases signed in the first quarter alone at a remarkable 39% cash rent mark-to-market. Furthermore, in the first 21 days of April, just 3 weeks, we have leased an additional 72,000 square feet of Manhattan office space, and the near-term leasing pipeline is similarly growing with 1.3 million square feet of Manhattan leases in active leasing negotiations out for signature or advanced stages of term sheets. 
We are also very pleased to see that asset values in New York continue to hold up from their record levels in 2015, and demand from both domestic and international equity investors and commercial lenders remain strong, as evidenced by recent activity, which exceeds $6 billion so far, notwithstanding the market pause that we saw in January and February. Investors will be more discerning this year and certain asset classes, like residential condominium projects, hotel and land, will see values fall as investors concentrate on well located, income-producing assets with embedded growth opportunity, the kind of assets that dominate SL Green's portfolio. Non-core or transitional office assets may see some downward pricing pressure, but as money continues to flow to quality Manhattan commercial assets, it is likely that their values will remain relatively steadfast. 
From an overall investment capital perspective, we are seeing a continued flow of money from foreign investors, sectors that we had highlighted over the past few months and on the last call, Japan, China, Korea, Germany, Canadian money and still money coming from Middle East. These are investors and nations that regard New York as the safest and most attractive place to invest and diversify their holdings. A number of overnight reports may reference to our Q1 results being evidenced as a solid New York City market, and certainly, that is a major contributing factor. But the much bigger story, in my opinion, is the way in which we have positioned SL Green to be a dominant force with this market and sector and to drive earnings and increases in shareholder equity, while running an investment-grade portfolio and investment-grade balance sheet that represents less than 40% loan-to-value on a consolidated basis. We have strategically fortified our company by upgrading and diversifying our portfolio through selective acquisitions and dispositions, expanding business lines, but within our market, and by operating the portfolio with a focus on long-term leases, high occupancy levels, low annual lease role and high credit quality tenants. 
Despite our many successes, one significant frustration that we share with all of our investors is a stock price that does not merely reflect those accomplishments, does not correspond to the current value of our underlying assets and undervalues the substantial additional growth embedded in our portfolio. For our shareholders, we will work relentlessly to illuminate value, continue our earnings progression, invest opportunistically, manage our liabilities and build substantial liquidity.
I want to thank you, and we'll open it up for questions."

So we'll see how it plays out, the year's only 3 months over. But I think they were looking at downward estimates of GDP. They were looking at what the effect of the minimum, $15 minimum wage was going to have on jobs in the city. And I think that they -- you have to remember, at 50,000 jobs, it's still by most accounts an extraordinary high number. So I don't think they were looking at it as being conservative or fearful or concerned. I think that was maybe misinterpreted on this call 3 months ago, that a 50,000 job creation number in the private sector is somehow a number that has a negative connotation to it. To the contrary, it's a strong number. Now will the city exceed that? Clearly, if it stays on the path it's on, it will not just exceed it, it will blow it away. But these things have a seasonality fostered to it. And you have to, I think, let more than 3 months past to see exactly where things level off, but clearly, sitting here through what hopefully was -- will be the worst part of the market for us, I haven't seen that kind of robustness, not only evidence from the jobs numbers, but in the leasing statistics, gives us much better confidence as we sit here today."

say to you that this is going to be the premier project, probably in the city, maybe the world, when this is completed. That's how we feel about this project. And that's the kind of feedback we've gotten from every single player we have presented this to. Now in terms of the financing, the financing is going exceedingly well. We still are on track for what we hope will be a closing and completion by the end of the summer, which is what we said on the last call. And then following that, we will focus in on equity capitalizations from JV partners, understanding that we get calls daily on this. We have a queue of potential interested investors that's not measured in the dozens. It's measured in the 50 to 100, and it's a matter of us being very deliberate about -- going about this very long-term project to make sure we get it exactly right. And the first order of business is the financing and completion of the demolition, and the beginning of excavation, which starts this summer, the finalization of our marketing materials, which are spectacular, and which many of our investors will get to see in December. And then getting out on the road and finding the right equity investor for us, we're committed to finding a partner for this project. I am confident we will have more than one party to choose from at the end of the day, and we'll be basically just bidding terms for who we think brings the most to the table beyond just capital at the end of the day. So with that, let me turn over to Steve on the leasing side. What do you -- what's your update there?"

Our single greatest challenge, quite frankly, is that we're 5 years out as far as being able to deliver. So that's very early in the time line for tenants to be able to make decisions. Notwithstanding that, we present this building to significant sized tenants. If not once a week, sometimes as many as 2x to 3x a week. The majority of those tenants are either financial service related-type businesses or very high end, international headquarters type companies, and I think that as -- time will tell. But we have 3 or 4 tenants that are doing active diligence on the building. And I feel personally very, very confident about where we stand in the lease up process."

I guess, to the extent the market for sale is still there, but our outlook is worse than other investors, then you would continue to sell. I mean, that would be the natural inclination. If everyone is on the same issue, then it becomes harder to sell, so your sales volumes may take a pause until the market gets better. So we typically look at things -- when a property is ready for sale, when you feel it's matured to a level that it's right to be harvested, it doesn't have any further strategic value for us or the ability to drive NOI over a 5- to 10-year period is below the average trend line for the portfolio, we will be much more readily desirous of either selling or JV-ing that asset and we do that constantly. I mean, we do it annually and we do it in size. So I think if -- we'll continue to do that, I guess the answer to your question will be we'll continue to do it, provided the market is there to do it. Sometimes, the market isn't there, but right now, it's excellent. There's a lot of demand for New York City assets. I'd say as much demand as there was last year, the demand has just shifted, as I said in my remarks. I think it's a little more discerning. I think it's really focused in highly on quality and income-producing assets. It's in our sweet spot, so we're actively pursuing sale and JV opportunities."

We show it in the December investor, what the implied NAV looks like at market cap rates. You folks on the sell side have your own NAVs, which average about $135 per share through your models, and many of our investors are at that level and higher. So I think that we continue to illuminate that value through sales and we'll do that. Often, I think we've shown an extraordinary ability to, one, recycle that capital into very profitable undertakings; and two, at this point in time, the recycling is less necessary because we have so much extraordinary embedded growth in the remainder of the growth portfolio in our retail portfolio, and just through mark-to-market of our stabilized office portfolio. You don't need to do a lot of investing if you're marking to market on a cash rent basis well into the double digits and you're leasing up retail assets, like we did with Armani, like we did with McDonald's, like we did with Nordstrom's at rents that are in x percent higher. They're multiples higher, 2x 3x, 4x what the expiry rent was. So we have that kind of embedded earnings velocity that will carry us through '16 and '17 and beyond without incremental investment, but obviously, we are -- we do look for incremental investments from time to time."

Three, the feedback that we get from our tenants and prospective tenants as to how they view the health of their business and the hiring prospects, and therefore, the rents -- the space demands, have really not moderated at all over the past year, even as we sit here today, which would explain why even in the face of doing 800,000 square feet, we've been able to then replenish the pipeline. So I sort of think that there was a lot of uncertainty in the market, that people hadn't thought will in the future help, but the reality is our tenants are still feeling very strong about where their business is, how it's performing, where they're hiring is, and therefore, how much space they need."

And Tower 46, which is sidestreet, great quality product but sidestreet location, although we haven't cited a lot of deals there yet, we have a tremendous amount of prospective tenants coming through and are trading term sheets with a number of very significant tenants at big rents in the $90 to $100 price point.

The Sony work is done and the tenant has moved in. As I mentioned earlier, Crédit Suisse exercised its renewals for the 2 floors that we could've gotten back, won't be getting back, that represented a very substantial mark-to-market. There is, I think, one space remaining, about half the floor, if I'm correct, that we had significant activity on. And I would hope in the next -- in the near term, we'll go to lease on that vacant space, at which point the building will be basically fully leased at rents that average like $70 a foot in a market that's north of $90 a foot. So it's worked out excellent. It's got long-term debt in place. We will talk to investors. That was something we had talked about setting up as a JV for future years, stabilization of that, meaning full rent paying is still about, I would say, plus or minus 18 to 24 months off. So I think the maximum execution for something like that could be end of this year, maybe next year. In that regard, it's not part of our guidance, but it's there as a storehouse of cash and liquidities we can monetize in the future to use either for debt repayment or new acquisitions in the future. And by doing so, there's little to no tax gain the way we structure it by selling that JV interest. So that is one of those sort of well-structured deals and a deal that will be a little bit more opportunistic in our timing for generating those funds and redeploying those funds or for paying down debt."

Okay, so let's just clarify one thing upfront on the acquisition targets, which we said on the last call and said in December investor and am going to say it again now.

Okay, so let's just clarify one thing upfront on the acquisition targets, which we said on the last call and said in December investor and am going to say it again now. Those goals that were originally set forth as they always are when we put those goals forth, are gross targets. So it doesn't account for deals we do in joint venture. So I can give you an example. There is a residential asset that we're looking at in pipeline, very good off market kind of situation, where we might be anywhere between, call it, roughly 1/3 to half the asset, if that thing turns out. I'm not -- I don't know if it will or won't. That would be a gross value even though, a, our share of it would be far less; and b, joint ventures tend to have secured debts. So the equity component of a JV of an asset tends to be quite small. So when people hear $1 billion, $1.5 billion of investment activity, they think equity, and that's the wrong way to think. The equity component of that $1 billion, $1.5 billion is far, far less. That's a -- b. I would say 4 months into the year, the office goal is probably something we'll reassess mid year, possibly downward, because we certainly don't have a pipeline now that comes anywhere close to that number. But the way these things go, the assets in New York are big. A deal could pop up second half of the year or towards the end of the year, that might be of a size to make some kind of dent in that goal. But it's not -- right now, our focus has really been on the things we've talked about, which is consummation of the Citi deal, that's done; certain sales and JVs that we -- are out there in the market with and have made good progress with to date and we'll continue to work on that through the balance of the year. There is a pipeline of some retail/resi and an office asset that could or could not come together between now and the end of the year. If we do, they will be deals that we think are going to be highly accretive to value and earnings in the future. Or else in a market like this, we wouldn't -- we would be more discerning, as are other investors. So we're only looking for deals that we think have high value add for somebody like us in this market. But I would say, the office component is probably something that could come in less than originally budgeted. The retail, too early to say. It's only April. It wouldn't even make any assessments there. Because the number for resi/retail, I think was $500 million in total. So $500 million in total, if it's a 50 [ph] JV, its $250 million. If it's levered, it's $100-and-some-odd million of investment. We could do that like in December. I couldn't sit here in April and predict it, but I can say there's nothing near term in pipeline that would have us reaching those goals any time in the next quarter."

So it's not a sale of a condominium in perpetuity. It's a leasehold condominium, which has a finite life to it of 30 years. And that transaction is expected to close in the next several months. It's really just subject to a couple of outstanding approvals. But that will take care of the lion's share of the Omnicom space, which is over 300,000 square feet. I think the second thing to note about that is that -- and it's a good segue into the following fact, which is of that 300,000 square feet, that will knock off a big chunk of our 2017 lease expirations, of which we've already signed almost 460,000 square feet of leases for 2017 and have another 500,000 square feet, including this deal that we talked about in active negotiations.

Those suburban markets are highly impaired generally in the Tri-State area, with 20% plus vacancy rates; and our occupancy levels, far better than that; and our average rent levels far better than that. So I think it's better for us as a company to take those assets sort of one by one and optimize and sell. There's no pressure. There's no -- I don't see any pressure to do something of -- I think what you'd call of a large size, unless something made extraordinary sense. But we like having that portfolio there to create longer-term value with and continue to monetize and harvest as time goes on. I think we've done an excellent job of stewardship on that portfolio, and have the guys up White Plains. And I think we're reaping the rewards for that now on some of these sales, which had been occurring in '15 and '16."

I think it will allow us to reduce that further, although I would say, when you get into that 7%, 7.5% range, we view the portfolio as pretty much completely derisked and delevered, especially given the cap rate environment we operate at, which is typically between 3.5% and 4% cap rate environment. Debt-to-EBITDA, I think is not the best model to use. I know you guys use it and that's the one you like. But there is also a notion of equity or embedded equity, which is more of a loan-to-value concept. And I think because New York is a very liquid market, with anywhere between $40 billion to $70 billion year of transactions, you can get a pretty good handle on the NAV. I know you guys carry a pretty high NAV for the company relative to where our stock price is. And if you look at the debt on a debt to, I'll call it, your NAV as opposed to debt-to-EBITDA, I think we would be sort of right in the middle or possibly even below peer average."

It's an absolutely glorious day here in New York City. The sun is shining and the stock is up, and we're glad you've joined us for our first quarter earnings call. Andrew Mathias is back in the saddle and with us today after his surgery, and we",1131,"Thank you. It's an absolutely glorious day here in New York City. The sun is shining and the stock is up, and we're glad you've joined us for our first quarter earnings call. Andrew Mathias is back in the saddle and with us today after his surgery, and we look forward to answering all of your questions, but first, a few comments on the quarter and the outlook for New York city market. Our Q1 results, by any measure were outstanding and indicative of a company that is firing on all cylinders. By my count, we have done over 70 of these earnings calls since IPO, and there were none that I can remember where the earnings results were so complete and so satisfying. 
On this past December 7, we set out for ourselves a host of intentionally challenging and specific goals and objectives with the hope and expectation of meeting all of them in 2016. On January 27 of this year, against global market headwinds, we reaffirmed our guidance, evidencing the confidence we have in our company, ourselves, our market to continuously deliver superior results on both an absolute and relative basis. This is because our discerning approach to investing in assets with significant growth opportunity and the constant recycling of our portfolio enables us to generate market-leading earnings growth, while also assembling the highest quality property portfolio in New York City.
These activities have resulted in our steadily increasing funds from operations from just $1.70 per share in our first year of being listed on the stock exchange to a normalized amount of approximately $7 per share estimated for 2016, a rate of growth that is unsurpassed in our industry sector.
Overall, New York City remains extremely solid, notwithstanding the dislocations we saw in the financial sector in December, January and the first half of February, volatility that has since leveled off. New York is often perceived to be heavily dependent upon the financial services sector for jobs and office-based demand. The reality, however, is that New York is, by far, the most compelling, diversified and resilient commercial property market in the country, possibly the world, and continues to attract businesses and investment capital, notwithstanding where we are at any one point in time in the market cycle.
Further, New York City's dependence on the financial services industry has been reduced, as other industry segments have proliferated, such as media, technology, education and health care. In fact, the financial services industry's contribution to incremental leasing absorption has fallen in recent years from 34% of square footage leased to 24% of square footage leased over the last 5 years, thereby, reducing occupancy risk if that sector were to shed jobs, though we have not witnessed any material shedding. Population, tourism and job growth continue in New York City, with industry profiles more diversified and less reliant on any one sector than ever before.
The first quarter numbers coming out of the Bureau of Labor Statistics were surprisingly strong for the first quarter, as New York City added net new 38,000 private sector jobs, 11,000 of which were in the office using sectors of business services, fire, the fire sector and information, and that's just in the first 3 months. Obviously, if that pace continues into the second quarter, the city would have to revisit its 2016 forecast for private-sector job creation, which was reduced by then to a still healthy total of 50,000 net new jobs earlier in the year when they revised that number. But as I said earlier, almost all of that job creation has been experienced in just these 3 months. 
While the city estimate is lower than the record-setting growth rates over the last 5 years, millions of square feet of positive office space absorption are still expected, and we have come out of the gate strong in 2016 with 850,000 square feet of Manhattan office leases signed in the first quarter alone at a remarkable 39% cash rent mark-to-market. Furthermore, in the first 21 days of April, just 3 weeks, we have leased an additional 72,000 square feet of Manhattan office space, and the near-term leasing pipeline is similarly growing with 1.3 million square feet of Manhattan leases in active leasing negotiations out for signature or advanced stages of term sheets. 
We are also very pleased to see that asset values in New York continue to hold up from their record levels in 2015, and demand from both domestic and international equity investors and commercial lenders remain strong, as evidenced by recent activity, which exceeds $6 billion so far, notwithstanding the market pause that we saw in January and February. Investors will be more discerning this year and certain asset classes, like residential condominium projects, hotel and land, will see values fall as investors concentrate on well located, income-producing assets with embedded growth opportunity, the kind of assets that dominate SL Green's portfolio. Non-core or transitional office assets may see some downward pricing pressure, but as money continues to flow to quality Manhattan commercial assets, it is likely that their values will remain relatively steadfast. 
From an overall investment capital perspective, we are seeing a continued flow of money from foreign investors, sectors that we had highlighted over the past few months and on the last call, Japan, China, Korea, Germany, Canadian money and still money coming from Middle East. These are investors and nations that regard New York as the safest and most attractive place to invest and diversify their holdings. A number of overnight reports made reference to our Q1 results being evidence of a solid New York City market, and certainly, that is a major contributing factor. But the much bigger story, in my opinion, is the way in which we have positioned SL Green to be a dominant force with this market and sector and to drive earnings and increases in shareholder equity, while running an investment-grade portfolio and investment-grade balance sheet that represents less than 40% loan-to-value on a consolidated basis. We have strategically fortified our company by upgrading and diversifying our portfolio through selective acquisitions and dispositions, expanding business lines, but within our market, and by operating the portfolio with a focus on long-term leases, high occupancy levels, low annual lease role and high credit quality tenants. 
Despite our many successes, one significant frustration that we share with all of our investors is a stock price that does not merely reflect those accomplishments, does not correspond to the current value of our underlying assets and undervalues the substantial additional growth embedded in our portfolio. For our shareholders, we will work relentlessly to illuminate value, continue our earnings progression, invest opportunistically, manage our liabilities and build substantial liquidity.
I want to thank you, and we'll open it up for questions."

So we'll see how it plays out, the year's only 3 months over. But I think they were looking at downward estimates of GDP. They were looking at what the effect of the minimum, $15 minimum wage was going to have on jobs in the city. And I think that they -- you have to remember, at 50,000 jobs, it's still by most accounts an extraordinary -- extraordinarily high number. So I don't think they were looking at it as being conservative or fearful or concerned. I think that was maybe misinterpreted on this call 3 months ago, that a 50,000 job creation number in the private sector is somehow a number that has a negative connotation to it. To the contrary, it's a strong number. Now will the city exceed that? Clearly, if it stays on the path it's on, it will not just exceed it, it will blow it away. But these things have a seasonality fostered to it. And you have to, I think, let more than 3 months past to see exactly where things level off, but clearly, sitting here through what hopefully was -- will be the worst part of the market for us, I haven't seen that kind of robustness, not only evidence from the jobs numbers, but in the leasing statistics, gives us much better confidence as we sit here today."

say to you that this is going to be the premier project, probably in the city, maybe the world, when this is completed. That's how we feel about this project. And that's the kind of feedback we've gotten from every single player we have presented this to. Now in terms of the financing, the financing is going exceedingly well. We still are on track for what we hope will be a closing and completion by the end of the summer, which is what we said on the last call. And then following that, we will focus in on equity capitalizations from JV partners, understanding that we get calls daily on this. We have a queue of potential interested investors that's not measured in the dozens. It's measured in the 50 to 100, and it's a matter of us being very deliberate about -- going about this very long-term project to make sure we get it exactly right. And the first order of business is the financing and completion of the demolition, and the beginning of excavation, which starts this summer, the finalization of our marketing materials, which are spectacular, and which many of our investors will get to see in December. And then getting out on the road and finding the right equity investor for us, we're committed to finding a partner for this project. I am confident we will have more than one party to choose from at the end of the day, and we'll be basically just bidding terms for who we think brings the most to the table beyond just capital at the end of the day. So with that, let me turn over to Steve on the leasing side. What do you -- what's your update there?"

Notwithstanding that, we present this building to significant sized tenants. If not once a week, sometimes as many as 2x to 3x a week. The majority of those tenants are either financial service related-type businesses or very high end, international headquarters type companies, and I think that as -- time will tell. But we have 3 or 4 tenants that are doing active diligence on the building. And I feel personally very, very confident about where we stand in the lease up process."

I guess, to the extent the market for sale is still there, but our outlook is worse than other investors, then you would continue to sell. I mean, that would be the natural inclination. If everyone is on the same issue, then it becomes harder to sell, so your sales volumes may take a pause until the market gets better. So we typically look at things -- when a property is ready for sale, when you feel it's matured to a level that it's ripe to be harvested, it doesn't have any further strategic value for us or the ability to drive NOI over a 5- to 10-year period is below the average trend line for the portfolio, we will be much more readily desirous of either selling or JV-ing that asset and we do that constantly. I mean, we do it annually and we do it in size. So I think if -- we'll continue to do that, I guess the answer to your question will be we'll continue to do it, provided the market is there to do it. Sometimes, the market isn't there, but right now, it's excellent. There's a lot of demand for New York City assets. I'd say as much demand as there was last year, the demand has just shifted, as I said in my remarks. I think it's a little more discerning.

We show it in the December investor, what the implied NAV looks like at market cap rates. You folks on the sell side have your own NAVs, which average about $135 per share through your models, and many of our investors are at that level and higher. So I think that we continue to illuminate that value through sales and we'll do that. Often, I think we've shown an extraordinary ability to: one, recycle that capital into very profitable undertakings; and two, at this point in time, the recycling is less necessary because we have so much extraordinary embedded growth in the remainder of the growth portfolio in our retail portfolio, and just through mark-to-market of our stabilized office portfolio. You don't need to do a lot of investing if you're marking to market on a cash rent basis well into the double digits and you're leasing up retail assets, like we did with Armani, like we did with McDonald's, like we did with Nordstrom's at rents that are in x percent higher. They're multiples higher, 2x 3x, 4x what the expiry rent was.

And Tower 46, which is sidestreet, great quality product but sidestreet location, although we haven't cited a lot of deals there yet, we have a tremendous amount of prospective tenants coming through and are trading term sheets with a number of very significant tenants at big rents in the $90 to $100 price point.

The Sony work is done and the tenant has moved in. As I mentioned earlier, Crédit Suisse exercised its renewals for the 2 floors that we could've gotten back, won't be getting back, that represented a very substantial mark-to-market. There is, I think, one space remaining, about half the floor, if I'm correct, that we had significant activity on. And I would hope in the next -- in the near term, we'll go to lease on that vacant space, at which point the building will be basically fully leased at rents that average like $70 a foot in a market that's north of $90 a foot. So it's worked out excellent. It's got long-term debt in place. We will talk to investors. That was something we had talked about setting up as a JV for future years, stabilization of that, meaning full rent paying is still about, I would say, plus or minus 18 to 24 months off. So I think the maximum execution for something like that could be end of this year, maybe next year. In that regard, it's not part of our guidance, but it's there as a storehouse of cash and liquidities we can monetize in the future to use either for debt repayment or new acquisitions in the future. And by doing so, there's little to no tax gain the way we structure it by selling that JV interest. So that is one of those sort of well-structured deals and a deal that will be a little bit more opportunistic in our timing for generating those funds and redeploying those funds or for paying down debt."

Okay, so let's just clarify one thing upfront on the acquisition targets, which we said on the last call and said in December investor and am going to say it again now. Those goals that were originally set forth as they always are when we put those goals forth, are gross targets. So it doesn't account for deals we do in joint venture. So I can give you an example. There is a residential asset that we're looking at in pipeline, very good off market kind of situation, where we might be anywhere between, call it, roughly 1/3 to half the asset, if that thing turns out. I'm not -- I don't know if it will or won't. That would be at a gross value even though, a, our share of it would be far less; and b, joint ventures tend to have secured debts. So the equity component of a JV of an asset tends to be quite small. So when people hear $1 billion, $1.5 billion of investment activity, they think equity, and that's the wrong way to think. The equity component of that $1 billion, $1.5 billion is far, far less. That's a -- b. I would say 4 months into the year, the office goal is probably something we'll reassess mid year, possibly downward, because we certainly don't have a pipeline now that comes anywhere close to that number. But the way these things go, the assets in New York are big. A deal could pop up second half of the year or towards the end of the year, that might be of a size to make some kind of dent in that goal. But it's not -- right now, our focus has really been on the things we've talked about, which is consummation of the Citi deal, that's done; certain sales and JVs that we -- are out there in the market with and have made good progress with to date and we'll continue to work on that through the balance of the year. There is a pipeline of some retail/resi and an office asset that could or could not come together between now and the end of the year. If we do, they will be deals that we think are going to be highly accretive to value and earnings in the future. Or else in a market like this, we wouldn't -- we would be more discerning, as are other investors. So we're only looking for deals that we think have high value add for somebody like us in this market. But I would say, the office component is probably something that could come in less than originally budgeted. The retail, too early to say. It's only April. It wouldn't even make any assessments there. Because the number for resi/retail, I think was $500 million in total. So $500 million in total, if it's a 50% JV, its $250 million, if it's levered. It's a 100-and-some-odd million dollar investment. We could do that like in December. I couldn't sit here in April and predict it, but I can say there's nothing near term in pipeline that would have us reaching those goals any time in the next quarter."

It's really just subject to a couple of outstanding approvals. But that will take care of the lion's share of the Omnicom space, which is over 300,000 square feet.

I think it will allow us to reduce that further, although I would say, when you get into that 7%, 7.5% range, we view the portfolio as pretty much completely derisked and delevered, especially given the cap rate environment we operate at, which is typically between 3.5% and 4% cap rate environment. Debt-to-EBITDA, I think is not the best model to use. I know you guys use it and that's the one you like. But there is also a notion of equity or embedded equity, which is more of a loan-to-value concept. And I think because New York is a very liquid market, with anywhere between $40 billion to $70 billion a year of transactions, you can get a pretty good handle on the NAV. I know you guys carry a pretty high NAV for the company relative to where our stock price is. And if you look at the debt on a debt to, I'll call it, your NAV as opposed to debt-to-EBITDA, I think we would be sort of right in the middle or possibly even below peer average."

The sun is shining and the stock is up, and we're glad you've joined us for our first quarter earnings call. Andrew Mathias is back in the saddle and with us today after his surgery, and we look forward to answering all of your questions, but first, a few comments on the quarter and the outlook for New York City market. Our Q1 results, by any measure were outstanding and indicative of a company that is firing on all cylinders. By my count, we have done over 70 of these earnings calls since IPO, and there were none that I can remember where the earnings results were so complete and so satisfying. 
On this past December 7, we set out for ourselves a host of intentionally challenging and specific goals and objectives with the hope and expectation of meeting all of them in 2016. On January 27 of this year, against global market headwinds, we reaffirmed our guidance, evidencing the confidence we have in our company, ourselves, our market to continuously deliver superior results on both an absolute and relative basis. This is because our discerning approach to investing in assets with significant growth opportunity and the constant recycling of our portfolio enables us to generate market-leading earnings growth, while also assembling the highest quality property portfolio in New York City.
These activities have resulted in our steadily increasing funds from operations from just $1.70 per share in our first year of being listed on the stock exchange to a normalized amount of approximately $7 per share estimated for 2016, a rate of growth that is unsurpassed in our industry sector.
Overall, New York City remains extremely solid, notwithstanding the dislocations we saw in the financial sector in December, January and the first half of February, volatility that has since leveled off. New York is often perceived to be heavily dependent upon the financial services sector for jobs and office-based demand. The reality, however, is that New York is, by far, the most compelling, diversified and resilient commercial property market in the country, possibly the world, and continues to attract businesses and investment capital, notwithstanding where we are at any one point in time in the market cycle.
Further, New York City's dependence on the financial services industry has been reduced, as other industry segments have proliferated, such as media, technology, education and health care. In fact, the financial services industry's contribution to incremental leasing absorption has fallen in recent years from 34% of square footage leased to 24% of square footage leased over the last 5 years, thereby, reducing occupancy risk if that sector were to shed jobs, though we have not witnessed any material shedding. Population, tourism and job growth continue in New York City, with industry profiles more diversified and less reliant on any one sector than ever before.
The first quarter numbers coming out of the Bureau of Labor Statistics were surprisingly strong for the first quarter, as New York City added net new 38,000 private sector jobs, 11,000 of which were in the office using sectors of business services, fire, the fire sector and information, and that's just in the first 3 months. Obviously, if that pace continues into the second quarter, the city would have to revisit its 2016 forecast for private-sector job creation, which was reduced by then to a still healthy total of 50,000 net new jobs earlier in the year when they revised that number. But as I said earlier, almost all of that job creation has been experienced in just these 3 months. 
While the city estimate is lower than the record-setting growth rates over the last 5 years, millions of square feet of positive office space absorption are still expected, and we have come out of the gate strong in 2016 with 850,000 square feet of Manhattan office leases signed in the first quarter alone at a remarkable 39% cash rent mark-to-market. Furthermore, in the first 21 days of April, just 3 weeks, we have leased an additional 72,000 square feet of Manhattan office space, and the near-term leasing pipeline is similarly growing with 1.3 million square feet of Manhattan leases in active leasing negotiations out for signature or advanced stages of term sheets. 
We are also very pleased to see that asset values in New York continue to hold up from their record levels in 2015, and demand from both domestic and international equity investors and commercial lenders remain strong, as evidenced by recent activity, which exceeds $6 billion so far, notwithstanding the market pause that we saw in January and February. Investors will be more discerning this year and certain asset classes, like residential condominium projects, hotel and land, will see values fall as investors concentrate on well located, income-producing assets with embedded growth opportunity, the kind of assets that dominate SL Green's portfolio. Non-core or transitional office assets may see some downward pricing pressure, but as money continues to flow to quality Manhattan commercial assets, it is likely that their values will remain relatively steadfast. 
From an overall investment capital perspective, we are seeing a continued flow of money from foreign investors, sectors that we had highlighted over the past few months and on the last call, Japan, China, Korea, Germany, Canadian money and still money coming from Middle East. These are investors and nations that regard New York as the safest and most attractive place to invest and diversify their holdings. A number of overnight reports made reference to our Q1 results being evidence of a solid New York City market, and certainly, that is a major contributing factor. But the much bigger story, in my opinion, is the way in which we have positioned SL Green to be a dominant force with this market and sector and to drive earnings and increases in shareholder equity, while running an investment-grade portfolio and investment-grade balance sheet that represents less than 40% loan-to-value on a consolidated basis. We have strategically fortified our company by upgrading and diversifying our portfolio through selective acquisitions and dispositions, expanding business lines, but within our market, and by operating the portfolio with a focus on long-term leases, high occupancy levels, low annual lease role and high credit quality tenants. 
Despite our many successes, one significant frustration that we share with all of our investors is a stock price that does not merely reflect those accomplishments, does not correspond to the current value of our underlying assets and undervalues the substantial additional growth embedded in our portfolio. For our shareholders, we will work relentlessly to illuminate value, continue our earnings progression, invest opportunistically, manage our liabilities and build substantial liquidity.
I want to thank you, and we'll open it up for questions."

So we'll see how it plays out, the year's only 3 months over. But I think they were looking at downward estimates of GDP. They were looking at what the effect of the minimum, $15 minimum wage was going to have on jobs in the city. And I think that they -- you have to remember, at 50,000 jobs, it's still by most accounts an extraordinary -- extraordinarily high number. So I don't think they were looking at it as being conservative or fearful or concerned. I think that was maybe misinterpreted on this call 3 months ago, that a 50,000 job creation number in the private sector is somehow a number that has a negative connotation to it. To the contrary, it's a strong number. Now will the city exceed that? Clearly, if it stays on the path it's on, it will not just exceed it, it will blow it away. But these things have a seasonality fostered to it. And you have to, I think, let more than 3 months past to see exactly where things level off, but clearly, sitting here through what hopefully was -- will be the worst part of the market for us, I haven't seen that kind of robustness, not only evidence from the jobs numbers, but in the leasing statistics, gives us much better confidence as we sit here today."

say to you that this is going to be the premier project, probably in the city, maybe the world, when this is completed. That's how we feel about this project. And that's the kind of feedback we've gotten from every single player we have presented this to. Now in terms of the financing, the financing is going exceedingly well. We still are on track for what we hope will be a closing and completion by the end of the summer, which is what we said on the last call. And then following that, we will focus in on equity capitalizations from JV partners, understanding that we get calls daily on this. We have a queue of potential interested investors that's not measured in the dozens. It's measured in the 50 to 100, and it's a matter of us being very deliberate about -- going about this very long-term project to make sure we get it exactly right. And the first order of business is the financing and completion of the demolition, and the beginning of excavation, which starts this summer, the finalization of our marketing materials, which are spectacular, and which many of our investors will get to see in December. And then getting out on the road and finding the right equity investor for us, we're committed to finding a partner for this project. I am confident we will have more than one party to choose from at the end of the day, and we'll be basically just bidding terms for who we think brings the most to the table beyond just capital at the end of the day. So with that, let me turn over to Steve on the leasing side. What do you -- what's your update there?"

We show it in the December investor, what the implied NAV looks like at market cap rates. You folks on the sell side have your own NAVs, which average about $135 per share through your models, and many of our investors are at that level and higher. So I think that we continue to illuminate that value through sales and we'll do that. Often, I think we've shown an extraordinary ability to: one, recycle that capital into very profitable undertakings; and two, at this point in time, the recycling is less necessary because we have so much extraordinary embedded growth in the remainder of the growth portfolio in our retail portfolio, and just through mark-to-market of our stabilized office portfolio. You don't need to do a lot of investing if you're marking to market on a cash rent basis well into the double digits and you're leasing up retail assets, like we did with Armani, like we did with McDonald's, like we did with Nordstrom's at rents that are in x percent higher. They're multiples higher, 2x 3x, 4x what the expiry rent was.

Three, the feedback that we get from our tenants and prospective tenants as to how they view the health of their business and the hiring prospects, and therefore, the rents -- the space demands, have really not moderated at all over the past year, even as we sit here today, which would explain why even in the face of doing 800,000 square feet, we've been able to then replenish the pipeline.

Yesterday alone, we converted 5 tenants over 2 leases out. So all of a sudden, that building, which is $80 to $90 to $100 kind of product, is like on fire. And Tower 46, which is sidestreet, great quality product but sidestreet location, although we haven't cited a lot of deals there yet, we have a tremendous amount of prospective tenants coming through and are trading term sheets with a number of very significant tenants at big rents in the $90 to $100 price point.

The Sony work is done and the tenant has moved in. As I mentioned earlier, Crédit Suisse exercised its renewals for the 2 floors that we could've gotten back, won't be getting back, that represented a very substantial mark-to-market. There is, I think, one space remaining, about half the floor, if I'm correct, that we had significant activity on. And I would hope in the next -- in the near term, we'll go to lease on that vacant space, at which point the building will be basically fully leased at rents that average like $70 a foot in a market that's north of $90 a foot. So it's worked out excellent. It's got long-term debt in place. We will talk to investors. That was something we had talked about setting up as a JV for future years, stabilization of that, meaning full rent paying is still about, I would say, plus or minus 18 to 24 months off. So I think the maximum execution for something like that could be end of this year, maybe next year. In that regard, it's not part of our guidance, but it's there as a storehouse of cash and liquidities we can monetize in the future to use either for debt repayment or new acquisitions in the future. And by doing so, there's little to no tax gain the way we structure it by selling that JV interest. So that is one of those sort of well-structured deals and a deal that will be a little bit more opportunistic in our timing for generating those funds and redeploying those funds or for paying down debt."

Okay, so let's just clarify one thing upfront on the acquisition targets, which we said on the last call and said in December investor and am going to say it again now. Those goals that were originally set forth as they always are when we put those goals forth, are gross targets. So it doesn't account for deals we do in joint venture. So I can give you an example. There is a residential asset that we're looking at in pipeline, very good off market kind of situation, where we might be anywhere between, call it, roughly 1/3 to half the asset, if that thing turns out. I'm not -- I don't know if it will or won't. That would be at a gross value even though, a, our share of it would be far less; and b, joint ventures tend to have secured debts. So the equity component of a JV of an asset tends to be quite small. So when people hear $1 billion, $1.5 billion of investment activity, they think equity, and that's the wrong way to think. The equity component of that $1 billion, $1.5 billion is far, far less. That's a -- b. I would say 4 months into the year, the office goal is probably something we'll reassess mid-year, possibly downward, because we certainly don't have a pipeline now that comes anywhere close to that number. But the way these things go, the assets in New York are big. A deal could pop up second half of the year or towards the end of the year, that might be of a size to make some kind of dent in that goal. But it's not -- right now, our focus has really been on the things we've talked about, which is consummation of the Citi deal, that's done; certain sales and JVs that we -- are out there in the market with and have made good progress with to date and we'll continue to work on that through the balance of the year. There is a pipeline of some retail/resi and an office asset that could or could not come together between now and the end of the year. If we do, they will be deals that we think are going to be highly accretive to value and earnings in the future. Or else in a market like this, we wouldn't -- we would be more discerning, as are other investors. So we're only looking for deals that we think have high value add for somebody like us in this market. But I would say, the office component is probably something that could come in less than originally budgeted. The retail, too early to say. It's only April. It wouldn't even make any assessments there. Because the number for resi/retail, I think was $500 million in total. So $500 million in total, if it's a 50% JV, its $250 million, if it's levered. It's a 100-and-some-odd million dollar investment. We could do that like in December. I couldn't sit here in April and predict it, but I can say there's nothing near term in pipeline that would have us reaching those goals any time in the next quarter."

I think it will allow us to reduce that further, although I would say, when you get into that 7%, 7.5% range, we view the portfolio as pretty much completely derisked and delevered, especially given the cap rate environment we operate at, which is typically between 3.5% and 4% cap rate environment. Debt-to-EBITDA, I think is not the best model to use. I know you guys use it and that's the one you like. But there is also a notion of equity or embedded equity, which is more of a loan-to-value concept. And I think because New York is a very liquid market, with anywhere between $40 billion to $70 billion a year of transactions, you can get a pretty good handle on the NAV. I know you guys carry a pretty high NAV for the company relative to where our stock price is. And if you look at the debt on a debt to, I'll call it, your NAV as opposed to debt-to-EBITDA, I think we would be sort of right in the middle or possibly even below peer average."

We're pleased that all of you joined us on this gorgeous day at New York City, and we're even happier that we were able to put out yet another quarter of strong operating results and market-leading capital transactions. Our seco",1690,"Okay. Thank you, operator. We're pleased that all of you joined us on this gorgeous day at New York City, and we're even happier that we were able to put out yet another quarter of strong operating results and market-leading capital transactions. Our second quarter results continue a trend in 2016 of surprising to [ph] the upside and leasing velocity and rental achievement. We executed another 620,000 square feet of Manhattan office leases, highlighted by the recently announced expansion of Bloomberg in 919 Third Avenue and the renewal and expansion of New York Life at Graybar Building. In fact, SL Green was responsible for 3 of the 8 largest leases transacted in the second quarter in Midtown, [ph] Bloomberg, New York Life and Wells Fargo at 100 Park Avenue. 
The mark-to-market on the second quarter Manhattan leases was a robust 16%, bringing first half 2016 average rental increases on replacement leases to 28%. And that's on about 1.5 million square feet of leasing during 6 months. I think it speaks for itself as an extraordinary accomplishment. 
Velocity continues even into the month of July, with another 84,000 square feet of leasing in office in Manhattan in just the past 3 weeks at an 18% mark-to-market inclusive of the recent Omnicom renewal at 220 East 42nd Street. 
In terms of forecasting these leasing trends for the remainder of the year, I would note that the best indicator of what those results are likely to trend towards would be our current leasing pipeline. That current pipeline stands today at about 1.6 million square feet, the vast majority of which is comprised of leases pending, 4 [ph] leases out for signature. And notably, the mark-to-market on all of those pipeline deals exceeds 20%. 
So fortunately for shareholders and unfortunately for Steve Durels and his leasing team, we must and are increasing our full year guidance for completed Manhattan office leases to 2.6 million square feet for the full year and mark-to-market on those leases, which are replacement leases, to 22% mark-to-market. So numbers that, in each case, are fairly significantly ahead of where we were in December. That sound you just heard was Steve hitting the floor. You can pick yourself up, Steve, and let's keep -- let's just put the best face on and go forward, okay? 
In this manner, we provide additional motivation and encouragement to our leasing and operations team to execute at the highest level that's consistent with this firm's culture of hard work and outperformance. 
These leasing results and our projection of second half performance is driven by continual demand for high-quality, well-located, reasonably priced office space, which descriptively is the sweet spot of our entire portfolio. 
Midtown space continues to be in high demand as the vacancy rate decreased 10 basis points to 9.2%, and sublease space in Midtown stands at only 2.9 million square feet, near historical lows over the past 8 or 9 years for sublease space. Very important barometer, we haven't talked about that on the last few conference calls, but we're talking about sublease space in Midtown that's about 1.1% of total inventory. So very, very [ph] well. 
Job creation in the financial security sector is roughly flat for the year. I think, contrary to market perspective that there has been some substantial contraction in this sector, it's actually, I think, going [ph] down about 1,000 jobs year-to-date, which on that job basis is essentially 0. But interestingly, the FIRE sector, finance, insurance real estate, is accounting for much of the first half leasing activity in Midtown and elsewhere. Health care is also making a reasonably good showing, but I would say financial services had an above-average showing in the first half of the year. 
That activity, and all that, [ph] whether it's the FIRE sector, health care or otherwise, is driven by jobs and job creation. Unfortunately, the June New York City job numbers are not out yet. They're going to be out imminently. We would have hoped to have had them for the call, but we don't. But if it's any indicator, the national numbers that came out from Bureau of Labor Statistics for June were quite strong relative to May and earlier. And we're hopeful that the New York City numbers will follow and inform the national numbers. In part, it's almost self-fulfilling because the end of the Verizon strike in and of itself will probably put back on the rolls [ph] of the city, I think, 3,000-plus jobs in June. So we're just hoping that and more growth on top of that, but we'll see shortly.
So that's a quick snapshot of the leasing picture. I'm sure you guys will have questions as we go forward. But I also want to make sure we touch upon the investment side of the portfolio. We did complete some important divestitures during the quarter, including the Citigroup headquarters building sale, 33 Beekman sale, and sale of the suburban property in Greenwich. The proceeds of these significant capital transactions went to pay down debt and invest in certain new opportunities, including a 20% stake in a recently completed residential project on the West Side, known as Sky, and an additional investment in the debt [ph] and preferred equity portfolio. 
On the topic of DPE, we are still on track and reaffirm our December guidance that for year-end balances, [ph] we'll be just shy of $2 billion, about $1.95 billion of balance, and contribution for the year should be on the order of about $200 million of gross revenues from that book of business.
We have sizable, identified pipeline of deals that we expect to close during the second half of the year, carrying routine spreads of approximately 9.9% for that pipeline book of business, which is higher than first half's achievement, but when blended will certainly exceed the 8.5% that was used in our earnings guidance back in December and then our earnings revision at the first quarter. So that's a very, I'd say, positive story and a good market for us to be conducting our business with on the lending side as well as on the equity on [ph] real estate side.
We have been market leaders in the provision of subordinate debt capital for large and small New York City commercial projects for years and years. We established that position by being the most active lender in that market, I guess, for nearly 20 years. So there's a reputation and franchise and knowledge of the business, which I think you'll see has been paying off over the years and will be a shining example through the balance of this year. 
With excellent visibility at this point into our remaining 2016 production and performance, given there's only 5.5 months to go, our focus will naturally turn to 2017 and beyond. In order to meet our stated objective of delivering market-leading recurring earnings growth and sector-leading total return to [ph] shareholder growth, we have positioned our investment portfolio to generate substantial increases in NOI through leasing up the remainder of the growth portfolio and taking advantage of the embedded rental mark-to-market in our stabilized office and retail portfolios. 
These engines of growth should enable us to continue to deliver sector-leading increases in FFO over the next 3 to 5 years, and this is before accounting for the earnings contributions from One Vanderbilt. Speaking of One Vanderbilt, we are on track with this iconic development project, with the site now almost 100% cleared of the 4 older buildings that formerly occupied the site. Heavy equipment is rolled in to complete the removal of the last 2 floors. And in 3 weeks, we will have a clean site ready to be excavated and foundations poured. Extraordinary amount of credit goes to our construction and operations team for undertaking over the past year what we believe to be the largest surgical demolition of commercial buildings in decades. And it was done on time, on budget and in a safe manner. And New York City is better for it. There's barely a day that goes by we're not getting a comment from somebody who sees how that site is now being transformed in a way to upgrade the appreciation you have of these great landmark properties that surround the site, like Grand Central and Chrysler and Lincoln and others. It's [ph] by allowing what will replace those buildings, the new building having setbacks to the property line in a tapered form [ph] to let in maximum light there, enormous benefit to the city, to the skyline and to this company by adding this extraordinary building to our portfolio. 
Our financing arrangements for the $1.5 billion construction loan are on track as we've signed the final term sheet with a consortium of 5 lenders, and we will look to have the loan fully committed and closed by the end of the third quarter.
You also saw we took advantage of interest rates by entering into a $300 million swap, 7-year term swap. And what's interesting to note is that in the past 2 Decembers, Andrew Mathias, [ph] a quick write-up on the screen, another engine of earnings growth, which I think doesn't get the proper amount of due, which is not top line revenue growth but bottom line debt service savings. And we showed that there was extraordinary amount of mark-to-market savings that we could achieve over the next 3 to 5 years in our debt book by having rates just basically stay roughly where they were when we went through the analysis in December. In fact, rates have fallen since then, so I would imagine the opportunity for us at this moment exceeds the $30 million or $40 million per year annually that we have forecasted at that point. And these swaps are one -- just one point of evidence of how we can take advantage of that because the rate we locked in for 7 years is actually lower than the floating rate we had forecasted for the year. Recall, we always model LIBOR curve plus 50 basis points, and the amount, what was it, 1.13?"

So I feel like we are firing on all cylinders. I said that last quarter. I feel like the cylinders are still properly functioning. I feel very good about our positioning in the market for the present and for the future. Our same-store portfolio was 97.4% leased. Our leverage levels were the lowest in the company's history and getting better. Our liquidity exceeds $1.5 billion. We expect to have little or no line of credit balance outstanding by year-end based on projections for the balance of the year. We have substantial storehouses of growth embedded in the portfolio, which I mentioned, and we're on track to develop the greatest buildings in New York City.
So with that, I'd like to open it up for questions."

Downturn doesn't mean things like go to 0. [ph] Downturns in New York may just be marginal rent reductions of 10%, 15%, 20%. I think that the model we've seen them execute in this market is sort of best-of-class, and I think that is generally perceived to be such when you look at the landlords that are doing business, looking to WeWork as sort of, in many cases, a prime tenant. So it doesn't give us concern. 3 million square feet for any tenant on a 400 million square foot inventory, I don't want to be too dismissive, but it's not like 3 million square feet in a 100 million square foot market.

As I think it should be. I think the first order of business and an important part of the overall capitalization of this project is to get a properly structured price, $1.5 billion construction and facility closed out, which we've been working intensely hard on for several months now. And looks like we're nearing the conclusion point and hope to have that close in the next 50 [ph] days or so, 60 [ph], 75 [ph] days. So I think along the way, we have begun to have conversations with equity investors, I would say, all of which have gone exceedingly well in terms of this activity of these various institutional players who have the capacity to fund a deal like this and have the desire to be a part of development projects, which are kind of best building, best market, best location. With that said, there are certain signals from our shareholders and analysts about trying to expedite, do it rapidly, we're not on that approach. It's a bad approach. We don't want to, I think, no exact right or wrong , but we think that for a project like this, we should see the whole market and there's going to be a lot of different opportunities out there, different structures, different amounts, different kind of yield enhancements available for the company. We're working very closely with Heinz in this regard. I'd say by the end of this year, we would've covered, I don't know maybe 40 of the top domestic and foreign investors in the world for a project like this. And then we'll try to zero in and grind it down to the right partner for a project like this. You don't want the wrong partner. You want to make sure this is the absolute right partner, shares a long-term vision, has the capacity to fund side-by-side all the way through the project and has a real deep love and affection for this project. I'm confident we'll get there as I was confident we would find, pull together the debt financing. It is not -- business is not on an urgent track, not on fast-track. It's on what I would call kind of a responsible track for a project like this. Remember, there's very little money spend right now. I keep reinforcing the fact that most of the money spent begins middle of '17 when you start going vertical on project. We kind of fully decided on unencumbered. We had no partners. We'll be funding what remains in demo activation, cash or between now and year-end. And then we get to do some initial loan draws where our expectation is we'll be able to do a initial loan draws under loan facilities to basically prime the pump for 2017. So we have time. We think the market's coming our way because as rates drop and you have things like Brexit, which take a fairly attractive and competitive market and maybe put it on the sidelines for a year or 2, we'll be the beneficiary of at least temporarily, if not permanently, some excess investment dollars searching for project like One Vanderbilt and I think it's our job to take advantage of that. We're on -- we're preceding a pace Bays and we'll definitely keep you apprised, but I didn't expect much in the way of announceable events on the JV side of '16, I would probably reiterate that at this point."

The other way of saying is I would have raised the guidance 22% if I did feel pretty good about that. I did say earlier at the outset that it has suprised us in the upside. I didn't expect the second half of the year to be quite as good as it looks like it's planning out to be. In response to someone's earlier question, maybe we're outperforming the market.

We're pleased that all of you joined us on this gorgeous day at New York City, and we're even happier that we were able to put out yet another quarter of strong operating results and market-leading capital transactions. Our seco",1676,"Okay. Thank you, operator. We're pleased that all of you joined us on this gorgeous day at New York City, and we're even happier that we were able to put out yet another quarter of strong operating results and market-leading capital transactions. Our second quarter results continue a trend in 2016 of surprising to the upside and leasing velocity and rental achievement. We executed another 620,000 square feet of Manhattan office leases, highlighted by the recently announced expansion of Bloomberg in 919 Third Avenue and the renewal and expansion of New York Life at Graybar Building. In fact, SL Green was responsible for 3 of the 8 largest leases transacted in the second quarter in Midtown, Bloomberg, New York Life and Wells Fargo at 100 Park Avenue. 
The mark-to-market on the second quarter Manhattan leases was a robust 16%, bringing first half 2016 average rental increases on replacement leases to 28%. And that's on about 1.5 million square feet of leasing during 6 months. I think it speaks for itself as an extraordinary accomplishment. 
Velocity continues even into the month of July, with another 84,000 square feet of leasing in office in Manhattan in just the past 3 weeks at an 18% mark-to-market inclusive of the recent Omnicom renewal at 220 East 42nd Street. 
In terms of forecasting these leasing trends for the remainder of the year, I would note that the best indicator of what those results are likely to trend towards would be our current leasing pipeline. That current pipeline stands today at about 1.6 million square feet, the vast majority of which is comprised of leases pending, 4 leases out for signature. And notably, the mark-to-market on all of those pipeline deals exceeds 20%. 
So fortunately for shareholders and unfortunately for Steve Durels and his leasing team, we must and are increasing our full year guidance for completed Manhattan office leases to 2.6 million square feet for the full year and mark-to-market on those leases, which are replacement leases, to 22% mark-to-market. So numbers that, in each case, are fairly significantly ahead of where we were in December. That sound you just heard was Steve hitting the floor. You can pick yourself up, Steve, and let's keep -- let's just put the best face on and go forward, okay? 
In this manner, we provide additional motivation and encouragement to our leasing and operations team to execute at the highest level that's consistent with this firm's culture of hard work and outperformance. 
These leasing results and our projection of second half performance is driven by continual demand for high-quality, well-located, reasonably priced office space, which descriptively is the sweet spot of our entire portfolio. 
Midtown space continues to be in high demand as the vacancy rate decreased 10 basis points to 9.2%, and sublease space in Midtown stands at only 2.9 million square feet, near historical lows over the past 8 or 9 years for sublease space. Very important barometer, we haven't talked about that on the last few conference calls, but we're talking about sublease space in Midtown that's about 1.1% of total inventory. So very, very well. 
Job creation in the financial security sector is roughly flat for the year. I think, contrary to market perspective that there has been some substantial contraction in this sector, it's actually, I think, going down about 1,000 jobs year-to-date, which on that job basis is essentially 0. But interestingly, the FIRE sector, finance, insurance real estate, is accounting for much of the first half leasing activity in Midtown and elsewhere. Health care is also making a reasonably good showing, but I would say financial services had an above-average showing in the first half of the year. 
That activity, and all that -- whether it's the FIRE sector, health care or otherwise, is driven by jobs and job creation. Unfortunately, the June New York City job numbers are not out yet. They're going to be out imminently. We would have hoped to have had them for the call, but we don't. But if it's any indicator, the national numbers that came out from Bureau of Labor Statistics for June were quite strong relative to May and earlier. And we're hopeful that the New York City numbers will follow and inform the national numbers. In part, it's almost self-fulfilling because the end of the Verizon strike in and of itself will probably put back on the rolls of the city, I think, 3,000-plus jobs in June. So we're just hoping that and more growth on top of that, but we'll see shortly.
So that's a quick snapshot of the leasing picture. I'm sure you guys will have questions as we go forward. But I also want to make sure we touch upon the investment side of the portfolio. We did complete some important divestitures during the quarter, including the Citigroup headquarters building sale, 33 Beekman sale, and sale of the suburban property in Greenwich. The proceeds of these significant capital transactions went to pay down debt and invest in certain new opportunities, including a 20% stake in a recently completed residential project on the West Side, known as Sky, and an additional investment in the debt and preferred equity portfolio. 
On the topic of DPE, we are still on track and reaffirm our December guidance that for year-end balances, we'll be just shy of $2 billion, about $1.95 billion of balance, and contribution for the year should be on the order of about $200 million of gross revenues from that book of business.
We have sizable, identified pipeline of deals that we expect to close during the second half of the year, carrying routine spreads of approximately 9.9% for that pipeline book of business, which is higher than first half's achievement, but when blended will certainly exceed the 8.5% that was used in our earnings guidance back in December and then our earnings revision at the first quarter. So that's a very, I'd say, positive story and a good market for us to be conducting our business with on the lending side as well as on the equity on real estate side.
We have been market leaders in the provision of subordinate debt capital for large and small New York City commercial projects for years and years. We established that position by being the most active lender in that market, I guess, for nearly 20 years. So there's a reputation and franchise and knowledge of the business, which I think you'll see has been paying off over the years and will be a shining example through the balance of this year. 
With excellent visibility at this point into our remaining 2016 production and performance, given there's only 5.5 months to go, our focus will naturally turn to 2017 and beyond. In order to meet our stated objective of delivering market-leading recurring earnings growth and sector-leading total return to shareholder growth, we have positioned our investment portfolio to generate substantial increases in NOI through leasing up the remainder of the growth portfolio and taking advantage of the embedded rental mark-to-market in our stabilized office and retail portfolios. 
These engines of growth should enable us to continue to deliver sector-leading increases in FFO over the next 3 to 5 years, and this is before accounting for the earnings contributions from One Vanderbilt. Speaking of One Vanderbilt, we are on track with this iconic development project, with the site now almost 100% cleared of the 4 older buildings that formerly occupied the site. Heavy equipment is rolled in to complete the removal of the last 2 floors. And in 3 weeks, we will have a clean site ready to be excavated and foundations poured. Extraordinary amount of credit goes to our construction and operations team for undertaking over the past year what we believe to be the largest surgical demolition of commercial buildings in decades. And it was done on time, on budget and in a safe manner. And New York City is better for it. There's barely a day that goes by we're not getting a comment from somebody who sees how that site is now being transformed in a way to upgrade the appreciation you have of these great landmark properties that surround the site, like Grand Central and Chrysler and Lincoln and others. It's by allowing what will replace those buildings, the new building having setbacks to the property line in a tapered form to let in maximum light there, enormous benefit to the city, to the skyline and to this company by adding this extraordinary building to our portfolio. 
Our financing arrangements for the $1.5 billion construction loan are on track as we've signed the final term sheet with a consortium of 5 lenders, and we will look to have the loan fully committed and closed by the end of the third quarter.
You also saw we took advantage of interest rates by entering into a $300 million swap, 7-year term swap. And what's interesting to note is that in the past 2 Decembers, Andrew Mathias, quick write-up on the screen, another engine of earnings growth, which I think doesn't get the proper amount of due, which is not top line revenue growth but bottom line debt service savings. And we showed that there was extraordinary amount of mark-to-market savings that we could achieve over the next 3 to 5 years in our debt book by having rates just basically stay roughly where they were when we went through the analysis in December. In fact, rates have fallen since then, so I would imagine the opportunity for us at this moment exceeds the $30 million or $40 million per year annually that we have forecasted at that point. And these swaps are one -- just one point of evidence of how we can take advantage of that because the rate we locked in for 7 years is actually lower than the floating rate we had forecasted for the year. Recall, we always model LIBOR curve plus 50 basis points, and the amount, what was it, 1.13?"

So I feel like we are firing on all cylinders. I said that last quarter. I feel like the cylinders are still properly functioning. I feel very good about our positioning in the market for the present and for the future. Our same-store portfolio was 97.4% leased. Our leverage levels were the lowest in the company's history and getting better. Our liquidity exceeds $1.5 billion. We expect to have little or no line of credit balance outstanding by year-end based on projections for the balance of the year. We have substantial storehouses of growth embedded in the portfolio, which I mentioned, and we're on track to develop the greatest buildings in New York City.
So with that, I'd like to open it up for questions."

And tenants, we've continued to see tenants that have 2017, '18 expirations a willingness to engage in early renewals.

So I think that if any of these companies are capitalized properly, and WeWork looks to be like they are, then these downturns in New York tend to be short-lived. Downturn doesn't mean things like go to 0. Downturns in New York may just be marginal rent reductions of 10%, 15%, 20%. I think that the model we've seen them execute in this market is sort of best-of-class, and I think that is generally perceived to be such when you look at the landlords that are doing business, looking to WeWork as sort of, in many cases, a prime tenant. So it doesn't give us concern. 3 million square feet for any tenant on a 400 million square foot inventory, I don't want to be too dismissive, but it's not like 3 million square feet in a 100 million square foot market. It's -- this market is 4x that size. And therefore, we don't -- it's not something that keeps us up at night."

So we are able to kind of leverage that position to maximize our relationships with tenants, partners, lenders and vendors to keep this portfolio 97.5% leased, maximize our rent, keep our TIs, leasing concessions low. I don't think anybody mentioned that, but I think it's worthy of mentioning. I think we were about $26 a foot or $30 a foot thereabout for the quarter.

I think that, that sort of reinforces our strategy, which is a question from time to time of wanting to be sort of a sharpshooter in one market. I think we attempted to not just -- it wasn't by accident. We chose to do $25 billion of business in one market. It was designed to be done in what we thought was the market that had the best liquidity, stability, transparency, depth of market participants, Fortune 500 tenants. London, I think, exhibits many of those traits, but I think New York is a better market going in. And I don't think there's any more desire on our part to diversify into that market or other markets, which we would almost deem as like adverse diversification. So there's plenty for us to do in this city, both -- in office, retail, multi then preferred equity. We've got actually quite a full plate. And while there may be some good opportunities in London that emerge, my guess is that'll be taken advantage of by people who have or groups that have significant footprints in that market.

I think the first order of business and an important part of the overall capitalization of this project is to get a properly structured price, $1.5 billion construction when the facility closed out, which we've been working intensely hard on for several months now and looks like we're nearing the conclusion point and hope to have that close in the next 60 days or so, 60, 75 days. So I think at -- along the way, we have begun to have conversations with equity investors, I would say, all of which have gone exceedingly well in terms of receptivity of these various institutional players who have the capacity to fund a deal like this and have the desire to be a part of development projects, which are kind of best building, best market, best location. With that said, there are certain signals from our shareholders and analysts about trying to expedite, do it rapidly. We're not on that approach. It's a bad approach. We don't want to -- I think, I mean, just no exact right or wrong , but we think that for a project like this, we should see the whole market. And there's going to be a lot of different opportunities out there, different structures, different amounts, different kind of yield enhancements available to this company. We're working very closely with Hines in this regard. I'd say by the end of this year, we'll have covered, I don't know, like, maybe 40 of the top domestic and foreign investors in the world for a project like this. And then we'll try and zero in and grind it down to the right partner for a project like this. You don't want the wrong partner. You want to make sure this is the absolute right partner, shares a long-term vision, has the capacity to fund side by side all the way through the project and has a real deep love and affection for this project. I'm confident we'll get there as I was confident we would find the -- pull together the debt financing. It is not -- this is not on a -- like a urgent track, not on a fast track. It's on what I would call kind of a responsible track for a project like this. Remember, there's very little money spend right now. I keep reinforcing the fact that most of the money spend begins middle of '17 when you start going vertical on a project. We've kind of fully decided on unencumbered. We have no partners. We'll be funding whatever remains in demo and activation just out of cash flow between now and year-end. And then we get to do some initial loan draws where our expectation is we'll be able to do initial loan draws under a loan facility to basically prime the pump for 2017. So we have time. We think the market's coming our way because as rates drop and you have things like Brexit, which take a fairly attractive and competitive market and maybe puts it on the sidelines for a year or 2, I think we'll be the beneficiary of, at least temporarily, if not permanently, some excess investment dollars, searching for projects like One Vanderbilt. And I think it's our job to take advantage of that. So we're on -- we're proceeding at pace, and we'll definitely keep you apprised, but I have said, I didn't expect much in the way of announceable events on the JV side in '16. I would probably reiterate that at this point."

We feel very good about the project's positioning and the rent positioning of the project where we sit today, not just where we sat in December. And we might be conservative; we might not be. But I don't think we're aggressive, and the returns are such that even if the rents are 3% to 5% off, the deal returns for the development side of this quality are still far, far in excess of baseline returns."

So the contribution is the differential in the gross rent. So if the NOI of the building is $10 million and we sign a new lease and the gross rent goes from $75 million to $80 million, we've got $5 a foot more that's going to drop to that bottom line through the NOI because expenses don't go up when you sign the lease.

I mean, we could look out into the future and sort of speculate as to what the longer-term trends might look like. But we're busily at work trying to close out that 1.6 million at fairly substantial rental increases. So I guess I'd had to answer that question by saying it looks like we're going to get those increases. The other way of saying this, I wouldn't have raised the guidance 22% if I didn't feel pretty good about that. So I did say earlier at the outset that it has surprised us to the upside. I didn't expect the second half of the year to be quite as good as it looks like it's panning out to be. In response to someone's earlier question, maybe we're outperforming the market. So you could have a situation where both things are true, and that's okay for us, which is maybe the market is slowing a bit and rental growth is slowing a bit. But if our portfolio is still full speed ahead, then I don't want to, like, question it. I want to go with that and do more of that and keep going and differentiate ourselves from the market. That's what you look for, I think, and top companies in any industry is that kind of differentiation. We're not bigger than the market, but we can certainly do better than the market, and I think we have and will. So I think both could be true, Nick, but we see a very good environment over the next 6 months to conduct our business and finish out our year and hit these sort of sector-leading numbers and then towards the end of the year, we're going to give you our view of '17, which I think it's a little too early because I'd like to see a few more months of jobs numbers before I even go there. Let's see June, July, August and the balance of the year and see where those jobs numbers go because if the private sector job numbers and opportunity job numbers are up and still not up as much as last year and the years prior but in the range of 50,000 new jobs plus and 50,000 plus are office-using jobs, then we're still in a good market.

We're pleased that all of you joined us on this gorgeous day in New York City, and we're even happier that we were able to put out yet another quarter of strong operating results and market-leading capital transactions. Our seco",1678,"Okay. Thank you, operator. We're pleased that all of you joined us on this gorgeous day in New York City, and we're even happier that we were able to put out yet another quarter of strong operating results and market-leading capital transactions. Our second quarter results continue a trend in 2016 of surprising to the upside in leasing velocity and rental achievement. We executed another 620,000 square feet of Manhattan office leases, highlighted by the recently announced expansion of Bloomberg in 919 Third Avenue and the renewal and expansion of New York Life at Graybar Building. In fact, SL Green was responsible for 3 of the 8 largest leases transacted in the second quarter in Midtown, Bloomberg, New York Life and Wells Fargo at 100 Park Avenue. 
The mark-to-market on the second quarter Manhattan leases was a robust 16%, bringing first half 2016 average rental increases on replacement leases to 28%. And that's on about 1.5 million square feet of leasing during 6 months. I think it speaks for itself as an extraordinary accomplishment. 
Velocity continues even into the month of July, with another 84,000 square feet of leasing in office in Manhattan in just the past 3 weeks at an 18% mark-to-market inclusive of the recent Omnicom renewal at 220 East 42nd Street. 
In terms of forecasting these leasing trends for the remainder of the year, I would note that the best indicator of what those results are likely to trend towards would be our current leasing pipeline. That current pipeline stands today at about 1.6 million square feet, the vast majority of which is comprised of leases pending, 4 leases out for signature. And notably, the mark-to-market on all of those pipeline deals exceeds 20%. 
So fortunately for shareholders and unfortunately for Steve Durels and his leasing team, we must and are increasing our full year guidance for completed Manhattan office leases to 2.6 million square feet for the full year and mark-to-market on those leases, which are replacement leases, to 22% mark-to-market. So numbers that, in each case, are fairly significantly ahead of where we were in December. That sound you just heard was Steve hitting the floor. You can pick yourself up, Steve, and let's keep -- let's just put the best face on and go forward, okay? 
In this manner, we provide additional motivation and encouragement to our leasing and operations team to execute at the highest level that's consistent with this firm's culture of hard work and outperformance. 
These leasing results in our projection of second half performance is driven by continual demand for high-quality, well-located, reasonably priced office space, which descriptively is the sweet spot of our entire portfolio. 
Midtown space continues to be in high demand as the vacancy rate decreased 10 basis points to 9.2%, and sublease space in Midtown stands at only 2.9 million square feet, near historical lows over the past 8 or 9 years for sublease space. Very important barometer, we haven't talked about that on the last few conference calls, but we're talking about sublease space in Midtown that's about 1.1% of total inventory. So very, very well. 
Job creation in the financial security sector is roughly flat for the year. I think, contrary to market perspective that there has been some substantial contraction in this sector, it's actually, I think, going down about 1,000 jobs year-to-date, which on that job basis is essentially 0. But interestingly, the FIRE sector -- finance, insurance, real estate -- is accounting for much of the first half leasing activity in Midtown and elsewhere. Health care is also making a reasonably good showing, but I would say financial services had an above-average showing in the first half of the year. 
That activity, and all that -- whether it's the FIRE sector, health care or otherwise, is driven by jobs and job creation. Unfortunately, the June New York City job numbers are not out yet. They're going to be out imminently. We would have hoped to have had them for the call, but we don't. But if it's any indicator, the national numbers that came out from Bureau of Labor Statistics for June were quite strong relative to May and earlier. And we're hopeful that the New York City numbers will follow and inform the national numbers. In part, it's almost self-fulfilling because the end of the Verizon strike in and of itself will probably put back on the rolls of the city, I think, 3,000-plus jobs in June. So we're just hoping that and more growth on top of that, but we'll see shortly.
So that's a quick snapshot of the leasing picture. I'm sure you guys will have questions as we go forward. But I also want to make sure we touch upon the investment side of the portfolio. We did complete some important divestitures during the quarter, including the Citigroup headquarters building sale, 33 Beekman sale, and sale of the suburban property in Greenwich. The proceeds of these significant capital transactions went to pay down debt and invest in certain new opportunities, including a 20% stake in a recently completed residential project on the West Side, known as Sky, and an additional investment in the debt and preferred equity portfolio. 
On the topic of DPE, we are still on track and reaffirm our December guidance that for year-end balances, we'll be just shy of $2 billion, about $1.95 billion of balance, and contribution for the year should be on the order of about $200 million of gross revenues from that book of business.
We have sizable, identified pipeline of deals that we expect to close during the second half of the year, carrying routine spreads of approximately 9.9% for that pipeline book of business, which is higher than first half's achievement, but when blended will certainly exceed the 8.5% that was used in our earnings guidance back in December and then our earnings revision at the first quarter. So that's a very, I'd say, positive story and a good market for us to be conducting our business with on the lending side as well as on the equity on real estate side.
We have been market leaders in the provision of subordinate debt capital for large and small New York City commercial projects for years and years. We established that position by being the most active lender in that market, I guess, for nearly 20 years. So there's a reputation and franchise and knowledge of the business, which I think you'll see has been paying off over the years and will be a shining example through the balance of this year. 
With excellent visibility at this point into our remaining 2016 production and performance, given there's only 5.5 months to go, our focus will naturally turn to 2017 and beyond. In order to meet our stated objective of delivering market-leading recurring earnings growth and sector-leading total return to shareholder growth, we have positioned our investment portfolio to generate substantial increases in NOI through leasing up the remainder of the growth portfolio and taking advantage of the embedded rental mark-to-market in our stabilized office and retail portfolios. 
These engines of growth should enable us to continue to deliver sector-leading increases in FFO over the next 3 to 5 years, and this is before accounting for the earnings contributions from One Vanderbilt. Speaking of One Vanderbilt, we are on track with this iconic development project, with the site now almost 100% cleared of the 4 older buildings that formerly occupied the site. Heavy equipment is rolled in to complete the removal of the last 2 floors. And in 3 weeks, we will have a clean site ready to be excavated and foundations poured. Extraordinary amount of credit goes to our construction and operations team for undertaking over the past year what we believe to be the largest surgical demolition of commercial buildings in decades. And it was done on time, on budget and in a safe manner. And New York City is better for it. There's barely a day that goes by we're not getting a comment from somebody who sees how that site is now being transformed in a way to upgrade the appreciation you have of these great landmark properties that surround the site, like Grand Central and Chrysler and Lincoln and others. It's by allowing what will replace those buildings, the new building having setbacks to the property line in a tapered form to let in maximum light there, enormous benefit to the city, to the skyline and to this company by adding this extraordinary building to our portfolio. 
Our financing arrangements for the $1.5 billion construction loan are on track as we've signed the final term sheet with a consortium of 5 lenders, and we will look to have the loan fully committed and closed by the end of the third quarter.
You also saw we took advantage of interest rates by entering into a $300 million swap, 7-year term swap. And what's interesting to note is that in the past 2 Decembers, Andrew Mathias, quick write-up on the screen, another engine of earnings growth, which I think doesn't get the proper amount of due, which is not top line revenue growth but bottom line debt service savings. And we showed that there was extraordinary amount of mark-to-market savings that we could achieve over the next 3 to 5 years in our debt book by having rates just basically stay roughly where they were when we went through the analysis in December. In fact, rates have fallen since then, so I would imagine the opportunity for us at this moment exceeds the $30 million or $40 million per year annually that we have forecasted at that point. And these swaps are one -- just one point of evidence of how we can take advantage of that because the rate we locked in for 7 years is actually lower than the floating rate we had forecasted for the year. Recall, we always model LIBOR curve plus 50 basis points, and the amount, what was it, 1.13?"

So I feel like we are firing on all cylinders. I said that last quarter. I feel like the cylinders are still properly functioning. I feel very good about our positioning in the market for the present and for the future. Our same-store portfolio was 97.4% leased. Our leverage levels are the lowest in the company's history and getting better. Our liquidity exceeds $1.5 billion. We expect to have little or no line of credit balance outstanding by year-end based on projections for the balance of year. We have substantial storehouses of growth embedded in the portfolio, which I mentioned, and we're on track to develop the greatest buildings in New York City.
So with that, I'd like to open it up for questions."

And I don't think that's ever going to go away for the next several years to come because it's a bit of a cultural thing. And tenants, we've continued to see tenants that have 2017, '18 expirations a willingness to engage in early renewals. And as Marc touched on, a lot of the sort of outperformance on the leasing velocity within our portfolio is a combination of filling vacancy but also tenants' willingness to step up and do early renewals.

So it's a different company with a different model, a very successful model and a model that's attracting an enormous amount of financial support. So to me, the difference between companies, not just fractional office companies or full-service communities like WeWork that do their business but really any company to ride through any period of downturn is simply -- well, not simply but is, in large part, capacity and liquidity. So I think that if any of these companies are capitalized properly, and WeWork looks to be like they are, then these downturns in New York tend to be short-lived. Downturn doesn't mean things like go to 0. Downturns in New York may just be marginal rent reductions of 10%, 15%, 20%. I think that the model we've seen them execute in this market is sort of best-of-class, and I think that is generally perceived to be such when you look at the landlords that are doing business, looking to WeWork as sort of, in many cases, a prime tenant. So it doesn't give us concern. 3 million square feet for any tenant on a 400 million square foot inventory, I don't want to be too dismissive, but it's not like 3 million square feet in a 100 million square foot market. It's -- this market is 4x that size. And therefore, we don't -- it's not something that keeps us up at night."

I hope we're, if not the best, among the best, but I'd like to think we are the best. And as a result, we, I think, have a unusual scale and footprint in the city, almost 30 million square feet of real estate. So we are able to kind of leverage that position to maximize our relationships with tenants, partners, lenders and vendors to keep this portfolio 97.5% leased, maximize our rent, keep our TIs, leasing concessions low. I don't think anybody mentioned that, but I think it's worthy of mentioning. I think we are about $26 a foot or $30 a foot thereabout for the quarter.

It was designed to be done in what we thought was the market that had the best liquidity, stability, transparency, depth of market participants, Fortune 500 tenants. London, I think, exhibits many of those traits, but I think New York is a better market going in. And I don't think there's any more desire on our part to diversify into that market or other markets, which we would almost deem as like adverse diversification. So there's plenty for us to do in this city, both -- in office, retail, multi then preferred equity. We've got actually quite a full plate. And while there may be some good opportunities in London that emerge, my guess is that'll be taken advantage of by people who have or groups that have significant footprints in that market.

I think the first order of business and an important part of the overall capitalization of this project is to get a properly structured price, $1.5 billion construction loan facility closed out, which we've been working intensely hard on for several months now and looks like we're nearing the conclusion point and hope to have that close in the next 60 days or so, 60, 75 days. So I think at -- along the way, we have begun to have conversations with equity investors, I would say, all of which have gone exceedingly well in terms of receptivity of these various institutional players who have the capacity to fund a deal like this and have the desire to be a part of development projects, which are kind of best building, best market, best location. With that said, there are certain signals from our shareholders and analysts about trying to expedite, do it rapidly. We're not on that approach. It's a bad approach. We don't want to -- I think, I mean, just there's no exact right or wrong , but we think that for a project like this, we should see the whole market. And there's going to be a lot of different opportunities out there, different structures, different amounts, different kind of yield enhancements available to this company. We're working very closely with Hines in this regard. I'd say by the end of this year, we'll have covered, I don't know, like, maybe 40 of the top domestic and foreign investors in the world for a project like this. And then we'll try and zero in and grind it down to the right partner for a project like this. You don't want the wrong partner. You want to make sure this is the absolute right partner, shares a long-term vision, has the capacity to fund side by side all the way through the project and has a real deep love and affection for this project. I'm confident we'll get there as I was confident we would find the -- pull together the debt financing. It is not -- this is not on a -- like a urgent track, not on a fast track. It's on what I would call kind of a responsible track for a project like this. Remember, there's very little money spend right now. I keep reinforcing the fact that most of the money spend begins middle of '17 when you start going vertical on a project. We've kind of fully decided unencumbered. We have no partners. We'll be funding whatever remains in demo and activation just out of cash flow between now and year-end. And then we get to do some initial loan draws where our expectation is we'll be able to do initial loan draws on the loan facility to basically prime the pump for 2017. So we have time. We think the market's coming our way because as rates drop and you have things like Brexit, which take a fairly attractive and competitive market and maybe puts it on the sidelines for a year or 2, I think we'll be the beneficiary of, at least temporarily, if not permanently, some excess investment dollars, searching for projects like One Vanderbilt. And I think it's our job to take advantage of that. So we're on -- we're proceeding at pace, and we'll definitely keep you apprised, but I have said, I didn't expect much in the way of announceable events on the JV side in '16. I would probably reiterate that at this point."

But I guess what we're looking at is within our NOI at any given point in time, you have the net. So the question is, how much contribution are you getting to the NOI, which you already -- remember, NOI is already taken out of the expenses. So the contribution is the differential in the gross rent. So if the NOI of the building is $10 million and we sign a new lease and the gross rent goes from $75 million to $80 million, we've got $5 a foot more that's going to drop to that bottom line through the NOI because expenses don't go up when you sign the lease. Your point is that increase on a net basis is probably more than 22%. I think that's right. So we can take a look at that."

I mean, we could look out into the future and sort of speculate as to what the longer-term trends might look like. But we're busily at work trying to close out that 1.6 million at fairly substantial rental increases. So I guess I'd had to answer that question by saying it looks like we're going to get those increases. The other way of saying this, I wouldn't have raised the guidance 22% if I didn't feel pretty good about that. So I did say earlier at the outset that it has surprised us to the upside. I didn't expect the second half of the year to be quite as good as it looks like it's panning out to be. In response to someone's earlier question, maybe we're outperforming the market. So you could have a situation where both things are true, and that's okay for us, which is maybe the market is slowing a bit and rental growth is slowing a bit. But if our portfolio is still full speed ahead, then I don't want to, like, question it. I want to go with that and do more of that and keep going and differentiate ourselves from the market. That's what you look for, I think, in top companies in any industry is that kind of differentiation. We're not bigger than the market, but we can certainly do better than the market, and I think we have and will. So I think both could be true, Nick, but we see a very good environment over the next 6 months to conduct our business and finish out our year and hit these sort of sector-leading numbers and then towards the end of the year, we're going to give you our view of '17, which I think it's a little too early because I'd like to see a few more months of jobs numbers before I even go there. Let's see June, July, August and the balance of the year and see where those jobs numbers go because if the private sector job numbers and opportunity job numbers are up and still not up as much as last year and the years prior but in the range of 50,000 new jobs plus and 50,000 plus are office-using jobs, then we're still in a good market.

We're pleased that all of you joined us on this gorgeous day in New York City, and we're even happier that we were able to put out yet another quarter of strong operating results and market-leading capital transactions. Our seco",1678,"Okay. Thank you, operator. We're pleased that all of you joined us on this gorgeous day in New York City, and we're even happier that we were able to put out yet another quarter of strong operating results and market-leading capital transactions. Our second quarter results continue a trend in 2016 of surprising to the upside in leasing velocity and rental achievement. We executed another 620,000 square feet of Manhattan office leases, highlighted by the recently announced expansion of Bloomberg in 919 Third Avenue and the renewal and expansion of New York Life at Graybar Building. In fact, SL Green was responsible for 3 of the 8 largest leases transacted in the second quarter in Midtown, Bloomberg, New York Life and Wells Fargo at 100 Park Avenue. 
The mark-to-market on the second quarter Manhattan leases was a robust 16%, bringing first half 2016 average rental increases on replacement leases to 28%. And that's on about 1.5 million square feet of leasing during 6 months. I think it speaks for itself as an extraordinary accomplishment. 
Velocity continues even into the month of July, with another 84,000 square feet of leasing in office in Manhattan in just the past 3 weeks at an 18% mark-to-market inclusive of the recent Omnicom renewal at 220 East 42nd Street. 
In terms of forecasting these leasing trends for the remainder of the year, I would note that the best indicator of what those results are likely to trend towards would be our current leasing pipeline. That current pipeline stands today at about 1.6 million square feet, the vast majority of which is comprised of leases pending, 4 leases out for signature. And notably, the mark-to-market on all of those pipeline deals exceeds 20%. 
So fortunately for shareholders and unfortunately for Steve Durels and his leasing team, we must and are increasing our full year guidance for completed Manhattan office leases to 2.6 million square feet for the full year and mark-to-market on those leases, which are replacement leases, to 22% mark-to-market. So numbers that, in each case, are fairly significantly ahead of where we were in December. That sound you just heard was Steve hitting the floor. You can pick yourself up, Steve, and let's keep -- let's just put the best face on and go forward, okay? 
In this manner, we provide additional motivation and encouragement to our leasing and operations team to execute at the highest level that's consistent with this firm's culture of hard work and outperformance. 
These leasing results in our projection of second half performance is driven by continual demand for high-quality, well-located, reasonably priced office space, which descriptively is the sweet spot of our entire portfolio. 
Midtown space continues to be in high demand as the vacancy rate decreased 10 basis points to 9.2%, and sublease space in Midtown stands at only 2.9 million square feet, near historical lows over the past 8 or 9 years for sublease space. Very important barometer, we haven't talked about that on the last few conference calls, but we're talking about sublease space in Midtown that's about 1.1% of total inventory. So very, very well. 
Job creation in the financial security sector is roughly flat for the year. I think, contrary to market perspective that there has been some substantial contraction in this sector, it's actually, I think, going down about 1,000 jobs year-to-date, which on that job basis is essentially 0. But interestingly, the FIRE sector -- finance, insurance, real estate -- is accounting for much of the first half leasing activity in Midtown and elsewhere. Health care is also making a reasonably good showing, but I would say financial services had an above-average showing in the first half of the year. 
That activity, and all that -- whether it's the FIRE sector, health care or otherwise, is driven by jobs and job creation. Unfortunately, the June New York City job numbers are not out yet. They're going to be out imminently. We would have hoped to have had them for the call, but we don't. But if it's any indicator, the national numbers that came out from Bureau of Labor Statistics for June were quite strong relative to May and earlier. And we're hopeful that the New York City numbers will follow and inform the national numbers. In part, it's almost self-fulfilling because the end of the Verizon strike in and of itself will probably put back on the rolls of the city, I think, 3,000-plus jobs in June. So we're just hoping that and more growth on top of that, but we'll see shortly.
So that's a quick snapshot of the leasing picture. I'm sure you guys will have questions as we go forward. But I also want to make sure we touch upon the investment side of the portfolio. We did complete some important divestitures during the quarter, including the Citigroup headquarters building sale, 33 Beekman sale, and sale of the suburban property in Greenwich. The proceeds of these significant capital transactions went to pay down debt and invest in certain new opportunities, including a 20% stake in a recently completed residential project on the West Side, known as Sky, and an additional investment in the debt and preferred equity portfolio. 
On the topic of DPE, we are still on track and reaffirm our December guidance that for year-end balances, we'll be just shy of $2 billion, about $1.95 billion of balance, and contribution for the year should be on the order of about $200 million of gross revenues from that book of business.
We have sizable, identified pipeline of deals that we expect to close during the second half of the year, carrying routine spreads of approximately 9.9% for that pipeline book of business, which is higher than first half's achievement, but when blended will certainly exceed the 8.5% that was used in our earnings guidance back in December and then our earnings revision at the first quarter. So that's a very, I'd say, positive story and a good market for us to be conducting our business with on the lending side as well as on the equity on real estate side.
We have been market leaders in the provision of subordinate debt capital for large and small New York City commercial projects for years and years. We established that position by being the most active lender in that market, I guess, for nearly 20 years. So there's a reputation and franchise and knowledge of the business, which I think you'll see has been paying off over the years and will be a shining example through the balance of this year. 
With excellent visibility at this point into our remaining 2016 production and performance, given there's only 5.5 months to go, our focus will naturally turn to 2017 and beyond. In order to meet our stated objective of delivering market-leading recurring earnings growth and sector-leading total return to shareholder growth, we have positioned our investment portfolio to generate substantial increases in NOI through leasing up the remainder of the growth portfolio and taking advantage of the embedded rental mark-to-market in our stabilized office and retail portfolios. 
These engines of growth should enable us to continue to deliver sector-leading increases in FFO over the next 3 to 5 years, and this is before accounting for the earnings contributions from One Vanderbilt. Speaking of One Vanderbilt, we are on track with this iconic development project, with the site now almost 100% cleared of the 4 older buildings that formerly occupied the site. Heavy equipment is rolled in to complete the removal of the last 2 floors. And in 3 weeks, we will have a clean site ready to be excavated and foundations poured. Extraordinary amount of credit goes to our construction and operations team for undertaking over the past year what we believe to be the largest surgical demolition of commercial buildings in decades. And it was done on time, on budget and in a safe manner. And New York City is better for it. There's barely a day that goes by we're not getting a comment from somebody who sees how that site is now being transformed in a way to upgrade the appreciation you have of these great landmark properties that surround the site, like Grand Central and Chrysler and Lincoln and others. It's by allowing what will replace those buildings, the new building having setbacks to the property line in a tapered form to let in maximum light there, enormous benefit to the city, to the skyline and to this company by adding this extraordinary building to our portfolio. 
Our financing arrangements for the $1.5 billion construction loan are on track as we've signed the final term sheet with a consortium of 5 lenders, and we will look to have the loan fully committed and closed by the end of the third quarter.
You also saw we took advantage of interest rates by entering into a $300 million swap, 7-year term swap. And what's interesting to note is that in the past 2 Decembers, Andrew Mathias, quick write-up on the screen, another engine of earnings growth, which I think doesn't get the proper amount of due, which is not top line revenue growth but bottom line debt service savings. And we showed that there was extraordinary amount of mark-to-market savings that we could achieve over the next 3 to 5 years in our debt book by having rates just basically stay roughly where they were when we went through the analysis in December. In fact, rates have fallen since then, so I would imagine the opportunity for us at this moment exceeds the $30 million or $40 million per year annually that we have forecasted at that point. And these swaps are one -- just one point of evidence of how we can take advantage of that because the rate we locked in for 7 years is actually lower than the floating rate we had forecasted for the year. Recall, we always model LIBOR curve plus 50 basis points, and the amount, what was it, 1.13?"

So I feel like we are firing on all cylinders. I said that last quarter. I feel like the cylinders are still properly functioning. I feel very good about our positioning in the market for the present and for the future. Our same-store portfolio was 97.4% leased. Our leverage levels are the lowest in the company's history and getting better. Our liquidity exceeds $1.5 billion. We expect to have little or no line of credit balance outstanding by year-end based on projections for the balance of year. We have substantial storehouses of growth embedded in the portfolio, which I mentioned, and we're on track to develop the greatest buildings in New York City.
So with that, I'd like to open it up for questions."

So something we've done and we've done with like a single-minded focus is to do a lot of not just current leasing but forward leasing.

And I don't think that's ever going to go away for the next several years to come because it's a bit of a cultural thing. And tenants, we've continued to see tenants that have 2017, '18 expirations a willingness to engage in early renewals. And as Marc touched on, a lot of the sort of outperformance on the leasing velocity within our portfolio is a combination of filling vacancy but also tenants' willingness to step up and do early renewals.

So it's a different company with a different model, a very successful model and a model that's attracting an enormous amount of financial support. So to me, the difference between companies, not just fractional office companies or full-service communities like WeWork that do their business but really any company to ride through any period of downturn is simply -- well, not simply but is, in large part, capacity and liquidity. So I think that if any of these companies are capitalized properly, and WeWork looks to be like they are, then these downturns in New York tend to be short-lived. Downturn doesn't mean things like go to 0. Downturns in New York may just be marginal rent reductions of 10%, 15%, 20%. I think that the model we've seen them execute in this market is sort of best-of-class, and I think that is generally perceived to be such when you look at the landlords that are doing business, looking to WeWork as sort of, in many cases, a prime tenant. So it doesn't give us concern. 3 million square feet for any tenant on a 400 million square foot inventory, I don't want to be too dismissive, but it's not like 3 million square feet in a 100 million square foot market. It's -- this market is 4x that size. And therefore, we don't -- it's not something that keeps us up at night."

We are -- we'd like to think of ourselves as having among the best platforms in New York City and executing these kind of deals. So there's a wide disparity of buildings and ownership groups that comprise the 400 million feet of inventory in the city. I hope we're, if not the best, among the best, but I'd like to think we are the best. And as a result, we, I think, have a unusual scale and footprint in the city, almost 30 million square feet of real estate. So we are able to kind of leverage that position to maximize our relationships with tenants, partners, lenders and vendors to keep this portfolio 97.5% leased, maximize our rent, keep our TIs, leasing concessions low. I don't think anybody mentioned that, but I think it's worthy of mentioning. I think we are about $26 a foot or $30 a foot thereabout for the quarter. So quite efficient, I think, in terms of how we executed the business, and that's our calling card."

I think that, that sort of reinforces our strategy, which is a question from time to time of wanting to be sort of a sharpshooter in one market. I think we attempted to not just -- it wasn't by accident. We chose to do $25 billion of business in one market. It was designed to be done in what we thought was the market that had the best liquidity, stability, transparency, depth of market participants, Fortune 500 tenants. London, I think, exhibits many of those traits, but I think New York is a better market going in. And I don't think there's any more desire on our part to diversify into that market or other markets, which we would almost deem as like adverse diversification. So there's plenty for us to do in this city, both -- in office, retail, multi then preferred equity. We've got actually quite a full plate. And while there may be some good opportunities in London that emerge, my guess is that'll be taken advantage of by people who have or groups that have significant footprints in that market. So I wouldn't think so, but it's not something we've looked at all that closely at the moment. If shareholders start asking us to take a look at it, maybe we'll become more focused.

I think the first order of business and an important part of the overall capitalization of this project is to get a properly structured price, $1.5 billion construction loan facility closed out, which we've been working intensely hard on for several months now and looks like we're nearing the conclusion point and hope to have that close in the next 60 days or so, 60, 75 days. So I think at -- along the way, we have begun to have conversations with equity investors, I would say, all of which have gone exceedingly well in terms of receptivity of these various institutional players who have the capacity to fund a deal like this and have the desire to be a part of development projects, which are kind of best building, best market, best location. With that said, there are certain signals from our shareholders and analysts about trying to expedite, do it rapidly. We're not on that approach. It's a bad approach. We don't want to -- I think, I mean, just there's no exact right or wrong , but we think that for a project like this, we should see the whole market. And there's going to be a lot of different opportunities out there, different structures, different amounts, different kind of yield enhancements available to this company. We're working very closely with Hines in this regard. I'd say by the end of this year, we'll have covered, I don't know, like, maybe 40 of the top domestic and foreign investors in the world for a project like this. And then we'll try and zero in and grind it down to the right partner for a project like this. You don't want the wrong partner. You want to make sure this is the absolute right partner, shares a long-term vision, has the capacity to fund side by side all the way through the project and has a real deep love and affection for this project. I'm confident we'll get there as I was confident we would find the -- pull together the debt financing. It is not -- this is not on a -- like a urgent track, not on a fast track. It's on what I would call kind of a responsible track for a project like this. Remember, there's very little money spend right now. I keep reinforcing the fact that most of the money spend begins middle of '17 when you start going vertical on a project. We've kind of fully decided unencumbered. We have no partners. We'll be funding whatever remains in demo and activation just out of cash flow between now and year-end. And then we get to do some initial loan draws where our expectation is we'll be able to do initial loan draws on the loan facility to basically prime the pump for 2017. So we have time. We think the market's coming our way because as rates drop and you have things like Brexit, which take a fairly attractive and competitive market and maybe puts it on the sidelines for a year or 2, I think we'll be the beneficiary of, at least temporarily, if not permanently, some excess investment dollars, searching for projects like One Vanderbilt. And I think it's our job to take advantage of that. So we're on -- we're proceeding at pace, and we'll definitely keep you apprised, but I have said, I didn't expect much in the way of announceable events on the JV side in '16. I would probably reiterate that at this point."

So I couldn't sit here and say I think rents are going down because of that evidence. You know what I'm saying? I mean, we could look out into the future and sort of speculate as to what the longer-term trends might look like. But we're busily at work trying to close out that 1.6 million at fairly substantial rental increases. So I guess I'd had to answer that question by saying it looks like we're going to get those increases. The other way of saying this, I wouldn't have raised the guidance 22% if I didn't feel pretty good about that. So I did say earlier at the outset that it has surprised us to the upside. I didn't expect the second half of the year to be quite as good as it looks like it's panning out to be. In response to someone's earlier question, maybe we're outperforming the market. So you could have a situation where both things are true, and that's okay for us, which is maybe the market is slowing a bit and rental growth is slowing a bit. But if our portfolio is still full speed ahead, then I don't want to, like, question it. I want to go with that and do more of that and keep going and differentiate ourselves from the market. That's what you look for, I think, in top companies in any industry is that kind of differentiation. We're not bigger than the market, but we can certainly do better than the market, and I think we have and will. So I think both could be true, Nick, but we see a very good environment over the next 6 months to conduct our business and finish out our year and hit these sort of sector-leading numbers and then towards the end of the year, we're going to give you our view of '17, which I think it's a little too early because I'd like to see a few more months of jobs numbers before I even go there. Let's see June, July, August and the balance of the year and see where those jobs numbers go because if the private sector job numbers and opportunity job numbers are up and still not up as much as last year and the years prior but in the range of 50,000 new jobs plus and 50,000 plus are office-using jobs, then we're still in a good market.

We are happy to have the opportunity to review with you the results of the third quarter and provide some additional commentary on how we see things shaping up in New York City. Conti",1185,"Okay. Thank you, Matt, and thank you for dialing into the call today. We are happy to have the opportunity to review with you the results of the third quarter and provide some additional commentary on how we see things shaping up in New York City. 
Continuing a trend this year where we have outperformed many of our 2016 operating and financial goals, we had a very strong third quarter, punctuated by 1.3 million square feet of Manhattan office leases signed at a market-leading 29% mark-to-market. Once again, SL Green has demonstrated its ability to outperform on the leasing and operational front, notwithstanding any perceived or actual slowdown in the tenant market. In fact, in the first 20 days of October, we concluded 9 additional Manhattan office leases for a total of 212,000 square feet, highlighted by the 2 leases we announced this morning with Comcast and Nixon Peabody at Tower 46, and we welcome those 2 tenants to our portfolio. This brings our total Manhattan leasing production to 3 million square feet. Year-to-date, that's 50% more than we originally forecast and a 28% mark-to-market on replacement leases, which is about double what we originally projected at the beginning of the year. These accomplishments are not just market-leading. They are extraordinary by any measure and will rank among the 2 or 3 best leasing years in our 19-year history as a public company, all the more notable because we achieved these results notwithstanding additional supply from Hudson Yards, making the point that high-quality, well-located and reasonably priced office space is still in very high demand. As further evidence of that tenant demand, we have a current leasing pipeline of nearly 600,000 square feet, approximately half of which are leases pending and out for signature. So I think that shows that notwithstanding we have cleared out a substantial amount of pipeline year-to-date, we still expect to achieve a lot more over the next 2.5 months as we close out the year. 
Assuming the successful completion of these pending leases, we are looking at a rollover schedule in New York City for 2017 and '18 that averages less than 900,000 square feet per annum or just about 3% of our portfolio square footage each year. That's the lowest rollover rate in recent history. That places our portfolio and this company in an unusually excellent offensive and defensive position by allowing us to focus our efforts on those future rollover spaces as and when they come up over the next 24 months and selectively make early deals with those tenants, the ones that allow us to drive the best economics possible. 
Notwithstanding our track record at keeping our portfolio well-leased throughout market cycles, we get the inevitable question: whether we can continue to outperform the market. And I believe the answer is absolutely an unequivocably yes. While office using job growth has slowed in the second half of the year, the information sector continues to add jobs while the losses in the financial sector have been quite modest through August, even though the prevailing view is much different and inaccurate, that being significant shedding of jobs in the financial sector. The numbers simply don't back that up, and that -- those are numbers that come right from OMD [ph].
September job numbers are not out yet, but there are a few interesting points to make about the health of the city economy up and through Q2, and part of these numbers are through September. Each of the big 5 banks have reported third quarter results, financial results, and pretax earnings were up 50% year-over-year. And revenues, which were flat for Q1 and Q2 for the big 5, were up 20% year-over-year in Q3. Add to that that total New York City jobs has reached another record level this year of 4.3 million workers, driven by private sector job growth through the second quarter of 77,000 new jobs, with third quarter numbers coming out imminently. Hotel occupancies are still as strong as last year, in the high 80s percent occupancy range, and only a slight decline in ADR, the average rate, even though there was a lot of new supply being absorbed this year as a result of construction that was taking place in years past. And Airbnb continues to be a competitive force, notwithstanding hotels having an excellent year, showing that tourism in the city is still very robust and has not missed a beat as a result of Brexit or otherwise. 
So while New York's economy and job growth metrics aren't on the same pace as last year's record levels, by the way, it's something that we had forecasted to you at the beginning of the year, it is still shaping up to be a relatively good year with above-average job growth, economic performance and  leasing activity, along with below-average sublet availability of well under 2%.
We also have a positive outlook for longer-term trends in tenant demand due to the expectation that New York City will continue to benefit from nation-leading population and job growth, extremely low interest rates by any historical standard and fairly limited new contributions to office inventory over the next 5 years as compared to the total 400 million square foot inventory of office properties that currently exist in all of Manhattan. 
Today, we gathered -- I'm sorry, Tuesday. It seems like today, but it was Tuesday. We gathered for a very proud moment in this company's history as we, along with Mayor de Blasio and many other elected officials, formally broke ground on the development for One Vanderbilt, a spectacular project that will transform the skyline and establish a new blueprint for the revitalization of East Midtown. This groundbreaking event followed on the heels of our announcement recently of the $1.5 billion construction loan closing, and that was led by 5 different domestic and international banks and carries with it an up to 7-year term, which is largely unprecedented in the construction loan market. And also, on top of that, we announced the withdrawal litigation and claims against the city and the project. So a lot accomplished in the -- since our last phone call in terms of clearing the decks for continued progress on the construction of One Vanderbilt, the financing. And along with that, we continue to be on budget and on track with that project. 
Andrew and I are extremely proud of our team for these great accomplishments, and we are excited to be part of this truly historic project. We understand that investor sentiment is mixed, but we look forward to fully educating everyone at our upcoming Investor Day that Matt just spoke about as to the incredible physical attributes of the building; the compelling economics of the project given our cost basis; and the transformative effect it will have in the surrounding area, in which the majority of our invested dollars reside. 
So with that, I'm sure there are people out there that have many questions on the quarter's results. And we would like to get right into it, and field [ph] the first one, operator."

As you guys think about, especially in light of leasing activity that you have, as you think about next steps, whether it's JV or leasing -- you guys have paid off like almost $1 billion, I think, of incremental debt, so in a sense, you've shored up the balance sheet.

Or do you feel that if you get more leasing done, there's more value to be extracted when you do -- if you should bring in a JV partner?"

From day 1, I've always said we had absolute flexibility to build it out of cash flows. We go forward [ph] over the next 4 years or bring in a JV partner. So the -- I would characterize it more as an intent and desire to bring in a JV partner, which is there simply because of the feel [ph] of the project and for the significant amount of yield enhancement we can create by bringing in a JV partner, obviously, at the right time given that our cost basis in the property is low and there's a lot of execution in terms of the development in [ph] leasing, for which there's a lot of fee income that's associated with that. So I think it's always been our goal from the outset to bring in a JV partner. I think the kind of schedule we had -- I had mentioned to investors at the beginning of the year was something along the lines of toward the end of this year to start to get to what we would consider more serious discussions with investors, knowing that we had to get a few milestones behind us in order to best position our presentation of this project to shareholders. And I think we've done that. I'd say we've done it as good or better than I even could have contemplated in terms of -- we have kind of best-in-class financing. The site, if you or others on the phone haven't seen it recently, it's really exciting and, I think, very impactful to walk over to 42nd and Vanderbilt just -- and get a sense of the scope of the project and the location of the project in its direct proximity to Grand Central and just how extraordinary it will be when that building is up in 4 years. The response from the tenant community so far has been nothing short of excellent in terms of having, I would say, checked every single box that we possibility could check in what you would want to do in delivering a best-in-class office building, with an understanding that tenants in the 50,000 to 250,000 square foot range typically are not making those kind of space commitments much more than 18 to 24 months ahead of time, which, given our schedule, would put the bulk of that leasing effort sometime towards the end of '17 and into '18, I think 2018 being the kind of the sweet spot of our marketing efforts. So with that said, we are in front of -- we're having discussions with a number of different potential JV partners. The good news is we're on a path, and I feel very comfortable that we'll be able to achieve our goals. But obviously, our goals are to make sure that the deal is properly structured with the kind of partner that shares our view and vision for long-term ownership and, on an economic basis, that's equitable and fair for both parties. So I think that we're doing -- we're on track there, and we'll just see how it goes."

They look at it on the cost-per-seat basis. And what the building offers from an efficiency point of view, meaning the amount of -- the lesser amount of square footage per employee that the tenants can occupy in this building, offset because of the column-free floors, the amount of infrastructure that's already baked into the building, and the amount of amenity space that tenants house outside of their demised premises allow them to reduce their total occupancy cost per head. And I really think that as we get closer to the prime lease-up period, we're going to be converting those conversations that we're already having with prospective tenants over to leases.

[indiscernible] I think the under on that, we're doing it for the same fundamental and sound reason we would typically JV any large project for some diversification of investment opportunity. I mean, we have other uses for the capital. And if properly structured, economically, while we won't maximize aggregate profit, we should maximize aggregate return. And that's what we have always been about. That's how we've been able to drive 7.7% growth in FFO from the date -- compounded growth of FFO from the day of our IPO back in 1997. It's how we've been able to drive outsized investment past [ph] total return to shareholders and it's really how we do our business, is by balancing aggregate gain, which would drive you to retain everything, versus maximizing return on capital which leads you to do a JV. Maybe it's a partial JV, maybe it's not half, maybe it's 40% like we did with Pru in 11 Madison, maybe it's 35% or 30% or 25%, you estimate and then you don't give up much in the way of governance. But there is something between 30% and 50% where we can structure, I think, a very appropriate joint venture, introduce this product to the domestic and more weighted international community who loves to own best project, best market, best location. When you can check those 3 boxes, it's unusually you can check those 3 boxes, but when you can, there's deep demand for that product. I think it's warranted that we and prudent that we do that for diversification for return maximization. And I think that is a good course. We don't give up much by doing it. We will always own the majority of the project, whether it's 51% or more. It will have SL Green's brand on the building, and it's something that we're all going to be very, very proud of, no matter what -- anyone who have reservations at this project now is going to be standing at that ribbon-cutting in 2020, and is going to feel like a champion when we open the doors to a least successful #1 building in New York City.

And I know as much as we try to orient the thinking on this particular topic to debt to value as opposed to debt-to-EBITDA, because not all EBITDA is created the same and I think it's a distorted metric to be used when applied towards all sorts of desperate companies. Putting that aside, if you look at debt to value for those few people out there that's still look at the traditional, that definition of the leverage ratio, we are right about 35% debt to value, which I think by any measure in New York City, maybe internationally, but certainly in Manhattan, is considered to be at a very low level. So I still look at 1 out of every 10 reports, uses the words above average leverage, not exactly sure what that means. But the reality is, our leverage level, based on our assets and the equity support we have on those assets, something much closer to 35%, which -- we have to compete against people who are 50%, 60%, 70% debt to value routinely, and we do it, we do it because I like to think we have the best of class investment teams here and we're able to do it. But it's obviously not as easy to achieve the kind of growth that we do achieve using a more expensive capital than our competitors. So we just have to be that much better on the volume, that much better on the execution to make up for it, and we have but looking at it from that standpoint, not just at the EBITDA, that's where our levels reside right about now."

I'm going to give you a bit of a curveball here.

The addition to supply of new inventory in Manhattan is a good thing, whether -- I don't know how it's gotten characterized in this kind of awful thing. He didn't hear that from us, I mean that's for sure because because what that addition is a representation of a great market, because only great market can create the demand to warrant the construction of new projects and do it in a way for the vacancy levels are unchanged and they're still roughly right around 9.5%, 10%, which is where they've been for several years now and do it in a way where there's very little sublet space. And I think it's about [ph] 1.5% [ph], so historical lows, and do it in a way that's very measured. So it's not all coming on in 1 year. So when you look at the inventories we've done in-depth and we'll do again in December when we meet with a lot of you folks on the phone, I won't take you through the math now, but you basically winds your way down to sort of at most, I'll say, about 2.5 million to 2.75 million square feet per year. And when you calculate the start of the breakeven job growth to absorb that incremental square footage, it's only about 10,000 office using jobs a year. And over the past 5 years, at least the city has done 2x or 3x that. The issue is not the inventory to me, it's job growth. And we have office using job growth, then we're going to have a drop in the vacancy level, even with about a 1 -- I guess that works out to be -- no, not even to 75 basis point per year addition to inventories. We have 400 million square feet in Manhattan. And as I said earlier, we'll be adding about 2.5 million, 2.75 million square feet a year. And that's if most everything goes, not everything necessarily will go, but if everything goes. And that's a healthy market. And as evidence of that, in 2015 and '16, we competed against that and yet, we had 2 of our best years on record, last year and this year. Those are not aberrations, that's just a reflection of a market that can withstand this sort of incremental and pretty modest increase in inventory over the next few years. It's not going to be more than that, I would challenge anyone to show us the -- a calculation where it's more than about 75 [ph] basis points a year of increase. And as long as we have the job growth to offset or exceed that, we're in great shape. And even if the jobs fall below that any 1 or 2 given years, I think the effect on the vacancy rate will be de minimis. And we seem to be able to outperform within the market anyway, so even -- I think we're always going to get more than our fair share of leases. If anything, I see over the next 2 years, the issue for us is we're not going to have that much space to lease. So to kind of worry about what the effect of this incremental space delivery is going to be, a lot, much of which has been spoken for already, and represents growth out of the space that's being moved out of. And we factor that into our analysis. We don't have a lot of space so we're going to focus in hard on that space, try to get it done ahead of time, the best economics possible. If we can renew it, we're going tenant and I have no real concern that we won't be able to maintain a very high vacancy rate or a very high occupancy rate, low vacancy rate. Right now, we're 97.5% leased. I mean, that's -- I don't know if there's another company in New York that's 97.5% leased, same-store and maybe by year end [ph] it will be higher than that. So it's mostly -- we're very positive in the, what I would call the modest additions coming to market and the fact that those additions are largely almost exclusively far west side and downtown, which no matter what, are going to compete at a rental price point that is less than core midtown. And that's not in any way to disparage those markets, those were important markets for companies that want to be there and want to sacrifice certain of the amenities and locational attributes of being a midtown just -- for a lower rent price point, that's fine, but for every one that does, there's many that don't. And that's why we leased 250 leases a year in Midtown is because those 250 tenants don't want to be far from the downtown, but there are some that do, and there's room for both so I don't see an issue."

And the -- I just want to leave it with -- I don't think it's a foregone conclusion that banks are going to do poorly over the next few years or do great in the next few years. I mean we sort of take it as we see the numbers come in in terms of profitability and job growth. The banks right now are reasonably healthy. A lot of the leasing in the first half of the year was financial services driven, not just the big 5, but the financial sector, whether that will be in the case in the second half or not, we'll see. But we're not seeing, I think what you heard earlier, as any major reductions in bank space demand or putting on the space or sublet space, or anything that would raise sort of cautionary flags for us on the banks. It's a good trend that what used to be 40% of the market now is closer to 30% or 35% of the market, it's 1/3 of the market. And maybe in 3 to 5 years, will be 30% of the market because you have health care growing, education growing, the government sector is growing, information is growing, technology is growing, business services, the biggest grower. It's a dynamic market, that's the beauty of New York City, dynamic. And you have so many calls, there's so many claims on a limited amount of building inventory that it's just not easy for most tenants to lease space.

But it's a fair question.  We put that program in place because it would be imprudent not to, so we wanted to put something in place and make it meaningful so that we have a tool available to us if we see things happening within the stock that we feel are so violently dislocated that we view it as an opportunity that exceeds all other opportunities available to us at that time. So one, it could be viewed as therefore, moments in time. And then there's a second view which could be, if there continues to be sort of this systematic dislocation between private sector valuations which continue to be fairly robust and public market valuations, which I would say in general, are below that and for stocks like us, seem to be far below that, then I think you have to start looking at systematically dealing, how you approach that problem with stock buyback being one of the tools that could be used along with asset sales and dividends and special dividends and everything else. So it certainly isn't exclusive, but it's certainly something we are becoming increasingly focused on as we see a year like this year, where there's going to be $40 billion of sales probably by end of year, all of which are executed at cap rates and per square footage prices, pretty much right on top of last year's record, $60 billion or $65 billion of sales. And while the volumes have decreased, the pricing for the well located redeveloped, low positioned assets really haven't decreased, and we could see scenarios where in 2017, that demand may increase because on a relative basis, the kinds of returns those assets produce, which are anywhere between 5.5%, 6% unlevered and that might translate to 7% to 8% levered. Those are by and large, considered to be excellent core returns for great properties which justify the pricing levels which are so dramatically ahead of what the implied pricing levels are in the public securities. So I would say if they're at a prudent, if they are opportunistic and maybe, they're systematically, if this diversion doesn't seem to correct itself at some point in time, but for now, we have not executed on it at this point. And it's -- if not, I would say the current focus of us at the moment, because we have all these other what I consider, the excellent opportunities that we are taking advantage of both on One Vanderbilt, other equity investments, in leasing, in redeveloping and structure finance. We're having a robust year, but it is there and it's something that I think we are going to pay a lot of attention."

And since a lot of inventories future inventory, all of that absorption, if you will, in reduction I think is -- have to think it through but it seems like predominantly, it's not exclusive to the job growth. I think it has been there. The only reason you haven't seen it, take a whole other ratchet down in 2016 is because the office, while private sector job growth is almost 80,000 jobs this year, which may put it on pace for 100 in total, by end of the year which would make it one of those rare record or near record years. The office using a lag behind that, we may only get this year, I'm speculating, about 10,000 plus jobs, which would be, let's call it half of prior year. But as I mentioned earlier, the big 5 numbers are up and even though you can't bench everything off of that, looking more broadly at Wall Street firms, broadly defined, their profits for the year were estimated to be by the city [ph] $10 billion. In fact, through the first half of the year, there were $9 billion. And the city, we will be revising the estimates for the full year, and it's going to be well in excess of $10 billion.  So it's not to say by a long stretch that office using job growth for the balance of this year into next year couldn't pivot and be higher. But in anyway, to answer your specific question as to whether it's been translated or not, we'll do a little study for December, but I think you have seen the correlation between job growth and reduction availability, which has been fairly programmatic through '15, and has leveled off a bit in '16.

We are happy to have the opportunity to review with you the results of the third quarter and provide some additional commentary on how we see things shaping up in New York City. Conti",1183,"Okay. Thank you, Matt, and thank you for dialing into the call today. We are happy to have the opportunity to review with you the results of the third quarter and provide some additional commentary on how we see things shaping up in New York City. 
Continuing a trend this year where we have outperformed many of our 2016 operating and financial goals, we had a very strong third quarter, punctuated by 1.3 million square feet of Manhattan office leases signed at a market-leading 29% mark-to-market. Once again, SL Green has demonstrated its ability to outperform on the leasing and operational front, notwithstanding any perceived or actual slowdown in the tenant market. In fact, in the first 20 days of October, we concluded 9 additional Manhattan office leases for a total of 212,000 square feet, highlighted by the 2 leases we announced this morning with Comcast and Nixon Peabody at Tower 46, and we welcome those 2 tenants to our portfolio. This brings our total Manhattan leasing production to 3 million square feet. Year-to-date, that's 50% more than we originally forecast and a 28% mark-to-market on replacement leases, which is about double what we originally projected at the beginning of the year. These accomplishments are not just market-leading. They are extraordinary by any measure and will rank among the 2 or 3 best leasing years in our 19-year history as a public company, all the more notable because we achieved these results notwithstanding additional supply from Hudson Yards, making the point that high-quality, well-located and reasonably priced office space is still in very high demand. As further evidence of that tenant demand, we have a current leasing pipeline of nearly 600,000 square feet, approximately half of which are leases pending and out for signature. So I think that shows that notwithstanding we have cleared out a substantial amount of pipeline year-to-date, we still expect to achieve a lot more over the next 2.5 months as we close out the year. 
Assuming the successful completion of these pending leases, we are looking at a rollover schedule in New York City for 2017 and '18 that averages less than 900,000 square feet per annum or just about 3% of our portfolio square footage each year. That's the lowest rollover rate in recent history. That places our portfolio and this company in an unusually excellent offensive and defensive position by allowing us to focus our efforts on those future rollover spaces as and when they come up over the next 24 months and selectively make early deals with those tenants, the ones that allow us to drive the best economics possible. 
Notwithstanding our track record at keeping our portfolio well-leased throughout market cycles, we get the inevitable question: whether we can continue to outperform the market. And I believe the answer is absolutely an unequivocably yes. While office using job growth has slowed in the second half of the year, the information sector continues to add jobs while the losses in the financial sector have been quite modest through August, even though the prevailing view is much different and inaccurate, that being significant shedding of jobs in the financial sector. The numbers simply don't back that up, and that -- those are numbers that come right from OMB.
September job numbers are not out yet, but there are a few interesting points to make about the health of the city economy up and through Q2, and part of these numbers are through September. Each of the big 5 banks have reported third quarter results, financial results, and pretax earnings were up 50% year-over-year. And revenues, which were flat for Q1 and Q2 for the big 5, were up 20% year-over-year in Q3. Add to that that total New York City jobs has reached another record level this year of 4.3 million workers, driven by private sector job growth through the second quarter of 77,000 new jobs, with third quarter numbers coming out imminently. Hotel occupancies are still as strong as last year, in the high 80s percent occupancy range, and only a slight decline in ADR, the average rate, even though there was a lot of new supply being absorbed this year as a result of construction that was taking place in years past. And Airbnb continues to be a competitive force, notwithstanding hotels having an excellent year, showing that tourism in the city is still very robust and has not missed a beat as a result of Brexit or otherwise. 
So while New York's economy and job growth metrics aren't on the same pace as last year's record levels, by the way, it's something that we had forecasted to you at the beginning of the year, it is still shaping up to be a relatively good year with above-average job growth, economic performance and  leasing activity, along with below-average sublet availability of well under 2%.
We also have a positive outlook for longer-term trends in tenant demand due to the expectation that New York City will continue to benefit from nation-leading population and job growth, extremely low interest rates by any historical standard and fairly limited new contributions to office inventory over the next 5 years as compared to the total 400 million square foot inventory of office properties that currently exist in all of Manhattan. 
Today, we gathered -- I'm sorry, Tuesday. It seems like today, but it was Tuesday. We gathered for a very proud moment in this company's history as we, along with Mayor de Blasio and many other elected officials, formally broke ground on the development for One Vanderbilt, a spectacular project that will transform the skyline and establish a new blueprint for the revitalization of East Midtown. This groundbreaking event followed on the heels of our announcement recently of the $1.5 billion construction loan closing, and that was led by 5 different domestic and international banks and carries with it an up to 7-year term, which is largely unprecedented in the construction loan market. And also, on top of that, we announced the withdrawal litigation and claims against the city and the project. So a lot accomplished in the -- since our last phone call in terms of clearing the decks for continued progress on the construction of One Vanderbilt, the financing. And along with that, we continue to be on budget and on track with that project. 
Andrew and I are extremely proud of our team for these great accomplishments, and we are excited to be part of this truly historic project. We understand that investor sentiment is mixed, but we look forward to fully educating everyone at our upcoming Investor Day that Matt just spoke about as to the incredible physical attributes of the building; the compelling economics of the project given our cost basis; and the transformative effect it will have in the surrounding area, in which the majority of our invested dollars reside. 
So with that, I'm sure there are people out there that have many questions on the quarter's results. And we would like to get right into it, and field the first one, operator."

As you guys think about, especially in light of leasing activity that you have, as you think about next steps, whether it's JV or leasing -- you guys have paid off like almost $1 billion, I think, of incremental debt, so in a sense, you've shored up the balance sheet. Do you still feel like you need to JV it before you get substantially more leasing done? Or do you feel that if you get more leasing done, there's more value to be extracted when you do -- if you should bring in a JV partner?"

I don't think we felt or feel the need, I guess, the need to JV it. From day 1, I've always said we had absolute flexibility to build it out of cash flow as we go forward over the next 4 years or bring in a JV partner. So the -- I would characterize it more as an intent and desire to bring in a JV partner, which is there simply because of the scale of the project and for the significant amount of yield enhancement we can create by bringing in a JV partner, obviously, at the right time given that our cost basis in the property is low and there's a lot of execution in terms of the development and the leasing for which there's a lot of fee income that's associated with that. So I think it's always been our goal from the outset to bring in a JV partner. I think the kind of schedule we had -- I had mentioned to investors at the beginning of the year was something along the lines of toward the end of this year to start to get to what we would consider more serious discussions with investors, knowing that we had to get a few milestones behind us in order to best position our presentation of this project to shareholders. And I think we've done that. I'd say we've done it as good or better than I even could have contemplated in terms of -- we have kind of best-of-class financing. The site, if you or others on the phone haven't seen it recently, it's really exciting and, I think, very impactful to walk over to 42nd and Vanderbilt just -- and get a sense of the scope of the project and the location of the project in its direct proximity to Grand Central and just how extraordinary it will be when that building is up in 4 years. The response from the tenant community so far has been nothing short of excellent in terms of having, I would say, checked every single box that we possibility could check in what you would want to do in delivering a best-of-class office building, with an understanding that tenants in the 50,000 to 250,000 square foot range typically are not making those kind of space commitments much more than 18 to 24 months ahead of time, which, given our schedule, would put the bulk of that leasing effort sometime towards the end of '17 and into '18, I think 2018 being the kind of the sweet spot of our marketing efforts. So with that said, we are in front of -- we're having discussions with a number of different potential JV partners. The good news is we're on a path, and I feel very comfortable that we'll be able to achieve our goals. But obviously, our goals are to make sure that the deal is properly structured with the kind of partner that shares our view and vision for long-term ownership and, on an economic basis, that's equitable and fair for both parties. So I think that we're doing -- we're on track there, and we'll just see how it goes."

The timing, I think you got to leave to us to be the measure of when the right time to do it is. But we're not the kind of people that try to grab the last dollar. We don't warehouse space when we think rents are ticking up. It's a business. We've got a lot of other projects and investments to focus on beyond One Vanderbilt, so we don't want to let it consume us. It's as important and spectacular as it is. It's one investment, and this is a $20 billion-plus company. So we have a lot of other things we're focused on as well. And I think we'll take it in due course, and we'll time it for when it's optimal to do it. And I don't think we're going to ever look back. We never look back and say, oh, should've, could've.

I think that whether the market is robust or not, this is a unique product that offers a unique value proposition to those tenants that need the finest office product in the world. And we know that it's going to be received a warm welcome because the feedback that we get from tenants today as they evaluate the project really don't look at it on a dollars-per-square-foot basis. They look at it on the cost-per-seat basis. And what the building offers from an efficiency point of view, meaning the amount of -- the lesser amount of square footage per employee that the tenants can occupy in this building, offset because of the column-free floors, the amount of infrastructure that's already baked into the building, and the amount of amenity space that tenants house outside of their demised premises allow them to reduce their total occupancy cost per head. And I really think that as we get closer to the prime lease-up period, we're going to be converting those conversations that we're already having with prospective tenants over to leases. And just I think -- and we'll speak to it in greater detail at the Investor Conference, but the rents that we're targeting are not the high end of the -- not the highest end of the market, surprisingly enough.

It's an interesting conversation because in some of those discussions with those tenants, we point out to them, assuming they're the right profile tenant, we point out to them where their anticipated escalated rent will be upon expiration of their current leases in our portfolio, which we could speak to, obviously, knowledgeably about that, is that it puts them within $5 to $10 of what our pro forma rent is for One Vanderbilt. And then when we further point out to them the ability for them to lease less square footage because of the relative attributes of the building that I spoke about earlier, that in reality, it would translate into an occupancy savings for those tenants. So we're having those conversations. We've targeted some of those tenants, and we're out there actively getting in front of them."

We're not JV-ing it to get a few bucks to stock price. That would be criminal. You know what I'm saying? It would be outlandish to do something like that for the sole purpose of thinking the stock is going to go up or down quickly. By the way, it's almost like everything we've heard for the past 18 months about do this, stock price will do x has been completely wrong. So if anything, I would take the under on that. We're doing it for the same fundamental and sound reasons we would typically JV any large project for some diversification of investment opportunity. I mean, we have other uses for the capital. And if properly structured, economically, while we won't maximize aggregate profit, we should maximize aggregate return. And that's what we have always been about. That's how we've been able to drive 7.7% growth in FFO from the day of -- compounded growth in FFO from the day of our IPO back in 1997. It's how we've been able to drive outsized investment-class total return to shareholders, and it's really how we do our business, is by balancing aggregate gain, which would drive you to retain everything, versus maximizing return on capital, which leads you to do a JV. Maybe it's a partial JV. Maybe it's not half. Maybe it's 40%, like we did with Pru [ph] at 11 Madison. Maybe it's 35% or 30% or 25%, and then you don't give up much in the way of governance. But there is something between 30% and 50% where we can structure, I think, a very appropriate joint venture, introduce this product to the domestic and more weighted international community who loves to own best project, best market, best location. When you can check those 3 boxes, it's unusual you can check those 3 boxes, but when you can, there's deep demand for that product. I think it's warranted that we -- and prudent that we do that for diversification, for return maximization. And I think that is a good course. We don't give up much by doing it. We will always own the majority of the project, whether it's 51% or more. It will have SL Green's brand on the building, and it's something that we're all going to be very, very proud of no matter what -- anyone who has reservations about this project now is going to be standing at that ribbon-cutting in 2020 and is going to feel like a champion when we open the doors to a lease-successful #1 building in New York City. And we're going to be able to stand up there and say, which many others can't, we did it profitably, on time, on budget."

And I know as much as we've tried to orient the thinking on this particular topic to debt-to-value as opposed to debt-to-EBITDA -- because not all EBITDA is created the same, and I think it's a distorted metric to be used when applied towards all sorts of disparate companies. Putting that aside, if you look at debt-to-value, for those few people out there that still look at the traditional definition of a leverage ratio, we are right about 35% debt-to-value, which, I think, by any measure in New York City, maybe internationally, but certainly in Manhattan, is considered to be at a very low level. So I still look at -- 1 out of every 10 reports uses the words above-average leverage. I'm not exactly sure what that means. But the reality is our leverage level, based on our assets and the equity  subordination we have on those assets, something much closer to 35%, which -- we have to compete against people who are 50%, 60%, 70% debt-to-value routinely, and we do it. We do it because I like to think we have the best-of-class investment team here, and we're able to do it. But it's obviously not as easy to achieve the kind of growth that we do achieve using more expensive capital than our competitors. So we just have to be that much better on the volume, that much better on the execution to make up for it, and we have. But looking at it from that standpoint, not just at the EBITDA, that's where our levels reside right about now."

I'm going to give you a bit of a curveball here. The addition to supply of new inventory in Manhattan is a good thing, whether -- I don't know how it's gotten characterized as kind of this awful thing. You didn't hear that",841,"Well, I think there's 2 reasons. I'm going to give you a bit of a curveball here. The addition to supply of new inventory in Manhattan is a good thing, whether -- I don't know how it's gotten characterized as kind of this awful thing. You didn't hear that from us. I mean, that's for sure. Because what that addition is is a representation of a great market because only great markets can create the demand to warrant the construction of new projects and do it in a way where the vacancy levels are unchanged, still roughly right around 9.5%, 10%, which is where they've been for several years now, and do it in a way where there's very little sublet space. And I think, Steve, that's about 1.5%, if I'm not mistaken, so historical lows. And do it in a way that's very measured, so it's not all coming on in 1 year. So when you look at the inventories we've done in depth and we'll do again in December when we meet with a lot of you folks on the phone, I won't take you through the math now, but you basically wend your way down to sort of, at most, I'll say, about 2.5 million to 2.75 million square feet per year. And when you calculate the sort of the breakeven job growth to absorb that incremental square footage, it's only about 10,000 office using jobs a year. And over the past 5 years, at least the city has done 2 or 3x that. So the issue is not the inventory. To me, it's the job growth. And if we have office using job growth, then we're going to have a drop in the vacancy level, even with about a 1 -- I guess that works out to be -- no, not even to 75 basis point per year addition to inventories. We have 400 million square feet in Manhattan. And as I said earlier, we'd be adding about 2.5 million, 2.75 million square feet a year. And that's if most everything goes. Not everything necessarily will go, but if everything goes. And that's a healthy market. And as evidence of that, in 2015 and '16, we competed against that, and yet, we had 2 of our best years on record, last year and this year. Those are not aberrations. That's just a reflection of a market that can withstand this sort of incremental and pretty modest increase in inventory over the next few years. It's not going to be more than that. I would challenge anyone to show us a calculation where it's more than about 75 basis points a year of increase. And as long as we have the job growth to offset or exceed that, we're in great shape. And even if the jobs fall below that in any 1 or 2 given years, I think the effect on the vacancy rate will be de minimis. And we seem to be able to outperform within the market anyway, so even -- I think we're always going to get more than our fair share of leases. If anything, I see over the next 2 years, the issue for us is we're not going to have that much space to lease. So to kind of worry about what the effect of this incremental space delivery is going to be, a lot -- much of which has been spoken for already and represents growth out of the space that's being moved out of, and we factor that into our analysis. We don't have a lot of space, and we're going to focus in hard on that space, try to get it done ahead of time, the best economics possible. If we can't renew, we're going to re-tenant. And I have no real concern that we won't be able to maintain a very high vacancy rate -- or a very high occupancy rate, low vacancy rate. Right now, we're 97.5% leased. I mean, that's -- I don't know if there's another company in New York City that's 97.5% leased, same-store, and maybe by a year, we'll be higher than that. So it's mostly -- we're very positive in the, what I'll call, the modest additions coming to market and the fact that those additions are largely, almost exclusively, far west side and downtown, which, no matter what, are going to compete at a rental price point that is less than core Midtown. And that's not in any way to disparage those markets. Those are important markets for companies that want to be there and want to sacrifice certain of the amenities and locational attributes of being in Midtown for a lower rent price point. That's fine. But for every one that does, there's many that don't. And that's why we lease 250 leases a year in Midtown is because those 250 tenants don't want to be far away from downtown. But there are some that do, and there's room for both, so I don't see it as an issue."

That $2 million cash rent loss also flows through same-store, so you had 2 factors in our same-store for this quarter, which obviously flow through the year and will flow through the balance of the year because they also affect the fourth quarter. The lost rent from Aero was about $2 million. We also gave free rent to Omnicom over at 220 East 42nd Street as part of their recent renewal. That was about $1.2 million in the quarter and will be a slightly larger number in the fourth quarter. So we've kept our 6% same-store NOI target for the year, which is sector-leading by a lot.

When you've seen assets like 693 Fifth and many, many other assets trade at, really, core stabilized-type values with enormous valuations, we feel boldened about the inventory that we own, just difficult for us to really buy much value-add out there given the investment landscape now."

A lot of the leasing in the first half of the year was financial services-driven, not just the big 5 but the financial sector. Whether that will be the case in the second half or not, we'll see. But we're not seeing, I think what you heard earlier, any major reductions in bank space demand or putting on the space of sublet space or anything that would raise sort of cautionary flags for us on the banks. It's a good trend that what used to be 40% of the market now is closer to 30% or 35% of the market or 1/3 of the market. And maybe in 3 to 5 years, it will be 30% of the market because you have health care growing, education growing. The government sector is growing. Information is growing. Technology is growing. Business services, probably the biggest grower. So it's a dynamic market. That's the beauty of New York City, dynamic. And you have so many calls, there's so many claims on a limited amount of building inventory that it's just not easy for most tenants to lease space.

But it's a fair question. We put that program in place because, a, it would be imprudent not to, so we wanted to put something in place and make it meaningful so that we have a tool available to us if we see things happening within the stock that we feel are so violently dislocated that we view it as an opportunity that exceeds all other opportunities available to us at that time. So one, it could be viewed as there for moments in time. And then there's a second view which could be, if there continues to be sort of this systematic dislocation between private sector valuations, which continue to be fairly robust, and public market valuations, which, I would say, in general, are below that and for stocks like us seem to be far below that, then I think you have to start looking at systematically dealing -- how you approach that problem with stock buyback being one of the tools that could be used along with asset sales and dividends and special dividends and everything else. So it certainly isn't exclusive, but it's certainly something we are becoming increasingly focused on as we see a year like this year, where there's going to be $40 billion of sales probably by end of year, all of which are executed at cap rates and per-square-foot prices pretty much right on top of last year's record, $60 billion or $65 billion of sales. And while the volumes have decreased, the pricing for the well-located, redeveloped, well-positioned assets really haven't decreased, and we could see scenarios where, in 2017, that demand may increase because on a relative basis, the kinds of returns those assets produce, which are anywhere between 5.5%, 6% unlevered, and that might translate to 7% to 8% levered, those are, by and large, considered to be excellent core returns for great properties, which justify the pricing levels which are so dramatically ahead of what the implied pricing levels are in the public securities. So I would say it's there out of prudence. It's there for opportunistic, and maybe it will be there systematically if this diversion doesn't seem to correct itself at some point in time. But for now, we have not executed on it at this point. And it's not, I would say, the current focus of us at the moment because we have all these other, what I consider to be, excellent opportunities that we are taking advantage of, both in the equity, One Vanderbilt, other equity investments and leasing, in redeveloping and structured finance. So we're having a robust year, but it is there, and it's something that, I think, we are going to pay a lot of attention to."

And since a lot of the inventory is future inventory, all of that absorption, if you will, reduction, I think, is -- I have to think it through, but it seems like predominantly, it's not exclusive, to me, job growth. So I think it has been there. The only reason you haven't seen it take a whole nother ratchet down in 2016 is because the office, while private sector job growth is almost 80,000 new jobs this year, which may put it on pace for 100 total by end of year, which would make it one of those rare record or near record years, the office usually has lagged behind that. We may only get this year, I'm speculating, about 10,000-plus jobs, which would be, let's call it, half of prior year. But as I mentioned earlier, the big 5 numbers are up. And even though you can't bench everything off of that, looking more broadly at Wall Street firms, broadly defined, their profits for the year were estimated to be, by the city, $10 billion. In fact, through the first half of the year, there were $9 billion. And the city, I believe, will be revising its estimates for the full year, and it's going to be well in excess of $10 billion. So it's not to say, by a long stretch, that office using job growth for the balance of this year or into next year couldn't pivot and be higher. But anyway, to answer your specific question as to whether it's been translated or not, we'll do a little study for December. But I think you have seen the correlation between job growth and reduction in availability, which has been fairly programmatic through '15 and has leveled off a bit in '16.

Thank you, Matt, and thank you for dialing into the call today. We are happy to have the opportunity to review with you the results of the third quarter and provide some additional commentary on how we see things shaping up in New York City. 
Continuing a trend this year where we have outperformed many of our 2016 operating and financial goals, we had a very strong third quarter, punctuated by 1.3 million square feet of Manhattan office leases signed at a market-leading 29% mark-to-market. Once again, SL Green has demonstrated its ability to outperform on the leasing and operational front, notwithstanding any perceived or actual slowdown in the tenant market. In fact, in the first 20 days of October, we concluded 9 additional Manhattan office leases for a total of 212,000 square feet, highlighted by the 2 leases we announced this morning with Comcast and Nixon Peabody at Tower 46, and we welcome those 2 tenants to our portfolio. This brings our total Manhattan leasing production to 3 million square feet. Year-to-date, that's 50% more than we originally forecast and a 28% mark-to-market on replacement leases, which is about double what we originally projected at the beginning of the year. These accomplishments are not just market-leading, they are extraordinary by any measure and will rank among the 2 or 3 best leasing years in our 19-year history as a public company, all the more notable because we achieved these results notwithstanding additional supply from Hudson Yards, making the point that high-quality, well-located and reasonably-priced office space is still in very high demand. As further evidence of that tenant demand, we have a current leasing pipeline of nearly 600,000 square feet, approximately half of which are leases pending and out for signature. So I think that shows that notwithstanding we have cleared out a substantial amount of pipeline year-to-date. We still expect to achieve a lot more over the next 2.5 months as we close out the year. 
Assuming the successful completion of these pending leases, we are looking at a rollover schedule in New York City for 2017 and '18 that averages less than 900,000 square feet per annum or just about 3% of our portfolio square footage each year. That's the lowest rollover rate in recent history. That places our portfolio and this company in an unusually excellent offensive and defensive position by allowing us to focus our efforts on those future rollover spaces as and when they come up over the next 24 months and selectively make early deals with those tenants, the ones that allow us to drive the best economics possible. 
Notwithstanding our track record at keeping our portfolio well-leased throughout market cycles, we get the inevitable question: whether we can continue to outperform the market. And I believe the answer is absolutely and unequivocably yes. While office using job growth has slowed in the second half of the year, the information sector continues to add jobs while the losses in the financial sector have been quite modest through August, even though the prevailing view is much different and inaccurate; that being significant shedding of jobs in the financial sector. The numbers simply don't back that up, and that's -- those are numbers that come right from OMB.
September job numbers are not out yet, but there are a few interesting points to make about the health of the city economy up and through Q2, and part of these numbers are through September. Each of the big 5 banks have reported third quarter results, financial results, and pretax earnings were up 50% year-over-year. And revenues, which were flat for Q1 and Q2 for the big 5, were up 20% year-over-year in Q3. Add to that, that total New York City jobs has reached another record level this year of 4.3 million workers, driven by private sector job growth through the second quarter of 77,000 new jobs, with third quarter numbers coming out imminently. Hotel occupancies are still as strong as last year, in the high 80s percent occupancy range, and only a slight decline in ADR, the average rate, even though there was a lot of new supply being absorbed this year as a result of construction that was taking place in years past. And Airbnb continues to be a competitive force, notwithstanding hotels having an excellent year, showing that tourism in the city is still very robust and has not missed a beat as a result of Brexit or otherwise. 
So while New York's economy and job growth metrics aren't on the same pace as last year's record levels, by the way, it's something that we had forecasted to you at the beginning of the year, it is still shaping up to be a relatively good year with above-average job growth, economic performance and leasing activity, along with below-average sublet availability of well under 2%.
We also have a positive outlook for longer-term trends in tenant demand due to the expectation that New York City will continue to benefit from nation-leading population and job growth, extremely low interest rates by any historical standard and fairly limited new contributions to office inventory over the next 5 years as compared to the total 400 million square foot inventory of office properties that currently exist in all of Manhattan. 
Today, we gathered -- I'm sorry, Tuesday -- it seems like today, but it was Tuesday -- we gathered for a very proud moment in this company's history as we, along with Mayor de Blasio and many other elected officials, formally broke ground on the development for One Vanderbilt, a spectacular project that will transform the skyline and establish a new blueprint for the revitalization of East Midtown. This groundbreaking event followed on the heels of our announcement recently of the $1.5 billion construction loan closing, and that was led by 5 different domestic and international banks and carries with it an up to 7-year term, which is largely unprecedented in the construction loan market. And also, on top of that, we announced the withdrawal litigation and claims against the city and the project. So a lot accomplished in the -- since our last phone call in terms of clearing the decks for continued progress on the construction of One Vanderbilt, the financing. And along with that, we continue to be on budget and on track with that project. 
Andrew and I are extremely proud of our team for these great accomplishments, and we are excited to be part of this truly historic project. We understand that investor sentiment is mixed, but we look forward to fully educating everyone at our upcoming Investor Day that Matt just spoke about as to the incredible physical attributes of the building; the compelling economics of the project given our cost basis; and the transformative effect it will have in the surrounding area, in which the majority of our invested dollars reside. 
So with that, I'm sure there are people out there that have many questions on the quarter's results. And we would like to get right into it, and field the first one, operator."

As you guys think about, especially in light of the leasing activity that you have, as you think about next steps, whether it's JV or leasing -- you guys have paid off like almost $1 billion, I think, of incremental debt, so, in a sense, you've shored up the balance sheet.

Or do you feel that if you get more leasing done, there's more value to be extracted when you do -- if you should bring in a JV partner?"

I just want to clarify one thing. I don't think we felt or feel the need, just the need to JV it.

I don't think we felt or feel the need, just the need to JV it. From day 1, I've always said we had absolute flexibility to build it out of cash flow as we go forward over the next 4 years or bring in a JV partner. So the -- I would characterize it more as an intent and desire to bring in a JV partner, which is there simply because of the scale of the project and for the significant amount of yield enhancement we can create by bringing in a JV partner, obviously, at the right time given that our cost basis in the property is low and there's a lot of execution in terms of the development and the leasing for which there's a lot of fee income that's associated with that. So I think it's always been our goal from the outset to bring in a JV partner. I think the kind of schedule we had -- I had mentioned to investors at the beginning of the year was something along the lines of toward the end of this year to start to get to what we would consider more serious discussions with investors, knowing that we had to get a few milestones behind us in order to best position our presentation of this project to shareholders. And I think we've done that. I'd say we've done it as good or better than I even could have contemplated in terms of -- we have kind of best-of-class financing. The site, if you or others on the phone haven't seen it recently, it's really exciting and, I think, very impactful to walk over to 42nd and Vanderbilt just -- and get a sense of the scope of the project and the location of the project in its direct proximity to Grand Central and just how extraordinary it will be when that building is up in 4 years. The response from the tenant community so far has been nothing short of excellent in terms of having, I would say, checked every single box that we possibly could check in what you would want to do in delivering a best-of-class office building, with an understanding that tenants in the 50,000 to 250,000 square foot range typically are not making those kind of space commitments much more than 18 to 24 months ahead of time, which, given our schedule, would put the bulk of that leasing effort sometime towards the end of '17 and into '18; I think 2018 being the kind of the sweet spot of our marketing efforts. 
So with that said, we are in front of -- we're having discussions with a number of different potential JV partners. The good news is we're on a path, and I feel very comfortable that we'll be able to achieve our goals. But obviously, our goals are to make sure that the deal is properly structured with the kind of partner that shares our view and vision for long-term ownership and, on an economic basis, that's equitable and fair for both parties. So I think that we're doing -- we're on track there, and we'll just see how it goes."

I think that whether the market is robust or not, this is a unique product that offers a unique value proposition to those tenants that need the finest office product in the world. And we know that it's going to be -- receive a warm welcome because the feedback that we get from tenants today as they evaluate the project really don't look at it on a dollars-per-square-foot basis. They look at it on the cost-per-seat basis. And what the building offers from an efficiency point of view, meaning the amount of -- the lesser amount of square footage per employee that the tenants can occupy in this building, offset because of the column-free floors, the amount of infrastructure that's already baked into the building, and the amount of amenity space that tenants house outside of their demised premises, allow them to reduce their total occupancy cost per head. And I really think that as we get closer to the prime lease-up period, we're going to be converting those conversations that we're already having with prospective tenants over to leases. And just I think -- and we'll speak to it in greater detail at the Investor Conference, but the rents that we're targeting are not the high end of the -- not the highest end of the market, surprisingly enough.

It would be outlandish to do something like that for the sole purpose of thinking the stock is going to go up or down quickly [ph]. By the way, it's almost like everything we've heard for the past 18 months about do this, stock price will do x has been completely wrong. So if anything, I would take the under on that. We're doing it for the same fundamental and sound reasons we would typically JV any large project for some diversification of investment opportunity. I mean, we have other uses for the capital. And if properly structured, economically, while we won't maximize aggregate profit, we should maximize aggregate return. And that's what we have always been about. That's how we've been able to drive 7.7% growth in FFO from the day of -- compounded growth in FFO from the day of our IPO back in 1997. It's how we've been able to drive outsized investment-class total return to shareholders, and it's really how we do our business, is by balancing aggregate gain, which would drive you to retain everything, versus maximizing return on capital, which leads you to do a JV. Maybe it's a partial JV. Maybe it's not half. Maybe it's 40%, like we did with Pru at 11 Madison. Maybe it's 35% or 30% or 25%, and then you don't give up much in the way of governance. But there is something between 30% and 50% where we can structure, I think, a very appropriate joint venture, introduce this product to the domestic and more weighted international community who loves to own best project, best market, best location. When you can check those 3 boxes -- it's unusual you can check those 3 boxes. But when you can, there's deep demand for that product. I think it's warranted that we -- and prudent that we do that for diversification, for return maximization. And I think that is a good course. We don't give up much by doing it. We will always own the majority of the project, whether it's 51% or more. It will have SL Green's brand on the building, and it's something that we're all going to be very, very proud of no matter what -- anyone who has reservations about this project now is going to be standing at that ribbon-cutting in 2020 and is going to feel like a champion when we open the doors to a lease successful #1 building in New York City. And we're going to be able to stand up there and say, which many others can't, we did it profitably, on time, on budget."

And I know as much as we've tried to orient the thinking on this particular topic to debt-to-value as opposed to debt-to-EBITDA -- because not all EBITDA is created the same, and I think it's a distorted metric to be used when applied towards all sorts of disparate companies. Putting that aside, if you look at debt-to-value, for those few people out there that still look at the traditional definition of a leverage ratio, we are right about 35% debt-to-value, which, I think, by any measure in New York City, maybe internationally, but certainly in Manhattan, is considered to be at a very low level. So I still look at -- 1 out of every 10 reports uses the words above-average leverage. I'm not exactly sure what that means. But the reality is our leverage level, based on our assets and the equity  subordination we have on those assets, something much closer to 35%, which -- we have to compete against people who are 50%, 60%, 70% debt-to-value routinely, and we do it. We do it because I like to think we have the best-of-class investment team here, and we're able to do it. But it's obviously not as easy to achieve the kind of growth that we do achieve using more expensive capital than our competitors. So we just have to be that much better on the volume, that much better on the execution to make up for it, and we have. But looking at it from that standpoint, not just at the EBITDA, that's where our levels reside right about now."

I'm going to give you a bit of a curveball here. The addition to supply of new inventory in Manhattan is a good thing, whether -- I don't know how it -- it's gotten characterized as kind of this awful thing. You didn't hea",843,"Well, I think there's 2 reasons. I'm going to give you a bit of a curveball here. The addition to supply of new inventory in Manhattan is a good thing, whether -- I don't know how it -- it's gotten characterized as kind of this awful thing. You didn't hear that from us. I mean, that's for sure. Because what that addition is, is a representation of a great market because only great markets can create the demand to warrant the construction of new projects and do it in a way where the vacancy levels are unchanged, still roughly right around 9.5%, 10%, which is where they've been for several years now, and do it in a way where there's very little sublet space. And I think, Steve, that's about 1.5%, if I'm not mistaken, so historical lows. And do it in a way that's very measured, so it's not all coming on in 1 year. So when you look at the inventories we've done in depth and we'll do again in December when we meet with a lot of you folks on the phone, I won't take you through the math now, but you basically wend your way down to sort of, at most, I'll say, about 2.5 million to 2.75 million square feet per year. And when you calculate the -- sort of the breakeven job growth to absorb that incremental square footage, it's only about 10,000 office using jobs a year. And over the past 5 years, at least the city has done 2 or 3x that. 
So the issue is not the inventory, to me. It's the job growth. And if we have office using job growth, then we're going to have a drop in the vacancy level, even with about a 1 -- I guess that works out to be -- no, not even to 75 basis point per year addition to inventories. We have 400 million square feet in Manhattan. And as I said earlier, we'd be adding about 2.5 million, 2.75 million square feet a year. And that's if most everything goes. Not everything necessarily will go, but if everything goes. And that's a healthy market. And as evidence of that, in 2015 and '16 we competed against that, and yet, we had 2 of our best years on record, last year and this year. Those are not aberrations. That's just a reflection of a market that can withstand this sort of incremental and pretty modest increase in inventory over the next few years. It's not going to be more than that. I would challenge anyone to show us a calculation where it's more than about 75 basis points a year of increase. And as long as we have the job growth to offset or exceed that, we're in great shape. And even if the jobs fall below that in any 1 or 2 given years, I think the effect on the vacancy rate will be de minimis. And we seem to be able to outperform within the market anyway, so even -- I think we're always going to get more than our fair share of leases. If anything, I see over the next 2 years, the issue for us is we're not going to have that much space to lease. So to kind of worry about what the effect of this incremental space delivery is going to be, a lot -- much of which has been spoken for already and represents growth out of the space that's being moved out of, and we factor that into our analysis, we don't have a lot of space. And we're going to focus in hard on that space, try to get it done ahead of time, the best economics possible. If we can't renew, we're going to re-tenant. And I have no real concern that we won't be able to maintain a very high vacancy rate -- or a very high occupancy rate, low vacancy rate. Right now, we're 97.5% leased. I mean, that's -- I don't know if there's another company in New York City that's 97.5% leased, same-store, and maybe by year, it'll be higher than that. So it's mostly -- we're very positive in the, what I'll call, the modest additions coming to market and the fact that those additions are largely, almost exclusively, far west side and downtown, which, no matter what, are going to compete at a rental price point that is less than core Midtown. And that's not in any way to disparage those markets. Those are important markets for companies that want to be there and want to sacrifice certain of the amenities and locational attributes of being in Midtown for a lower rent price point. That's fine. But for every one that does, there's many that don't. And that's why we lease 250 leases a year in Midtown is because those 250 tenants don't want to be far away from downtown. But there are some that do, and there's room for both, so I don't see it as an issue."

So you had 2 factors in our same-store for this quarter, which obviously flow through the year and will flow through the balance of the year because they also affect the fourth quarter. The lost rent from Aero was about $2 million. We also gave free rent to Omnicom over at 220 East 42nd Street as part of their recent renewal. That was about $1.2 million in the quarter and will be a slightly larger number in the fourth quarter. So we've kept our 6% same-store NOI target for the year, which is sector-leading by a lot. We would be at 6.6% through the 9 months were it not for those couple of those anomalies. We will work hard to maintain the 6% in spite of those couple of things for the full year.

So we've also been active syndicators, which we have been in years past and are on track this year to be another active syndicator, sort of verifying the liquidity in the positions that we own, and we'd expect that to continue as well through the fourth quarter."

A lot of the leasing in the first half of the year was financial services-driven, not just the big 5 but the financial sector. Whether that will be the case in the second half or not, we'll see. But we're not seeing, I think what you heard earlier, is any major reductions in bank space demand or putting on the space of sublet space or anything that would raise sort of cautionary flags for us on the banks. It's a good trend that what used to be 40% of the market now is closer to 30% or 35% of the market, probably 1/3 of the market. And maybe in 3 to 5 years, it will be 30% of the market because you have health care growing, education growing. The government sector is growing. Information is growing. Technology is growing. Business services, probably the biggest grower. So it's a dynamic market. That's the beauty of New York City, dynamic. And you have so many calls. There's so many claims on a limited amount of building inventory that it's just not easy for most tenants to lease space. And when they can, they're relatively quick to do so.

But it's a fair question. We put that program in place because, a, it would be imprudent not to, so we wanted to put something in place and make it meaningful so that we have a tool available to us if we see things happening within the stock that we feel are so violently dislocated that we view it as an opportunity that exceeds all other opportunities available to us at that time. So one, it could be viewed as there for moments in time. And then there's a second view which could be, if there continues to be sort of this systematic dislocation between private sector valuations, which continue to be fairly robust, and public market valuations, which, I would say, in general, are below that and for stocks like us seem to be far below that, then I think you have to start looking at systematically dealing -- how you approach that problem with stock buyback being one of the tools that could be used along with asset sales and dividends and special dividends and everything else. So it certainly isn't exclusive, but it's certainly something we are becoming increasingly focused on as we see a year like this year, where there's going to be $40 billion of sales probably by end of year, all of which are executed at cap rates and per-square-foot prices pretty much right on top of last year's record, $60 billion or $65 billion of sales. And while the volumes have decreased, the pricing for the well-located, redeveloped, well-positioned assets really haven't decreased, and we could see scenarios where, in 2017, that demand may increase because on a relative basis, the kinds of returns those assets produce, which are anywhere between 5.5%, 6% unlevered, and that might translate to 7% to 8% levered, those are, by and large, considered to be excellent core returns for great properties, which justify the pricing levels which are so dramatically ahead of what the implied pricing levels are in the public securities. 
So I would say it's there out of prudence. It's there for opportunistic, and maybe it will be there systematically if this diversion doesn't seem to correct itself at some point in time. But for now, we have not executed on it at this point. And it's -- if not, I would say, the current focus of us at the moment because we have all these other, what I consider to be excellent opportunities that we are taking advantage of, both in the equity, One Vanderbilt, other equity investments and leasing, in redeveloping and structured finance. So we're having a robust year. But it is there, and it's something that, I think, we are going to pay a lot of attention to."

And since a lot of the inventory is future inventory, all of that absorption, if you will, reduction, I think, is -- I have to think it through, but it seems like predominantly, it's not exclusive, to me, job growth. So I think it has been there. The only reason you haven't seen it take a whole nother ratchet down in 2016 is because the office -- while private sector job growth is almost 80,000 new jobs this year, which may put it on pace for 100 total by end of year, which would make it one of those rare record or near-record years, the office using has lagged behind that. We may only get this year, I'm speculating, about 10,000-plus jobs, which would be, let's call it, half of a prior year. But as I mentioned earlier, the big 5 numbers are up. And even though you can't bench everything off of that, looking more broadly at Wall Street firms, broadly defined, their profits for the year were estimated to be, by the city, $10 billion. In fact, through the first half of the year, they were $9 billion. And the city, I believe, will be revising its estimates for the full year, and it's going to be well in excess of $10 billion. So it's not to say, by a long stretch, that office using job growth for the balance of this year or into next year couldn't pivot and be higher. 
But anyway, to answer your specific question as to whether it's been translated or not, we'll do a little study for December. But I think you have seen the correlation between job growth and reduction in availability, which has been fairly programmatic through '15 and has leveled off a bit in '16.

Thank you, Matt, and thank you for dialing into the call today. We are happy to have the opportunity to review with you the results of the third quarter and provide some additional commentary on how we see things shaping up in New York City. 
Continuing a trend this year where we have outperformed many of our 2016 operating and financial goals, we had a very strong third quarter, punctuated by 1.3 million square feet of Manhattan office leases signed at a market-leading 29% mark-to-market. Once again, SL Green has demonstrated its ability to outperform on the leasing and operational front, notwithstanding any perceived or actual slowdown in the tenant market. In fact, in the first 20 days of October, we concluded 9 additional Manhattan office leases for a total of 212,000 square feet, highlighted by the 2 leases we announced this morning with Comcast and Nixon Peabody at Tower 46, and we welcome those 2 tenants to our portfolio. This brings our total Manhattan leasing production to 3 million square feet. Year-to-date, that's 50% more than we originally forecast and a 28% mark-to-market on replacement leases, which is about double what we originally projected at the beginning of the year. These accomplishments are not just market-leading, they are extraordinary by any measure and will rank among the 2 or 3 best leasing years in our 19-year history as a public company, all the more notable because we achieved these results notwithstanding additional supply from Hudson Yards, making the point that high-quality, well-located and reasonably-priced office space is still in very high demand. As further evidence of that tenant demand, we have a current leasing pipeline of nearly 600,000 square feet, approximately half of which are leases pending and out for signature. So I think that shows that notwithstanding we have cleared out a substantial amount of pipeline year-to-date. We still expect to achieve a lot more over the next 2.5 months as we close out the year. 
Assuming the successful completion of these pending leases, we are looking at a rollover schedule in New York City for 2017 and '18 that averages less than 900,000 square feet per annum or just about 3% of our portfolio square footage each year. That's the lowest rollover rate in recent history. That places our portfolio and this company in an unusually excellent offensive and defensive position by allowing us to focus our efforts on those future rollover spaces as and when they come up over the next 24 months and selectively make early deals with those tenants, the ones that allow us to drive the best economics possible. 
Notwithstanding our track record at keeping our portfolio well-leased throughout market cycles, we get the inevitable question: whether we can continue to outperform the market. And I believe the answer is absolutely and unequivocably yes. While office using job growth has slowed in the second half of the year, the information sector continues to add jobs while the losses in the financial sector have been quite modest through August, even though the prevailing view is much different and inaccurate; that being significant shedding of jobs in the financial sector. The numbers simply don't back that up, and that's -- those are numbers that come right from OMB.
September job numbers are not out yet, but there are a few interesting points to make about the health of the city economy up and through Q2, and part of these numbers are through September. Each of the big 5 banks have reported third quarter results, financial results, and pretax earnings were up 50% year-over-year. And revenues, which were flat for Q1 and Q2 for the big 5, were up 20% year-over-year in Q3. Add to that, that total New York City jobs has reached another record level this year of 4.3 million workers, driven by private sector job growth through the second quarter of 77,000 new jobs, with third quarter numbers coming out imminently. Hotel occupancies are still as strong as last year, in the high 80s percent occupancy range, and only a slight decline in ADR, the average rate, even though there was a lot of new supply being absorbed this year as a result of construction that was taking place in years past. And Airbnb continues to be a competitive force, notwithstanding hotels having an excellent year, showing that tourism in the city is still very robust and has not missed a beat as a result of Brexit or otherwise. 
So while New York's economy and job growth metrics aren't on the same pace as last year's record levels, by the way, it's something that we had forecasted to you at the beginning of the year, it is still shaping up to be a relatively good year with above-average job growth, economic performance and leasing activity, along with below-average sublet availability of well under 2%.
We also have a positive outlook for longer-term trends in tenant demand due to the expectation that New York City will continue to benefit from nation-leading population and job growth, extremely low interest rates by any historical standard and fairly limited new contributions to office inventory over the next 5 years as compared to the total 400 million square foot inventory of office properties that currently exist in all of Manhattan. 
Today, we gathered -- I'm sorry, Tuesday -- it seems like today, but it was Tuesday -- we gathered for a very proud moment in this company's history as we, along with Mayor de Blasio and many other elected officials, formally broke ground on the development for One Vanderbilt, a spectacular project that will transform the skyline and establish a new blueprint for the revitalization of East Midtown. This groundbreaking event followed on the heels of our announcement recently of the $1.5 billion construction loan closing, and that was led by 5 different domestic and international banks and carries with it an up to 7-year term, which is largely unprecedented in the construction loan market. And also, on top of that, we announced the withdrawal litigation and claims against the city and the project. So a lot accomplished in the -- since our last phone call in terms of clearing the decks for continued progress on the construction of One Vanderbilt, the financing. And along with that, we continue to be on budget and on track with that project. 
Andrew and I are extremely proud of our team for these great accomplishments, and we are excited to be part of this truly historic project. We understand that investor sentiment is mixed, but we look forward to fully educating everyone at our upcoming Investor Day that Matt just spoke about as to the incredible physical attributes of the building; the compelling economics of the project given our cost basis; and the transformative effect it will have in the surrounding area, in which the majority of our invested dollars reside. 
So with that, I'm sure there are people out there that have many questions on the quarter's results. And we would like to get right into it, and field the first one, operator."

As you guys think about, especially in light of the leasing activity that you have, as you think about next steps, whether it's JV or leasing -- you guys have paid off like almost $1 billion, I think, of incremental debt, so, in a sense, you've shored up the balance sheet. Do you still feel like you need to JV it before you get substantially more leasing done? Or do you feel that if you get more leasing done, there's more value to be extracted when you do -- if you should bring in a JV partner?"

I just want to clarify one thing. I don't think we felt or feel the need, just the need to JV it. From day 1, I've always said we had absolute flexibility to build it out of cash flow as we go forward over the next 4 year",543,"Yes. It's a great question, Alex. I just want to clarify one thing. I don't think we felt or feel the need, just the need to JV it. From day 1, I've always said we had absolute flexibility to build it out of cash flow as we go forward over the next 4 years or bring in a JV partner. So the -- I would characterize it more as an intent and desire to bring in a JV partner, which is there simply because of the scale of the project and for the significant amount of yield enhancement we can create by bringing in a JV partner, obviously, at the right time given that our cost basis in the property is low and there's a lot of execution in terms of the development and the leasing for which there's a lot of fee income that's associated with that. So I think it's always been our goal from the outset to bring in a JV partner. I think the kind of schedule we had -- I had mentioned to investors at the beginning of the year was something along the lines of toward the end of this year to start to get to what we would consider more serious discussions with investors, knowing that we had to get a few milestones behind us in order to best position our presentation of this project to shareholders. And I think we've done that. I'd say we've done it as good or better than I even could have contemplated in terms of -- we have kind of best-of-class financing. The site, if you or others on the phone haven't seen it recently, it's really exciting and, I think, very impactful to walk over to 42nd and Vanderbilt just -- and get a sense of the scope of the project and the location of the project in its direct proximity to Grand Central and just how extraordinary it will be when that building is up in 4 years. The response from the tenant community so far has been nothing short of excellent in terms of having, I would say, checked every single box that we possibly could check in what you would want to do in delivering a best-of-class office building, with an understanding that tenants in the 50,000 to 250,000 square foot range typically are not making those kind of space commitments much more than 18 to 24 months ahead of time, which, given our schedule, would put the bulk of that leasing effort sometime towards the end of '17 and into '18; I think 2018 being the kind of the sweet spot of our marketing efforts. 
So with that said, we are in front of -- we're having discussions with a number of different potential JV partners. The good news is we're on a path, and I feel very comfortable that we'll be able to achieve our goals. But obviously, our goals are to make sure that the deal is properly structured with the kind of partner that shares our view and vision for long-term ownership and, on an economic basis, that's equitable and fair for both parties. So I think that we're doing -- we're on track there, and we'll just see how it goes."

We've got a lot of other projects and investments to focus on beyond One Vanderbilt, so we don't want to let it consume us. It's -- as important and spectacular as it is, it's one investment, and this is a $20 billion-plus company. So we have a lot of other things we're focused on as well.

I think that whether the market is robust or not, this is a unique product that offers a unique value proposition to those tenants that need the finest office product in the world. And we know that it's going to be -- receive a warm welcome because the feedback that we get from tenants today as they evaluate the project really don't look at it on a dollars-per-square-foot basis. They look at it on the cost-per-seat basis. And what the building offers from an efficiency point of view, meaning the amount of -- the lesser amount of square footage per employee that the tenants can occupy in this building, offset because of the column-free floors, the amount of infrastructure that's already baked into the building, and the amount of amenity space that tenants house outside of their demised premises, allow them to reduce their total occupancy cost per head. And I really think that as we get closer to the prime lease-up period, we're going to be converting those conversations that we're already having with prospective tenants over to leases. And just I think -- and we'll speak to it in greater detail at the Investor Conference, but the rents that we're targeting are not the high end of the -- not the highest end of the market, surprisingly enough.

It's how we've been able to drive outsized investment-class total return to shareholders, and it's really how we do our business, is by balancing aggregate gain, which would drive you to retain everything, versus maximizing return on capital, which leads you to do a JV. Maybe it's a partial JV. Maybe it's not half. Maybe it's 40%, like we did with Pru at 11 Madison. Maybe it's 35% or 30% or 25%, and then you don't give up much in the way of governance. But there is something between 30% and 50% where we can structure, I think, a very appropriate joint venture, introduce this product to the domestic and more weighted international community who loves to own best project, best market, best location. When you can check those 3 boxes -- it's unusual you can check those 3 boxes. But when you can, there's deep demand for that product. I think it's warranted that we -- and prudent that we do that for diversification, for return maximization. And I think that is a good course. We don't give up much by doing it. We will always own the majority of the project, whether it's 51% or more. It will have SL Green's brand on the building, and it's something that we're all going to be very, very proud of no matter what -- anyone who has reservations about this project now is going to be standing at that ribbon-cutting in 2020 and is going to feel like a champion when we open the doors to a lease successful #1 building in New York City. And we're going to be able to stand up there and say, which many others can't, we did it profitably, on time, on budget."

And I know as much as we've tried to orient the thinking on this particular topic to debt-to-value as opposed to debt-to-EBITDA -- because not all EBITDA is created the same, and I think it's a distorted metric to be used when applied towards all sorts of disparate companies. Putting that aside, if you look at debt-to-value, for those few people out there that still look at the traditional definition of a leverage ratio, we are right about 35% debt-to-value, which, I think, by any measure in New York City, maybe internationally, but certainly in Manhattan, is considered to be at a very low level. So I still look at -- 1 out of every 10 reports uses the words above-average leverage. I'm not exactly sure what that means. But the reality is our leverage level, based on our assets and the equity  subordination we have on those assets, something much closer to 35%, which -- we have to compete against people who are 50%, 60%, 70% debt-to-value routinely, and we do it. We do it because I like to think we have the best-of-class investment team here, and we're able to do it. But it's obviously not as easy to achieve the kind of growth that we do achieve using more expensive capital than our competitors. So we just have to be that much better on the volume, that much better on the execution to make up for it, and we have. But looking at it from that standpoint, not just at the EBITDA, that's where our levels reside right about now."

I'm going to give you a bit of a curveball here. The addition to supply of new inventory in Manhattan is a good thing, whether -- I don't know how it -- it's gotten characterized as kind of this awful thing. You didn't hea",843,"Well, I think there's 2 reasons. I'm going to give you a bit of a curveball here. The addition to supply of new inventory in Manhattan is a good thing, whether -- I don't know how it -- it's gotten characterized as kind of this awful thing. You didn't hear that from us. I mean, that's for sure. Because what that addition is, is a representation of a great market because only great markets can create the demand to warrant the construction of new projects and do it in a way where the vacancy levels are unchanged, still roughly right around 9.5%, 10%, which is where they've been for several years now, and do it in a way where there's very little sublet space. And I think, Steve, that's about 1.5%, if I'm not mistaken, so historical lows. And do it in a way that's very measured, so it's not all coming on in 1 year. So when you look at the inventories we've done in depth and we'll do again in December when we meet with a lot of you folks on the phone, I won't take you through the math now, but you basically wend your way down to sort of, at most, I'll say, about 2.5 million to 2.75 million square feet per year. And when you calculate the -- sort of the breakeven job growth to absorb that incremental square footage, it's only about 10,000 office using jobs a year. And over the past 5 years, at least the city has done 2 or 3x that. 
So the issue is not the inventory, to me. It's the job growth. And if we have office using job growth, then we're going to have a drop in the vacancy level, even with about a 1 -- I guess that works out to be -- no, not even to 75 basis point per year addition to inventories. We have 400 million square feet in Manhattan. And as I said earlier, we'd be adding about 2.5 million, 2.75 million square feet a year. And that's if most everything goes. Not everything necessarily will go, but if everything goes. And that's a healthy market. And as evidence of that, in 2015 and '16 we competed against that, and yet, we had 2 of our best years on record, last year and this year. Those are not aberrations. That's just a reflection of a market that can withstand this sort of incremental and pretty modest increase in inventory over the next few years. It's not going to be more than that. I would challenge anyone to show us a calculation where it's more than about 75 basis points a year of increase. And as long as we have the job growth to offset or exceed that, we're in great shape. And even if the jobs fall below that in any 1 or 2 given years, I think the effect on the vacancy rate will be de minimis. And we seem to be able to outperform within the market anyway, so even -- I think we're always going to get more than our fair share of leases. If anything, I see over the next 2 years, the issue for us is we're not going to have that much space to lease. So to kind of worry about what the effect of this incremental space delivery is going to be, a lot -- much of which has been spoken for already and represents growth out of the space that's being moved out of, and we factor that into our analysis, we don't have a lot of space. And we're going to focus in hard on that space, try to get it done ahead of time, the best economics possible. If we can't renew, we're going to re-tenant. And I have no real concern that we won't be able to maintain a very high vacancy rate -- or a very high occupancy rate, low vacancy rate. Right now, we're 97.5% leased. I mean, that's -- I don't know if there's another company in New York City that's 97.5% leased, same-store, and maybe by year, it'll be higher than that. So it's mostly -- we're very positive in the, what I'll call, the modest additions coming to market and the fact that those additions are largely, almost exclusively, far west side and downtown, which, no matter what, are going to compete at a rental price point that is less than core Midtown. And that's not in any way to disparage those markets. Those are important markets for companies that want to be there and want to sacrifice certain of the amenities and locational attributes of being in Midtown for a lower rent price point. That's fine. But for every one that does, there's many that don't. And that's why we lease 250 leases a year in Midtown is because those 250 tenants don't want to be far away from downtown. But there are some that do, and there's room for both, so I don't see it as an issue."

So you had 2 factors in our same-store for this quarter, which obviously flow through the year and will flow through the balance of the year because they also affect the fourth quarter. The lost rent from Aero was about $2 million. We also gave free rent to Omnicom over at 220 East 42nd Street as part of their recent renewal. That was about $1.2 million in the quarter and will be a slightly larger number in the fourth quarter. So we've kept our 6% same-store NOI target for the year, which is sector-leading by a lot.

So there are fewer deals, but what's interesting is the size of the deals is growing in that sector of the marketplace. And I think it's misleading to evaluate where our marketplace will be 4 years from now based upon where it's been over the past two quarters.

But we can't answer that in 60 seconds. And the -- I just want to leave it with I don't think it's a foregone conclusion that banks are going to do poorly over the next few years or do great in the next few years. I mean, we sort of take it as we see the numbers come in, in terms of profitability and job growth. The banks right now are reasonably healthy. A lot of the leasing in the first half of the year was financial services-driven, not just the big 5 but the financial sector. Whether that will be the case in the second half or not, we'll see. But we're not seeing, I think what you heard earlier, is any major reductions in bank space demand or putting on the space of sublet space or anything that would raise sort of cautionary flags for us on the banks. It's a good trend that what used to be 40% of the market now is closer to 30% or 35% of the market, probably 1/3 of the market. And maybe in 3 to 5 years, it will be 30% of the market because you have health care growing, education growing. The government sector is growing. Information is growing. Technology is growing. Business services, probably the biggest grower. So it's a dynamic market. That's the beauty of New York City, dynamic. And you have so many calls. There's so many claims on a limited amount of building inventory that it's just not easy for most tenants to lease space. And when they can, they're relatively quick to do so. And we'll see -- we will forecast how we see banks playing into that mix in December. But it's a complicated question, not that we'd do it justice on this call, but it's duly noted."

But it's a fair question. We put that program in place because, a, it would be imprudent not to, so we wanted to put something in place and make it meaningful so that we have a tool available to us if we see things happening within the stock that we feel are so violently dislocated that we view it as an opportunity that exceeds all other opportunities available to us at that time. So one, it could be viewed as there for moments in time. And then there's a second view which could be, if there continues to be sort of this systematic dislocation between private sector valuations, which continue to be fairly robust, and public market valuations, which, I would say, in general, are below that and for stocks like us seem to be far below that, then I think you have to start looking at systematically dealing -- how you approach that problem with stock buyback being one of the tools that could be used along with asset sales and dividends and special dividends and everything else. So it certainly isn't exclusive, but it's certainly something we are becoming increasingly focused on as we see a year like this year, where there's going to be $40 billion of sales probably by end of year, all of which are executed at cap rates and per-square-foot prices pretty much right on top of last year's record, $60 billion or $65 billion of sales. And while the volumes have decreased, the pricing for the well-located, redeveloped, well-positioned assets really haven't decreased, and we could see scenarios where, in 2017, that demand may increase because on a relative basis, the kinds of returns those assets produce, which are anywhere between 5.5%, 6% unlevered, and that might translate to 7% to 8% levered, those are, by and large, considered to be excellent core returns for great properties, which justify the pricing levels which are so dramatically ahead of what the implied pricing levels are in the public securities. 
So I would say it's there out of prudence. It's there for opportunistic, and maybe it will be there systematically if this diversion doesn't seem to correct itself at some point in time. But for now, we have not executed on it at this point. And it's -- if not, I would say, the current focus of us at the moment because we have all these other, what I consider to be excellent opportunities that we are taking advantage of, both in the equity, One Vanderbilt, other equity investments and leasing, in redeveloping and structured finance. So we're having a robust year. But it is there, and it's something that, I think, we are going to pay a lot of attention to."

So that's a lot of space, 400 basis points or 400 million square feet. And since a lot of the inventory is future inventory, all of that absorption, if you will, reduction, I think, is -- I have to think it through, but it seems like predominantly, it's not exclusive, to me, job growth. So I think it has been there. The only reason you haven't seen it take a whole another ratchet down in 2016 is because the office -- while private sector job growth is almost 80,000 new jobs this year, which may put it on pace for 100 total by end of year, which would make it one of those rare record or near-record years, the office using has lagged behind that. We may only get this year, I'm speculating, about 10,000-plus jobs, which would be, let's call it, half of a prior year. But as I mentioned earlier, the big 5 numbers are up. And even though you can't bench everything off of that, looking more broadly at Wall Street firms, broadly defined, their profits for the year were estimated to be, by the city, $10 billion. In fact, through the first half of the year, they were $9 billion. And the city, I believe, will be revising its estimates for the full year, and it's going to be well in excess of $10 billion. So it's not to say, by a long stretch, that office using job growth for the balance of this year or into next year couldn't pivot and be higher. 
But anyway, to answer your specific question as to whether it's been translated or not, we'll do a little study for December. But I think you have seen the correlation between job growth and reduction in availability, which has been fairly programmatic through '15 and has leveled off a bit in '16.
