Now let's review our fourth quarter 2015 results. Quarterly revenues were $1.305 billion, up 7% from the fourth quarter 1 year ago, or up 9% on a same-day, constant-currency basis. 
Income per share was $0.71, up 14% from this time last year. Cash flow from operations was $111 million in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $27 million.
We returned $27 million to our stockholders during the quarter through a $0.20 per share cash dividend. We also repurchased $1.4 million Robert Half's shares for $67 million. 
In October, our Board of Directors approved the repurchase from time-to-time of an additional 10 million shares of common stock. All told, we have 10.4 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.
Demand for our professional staffing and consulting services remained strong in the fourth quarter, fueled by a healthy U.S. job market and low unemployment in numerous professional occupations as well as a more positive economic backdrop in many of our non-U.S. markets. 
We saw year-over-year revenue growth across the board and our staffing and consulting operations, both in the United States and abroad.
This was the company's 23rd straight quarter of double-digit net income and earnings per share percentage growth on a year-over-year basis. Our unlevered return on equity was 37%.
I'll turn the call over to Keith  now for a closer look at our fourth quarter results."

As Max said, global revenues were $1.305 billion in the fourth quarter. This is up 7% from the fourth quarter 1 year ago on a reported basis and up 9% on a same-day, constant currency basis.
Fourth quarter staffing revenues were up 8% on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $892 million in the fourth quarter, up 8%. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $217 million, up 4% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 332 staffing locations worldwide, including 92 locations in 17 countries outside the U.S.
The fourth quarter had 62.3 billing days compared to 61.7 days in the fourth quarter a year ago. The current first quarter has 62.7 billing days compared to 62 days in the first quarter of last year.
Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates for our staffing lines of business on both the reported and same-day, constant-currency basis. This is further broken down by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
Currency-exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $30 million in the fourth quarter. Exchange rates also decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 3 points.
Global revenues for Protiviti were $195 million in the fourth quarter, with $164 million in revenues in the United States and $31 million in revenues outside the U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 15% year-over-year on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. revenues were up 15%, and non-U.S. revenues were up 17% from the prior year. 
Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $3 million in the fourth quarter and decreasing year-over-year reported growth rate by 2%. Protiviti and it's independently owned Member Firms served clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries.
Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations in the fourth quarter was 37.3% of applicable revenues. This is a 40 basis point improvement from the same period a year ago. The improvement relates primarily to higher pay/bill spreads. The fourth quarter of 2015 also includes $1.2 million workers' compensation and other payroll-related credits.
Fourth quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.2% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is unchanged from last year's fourth quarter. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staff gross margin improved 40 basis points versus a year ago to 43.0%.
 Fourth quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $62 million or 32% of Protiviti revenues. Gross margin 1 year ago for Protiviti was $53 million or 30.7% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 32.5% of staffing revenues in the fourth quarter versus 32.0% in last year's fourth quarter. We ended 2015 with 12,800 full-time employees in our staffing divisions, up 14% from the prior year.
SG&A costs for Protiviti were 18% of Protiviti revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 18.3% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period. We ended 2015 with 3,800 full-time Protiviti employees and contractors, up 15% from the prior year.
Operating income from our staffing operations was $117 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% from the prior year. Operating margin was 10.5%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $99 million in operating income, an increase of 5% over the prior year. 
This resulted in an operating margin of 9.9%. Operating income from our permanent placement division was $18 million in the fourth quarter, up 2% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 17.3%.
 Fourth quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $27 million, an increase of 29% from the prior year. 
This produced an operating margin of 14.0%.
At the end of the fourth quarter, accounts receivable were $705 million. Implied day sales outstanding, DSO, was 49.2 days.
Before we move to first quarter guidance, let's review the monthly revenue trends we saw in the fourth quarter and in January, all adjusted for currency.
Globally, year-over-year revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions accelerated modestly in October, then decelerated the latter part of the quarter. 
We exited the quarter with December growing 6% compared to 7% for the full fourth quarter. Revenue growth for the first 3 weeks of January was also up 6% compared to the prior year. 
Global permanent placement revenue growth rates also accelerated in October, then moderated the balance of the quarter, with December growing 8% compared to 8% for the full quarter. And in for the first 4 weeks in January, permanent placement revenues increased 7% compared to the same period last year.
This information is designed to offer a glimpse into trends we saw during the fourth quarter and in January. But, as you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time.
That said, we offer the following first quarter guidance: Revenues $1 billion 270 million to $1 billion 330 million. Income per share $0.61 to $0.67.
The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 8% on a reported basis and adjusted for currency including Protiviti and EPS growth of 10%.
Will limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on the call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

Annual revenues in 2015 crossed the $5 billion mark for the first time. We anticipate the high demand for skilled talent will remain a growth driver for us, and we have every confidence in the opportunities ahead for Protiviti. 
While the stock market has been volatile and economic uncertainty persists, the U.S. labor market remained strong, and international markets have also started to rebound. In the United States, nearly 300,000 jobs were created in December alone and 2.7 million jobs were added over the course of the year in 2015.
A number of professional occupations are near full employment, which is placing pressure on the supply of available talent and increasing our value to clients. This is particularly true in technology staffing, and we're responding with investments to capitalize on this potential. Locating hard-to-find talent is a specialty at Robert Half.
The secular demand for temporary staffing is also ongoing. The use of flexible workers matched an all-time high during the fourth quarter. Temporary employees now represent 2.06% of the U.S. workforce.
And a word about Protiviti. We continue to be pleased with our how Protiviti is performed. This is a very good business with an excellent management team. Protiviti has successfully diversified its service offerings, built a loyal and growing client base, and is seeing steady demand in all of its major consulting segments. Protiviti serves its clients in areas such as internal audit and financial advisory services, risk and compliance, and information technology consulting, among others.

The tax rate volatile as always, it was low in the fourth quarter, because we had more benefits from foreign operations than we expected, plus when Congress passed in late quarter the tax extenders, which, I guess, was the that freed up some payroll tax credits that we recognized. We would not expect those to continue to that degree into the current first quarter. So the tax rate we're using for the first quarter in 2016 is around 39%, but as you know from prior quarters, that mean somewhere between 38% and 40%. CapEx, we do expect increase our capital expenditures during 2016. The range we would give would be somewhere between $90 million and $100 million. midpoint between $95 million, that's up from $75 million in 2015, 2 or 3 things going on there. We're upgrading our IT internal infrastructure to cloud-based systems, both for our front office, client and candidate relationship management systems on the staffing side. We're converting to cloud-based HR and staff payroll system as well. Further, we continue to invest in data signs, data analytics, artificial intelligence, as it relates to identifying, matching, prioritizing, both leads, clients and candidates and then further we've got more lease expirations in '16 than in '15. And there would be more improvement cost that relate to that, but as a percent of revenue, CapEx in '16 will be a little bit higher. I think the historical average is 1.5% of revenue, and I think 2016 is going to be 1.7%, 1.8% of revenue."

But our clients did get a little more cautious, not significantly more cautious. Further, December is always a somewhat odd month, because our internal staff has had a very good year in 2015. They probably checked out a little earlier as did our client frankly. So we felt like we had a little more December effect than we would typically have, but generally speaking the fourth quarter was in line with our expectations. we were within $5 million of the midpoint of our $1.3 billion estimate. And generally speaking, our guidance for the first quarter is significantly different, so it's mostly more of the same. The fourth quarter wasn't that different from the third quarter. The first quarter guidance isn't that different than the fourth quarter. Now the tax rate swings things around, so the tax rate Q4 was low as we talked about, the tax rate Q1 goes back up. So if you look at sequential progress, one to the other, the tax rate has a big impact."

Sequentially, due to normal seasonality, Protiviti will be down. Temp gross margin year-on-year, we see 10 to 30 basis points of improvement, which, is,  principally a carryover of the higher pay/bill spreads that we've experienced through '15. SG&A year-on-year was  still be up 10, 20 basis points because of the carryover impact of the headcount  additions, but sequentially, we should be down 10 to 30 basis points, as we lever that headcount as revenues grow in the first quarter. Protiviti SG&A year-on-year, flat to up slightly as they make some infrastructure investments. They're also redoing their front office over the course of 2016. Staffing operating income flat to down slightly year-over-year for the reasons I just talked about. Protiviti up 30 to 50 basis points year-on-year, strong mid-teen topline growth, bottom line growth at least to that degree. Tax rate 39%, as I talked about earlier, which is about flat year-on-year. It's up sequentially as we discussed. Shares down 1 million or so as a flow through the buybacks that we did during the fourth quarter. We again as we've done many, many, many quarters we spend our cash flow or free cash flow or some combination of dividends and share repurchases. And then, CapEx, as we mentioned earlier, our 2016 range is $90 million to $100 million as we made the infrastructure investments, so that's all for now."

So if you look at our Q1 guidance, essentially, the extra billing day due to leap year offsets the impact of FX and you reported your currency adjusted growth rates are about the same. Orders of magnitude."

As I talked about earlier, we're simultaneously dealing with pickier clients and pickier candidates. Candidates are getting more counters offers, candidates are getting competing offers, candidates are turning down offers that our clients give them. There is an art to deciding whether to work with a candidate as to whether are tire kicker that's you're going take to the process and at the end of the day, they're going to take the job or whether there's sincerely interested. There is an art to deciding which orders to work, whether it's an impossible to fill order that  you spend a lot of time on that you never feel or is a fillable order. So there is an art to deciding which candidates, there is an art deciding which clients, but there is no question that there are candidate shortages, but we believe manageable candidate shortages with there is more exposure, there is more transparency to the candidate -- availability of candidates with social media, with the job boards, with the job aggregators, we feel like we're exposed to a larger portion of the labor market than has ever been the case, and that's certainly something we're trying to address with our technology initiatives, so that we continue to manage our way through the candidate shortage."

So Protiviti had a wonderful fourth quarter. It is true that during the fourth quarter and the financial services regulatory compliance area, they had a couple of projects that ended earlier than expected. They had 1 larger project where the client ran out a budget and delayed the project for a few weeks until the New Year when they got a new budget. So there is always going to be project variation with Protiviti. And by the way, Management Resources, which nobody has asked about, it actually did better than the expectation in the fourth quarter sequentially and year-on-year, and it's just the opposite story where again in financial services, they had some good projects come online better than expectation. So project -- project timing hurt Protiviti a little bit, project timing helped Management Resources. So it's just kind of the ebb and flow of projects that impacts those results. So there's nothing particularly shattering about Protiviti's fourth quarter sequential performance. And here again, Protiviti had a great quarter, Protiviti had a great year, they've had the toughest comps, they've grown the fastest top line and bottom line, profitability 14% for the quarter is wonderful.

Now let's review our fourth quarter 2015 results. Quarterly revenues were $1.305 billion, up 7% from the fourth quarter a year ago, or up 9% on a same-day, constant-currency basis.
Income per share was $0.71, up 14% from this time last year. Cash flow from operations was $111 million in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $27 million.
We returned $27 million to our stockholders during the quarter through a $0.20 per share cash dividend. We also repurchased $1.4 million Robert Half shares for $67 million.
In October, our Board of Directors approved the repurchase from time-to-time of an additional 10 million shares of common stock. All told, we have 10.4 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.
Demand for our professional staffing and consulting services remained strong in the fourth quarter, fueled by a healthy U.S. job market and low unemployment in numerous professional occupations as well as a more positive economic backdrop in many of our non-U.S. markets.
We saw year-over-year revenue growth across the board and our staffing and consulting operations, both in the United States and abroad.
This was the company's 23rd straight quarter of double-digit net income and earnings per share percentage growth on a year-over-year basis. Our unlevered return on equity was 37%.
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our fourth quarter results."

As Max said, global revenues were $1.305 billion in the fourth quarter. This is up 7% from the fourth quarter a year ago on a reported basis and up 9% on a same-day, constant currency basis.
Fourth quarter staffing revenues were up 8% on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $892 million in the fourth quarter, up 8%. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $217 million, up 4% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 332 staffing locations worldwide, including 92 locations in 17 countries outside the U.S.
The fourth quarter had 62.3 billing days compared to 61.7 days in the fourth quarter a year ago. The current first quarter has 62.7 billing days compared to 62 days in the first quarter of last year.
Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates for our staffing lines of business on both the reported and same-day, constant-currency basis. This is further broken down by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
Currency-exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $30 million in the fourth quarter. Exchange rates also decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 3 points.
Global revenues for Protiviti were $195 million in the fourth quarter, with $164 million in revenues in the United States and $31 million in revenues outside the U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 15% year-over-year on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. revenues were up 15%, and non-U.S. revenues were up 17% from the prior year.
Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $3 million in the fourth quarter and decreasing year-over-year reported growth rate by 2%. Protiviti and it's independently owned Member Firms served clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries.
Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations in the fourth quarter was 37.3% of applicable revenues. This is a 40-basis-point improvement from the same period a year ago. The improvement relates primarily to higher pay/bill spreads. The fourth quarter of 2015 also includes $1.2 million workers' compensation and other payroll-related credits.
Fourth quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.2% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is unchanged from last year's fourth quarter. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin improved 40 basis points versus a year ago to 43.0%.
Fourth quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $62 million or 32% of Protiviti revenues. Gross margin 1 year ago for Protiviti was $53 million or 30.7% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 32.5% of staffing revenues in the fourth quarter versus 32.0% in last year's fourth quarter. We ended 2015 with 12,800 full-time employees in our staffing divisions, up 14% from the prior year.
SG&A costs for Protiviti were 18% of Protiviti revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 18.3% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period. We ended 2015 with 3,800 full-time Protiviti employees and contractors, up 15% from the prior year.
Operating income from our staffing operations was $117 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% from the prior year. Operating margin was 10.5%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $99 million in operating income, an increase of 5% over the prior year. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.9%. Operating income for our permanent placement division was $18 million in the fourth quarter, up 2% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 17.3%.
Fourth quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $27 million, an increase of 29% from the prior year. This produced an operating margin of 14.0%.
At the end of the fourth quarter, accounts receivable were $705 million. Implied day sales outstanding, DSO, was 49.2 days.
Before we move to first quarter guidance, let's review the monthly revenue trends we saw in the fourth quarter and in January, all adjusted for currency.
Globally, year-over-year revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions accelerated modestly in October then decelerated the latter part of the quarter. 
We exited the quarter with December growing 6% compared to 7% for the full fourth quarter. Revenue growth for the first 3 weeks of January was also up 6% compared to the prior year.
Global permanent placement revenue growth rates also accelerated in October, then moderated the balance of the quarter, with December growing 8% compared to 8% for the full quarter. And in for the first 4 weeks in January, permanent placement revenues increased 7% compared to the same period last year.
This information is designed to offer a glimpse into trends we saw during the fourth quarter and in January. But as you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time.
That said, we offer the following first quarter guidance: Revenues $1,270,000,000 to $1,330,000,000. Income per share, $0.61 to $0.67.
The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 8% on a reported basis and adjusted for currency including Protiviti and EPS growth of 10%.
We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on the call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

Annual revenues in 2015 crossed the $5 billion mark for the first time. We anticipate the high demand for skilled talent will remain a growth driver for us, and we have every confidence in the opportunities ahead for Protiviti.
While the stock market has been volatile and economic uncertainty persists, the U.S. labor market remained strong, and international markets have also started to rebound. In the United States, nearly 300,000 jobs were created in December alone and 2.7 million jobs were added over the course of the year in 2015.
A number of professional occupations are near full employment, which is placing pressure on the supply of available talent and increasing our value to clients. This is particularly true in technology staffing, and we are responding with investments to capitalize on this potential. Locating hard-to-find talent is a specialty at Robert Half.
The secular demand for temporary staffing also is ongoing. The use of flexible workers matched an all-time high during the fourth quarter. Temporary employees now represent 2.06% of the U.S. workforce.
And a word about Protiviti. We continue to be pleased with how Protiviti is performed. This is a very good business with an excellent management team. Protiviti has successfully diversified its service offerings, built a loyal and growing client base, and is seeing steady demand in all of its major consulting segments. Protiviti serves its clients in areas such as internal audit and financial advisory services, risk and compliance, and information technology consulting, among others.

The tax rate, volatile as always, it was low in the fourth quarter, because we had more benefits from foreign operations than we expected, plus when Congress passed in late quarter the tax extenders, which, I guess, was the PATH Act that freed up some payroll tax credits that we recognized. We would not expect those to continue to that degree into the current first quarter. So the tax rate we're using for the first quarter and 2016 is around 39%, but as you know from prior quarters, that means somewhere between 38% and 40%. CapEx, we do expect increase to our capital expenditures during 2016. The range we would give would be somewhere between $90 million and $100 million. Midpoint would be $95 million, that's up from $75 million in 2015. Two or three things going on there. We're upgrading our IT internal infrastructure to cloud-based systems, both for our front office, client and candidate relationship management systems on the staffing side. We're converting to cloud-based HR and staff payroll system as well. Further, we continue to invest in data science, data analytics, artificial intelligence, as it relates to identifying, matching, prioritizing, both leads, clients and candidates and then further, we've got more lease expirations in '16 than in '15. And there would be more tenant improvement cost that relate to that. But as a percent of revenue, CapEx in '16 will be a little bit higher. I think the historical average is 1.5% of revenue, and I think 2016, it's going to be 1.7%, 1.8% of revenue."

But our clients did get a little more cautious, not significantly more cautious. Further, December's always a somewhat odd month because our internal staff has had a very good year in 2015. They probably checked out a little earlier as did our clients, frankly. So we felt like we had a little more December effect than we would typically have, but generally speaking, the fourth quarter was in line with our expectations. I mean, I think we were within $5 million of the midpoint of our $1.3 billion estimate. And generally speaking, our guidance for the first quarter is significantly different, so it's mostly more of the same. The fourth quarter wasn't that different from the third quarter. The first quarter guidance isn't that different than the fourth quarter. Now the tax rate swings things around. So the tax rate Q4 was low as we talked about, the tax rate Q1 goes back up.

And clearly, this recovery has been more sluggish. Outlook wise, we continue to be positive about perm. If you look at perm versus temp, last cycle, every year during the last recovery cycle, perm outgrew temp, that's no surprise. A perm takes a much bigger hit during a downturn does -- than does temp. If you look at this cycle so far, while more sluggish than past cycles, perm has also outgrown temp every year in this cycle as well. So that's not unusual. The degrees or something, I guess, we can have a discussion about. Our outlook for 2016 and our guidance for the first quarter of 2016 essentially assumes, we continue to see more sluggish growth the way we have for several quarters, and quite frankly, we're pretty proud of how we've done the last several quarters.

They had one larger project where the client ran out of budget and delayed the project for a few weeks until the New Year when they got a new budget.

And by the way, Management Resources, which nobody has asked about, it actually did better than the expectation in the fourth quarter, sequentially and year-on-year, and it's just the opposite story where, again, in financial services, they had some big projects come online better than expectation.

We believe we've got Big 4-level resources that are much more responsive and much more agile for clients given our relative sizes. So..."

Now let's review our fourth quarter 2015 results. Quarterly revenues were $1.305 billion, up 7% from the fourth quarter a year ago, or up 9% on a same-day, constant-currency basis.
Income per share was $0.71, up 14% from this time last year. Cash flow from operations was $111 million in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $27 million.
We returned $27 million to our stockholders during the quarter through a $0.20 per share cash dividend. We also repurchased $1.4 million Robert Half shares for $67 million.
In October, our Board of Directors approved the repurchase from time-to-time of an additional 10 million shares of common stock. All told, we have 10.4 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.
Demand for our professional staffing and consulting services remained strong in the fourth quarter, fueled by a healthy U.S. job market and low unemployment in numerous professional occupations as well as a more positive economic backdrop in many of our non-U.S. markets.
We saw year-over-year revenue growth across the board and our staffing and consulting operations, both in the United States and abroad.
This was the company's 23rd straight quarter of double-digit net income and earnings per share percentage growth on a year-over-year basis. Our unlevered return on equity was 37%.
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our fourth quarter results."

          Thank you. As Max said, global revenues were $1.305 billion in the fourth quarter. This is up 7% from the fourth quarter a year ago on a reported basis and up 9% on a same-day, constant currency basis.
Fourth quarter staffing revenues were up 8% on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $892 million in the fourth quarter, up 8%. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $217 million, up 4% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 332 staffing locations worldwide, including 92 locations in 17 countries outside the U.S.
The fourth quarter had 62.3 billing days compared to 61.7 days in the fourth quarter a year ago. The current first quarter has 62.7 billing days compared to 62 days in the first quarter of last year.
Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates for our staffing lines of business on both the reported and same-day, constant-currency basis. This is further broken down by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
Currency-exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $30 million in the fourth quarter. Exchange rates also decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 3 points.
Global revenues for Protiviti were $195 million in the fourth quarter, with $164 million in revenues in the United States and $31 million in revenues outside the U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 15% year-over-year on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. revenues were up 15%, and non-U.S. revenues were up 17% from the prior year.
Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $3 million in the fourth quarter and decreasing year-over-year reported growth rate by 2%. Protiviti and it's independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries.
Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations in the fourth quarter was 37.3% of applicable revenues. This is a 40-basis-point improvement from the same period a year ago. The improvement relates primarily to higher pay/bill spreads. The fourth quarter of 2015 also includes $1.2 million workers' compensation and other payroll-related credits.
Fourth quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.2% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is unchanged from last year's fourth quarter. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin improved 40 basis points versus a year ago to 43.0%.
Fourth quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $62 million or 32% of Protiviti revenues. Gross margin 1 year ago for Protiviti was $53 million or 30.7% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 32.5% of staffing revenues in the fourth quarter versus 32.0% in last year's fourth quarter. We ended 2015 with 12,800 full-time employees in our staffing divisions, up 14% from the prior year.
SG&A costs for Protiviti were 18% of Protiviti revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 18.3% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period. We ended 2015 with 3,800 full-time Protiviti employees and contractors, up 15% from the prior year.
Operating income from our staffing operations was $117 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% from the prior year. Operating margin was 10.5%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $99 million in operating income, an increase of 5% over the prior year. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.9%. Operating income for our permanent placement division was $18 million in the fourth quarter, up 2% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 17.3%.
Fourth quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $27 million, an increase of 29% from the prior year. This produced an operating margin of 14.0%.
At the end of the fourth quarter, accounts receivable were $705 million. Implied day sales outstanding, DSO, was 49.2 days.
Before we move to first quarter guidance, let's review the monthly revenue trends we saw in the fourth quarter and in January, all adjusted for currency.
Globally, year-over-year revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions accelerated modestly in October then decelerated the latter part of the quarter. 
We exited the quarter with December growing 6% compared to 7% for the full fourth quarter. Revenue growth for the first 3 weeks of January was also up 6% compared to the prior year.
Global permanent placement revenue growth rates also accelerated in October, then moderated the balance of the quarter, with December growing 8% compared to 8% for the full quarter. And in for the first 4 weeks in January, permanent placement revenues increased 7% compared to the same period last year.
This information is designed to offer a glimpse into trends we saw during the fourth quarter and in January. But as you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time.
That said, we offer the following first quarter guidance: Revenues $1,270,000,000 to $1,330,000,000. Income per share, $0.61 to $0.67.
The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 8% on a reported basis and adjusted for currency including Protiviti and EPS growth of 10%.
We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on the call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

          Thank you, Keith. We were pleased with the company's performance during the fourth quarter, and we are optimistic about our prospects. Annual revenues in 2015 crossed the $5 billion mark for the first time. We anticipate the high demand for skilled talent will remain a growth driver for us, and we have every confidence in the opportunities ahead for Protiviti.
While the stock market has been volatile and economic uncertainty persists, the U.S. labor market remained strong, and international markets have also started to rebound. In the United States, nearly 300,000 jobs were created in December alone and 2.7 million jobs were added over the course of the year in 2015.
A number of professional occupations are near full employment, which is placing pressure on the supply of available talent and increasing our value to clients. This is particularly true in technology staffing, and we are responding with investments to capitalize on this potential. Locating hard-to-find talent is a specialty at Robert Half.
The secular demand for temporary staffing also is ongoing. The use of flexible workers matched an all-time high during the fourth quarter. Temporary employees now represent 2.06% of the U.S. workforce.
And a word about Protiviti. We continue to be pleased with how Protiviti is performed. This is a very good business with an excellent management team. Protiviti has successfully diversified its service offerings, built a loyal and growing client base, and is seeing steady demand in all of its major consulting segments. Protiviti serves its clients in areas such as internal audit and financial advisory services, risk and compliance, and information technology consulting, among others. 
At this time, Keith and I would be happy to answer questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

          Sure. The tax rate, volatile as always, it was low in the fourth quarter, because we had more benefits from foreign operations than we expected, plus when Congress passed in late quarter the tax extenders, which, I guess, was the PATH Act that freed up some payroll tax credits that we recognized. We would not expect those to continue to that degree into the current first quarter. So the tax rate we're using for the first quarter and 2016 is around 39%, but as you know from prior quarters, that means somewhere between 38% and 40%. CapEx, we do expect increase to our capital expenditures during 2016. The range we would give would be somewhere between $90 million and $100 million. Midpoint would be $95 million, that's up from $75 million in 2015. Two or three things going on there. We're upgrading our IT internal infrastructure to cloud-based systems, both for our front office, client and candidate relationship management systems on the staffing side. We're converting to cloud-based HR and staff payroll system as well. Further, we continue to invest in data science, data analytics, artificial intelligence, as it relates to identifying, matching, prioritizing, both leads, clients and candidates and then further, we've got more lease expirations in '16 than in '15. And there would be more tenant improvement cost that relate to that. But as a percent of revenue, CapEx in '16 will be a little bit higher. I think the historical average is 1.5% of revenue, and I think 2016, it's going to be 1.7%, 1.8% of revenue."

But our clients did get a little more cautious, not significantly more cautious. Further, December's always a somewhat odd month because our internal staff has had a very good year in 2015. They probably checked out a little earlier as did our clients, frankly. So we felt like we had a little more December effect than we would typically have, but generally speaking, the fourth quarter was in line with our expectations. I mean, I think we were within $5 million of the midpoint of our $1.3 billion estimate. And generally speaking, our guidance for the first quarter is significantly different, so it's mostly more of the same. The fourth quarter wasn't that different from the third quarter. The first quarter guidance isn't that different than the fourth quarter. Now the tax rate swings things around. So the tax rate Q4 was low as we talked about, the tax rate Q1 goes back up.

Well, we would say the clients becoming more cautious, certainly, impacted perm. It's odd and that on the one hand, clients are still picky. Candidates are also harder to close. They're accepting counter offers, they're excepting competing offers, they're declining offers. So it's a little odd that at the same time, clients and candidates are being picky and that has the effect of increasing the days to fill or increasing the sales cycle, how ever you'd like to describe it. But the point is perm was a little bit light of what we had projected for the fourth quarter. It wasn't dramatically light. We believe that current tone of business in perm is solid, and the guidance we've given for the first quarter reflects that."

We'll then look toward the end of the first quarter as to what we do in the second quarter. But it's not that unlike 2015, where the headcount was back-end loaded and the first half of 2015, there wasn't a lot of headcount addition either. So we should have a couple of quarters where we leverage our SG&A better than what we've done intentionally the second half of 2015 by being more aggressive with the heads. I mean, it's -- frankly, it's been a few years since we added more heads than our top line grew by. I think, in rough numbers, we added 14% to our staffing headcount and our revenues were up 10%. So simple math says we front-loaded, we've added to capacity at the beginning of 2016. We'll play it by ear for the rest of the year."

          Sure. So embedded in the -- to the midpoint of our guidance, and all this is adjusted for currency and days, we see temp growth continuing to decelerate slightly. We see perm grow stable-ish, the comps helped us out there a year ago, the comps get a little easier. We see Protiviti year-on-year growth flat to down a little bit on very tough comps. Sequentially, due to normal seasonality, Protiviti will be down. Temp gross margin, year-on-year, we see 10 to 30 basis points of improvement, which is principally a carryover of the higher pay/bill spreads that we've experienced through '15. SG&A, year-on-year, will still be up 10, 20 basis points because of the carryover impact of the headcount  additions, but sequentially, we should be down 10 to 30 basis points as we lever that headcount as revenues grow in the first quarter. Protiviti SG&A, year-on-year, flat to up slightly as they make some infrastructure investments. They're also redoing their front office over the course of 2016. Staffing operating income, flat to down slightly year-over-year for the reasons I just talked about. Protiviti, up 30 to 50 basis points year-on-year, strong mid-teen topline growth, bottom line growth at least to that degree. Tax rate, 39%, as I talked about earlier, which is about flat year-on-year. It's up sequentially as we discussed. Shares down 1 million or so as a flow through the buybacks that we did during the fourth quarter. We, again, as we've done many, many, many quarters, we spend our cash flow -- our free cash flow on some combination of dividends and share repurchases. And then, CapEx, as we've mentioned earlier, our 2016 range is $90 million to $100 million as we make the infrastructure investments that I've talked about."

          Well, so first of all, let's talk about 2015. And I think we absolutely delivered everything we talked about with respect to gross margin expansion. And in fact, if you look up and down our P&L, probably the single most impressive thing that happened in 2015 is the way we expanded our gross margins led by pay/bill spreads. As we move into '16, given where our margins start from, incrementally, you shouldn't expect as much improvement in 2016 as you saw in 2015. But our conversions, as an example, are still low relative to the past at 3.2% versus a range of 3.0% to 5.0%, midpoint being 4%. We still have that upside on state unemployment rates, as the national unemployment rate goes down, as the unemployment claims that get filed against Robert Half go down, our unemployment rate as we go forward should continue to trend down, there is upside there. Let's call that another -- I don't know, at least 10 to 30 basis points depending on how aggressive you want to be. So that's still ahead of us. Just on the pay/bill spreads, we brought those a long way already. And while the environment will be conducive if there's wage inflation to us getting not only that passed through, but a little more for the house, incrementally, that won't be what it was in 2015."

Accounting, internal audit, financial services, regulatory compliance, there are also pockets of accounting and finance where there are also candidate shortages. As I talked about earlier, we're simultaneously dealing with pickier clients and pickier candidates. Candidates are getting more counter offers, candidates are getting competing offers, candidates are turning down offers that our clients give them. There's an art to deciding whether to work with a candidate as to whether they're a tire kicker that you're going take to the process and at the end of the day, they're not going to take the job or whether they're sincerely interested. There is an art to deciding which orders to work, whether it's an impossible-to-fill order that you spend a lot of time on that you can never fill or it's a fillable order. So there's an art to deciding which candidates, there's an art deciding which clients, but there's no question that there are candidate shortages, but we believe manageable candidate shortages, with there's more exposure, there's more transparency to the candidate -- availability of candidates, whatever, with social media, with the job boards, with the job aggregators. We feel like we're exposed to a larger portion of the labor market than has ever been the case, and that's certainly something we're trying to address with our technology initiatives, so that we continue to manage our way through the candidate shortage."

          Well, let's remember now that year-on-year Protiviti grew 15% on monster comps. So Protiviti had a wonderful fourth quarter. It is true that during the fourth quarter in the financial services regulatory compliance area, they had a couple of projects that ended earlier than expected. They had one larger project where the client ran out of budget and delayed the project for a few weeks until the New Year when they got a new budget. So there is always going to be project variation with Protiviti. And by the way, Management Resources, which nobody has asked about, it actually did better than the expectation in the fourth quarter, sequentially and year-on-year, and it's just the opposite story where, again, in financial services, they had some big projects come online better than expectation. So project -- project timing hurt Protiviti a little bit, project timing helped Management Resources. So it's just kind of the ebb and flow of projects that impacts those results. So there's nothing particularly earth shattering about Protiviti's fourth quarter sequential performance. And here again, Protiviti had a great quarter, Protiviti had a great year, they've had the toughest comps, they've grown the fastest top line and bottom line, profitability, 14% for the quarter is wonderful. We're at that mid-double-digit profitability level we've long talked about. We couldn't be happier with Protiviti, but there is project variability in their revenues."

It's not exactly responsive of your question, but let me just add that I was at a business meeting with a bunch of CEOs recently, and it was noted that there are over 75,000 pages in the Federal Register this year alone. I would say that the regulatory state is a great ally of Robert Half. We live in an environment where there are more and more rules and regulations and of course, we're in the business of helping people deal with those. So on a positive note, regulations can be our friend as well as our enemy.

Now let's review our fourth quarter 2015 results. Quarterly revenues were $1.305 billion, up 7% from the fourth quarter a year ago, or up 9% on a same-day, constant-currency basis.
Income per share was $0.71, up 14% from this time last year. Cash flow from operations was $111 million in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $27 million.
We returned $27 million to our stockholders during the quarter through a $0.20 per share cash dividend. We also repurchased $1.4 million Robert Half shares for $67 million.
In October, our Board of Directors approved the repurchase from time-to-time of an additional 10 million shares of common stock. All told, we have 10.4 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.
Demand for our professional staffing and consulting services remained strong in the fourth quarter, fueled by a healthy U.S. job market and low unemployment in numerous professional occupations as well as a more positive economic backdrop in many of our non-U.S. markets.
We saw year-over-year revenue growth across the board and our staffing and consulting operations, both in the United States and abroad.
This was the company's 23rd straight quarter of double-digit net income and earnings per share percentage growth on a year-over-year basis. Our unlevered return on equity was 37%.
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our fourth quarter results."

As Max said, global revenues were $1.305 billion in the fourth quarter. This is up 7% from the fourth quarter a year ago on a reported basis and up 9% on a same-day, constant currency basis.
Fourth quarter staffing revenues were up 8% on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $892 million in the fourth quarter, up 8%. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $217 million, up 4% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 332 staffing locations worldwide, including 92 locations in 17 countries outside the U.S.
The fourth quarter had 62.3 billing days compared to 61.7 days in the fourth quarter a year ago. The current first quarter has 62.7 billing days compared to 62 days in the first quarter of last year.
Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates for our staffing lines of business on both the reported and same-day, constant-currency basis. This is further broken down by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
Currency-exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $30 million in the fourth quarter. Exchange rates also decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 3 points.
Global revenues for Protiviti were $195 million in the fourth quarter, with $164 million in revenues in the United States and $31 million in revenues outside the U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 15% year-over-year on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. revenues were up 15%, and non-U.S. revenues were up 17% from the prior year.
Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $3 million in the fourth quarter and decreasing year-over-year reported growth rate by 2%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries.
Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations in the fourth quarter was 37.3% of applicable revenues. This is a 40-basis-point improvement from the same period a year ago. The improvement relates primarily to higher pay/bill spreads. The fourth quarter of 2015 also includes $1.2 million workers' compensation and other payroll-related credits.
Fourth quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.2% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is unchanged from last year's fourth quarter. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin improved 40 basis points versus a year ago to 43.0%.
Fourth quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $62 million or 32% of Protiviti revenues. Gross margin 1 year ago for Protiviti was $53 million or 30.7% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 32.5% of staffing revenues in the fourth quarter versus 32.0% in last year's fourth quarter. We ended 2015 with 12,800 full-time employees in our staffing divisions, up 14% from the prior year.
SG&A costs for Protiviti were 18% of Protiviti revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 18.3% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period. We ended 2015 with 3,800 full-time Protiviti employees and contractors, up 15% from the prior year.
Operating income from our staffing operations was $117 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% from the prior year. Operating margin was 10.5%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $99 million in operating income, an increase of 5% over the prior year. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.9%. Operating income for our permanent placement division was $18 million in the fourth quarter, up 2% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 17.3%.
Fourth quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $27 million, an increase of 29% from the prior year. This produced an operating margin of 14.0%.
At the end of the fourth quarter, accounts receivable were $705 million. Implied day sales outstanding, DSO, was 49.2 days.
Before we move to first quarter guidance, let's review the monthly revenue trends we saw in the fourth quarter and in January, all adjusted for currency.
Globally, year-over-year revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions accelerated modestly in October then decelerated the latter part of the quarter. 
We exited the quarter with December growing 6% compared to 7% for the full fourth quarter. Revenue growth for the first 3 weeks of January was also up 6% compared to the prior year.
Global permanent placement revenue growth rates also accelerated in October, then moderated the balance of the quarter, with December growing 8% compared to 8% for the full quarter. And in for the first 4 weeks in January, permanent placement revenues increased 7% compared to the same period last year.
This information is designed to offer a glimpse into trends we saw during the fourth quarter and in January. But as you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time.
That said, we offer the following first quarter guidance: Revenues $1,270,000,000 to $1,330,000,000. Income per share, $0.61 to $0.67.
The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 8% on a reported basis and adjusted for currency including Protiviti and EPS growth of 10%.
We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on the call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

Annual revenues in 2015 crossed the $5 billion mark for the first time. We anticipate the high demand for skilled talent will remain a growth driver for us, and we have every confidence in the opportunities ahead for Protiviti.
While the stock market has been volatile and economic uncertainty persists, the U.S. labor market remained strong, and international markets have also started to rebound. In the United States, nearly 300,000 jobs were created in December alone and 2.7 million jobs were added over the course of the year in 2015.
A number of professional occupations are near full employment, which is placing pressure on the supply of available talent and increasing our value to clients. This is particularly true in technology staffing, and we are responding with investments to capitalize on this potential. Locating hard-to-find talent is a specialty at Robert Half.
The secular demand for temporary staffing also is ongoing. The use of flexible workers matched an all-time high during the fourth quarter. Temporary employees now represent 2.06% of the U.S. workforce.
And a word about Protiviti. We continue to be pleased with how Protiviti is performed. This is a very good business with an excellent management team. Protiviti has successfully diversified its service offerings, built a loyal and growing client base, and is seeing steady demand in all of its major consulting segments. Protiviti serves its clients in areas such as internal audit and financial advisory services, risk and compliance, and information technology consulting, among others. 
At this time, Keith and I would be happy to answer questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

The tax rate, volatile as always, it was low in the fourth quarter, because we had more benefits from foreign operations than we expected, plus when Congress passed in late quarter the tax extenders, which, I guess, was the PATH Act that freed up some payroll tax credits that we recognized. We would not expect those to continue to that degree into the current first quarter. So the tax rate we're using for the first quarter and 2016 is around 39%, but as you know from prior quarters, that means somewhere between 38% and 40%. CapEx, we do expect increase to our capital expenditures during 2016. The range we would give would be somewhere between $90 million and $100 million. Midpoint would be $95 million, that's up from $75 million in 2015. Two or three things going on there. We're upgrading our IT internal infrastructure to cloud-based systems, both for our front office, client and candidate relationship management systems on the staffing side. We're converting to cloud-based HR and staff payroll system as well. Further, we continue to invest in data science, data analytics, artificial intelligence, as it relates to identifying, matching, prioritizing, both leads, clients and candidates and then further, we've got more lease expirations in '16 than in '15. And there would be more tenant improvement cost that relate to that. But as a percent of revenue, CapEx in '16 will be a little bit higher. I think the historical average is 1.5% of revenue, and I think 2016, it's going to be 1.7%, 1.8% of revenue."

But our clients did get a little more cautious, not significantly more cautious. Further, December's always a somewhat odd month because our internal staff has had a very good year in 2015. They probably checked out a little earlier as did our clients, frankly. So we felt like we had a little more December effect than we would typically have, but generally speaking, the fourth quarter was in line with our expectations. I mean, I think we were within $5 million of the midpoint of our $1.3 billion estimate. And generally speaking, our guidance for the first quarter is significantly different, so it's mostly more of the same. The fourth quarter wasn't that different from the third quarter. The first quarter guidance isn't that different than the fourth quarter. Now the tax rate swings things around. So the tax rate Q4 was low as we talked about, the tax rate Q1 goes back up.

SG&A, year-on-year, will still be up 10, 20 basis points because of the carryover impact of the headcount  additions, but sequentially, we should be down 10 to 30 basis points as we lever that headcount as revenues grow in the first quarter. Protiviti SG&A, year-on-year, flat to up slightly as they make some infrastructure investments. They're also redoing their front office over the course of 2016. Staffing operating income, flat to down slightly year-over-year for the reasons I just talked about. Protiviti, up 30 to 50 basis points year-on-year, strong mid-teen topline growth, bottom line growth at least to that degree.

As we move into '16, given where our margins start from, incrementally, you shouldn't expect as much improvement in 2016 as you saw in 2015. But our conversions, as an example, are still low relative to the past at 3.2% versus a range of 3.0% to 5.0%, midpoint being 4%. We still have that upside on state unemployment rates, as the national unemployment rate goes down, as the unemployment claims that get filed against Robert Half go down, our unemployment rate as we go forward should continue to trend down, there is upside there. Let's call that another -- I don't know, at least 10 to 30 basis points depending on how aggressive you want to be. So that's still ahead of us. Just on the pay/bill spreads, we brought those a long way already. And while the environment will be conducive if there's wage inflation to us getting not only that passed through, but a little more for the house, incrementally, that won't be what it was in 2015."

Accounting, internal audit, financial services, regulatory compliance, there are also pockets of accounting and finance where there are also candidate shortages. As I talked about earlier, we're simultaneously dealing with pickier clients and pickier candidates. Candidates are getting more counter offers, candidates are getting competing offers, candidates are turning down offers that our clients give them. There's an art to deciding whether to work with a candidate as to whether they're a tire kicker that you're going take to the process and at the end of the day, they're not going to take the job or whether they're sincerely interested. There is an art to deciding which orders to work, whether it's an impossible-to-fill order that you spend a lot of time on that you can never fill or it's a fillable order. So there's an art to deciding which candidates, there's an art deciding which clients, but there's no question that there are candidate shortages, but we believe manageable candidate shortages, with there's more exposure, there's more transparency to the candidate -- availability of candidates, whatever, with social media, with the job boards, with the job aggregators. We feel like we're exposed to a larger portion of the labor market than has ever been the case, and that's certainly something we're trying to address with our technology initiatives, so that we continue to manage our way through the candidate shortage."

So Protiviti had a wonderful fourth quarter. It is true that during the fourth quarter in the financial services regulatory compliance area, they had a couple of projects that ended earlier than expected. They had one larger project where the client ran out of budget and delayed the project for a few weeks until the New Year when they got a new budget. So there is always going to be project variation with Protiviti. And by the way, Management Resources, which nobody has asked about, it actually did better than the expectation in the fourth quarter, sequentially and year-on-year, and it's just the opposite story where, again, in financial services, they had some big projects come online better than expectation. So project -- project timing hurt Protiviti a little bit, project timing helped Management Resources. So it's just kind of the ebb and flow of projects that impacts those results. So there's nothing particularly earth shattering about Protiviti's fourth quarter sequential performance. And here again, Protiviti had a great quarter, Protiviti had a great year, they've had the toughest comps, they've grown the fastest top line and bottom line, profitability, 14% for the quarter is wonderful. We're at that mid-double-digit profitability level we've long talked about. We couldn't be happier with Protiviti, but there is project variability in their revenues."

Now let's review our fourth quarter 2015 results. Quarterly revenues were $1.305 billion, up 7% from the fourth quarter 1 year ago or up 9% on a same-day, constant currency basis.
Income per share was $0.71, up 14% from this time last year. Cash flow from operations was $111 million in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $27 million.
We returned $27 million to our stockholders during the quarter through a $0.20 per share cash dividend. We also repurchased 1.4 million Robert Half shares for $67 million.
In October, our Board of Directors approved the repurchase from time-to-time of an additional 10 million shares of common stock. All told, we have 10.4 million shares available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.
Demand for our professional staffing and consulting services remained strong in the fourth quarter, fueled by a healthy U.S. job market and low unemployment in numerous professional occupations as well as a more positive economic backdrop in many of our non-U.S. markets.
We saw year-over-year revenue growth across-the-board in our staffing and consulting operations, both in the United States and abroad.
This was the company's 23rd straight quarter of double-digit net income and earnings per share percentage growth on a year-over-year basis. Our unlevered return on equity was 37%.
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our fourth quarter results."

As Max said, global revenues were $1.305 billion in the fourth quarter. This is up 7% from the fourth quarter 1 year ago on a reported basis and up 9% on a same-day, constant currency basis.
Fourth quarter staffing revenues were up 8% on a same-day, constant currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $892 million in the fourth quarter, up 8%. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $217 million, up 4% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 332 staffing locations worldwide, including 92 locations in 17 countries outside the U.S.
The fourth quarter had 62.3 billing days compared to 61.7 days in the fourth quarter a year ago. The current first quarter has 62.7 billing days compared to 62 days in the first quarter of last year.
Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates for our staffing lines of business on both a reported and same-day, constant currency basis. This is further broken down by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
Currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $30 million in the fourth quarter. Exchange rates also decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 3 points.
Global revenues for Protiviti were $195 million in the fourth quarter, with $164 million in revenues in the United States and $31 million in revenues outside the U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 15% year-over-year on a same-day, constant currency basis. U.S. revenues were up 15%, and non-U.S. revenues were up 17% from the prior year.
Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $3 million in the fourth quarter and decreasing year-over-year reported growth rate by 2%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries.
Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations in the fourth quarter was 37.3% of applicable revenues. This is a 40 basis point improvement from the same period a year ago. The improvement relates primarily to higher pay/bill spreads. The fourth quarter of 2015 also includes a $1.2 million workers' compensation and other payroll-related credits.
Fourth quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.2% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is unchanged from last year's fourth quarter. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin improved 40 basis points versus a year ago to 43.0%.
Fourth quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $62 million or 32% of Protiviti revenues. Gross margin 1 year ago for Protiviti was $53 million or 30.7% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 32.5% of staffing revenues in the fourth quarter versus 32.0% in last year's fourth quarter. We ended 2015 with 12,800 full-time employees in our staffing divisions, up 14% from the prior year.
SG&A costs for Protiviti were 18% of Protiviti revenues in the fourth quarter compared to 18.3% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period. We ended 2015 with 3,800 full-time Protiviti employees and contractors, up 15% from the prior year.
Operating income from our staffing operations was $117 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% from the prior year. Operating margin was 10.5%. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $99 million in operating income, an increase of 5% over the prior year. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.9%. Operating income for our permanent placement division was $18 million in the fourth quarter, up 2% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 17.3%.
Fourth quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $27 million, an increase of 29% from the prior year. This produced an operating margin of 14.0%.
At the end of the fourth quarter, accounts receivable were $705 million. Implied days sales outstanding, DSO, was 49.2 days.
Before we move to first quarter guidance, let's review the monthly revenue trends we saw in the fourth quarter and in January, all adjusted for currency.
Globally, year-over-year revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions accelerated modestly in October then decelerated the latter part of the quarter. 
We exited the quarter with December growing 6% compared to 7% for the full fourth quarter. Revenue growth for the first 3 weeks of January was also up 6% compared to the prior year.
Global permanent placement revenue growth rates also accelerated in October, then moderated the balance of the quarter, with December growing 8% compared to 8% for the full quarter. And then for the first 4 weeks in January, permanent placement revenues increased 7% compared to the same period last year.
This information is designed to offer a glimpse into trends we saw during the fourth quarter and in January. But as you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time.
That said, we offer the following first quarter guidance: Revenues $1,270,000,000 to $1,330,000,000; income per share, $0.61 to $0.67.
The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 8% on a reported basis and adjusted for currency including Protiviti and EPS growth of 10%.
We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on the call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.

Annual revenues in 2015 crossed the $5 billion mark for the first time. We anticipate the high demand for skilled talent will remain a growth driver for us, and we have every confidence in the opportunities ahead for Protiviti.
While the stock market has been volatile and economic uncertainty persists, the U.S. labor market remained strong, and international markets have also started to rebound. In the United States, nearly 300,000 jobs were created in December alone and 2.7 million jobs were added over the course of the year in 2015.
A number of professional occupations are near full employment, which is placing pressure on the supply of available talent and increasing our value to clients. This is particularly true in technology staffing, and we are responding with investments to capitalize on this potential. Locating hard-to-find talent is a specialty at Robert Half.
The secular demand for temporary staffing also is ongoing. The use of flexible workers matched an all-time high during the fourth quarter. Temporary employees now represent 2.06% of the U.S. workforce.
And a word about Protiviti. We continue to be pleased with how Protiviti is performing. This is a very good business with an excellent management team. Protiviti has successfully diversified its service offerings, built a loyal and growing client base and is seeing steady demand in all of its major consulting segments. Protiviti serves its clients in areas such as internal audit and financial advisory services, risk and compliance, and information technology consulting, among others. 
At this time, Keith and I would be happy to answer questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

The tax rate, volatile as always. It was low in the fourth quarter because we had more benefits from foreign operations than we expected, plus when Congress passed in late quarter the tax extenders, which I guess was the PATH Act, that freed up some payroll tax credits that we recognized. We would not expect those to continue to that degree into the current first quarter. So the tax rate we're using for the first quarter and 2016 is around 39%, but as you know from prior quarters, that means somewhere between 38% and 40%. CapEx, we do expect to increase our capital expenditures during 2016. The range we would give would be somewhere between $90 million and $100 million. Midpoint would be $95 million. That's up from $75 million in 2015. 2 or 3 things going on there. We're upgrading our IT internal infrastructure to cloud-based systems, both for our front office, client and candidate relationship management systems on the staffing side. We're converting to a cloud-based HR and staff payroll system as well. Further, we continue to invest in data science, data analytics, artificial intelligence, as it relates to identifying, matching, prioritizing, both leads, clients and candidates. And then further, we've got more lease expirations in '16 than in '15, and there would be more tenant improvement cost that relate to that. But as a percent of revenue, CapEx in '16 will be a little bit higher. I think the historical average is 1.5% of revenue, and I think 2016, it's going to be 1.7%, 1.8% of revenue."

They probably checked out a little earlier as did our clients, frankly. So we felt like we had a little more December effect than we would typically have. But generally speaking, the fourth quarter was in line with our expectations. I mean, I think we were within $5 million of the midpoint of our $1.3 billion estimate. And generally speaking, our guidance for the first quarter isn't significantly different, so it's mostly more of the same. The fourth quarter wasn't that different from the third quarter. The first quarter guidance isn't that different than the fourth quarter. Now the tax rate swings things around. So the tax rate Q4 was low as we talked about, the tax rate Q1 goes back up.

And I think we absolutely delivered everything we talked about with respect to gross margin expansion.

But our conversions, as an example, are still low relative to the past at 3.2% versus a range of 3.0% to 5.0%, midpoint being 4%. We still have that upside on state unemployment rates.

It is true that during the fourth quarter in the financial services regulatory compliance area, they had a couple of projects that ended earlier than expected. They had one larger project where the client ran out of budget and delayed the project for a few weeks until the new year when they got a new budget.

And by the way, Management Resources, which nobody has asked about, it actually did better than the expectation in the fourth quarter, sequentially and year-on-year. And it's just the opposite story where, again in financial services, they had some big projects come online better than expectation.

We're at that mid-double-digit profitability level we've long talked about. We couldn't be happier with Protiviti, but there is project variability in their revenues."

Now let's review first quarter 2016 results. Quarterly revenues were $1.303 billion, up 8% from the first quarter 1-year ago. Income per share was $0.64, up 10% from this time last year. 
Cash flow from operations was $79 million in the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $19 million. 
In February, we increased the quarterly cash dividend from $0.20 to $0.22 per share. This is the 11th consecutive year we've increased the dividend amount. The dividend was paid to shareholders on March 15 for a total cash outlay of $29 million. 
We also repurchased 700,000 Robert Half's shares during the first quarter at a cost of $29 million. We have 9.7 million shares still available for repurchase under our board authorized stock repurchase plan. 
The U.S. job market remained solid in the first quarter as the demand for our professional staffing and the consulting services, resulting in year-over-year revenue growth in all lines of business. 
Our accounting and finance staffing divisions had a particularly strong first quarter. This was the company's 24th straight quarter  of double-digit earnings per share percentage growth on a year-over-year basis. 
Our unlevered  return on equity was 33%. 
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our first quarter results."

first quarter staffing  revenues were up 7% on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $900 million in the first quarter, up 9%. 
Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $215 million, up 4% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. 
We have 330 staffing  locations worldwide, including 90 locations in 17 countries outside the United States. 
The first quarter had 62.7 billing days compared to 62.0 days in the first quarter 1-year ago. 
The difference in billing days had the effect of increasing by 1% of the reported year-over-year revenue growth rate for the quarter. 
The current second quarter has 63.9 billing days compared to 63.2 days in the second quarter of last year. 
Currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing  revenues by $11 million in the first quarter. 
Exchange rates decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 1%. 
Global revenues for Protiviti were $187 million in the first quarter, with $158 million in revenues in the United States and $29 million in revenues outside the U.S. 
Protiviti revenues were up 14% year-over-year on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. revenues were up 15%, and non-U.S. revenues were up 8% from the prior year. 
Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the first quarter and decreasing year-over-year reported growth rate by 1%. 
Protiviti and it's independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries. Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and a same-day, constant-currency basis. This data is further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. 
This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations. 
Now let's talk about gross margin. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing  operations in the first quarter was 37.1% of applicable revenues. This is a 10 basis point improvement from the same period 1-year ago, as higher pay/bill spreads offset lower temp-to-hire conversion revenues. 
First quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.5% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is up slightly from last year's 9.4%. 
Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall, staffing gross margin improved by 20 basis points versus a year ago to 43.1%. 
First quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $51 million or 27.4% of Protiviti revenues. Gross margin 1-year ago for Protiviti was $47 million or 28.8% of Protiviti revenues. 
Staffing  SG&A costs were 32.4% of staffing revenues in the first quarter versus 32.2% in last year's first quarter. SG&A costs for Protiviti were 19.6% of Protiviti revenues in the first quarter compared to 18.8% of Protiviti revenues in the year-ago period. 
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $119 million in the first quarter, up 7% from the prior year. 
Operating margin was 10.7%, the same as the prior year. 
Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $98 million in operating income, an increase of 5% over the prior year.  This resulted in an operating margin of 9.7%. 
Operating income for our permanent placement division was $21 million in the first quarter, up 13% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 20.2%. 
First quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $15 million, a decrease of 11% from the prior year. This produced an operating margin of 7.8%. 
At the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable were $734 million. Implied day sales outstanding, DSO, was 51.3 days. 
Now turning into guidance. Before I return to guidance, first review the monthly revenue trends, we saw in the first quarter and so far in April, all adjusted for currency. Globally, year-over-year revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions decelerated slightly during the quarter, and we exited the quarter with March revenues growing 6.3% compared to 6.7% for the full quarter. 
Revenue growth for our staffing and consulting services in the first 2 weeks of April was up 5.5% compared to the prior year. Global permanent placement revenue growth rates accelerated during the first part of the quarter, then moderated thereafter with March revenues growing 1.5% compared to 8.6% for the full quarter. 
For the first 3 weeks in April, permanent placement revenues were flat compared to the same period last year. This information is designed to offer a glimpse into trends we saw during the quarter and in April, but as you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time. 
With that said, we offer the following second quarter guidance. Revenues 1 billion 325 million to 1 billion 385 million. Income per share $0.70 to $0.76. The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 6% on a reported basis and adjusted for currency including Protiviti and EPS growth of 8%. 
We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

We were pleased with the company's performance during the first quarter. Our results were boosted by still low U.S. unemployment in numerous professional occupations and stronger labor markets and key international locations. The number of U.S. job openings has exceeded the number of hires since February 2015 according to the most recent job openings and Labor Turnover Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The competition for skill talent is intense, multiple  offers and counteroffers are common for high demand candidates, particularly in taking of the accounting. Internationally, we see higher demand for professional level talent in a number of markets, notwithstanding the economic headwinds that persist outside the United States.
We feel we will continue to benefit from a widening skills gap in a number of our professional specialty areas. Employers that are struggling to find needed talent are recognizing the flexible staffing can help them manage total labor costs and also increase the pool of potential full-time talent through temporary to hire arrangements. 
Turning to Protiviti. We were pleased with Protiviti's performance during the quarter, including once again reporting double-digit revenue growth on a year-over-year basis. Protiviti has an excellent growth outlook based on multiple factors favorably influencing service demand. 
These include a robust regulatory environment and increased need for stronger internal controls and data security measures, among others.

That the sales cycle furniture  as we've talked about before. Candidates have many options with their current employer, with other employers, that makes them harder to close, that also lengthens the sales cycle. So generally speaking across our divisions, less so accounting with the financing ones, but the sales cycle has elongated, which has impacted our growth rates and is expected to impact our growth rates into the second quarter. Compared to prior cycles, it usually gets white hot for candidates such that clients will very quickly take any candidate that's close and the current environment is nowhere near that environment. So to the extent in prior cycles, late stage has been indicated by this white hot hyper demand where permanent placement growth at very high double-digit rates, that hasn't happened. And notwithstanding the fact it were in year 7 or whatever of this cycle, we still don't see that type of hyper demand that we would typically see late cycle, but instead, we continue to slug it out in this relatively sluggish macro environment. We saw that again in the first quarter. Our guidance anticipates more of same in the second quarter. With respect to our RH Technology and perm, I would say those trends were particularly evident in both of those divisions. While it's true that Tech's year-over-year growth rate slowed from 10% to 6%, if you look at year ago comps, they've got harder from 12% to 19%. So given the tougher comps, the deceleration in the growth wasn't totally unexpected. Perm did fine in the beginning of the quarter as we said. It decelerated late. That deceleration continued into the first part of this quarter. That said, we all know from experience that those are short periods of time. They were disproportionately impacted in the post quarter start by our non-U.S. operations. But on balance, the guidance we're giving is that the economy will continue to chug along at a slow rate. The sales cycle has elongated. It's taken longer to close deals. That includes Perm, that includes Tech and therefore, our growth rates have slowed modestly."

Throughout 14% on comps, that had grown 26% in the year-ago period. That said, on the cost side, there have been many investment hires on the site to expand their practice, both in the U.S. and abroad. January 1 is the date for the annual raises for their entire practice. The raises due to the competitiveness of the market were higher this year than they were in years past. So the combination of those 2, their direct costs were up 17%. On the revenues, they were up 14%. Clearly, some of those costs are front loaded for the full year. We expect to leverage those as we progress through the year. We would also observe that in the financial services regulatory consulting practice, we had some projects again that were delayed and deferred. On a few new projects, the rates were lower than they had been in the past, as clients get little more cost conscious. The regulatory practice for many quarters in the row has had absolute hyper growth. In this quarter, it went from hyper growth to fantastic growth. It shapes a really good, but it was slightly slower this quarter than we expected frankly. And to the extent, it was a little light relative to our plan. All of that lightness dropped all the way to the bottom line. So notwithstanding, very robust revenue growth. Our margins declined year-over-year as you noted. As we move into the year, for the second quarter, we expect Protiviti to still have growth in the low to mid-teens. Again, that's on very tough comps a year ago, which were up 23%. We think the margins will grow nicely sequentially, but the margins will still be slightly below last year level. That said, we do expect to get back into double-digit percentage operating margins, which is certainly going in the right direction. Demand for Protiviti services remain strong. The pipeline remain strong. It had a very good quarter. It certainly has been aggressive adding to capacity. It will now leverage that capacity over the rest of the year, and the margins will improve. It's our fastest growing division. It's been our fastest growing division for several quarters running. We're very pleased with Protiviti."

In Accountemps, it's a shift from accounts payable, accounts receivable payroll to staff and senior accountants and to business analysts. In Management Resources, it's a shift to more accounting managers, more controllers, more senior analysts. So the net of that is the assignments are a little longer. There is a little less candidate turnover.

So by segment, I would say, without getting totally granular, generally speaking, we would expect Accountemps and Management Resources to have higher growth rates than the other staffing divisions. We've already talked about Protiviti. At the gross margin line, our guidance contemplates a contraction of 10 to 20 basis points for temp gross margin. However, that's because we have not considered any additional workers compensation credit. That we've got a year ago, that a year ago, was 20 basis points. So with no consideration of a workers compensation credit this quarter, we're talking about temp down 10 to 20 basis points. If you figure, we get our workers compensation credit, which we have a third-party review and we just don't know. Although for many quarters, we have gotten one, then we wouldn't have that contraction. On the staffing SG&A side, we believe we'll start to leverage the headcount investments we made in the second half of last year, because we're holding those pretty much constant in the quarter just ended as well as the second quarter ahead as we've talked about in the past. So that we should get 10 to 20 basis points of year-over-year SG&A leverage. So again in the absence of any workers comp credit, our staffing operating income percentage would be down 30 to 40 basis points year-over-year. Half of that would be workers comp. A piece of the balance of that would be expected less perm mix than we had a year ago. The second quarter is always a strong perm quarter, and you get a nice lift sequentially. We got a really nice lift a year ago. We're expecting a lift this quarter, but not as much lift as we had a year ago. We talked about Protiviti. Year-on-year will be down a point or 2 operating margin wise, but that will be up sequentially versus what we just reported. Tax rate, we just talked about. Share count would be down half a million shares or so, as they flow through of what we bought in the first quarter. So at a high level, we see a couple of points of top line deceleration, as we go into the second quarter. We hope we're being conservative, but with the -- when people start talking about Q1 GDP growth being sub 1%, we thought it prudent to be conservative. And frankly, our start in April is a little stronger than the fourth quarter guidance that we've given, but it's not a lot stronger."

Now let's review first quarter 2016 results. Quarterly revenues were $1.303 billion, up 8% from the first quarter 1 year ago. Income per share was $0.64, up 10% from this time last year. 
Cash flow from operations was $79 million in the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $19 million. 
In February, we increased the quarterly cash dividend from $0.20 to $0.22 per share. This is the 11th consecutive year we've increased the dividend amount. The dividend was paid to shareholders on March 15 for a total cash outlay of $29 million. We also repurchased 700,000 Robert Half's shares during the first quarter at a cost of $29 million. We have 9.7 million shares still available for repurchase under our board authorized stock repurchase plan. 
The U.S. job market remained solid in the first quarter as did demand for our professional staffing and consulting services, resulting in year-over-year revenue growth in all lines of business. 
Our accounting and finance staffing divisions had a particularly strong first quarter. This was the company's 24th straight quarter of double-digit earnings per share percentage growth on a year-over-year basis. Our unlevered return on equity was 33%. 
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our first quarter results."

First quarter staffing revenues were up 7% on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $900 million in the first quarter, up 9%. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $215 million, up 4% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 330 staffing locations worldwide, including 90 locations in 17 countries outside the United States. 
The first quarter had 62.7 billing days compared to 62.0 days in the first quarter 1 year ago. The difference in billing days had the effect of increasing by 1% of the reported year-over-year revenue growth rate for the quarter. The current second quarter has 63.9 billing days compared to 63.2 days in the second quarter of last year. 
Currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing  revenues by $11 million in the first quarter. Exchange rates decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 1%. 
Global revenues for Protiviti were $187 million in the first quarter, with $158 million in revenues in the United States and $29 million in revenues outside the U.S. 
Protiviti revenues were up 14% year-over-year on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. revenues were up 15% and non-U.S. revenues were up 8% from the prior year. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the first quarter and decreasing year-over-year reported growth rate by 1%. 
Protiviti and it's independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries. Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and a same-day, constant-currency basis. This data is further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations. 
Now let's talk about gross margin. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations in the first quarter was 37.1% of applicable revenues. This is a 10 basis point improvement from the same period 1 year ago, as higher pay/bill spreads offset lower temp-to-hire conversion revenues. 
First quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.5% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is up slightly from last year's 9.4%. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin improved by 20 basis points versus a year ago to 43.1%. 
First quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $51 million, or 27.4% of Protiviti revenues. Gross margin 1 year ago for Protiviti was $47 million, or 28.8% of Protiviti revenues. 
Staffing SG&A costs were 32.4% of staffing revenues in the first quarter versus 32.2% in last year's first quarter. SG&A costs for Protiviti were 19.6% of Protiviti revenues in the first quarter compared to 18.8% of Protiviti revenues in the year ago period. 
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $119 million in the first quarter, up 7% from the prior year. Operating margin was 10.7%, the same as the prior year. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $98 million in operating income, an increase of 5% over the prior year.  This resulted in an operating margin of 9.7%. 
Operating income for our permanent placement division was $21 million in the first quarter, up 13% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 20.2%. First quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $15 million, a decrease of 11% from the prior year. This produced an operating margin of 7.8%. 
At the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable were $734 million. Implied day sales outstanding, DSO, was 51.3 days. 
Now turning to guidance. Before I return to guidance, let's review the monthly revenue trends we saw in the first quarter and so far in April, all adjusted for currency. 
Globally, year-over-year revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions decelerated slightly during the quarter, and we exited the quarter with March revenues growing 6.3% compared to 6.7% for the full quarter. Revenue growth for our staffing and consulting services in the first 2 weeks of April was up 5.5% compared to the prior year. 
Global permanent placement revenue growth rates accelerated during the first part of the quarter then moderated thereafter, with March revenues growing 1.5% compared to 8.6% for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in April, permanent placement revenues were flat compared to the same period last year. 
This information is designed to offer a glimpse into trends we saw during the quarter and in April. But as you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time. 
With that said, we offer the following second quarter guidance. Revenues $1,325,000,000 to 1, 385,000,000. Income per share $0.70 to $0.76. The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 6% on a reported basis and adjusted for currency, including Protiviti and EPS growth of 8%. 
We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

We were pleased with the company's performance during the first quarter. Our results were boosted by still-low U.S. unemployment in numerous professional occupations and stronger labor markets in key international locations. 
The number of U.S. job openings has exceeded the number of hires since February 2015 according to the most recent Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The competition for skilled talent is intense. Multiple  offers and counteroffers are common for high-demand candidates, particularly in technology and accounting. 
Internationally, we see higher demand for professional-level talent in a number of markets, notwithstanding the economic headwinds that persist outside the United States.
We feel we will continue to benefit from a widening skills gap in a number of our professional specialty areas. Employers that are struggling to find needed talent are recognizing that flexible staffing can help them manage total labor costs and also increase the pool of potential full-time talent through temporary-to-hire arrangements. 
Turning to Protiviti, we were pleased with Protiviti's performance during the quarter, including once again reporting double-digit revenue growth on a year-over-year basis. Protiviti has an excellent growth outlook based on multiple factors favorably influencing service demand. These include a robust regulatory environment and increased need for stronger internal controls and data security measures, among others. 
At this time, Keith and I will be happy to answer your questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a single follow up as needed. If time permits, we'll certainly try to return you if you have additional questions."

So about trends comparing cycles, clearly, we see clients remaining cautious due to the uncertain macro environment. That lengthens the sales cycle further. As we've talked about before, candidates have many options with their current employer, with other employers, that makes them harder to close, that also lengthens the sales cycle. So generally speaking across our divisions, less so with the accounting and finance ones, but the sales cycle has elongated, which has impacted our growth rates and is expected to impact our growth rates into the second quarter. Compared to prior cycles, it usually gets white-hot for candidates such that clients will very quickly take any candidate that's close and the current environment is nowhere near that environment. So to the extent in prior cycles, late stage has been indicated by this white-hot hyper demand where permanent placement grows at very high double-digit rates, that hasn't happened. And notwithstanding the fact that we're in year 7 or whatever of this cycle, we still don't see that type of hyper demand that we would typically see late cycle, but instead, we continue to slug it out in this relatively sluggish macro environment. We saw that again in the first quarter. Our guidance anticipates more of same in the second quarter. With respect to RH Tech and perm, I would say those trends were particularly evident in both of those divisions. While it's true that Tech's year-over-year growth rate slowed from 10% to 6%, if you look at a year ago comps, they've got harder from 12% to 19%. So given the tougher comps, the deceleration in the growth wasn't totally unexpected. Perm did fine in the beginning of the quarter, as we said. It decelerated late. That deceleration continued into the first part of this quarter. That said, we all know from experience that those are short periods of time. They were disproportionately impacted in the post quarter start by our non-U.S. operations. But on balance, the guidance we're giving is that the economy will continue to chug along at a slow rate. The sales cycle has elongated. It's taken longer to close deals. That includes perm, that includes tech and therefore, our growth rates have slowed modestly."

They were up 14% on comps, that had grown 26% in the year ago period. That said, on the cost side, there have been many investment hires on the MD side to expand their practice, both in the U.S. and abroad. January 1 is the date for the annual raises for their entire practice. The raises due to the competitiveness of the market were higher this year than they were in years past. So the combination of those 2, their direct costs were up 17%. On the revenues, that were up 14%. Clearly, some of those costs are front loaded for the full year. We expect to leverage those as we progress through the year. We would also observe that in the financial services regulatory consulting practice, we had some projects, again, that were delayed and deferred. On a few new projects, the rates were lower than they had been in the past, as some clients get a little more cost conscious. The regulatory practice for many quarters in the row has had absolute hyper growth. In this quarter, it went from hyper growth to fantastic growth. It's shades are really good, but it was slightly slower this quarter than we expected frankly. And to the extent, it was a little light relative to our plan. All of that lightness dropped all the way to the bottom line. So notwithstanding, very robust revenue growth. Our margins declined year-over-year as you noted. As we move into the year, for the second quarter, we expect Protiviti to still have growth in the low to mid-teens. Again, that's on very tough comps a year ago, which were up 23%. We think the margins will grow nicely sequentially, but the margins will still be slightly below last year's levels. That said, we do expect to get back into double-digit percentage operating margins, which is certainly going in the right direction. Demand for Protiviti services remain strong. The pipeline remains strong. It had a very good quarter. It certainly has been aggressive adding to capacity. It will now leverage that capacity over the rest of the year and the margins will improve. It's our fastest growing division. It's been our fastest growing division for several quarters running. We're very pleased with Protiviti."

So that overall umbrella is helpful for all our accounting divisions, but further than that we would also observe that there is a shift to higher level skills. In Accountemps, it's a shift from accounts payable, accounts receivable payroll to staff and senior accountants and to business analysts. In Management Resources, it's a shift to more accounting managers, more controllers, more senior analysts. So the net of that is the assignments are a little longer. There is a little less candidate turnover. And so you see higher growth rates in Accountemps, Management Resources and as we talked about earlier that -- and Protiviti, that are all somewhat related with more complexity comes the need for higher skills, and we are seeing that positive skill drift, if you will, that you can see we're benefiting from in those divisions."

So by segment, I would say, without getting totally granular, generally speaking, we would expect Accountemps and Management Resources to have higher growth rates than the other staffing divisions. We've already talked about Protiviti. At the gross margin line, our guidance contemplates a contraction of 10 to 20 basis points for temp gross margin. However, that's because we have not considered any additional workers' compensation credit. That we got a year ago, that a year ago was 20 basis points. So with no consideration of a workers' compensation credit this quarter, we're talking about temp being down 10 to 20 basis points. If you figure, we get our worker's compensation credit, which we have a third-party review and we just don't know, although, for many quarters, we have gotten one, then we wouldn't have that contraction. On the staffing SG&A side, we believe we will start to leverage the headcount investments we made in the second half of last year because we're holding those pretty much constant in the quarter just ended as well as the second quarter ahead as we've talked about in the past. So that we should get 10 to 20 basis points of year-over-year SG&A leverage. So again, in the absence of any workers' comp credit, our staffing operating income percentage would be down 30 to 40 basis points year-over-year. Half of that would be workers' comp. A piece of the balance of that would be expected less perm mix than we had a year ago. The second quarter is always a strong perm quarter, and you get a nice lift sequentially. We got a really nice lift a year ago. We're expecting a lift this quarter, but not as much lift as we had a year ago. We talked about Protiviti. Year-on-year, we'll be down a point or 2 operating margin wise, but that will be up sequentially versus what we just reported. Tax rate, we just talked about. Share count would be down half a million shares or so, as they flow through of what we bought in the first quarter. So at a high level, we see a couple of points of top line deceleration as we go into the second quarter. We hope we're being conservative, but with the -- when people start talking about Q1 GDP growth being sub-1%, we thought it prudent to be conservative. And frankly, our start in April is a little stronger than the full quarter guidance that we've given, but it's not a lot stronger."

Now let's review first quarter 2016 results. Quarterly revenues were $1.303 billion, up 8% from the first quarter 1 year ago. Income per share was $0.64, up 10% from this time last year. 
Cash flow from operations was $79 million in the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $19 million. 
In February, we increased the quarterly cash dividend from $0.20 to $0.22 per share. This is the 11th consecutive year we've increased the dividend amount. The dividend was paid to shareholders on March 15 for a total cash outlay of $29 million. We also repurchased 700,000 Robert Half's shares during the first quarter at a cost of $29 million. We have 9.7 million shares still available for repurchase under our board authorized stock repurchase plan. 
The U.S. job market remained solid in the first quarter as did demand for our professional staffing and consulting services, resulting in year-over-year revenue growth in all lines of business. 
Our accounting and finance staffing divisions had a particularly strong first quarter. This was the company's 24th straight quarter of double-digit earnings per share percentage growth on a year-over-year basis. Our unlevered return on equity was 33%. 
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our first quarter results."

First quarter staffing revenues were up 7% on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $900 million in the first quarter, up 9%. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $215 million, up 4% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 330 staffing locations worldwide, including 90 locations in 17 countries outside the United States. 
The first quarter had 62.7 billing days compared to 62.0 days in the first quarter 1 year ago. The difference in billing days had the effect of increasing by 1% the reported year-over-year revenue growth rate for the quarter. The current second quarter has 63.9 billing days compared to 63.2 days in the second quarter of last year. 
Currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing  revenues by $11 million in the first quarter. Exchange rates decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 1 percent. 
Global revenues for Protiviti were $187 million in the first quarter, with $158 million in revenues in the United States and $29 million in revenues outside the U.S. 
Protiviti revenues were up 14% year-over-year on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. revenues were up 15% and non-U.S. revenues were up 8% from the prior year. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the first quarter and decreasing year-over-year reported growth rate by 1%. 
Protiviti and it's independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries. Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and a same-day, constant-currency basis. This data is further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations. 
Now let's talk about gross margin. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations in the first quarter was 37.1% of applicable revenues. This is a 10 basis point improvement from the same period 1 year ago, as higher pay/bill spreads offset lower temp-to-hire conversion revenues. 
First quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.5% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is up slightly from last year's 9.4%. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin improved by 20 basis points versus a year ago to 43.1%. 
First quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $51 million, or 27.4% of Protiviti revenues. Gross margin 1 year ago for Protiviti was $47 million, or 28.8% of Protiviti revenues. 
Staffing SG&A costs were 32.4% of staffing revenues in the first quarter versus 32.2% in last year's first quarter. SG&A costs for Protiviti were 19.6% of Protiviti revenues in the first quarter compared to 18.8% of Protiviti revenues in the year ago period. 
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $119 million in the first quarter, up 7% from the prior year. Operating margin was 10.7%, the same as the prior year. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $98 million in operating income, an increase of 5% over the prior year.  This resulted in an operating margin of 9.7%. 
Operating income for our permanent placement division was $21 million in the first quarter, up 13% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 20.2%. First quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $15 million, a decrease of 11% from the prior year. This produced an operating margin of 7.8%. 
At the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable were $734 million. Implied day sales outstanding, DSO, was 51.3 days. 
Now turning to guidance. Before I return to guidance, let's review the monthly revenue trends we saw in the first quarter and so far in April, all adjusted for currency. 
Globally, year-over-year revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions decelerated slightly during the quarter, and we exited the quarter with March revenues growing 6.3% compared to 6.7% for the full quarter. Revenue growth for our staffing and consulting services in the first 2 weeks of April was up 5.5% compared to the prior year. 
Global permanent placement revenue growth rates accelerated during the first part of the quarter then moderated thereafter, with March revenues growing 1.5% compared to 8.6% for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in April, permanent placement revenues were flat compared to the same period last year. 
This information is designed to offer a glimpse into trends we saw during the quarter and in April. But as you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time. 
With that said, we offer the following second quarter guidance. Revenues $1,325,000,000 to 1, 385,000,000. Income per share $0.70 to $0.76. The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 6% on a reported basis and adjusted for currency, including Protiviti and EPS growth of 8%. 
We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

We were pleased with the company's performance during the first quarter. Our results were boosted by still-low U.S. unemployment in numerous professional occupations and stronger labor markets in key international locations. 
The number of U.S. job openings has exceeded the number of hires since February 2015 according to the most recent Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The competition for skilled talent is intense. Multiple  offers and counteroffers are common for high-demand candidates, particularly in technology and accounting. 
Internationally, we see higher demand for professional-level talent in a number of markets, notwithstanding the economic headwinds that persist outside the United States.
We feel we will continue to benefit from a widening skills gap in a number of our professional specialty areas. Employers that are struggling to find needed talent are recognizing that flexible staffing can help them manage total labor costs and also increase the pool of potential full-time talent through temporary-to-hire arrangements. 
Turning to Protiviti, we were pleased with Protiviti's performance during the quarter, including once again reporting double-digit revenue growth on a year-over-year basis. Protiviti has an excellent growth outlook based on multiple factors favorably influencing service demand. These include a robust regulatory environment and increased need for stronger internal controls and data security measures, among others. 
At this time, Keith and I will be happy to answer your questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a single follow up as needed. If time permits, we'll certainly try to return to you if you have additional questions."

And I know you're always realistic about not saying that you're economists, but just got a ton of experience, so that's one.

So about trends comparing cycles, clearly, we see clients remaining cautious due to the uncertain macro environment. That lengthens the sales cycle further. As we've talked about before, candidates have many options with their current employer, with other employers, that makes them harder to close, that also lengthens the sales cycle. So generally speaking across our divisions, less so with the accounting and finance ones, but the sales cycle has elongated, which has impacted our growth rates and is expected to impact our growth rates into the second quarter. Compared to prior cycles, it usually gets white-hot for candidates such that clients will very quickly take any candidate that's close and the current environment is nowhere near that environment. So to the extent in prior cycles, late stage has been indicated by this white-hot hyper demand where permanent placement grows at very high double-digit rates. That hasn't happened. And notwithstanding the fact that we're in year 7 or whatever of this cycle, we still don't see that type of hyper demand that we would typically see late cycle, but instead, we continue to slug it out in this relatively sluggish macro environment. We saw that again in the first quarter. Our guidance anticipates more of same in the second quarter. With respect to RH Tech and perm, I would say those trends were particularly evident in both of those divisions. While it's true that Tech's year-over-year growth rate slowed from 10% to 6%, if you look at a year ago comps, they've got harder from 12% to 19%. So given the tougher comps, the deceleration in the growth wasn't totally unexpected. Perm did fine in the beginning of the quarter, as we said. It decelerated late. That deceleration continued into the first part of this quarter. That said, we all know from experience that those are short periods of time. They were disproportionately impacted in the post quarter start by our non-U.S. operations. But on balance, the guidance we're giving is that the economy will continue to chug along at a slow rate. The sales cycle has elongated. It's taken longer to close deals. That includes perm, that includes tech and therefore, our growth rates have slowed modestly."

They were up 14% on comps, that had grown 26% in the year ago period. That said, on the cost side, there have been many investment hires on the MD side to expand their practice, both in the U.S. and abroad. January 1 is the date for the annual raises for their entire practice. The raises due to the competitiveness of the market were higher this year than they were in years past. So the combination of those 2, their direct costs were up 17%. On the revenues, that were up 14%. Clearly, some of those costs are front loaded for the full year. We expect to leverage those as we progress through the year. We would also observe that in the financial services regulatory consulting practice, we had some projects, again, that were delayed and deferred. On a few new projects, the rates were lower than they had been in the past, as some clients get a little more cost conscious. The regulatory practice for many quarters in the row has had absolute hyper growth. In this quarter, it went from hyper growth to fantastic growth. It's shades are really good, but it was slightly slower this quarter than we expected frankly. And to the extent, it was a little light relative to our plan. All of that lightness dropped all the way to the bottom line. So notwithstanding, very robust revenue growth. Our margins declined year-over-year as you noted. As we move into the year, for the second quarter, we expect Protiviti to still have growth in the low to mid-teens. Again, that's on very tough comps a year ago, which were up 23%. We think the margins will grow nicely sequentially, but the margins will still be slightly below last year's levels. That said, we do expect to get back into double-digit percentage operating margins, which is certainly going in the right direction. Demand for Protiviti services remain strong. The pipeline remains strong. It had a very good quarter. It certainly has been aggressive adding to capacity. It will now leverage that capacity over the rest of the year and the margins will improve. It's our fastest growing division. It's been our fastest growing division for several quarters running. We're very pleased with Protiviti."

So that overall umbrella is helpful for all our accounting divisions, but further than that we would also observe that there is a shift to higher level skills. In Accountemps, it's a shift from accounts payable, accounts receivable payroll to staff and senior accountants and to business analysts. In Management Resources, it's a shift to more accounting managers, more controllers, more senior analysts. So the net of that is the assignments are a little longer. There is a little less candidate turnover. And so you see higher growth rates in Accountemps, Management Resources and as we talked about earlier that -- and Protiviti, that are all somewhat related with more complexity comes the need for higher skills, and we are seeing that positive skill drift, if you will, that you can see we're benefiting from in those divisions."

So by segment, I would say, without getting totally granular, generally speaking, we would expect Accountemps and Management Resources to have higher growth rates than the other staffing divisions. We've already talked about Protiviti. At the gross margin line, our guidance contemplates a contraction of 10 to 20 basis points for temp gross margin. However, that's because we have not considered any additional workers' compensation credit. That we got a year ago, that a year ago was 20 basis points. So with no consideration of a workers' compensation credit this quarter, we're talking about temp being down 10 to 20 basis points. If you figure, we get our worker's compensation credit, which we have a third-party review and we just don't know, although, for many quarters, we have gotten one, then we wouldn't have that contraction. On the staffing SG&A side, we believe we will start to leverage the headcount investments we made in the second half of last year because we're holding those pretty much constant in the quarter just ended as well as the second quarter ahead as we've talked about in the past. So that we should get 10 to 20 basis points of year-over-year SG&A leverage. So again, in the absence of any workers' comp credit, our staffing operating income percentage would be down 30 to 40 basis points year-over-year. Half of that would be workers' comp. A piece of the balance of that would be expected less perm mix than we had a year ago. The second quarter is always a strong perm quarter, and you get a nice lift sequentially. We got a really nice lift a year ago. We're expecting a lift this quarter, but not as much lift as we had a year ago. We talked about Protiviti. Year-on-year, we'll be down a point or 2 operating margin wise, but that will be up sequentially versus what we just reported. Tax rate, we just talked about. Share count would be down half a million shares or so, as they flow through of what we bought in the first quarter. So at a high level, we see a couple of points of top line deceleration as we go into the second quarter. We hope we're being conservative, but with the -- when people start talking about Q1 GDP growth being sub-1%, we thought it prudent to be conservative. And frankly, our start in April is a little stronger than the full quarter guidance that we've given, but it's not a lot stronger."

But this whole -- this phenomena of the sales cycle elongating certainly applies to Tech. We have had clients take longer to pull the trigger, if you want to call that softening, that would be fair. Candidates are still in tight supply, particularly the mid-to-higher level candidates. It does take longer to close them. That impacts growth rates as well. So we would characterize, as the market for Tech, as firm, as strong, but it's taken us longer to get deals closed and, therefore, our growth rates are slowing, exacerbated by the toughness of the comps."

Now let's review first quarter 2016 results. Quarterly revenues were $1.303 billion, up 8% from the first quarter 1 year ago. Income per share was $0.64, up 10% from this time last year. 
Cash flow from operations was $79 million in the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $19 million. 
In February, we increased the quarterly cash dividend from $0.20 to $0.22 per share. This is the 11th consecutive year we've increased the dividend amount. The dividend was paid to shareholders on March 15 for a total cash outlay of $29 million. We also repurchased 700,000 Robert Half's shares during the first quarter at a cost of $29 million. We have 9.7 million shares still available for repurchase under our board authorized stock repurchase plan. 
The U.S. job market remained solid in the first quarter as did demand for our professional staffing and consulting services, resulting in year-over-year revenue growth in all lines of business. 
Our accounting and finance staffing divisions had a particularly strong first quarter. This was the company's 24th straight quarter of double-digit earnings per share percentage growth on a year-over-year basis. Our unlevered return on equity was 33%. 
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our first quarter results."

U.S. staffing",876,"Thank you, Max. Global revenues were $1.3 billion in the first quarter, up 8% from a year ago on a reported basis and on a same day, constant currency basis.
First quarter staffing revenues were up 7% on a same day, constant currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $900 million in the first quarter, up 9%. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $215 million, up 4% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 330 staffing locations worldwide, including 90 locations in 17 countries outside the United States. 
The first quarter had 62.7 billing days compared to 62.0 days in the first quarter 1 year ago. The difference in billing days had the effect of increasing by 1% the reported year-over-year revenue growth rate for the quarter. The current second quarter has 63.9 billing days compared to 63.2 days in the second quarter of last year. 
Currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $11 million in the first quarter. Exchange rates decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 1%. 
Global revenues for Protiviti were $187 million in the first quarter, with $158 million in revenues in the United States and $29 million in revenues outside the U.S. 
Protiviti revenues were up 14% year-over-year on a same day, constant currency basis. U.S. revenues were up 15% and non-U.S. revenues were up 8% from the prior year. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $1 million in the first quarter and decreasing year-over-year reported growth rate by 1%. 
Protiviti and it's independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries. Accompanying our earnings release is a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and a same day, constant currency basis. This data is further broken out by U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure that offers insight into certain revenue trends in our operations. 
Now let's talk about gross margin. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations in the first quarter was 37.1% of applicable revenues. This is a 10 basis point improvement from the same period 1 year ago, as higher pay/bill spreads offset lower temp-to-hire conversion revenues. 
First quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.5% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is up slightly from last year's 9.4%. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin improved by 20 basis points versus a year ago to 43.1%. 
First quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $51 million, or 27.4% of Protiviti revenues. Gross margin 1 year ago for Protiviti was $47 million, or 28.8% of Protiviti revenues. 
Staffing SG&A costs were 32.4% of staffing revenues in the first quarter versus 32.2% in last year's first quarter. SG&A costs for Protiviti were 19.6% of Protiviti revenues in the first quarter compared to 18.8% of Protiviti revenues in the year ago period. 
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $119 million in the first quarter, up 7% from the prior year. Operating margin was 10.7%, the same as the prior year. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $98 million in operating income, an increase of 5% over the prior year. This resulted in an operating margin of 9.7%. 
Operating income for our permanent placement division was $21 million in the first quarter, up 13% from the prior year and producing an operating margin of 20.2%. First quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $15 million, a decrease of 11% from the prior year. This produced an operating margin of 7.8%. 
At the end of the first quarter, accounts receivable were $734 million. Implied day sales outstanding, DSO, was 51.3 days. 
Now turning to guidance. Before I return to guidance, let's review the monthly revenue trends we saw in the first quarter and so far in April, all adjusted for currency. 
Globally, year-over-year revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions decelerated slightly during the quarter, and we exited the quarter with March revenues growing 6.3% compared to 6.7% for the full quarter. Revenue growth for our staffing and consulting services in the first 2 weeks of April was up 5.5% compared to the prior year. 
Global permanent placement revenue growth rates accelerated during the first part of the quarter then moderated thereafter, with March revenues growing 1.5% compared to 8.6% for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks in April, permanent placement revenues were flat compared to the same period last year. 
This information is designed to offer a glimpse into trends we saw during the quarter and in April. But as you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time. 
With that said, we offer the following second quarter guidance. Revenues $1,325,000,000 to 1, 385,000,000. Income per share $0.70 to $0.76. The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 6% on a reported basis and adjusted for currency, including Protiviti and EPS growth of 8%. 
We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

We were pleased with the company's performance during the first quarter. Our results were boosted by still-low U.S. unemployment in numerous professional occupations and stronger labor markets in key international locations. 
The number of U.S. job openings has exceeded the number of hires since February 2015 according to the most recent Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The competition for skilled talent is intense. Multiple offers and counteroffers are common for high-demand candidates, particularly in technology and accounting. 
Internationally, we see higher demand for professional-level talent in a number of markets, notwithstanding the economic headwinds that persist outside the United States.
We feel we will continue to benefit from a widening skills gap in a number of our professional specialty areas. Employers that are struggling to find needed talent are recognizing that flexible staffing can help them manage total labor costs and also increase the pool of potential full-time talent through temporary-to-hire arrangements. 
Turning to Protiviti, we were pleased with Protiviti's performance during the quarter, including once again reporting double-digit revenue growth on a year-over-year basis. Protiviti has an excellent growth outlook based on multiple factors favorably influencing service demand. These include a robust regulatory environment and increased need for stronger internal controls and data security measures, among others. 
At this time, Keith and I will be happy to answer your questions. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a single follow up as needed. If time permits, we'll certainly try to return to you if you have additional questions."

And I know you're always realistic about not saying that you're economists, but just got a ton of experience, so that's one. And then secondly, can you just talk a little bit, specifically about what you saw in RH Technology as well as in perm in this quarter and in March?"

So about trends comparing cycles, clearly, we see clients remaining cautious due to the uncertain macro environment. That lengthens the sales cycle further. As we've talked about before, candidates have many options with their current employer, with other employers, that makes them harder to close, that also lengthens the sales cycle. So generally speaking across our divisions, less so with the accounting and finance ones, but the sales cycle has elongated, which has impacted our growth rates and is expected to impact our growth rates into the second quarter. Compared to prior cycles, it usually gets white-hot for candidates such that clients will very quickly take any candidate that's close and the current environment is nowhere near that environment. So to the extent in prior cycles, late stage has been indicated by this white-hot hyper demand where permanent placement grows at very high double-digit rates. That hasn't happened. And notwithstanding the fact that we're in year 7 or whatever of this cycle, we still don't see that type of hyper demand that we would typically see late cycle, but instead, we continue to slug it out in this relatively sluggish macro environment. We saw that again in the first quarter. Our guidance anticipates more of same in the second quarter. With respect to RH Tech and perm, I would say those trends were particularly evident in both of those divisions. While it's true that Tech's year-over-year growth rate slowed from 10% to 6%, if you look at a year ago comps, they've got harder from 12% to 19%. So given the tougher comps, the deceleration in the growth wasn't totally unexpected. Perm did fine in the beginning of the quarter, as we said. It decelerated late. That deceleration continued into the first part of this quarter. That said, we all know from experience that those are short periods of time. They were disproportionately impacted in the post quarter start by our non-U.S. operations. But on balance, the guidance we're giving is that the economy will continue to chug along at a slow rate. The sales cycle has elongated. It's taken longer to close deals. That includes perm, that includes tech and therefore, our growth rates have slowed modestly."

They were up 14% on comps, that had grown 26% in the year ago period. That said, on the cost side, there have been many investment hires on the MD side to expand their practice, both in the U.S. and abroad. January 1 is the date for the annual raises for their entire practice. The raises due to the competitiveness of the market were higher this year than they were in years past. So the combination of those 2, their direct costs were up 17%. On the revenues, that were up 14%. Clearly, some of those costs are front loaded for the full year. We expect to leverage those as we progress through the year. We would also observe that in the financial services regulatory consulting practice, we had some projects, again, that were delayed and deferred. On a few new projects, the rates were lower than they had been in the past, as some clients get a little more cost conscious. The regulatory practice for many quarters in the row has had absolute hyper growth. In this quarter, it went from hyper growth to fantastic growth. It's shades are really good, but it was slightly slower this quarter than we expected frankly. And to the extent, it was a little light relative to our plan. All of that lightness dropped all the way to the bottom line. So notwithstanding, very robust revenue growth. Our margins declined year-over-year as you noted. As we move into the year, for the second quarter, we expect Protiviti to still have growth in the low to mid-teens. Again, that's on very tough comps a year ago, which were up 23%. We think the margins will grow nicely sequentially, but the margins will still be slightly below last year's levels. That said, we do expect to get back into double-digit percentage operating margins, which is certainly going in the right direction. Demand for Protiviti services remain strong. The pipeline remains strong. It had a very good quarter. It certainly has been aggressive adding to capacity. It will now leverage that capacity over the rest of the year and the margins will improve. It's our fastest growing division. It's been our fastest growing division for several quarters running. We're very pleased with Protiviti."

So that overall umbrella is helpful for all our accounting divisions, but further than that we would also observe that there is a shift to higher level skills. In Accountemps, it's a shift from accounts payable, accounts receivable payroll to staff and senior accountants and to business analysts. In Management Resources, it's a shift to more accounting managers, more controllers, more senior analysts. So the net of that is the assignments are a little longer. There is a little less candidate turnover. And so you see higher growth rates in Accountemps, Management Resources and as we talked about earlier that -- and Protiviti, that are all somewhat related with more complexity comes the need for higher skills, and we are seeing that positive skill drift, if you will, that you can see we're benefiting from in those divisions."

So by segment, I would say, without getting totally granular, generally speaking, we would expect Accountemps and Management Resources to have higher growth rates than the other staffing divisions. We've already talked about Protiviti. At the gross margin line, our guidance contemplates a contraction of 10 to 20 basis points for temp gross margin. However, that's because we have not considered any additional workers' compensation credit. That we got a year ago, that a year ago was 20 basis points. So with no consideration of a workers' compensation credit this quarter, we're talking about temp being down 10 to 20 basis points. If you figure, we get our worker's compensation credit, which we have a third-party review and we just don't know, although, for many quarters, we have gotten one, then we wouldn't have that contraction. On the staffing SG&A side, we believe we will start to leverage the headcount investments we made in the second half of last year because we're holding those pretty much constant in the quarter just ended as well as the second quarter ahead as we've talked about in the past. So that we should get 10 to 20 basis points of year-over-year SG&A leverage. So again, in the absence of any workers' comp credit, our staffing operating income percentage would be down 30 to 40 basis points year-over-year. Half of that would be workers' comp. A piece of the balance of that would be expected less perm mix than we had a year ago. The second quarter is always a strong perm quarter, and you get a nice lift sequentially. We got a really nice lift a year ago. We're expecting a lift this quarter, but not as much lift as we had a year ago. We talked about Protiviti. Year-on-year, we'll be down a point or 2 operating margin wise, but that will be up sequentially versus what we just reported. Tax rate, we just talked about. Share count would be down half a million shares or so, as they flow through of what we bought in the first quarter. So at a high level, we see a couple of points of top line deceleration as we go into the second quarter. We hope we're being conservative, but with the -- when people start talking about Q1 GDP growth being sub-1%, we thought it prudent to be conservative. And frankly, our start in April is a little stronger than the full quarter guidance that we've given, but it's not a lot stronger."

But just as our efforts are more labor intensive to get things closed, we would argue self-service, either by a candidate or by a client, is less effective as well. And in fact those same technology driven options you described are also places, are also tools we use in our own recruiting of candidates and in our own pursuit of leads for which clients are looking for people. We have more visibility to open job orders or unfilled openings today than we've ever had. We have more visibility to candidates in our functional roles today than we've ever had. But notwithstanding that greater visibility into both sides of our business, we find it's more labor intensive today not less labor intensive to get things done."

They're about as uncertain as which way the economy is going as the stock market appears to be that the slow GDP growth rates make them nervous, they're part of it, and yet they see demand in their own businesses that is encouraging. So I think everyone's in a little bit state of limbo here, waiting to see what the macro economy is going to do. From our standpoint, it certainly doesn't feel late cycle, let's put it that way.

Now let's discuss Robert Half's second quarter 2016 results. Quarterly revenues were $1.344 billion, up 6% from the second quarter 1 year ago. Income per share were $0.71, also up 6% from last year's second quarter. Cash flow from operations was $129 million and capital expenditures were $25 million in the second quarter. We've paid our stockholders a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share on June 15 for a total cash outlay of $29 million. We also repurchased 1 million Robert Half shares during the quarter at a cost of $38 million. We have 8.7 million shares still available for repurchase under our board authorized stock repurchase plan.
Our second quarter results reflect continued solid demand for our professional staffing and consulting services. Our financial staffing divisions and productivity reported the strongest year-over-year revenue gains.
In the second quarter, unlevered return on equity for the company was 35%. 
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our results."

This is up 6% from the second quarter of 2015 on a reported basis and up 5% on a same day constant-currency basis. Second quarter staffing revenues were up 4% on a same day constant-currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $911 million in the second quarter, up 3%. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $234 million, up 8% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 328 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the United States. 
The second quarter had 63.9 billing days compared to 63.2 billing days in last year's second quarter. The difference in billing days had the effect of increasing reported year-over-year revenue growth rates for the quarter by 1%. The current quarter has 64.1 billing days compared to 64.2 billing days in the third quarter of 2015.
Currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $4 million in the second quarter. Exchange rates decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.3%. Global revenues for Protiviti were $199 million in the second quarter, with $164 million in revenues in the United States and $35 million in revenues outside the U S.
Protiviti revenues were up 8% year-over-year on a same day constant-currency basis. U.S. revenues were up 6% and non-U.S. revenues were up 17% from last year's second quarter. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $400,000 in the second quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.2%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms served clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries.
Along with our earnings release today, you'll find a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day constant-currency basis. This data is further broken out by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure. We offer to give you insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations in the second quarter was 37.2% [ph] of applicable revenues. This is a 30 basis point improvement from the same period 1 year ago due primarily to higher pay bill spreads. The second quarters of 2016 and 2015 include workers' compensation credits of $1.4 million and $2.1 million, respectively, pursuant to third-party actuarial reviews of our workers' compensation accruals.
Second quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.9% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is down slightly from last year's 10.1%. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased by 10 basis points versus 1 year ago to 43.8%. 
Second quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $56 million or 28.1% of Protiviti revenues. Last year, second quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $54 million or 29.9% of Protiviti revenues. Second quarter SG&A costs were 32.3% of staffing revenues compared to 31.9% in the second quarter 1 year ago. SG&A costs of for Protiviti were 19.1% of Protiviti revenues in the second quarter versus 18.6% of Protiviti revenues in the same period last year.
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $131 million in the second quarter of 2016, up 2% from the previous year. Operating margin was 11.5%, down slightly from the 11.8% in last year's second quarter. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $107 million in operating income, an increase of 2% from the second quarter of 2015. This resulted in an operating margin of 10.4%.
Operating income for our permanent placement division was $24 million in the second quarter, up 2% from the previous year and producing an operating margin of 21.7%. Second quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $18 million, a decrease of 13% from the prior year. This produced an operating margin of 9.0%. 
At the end of the second quarter, accounts receivable were $732 million. Implied days sales outstanding or DSO was 49.6 days. 
Before we move to third quarter guidance, I'd like to give you some more color on our Q2 results, specifically the monthly revenue trends we saw in the second quarter and thus far, in July, all normalized for billing days and currency. Globally, year-over-year revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions decelerated during the second quarter, and we exited the quarter with June revenues growing 3.7% compared to an increase of 4.5% for the full quarter.
Revenue growth for our staffing and consulting services in the first 2 weeks of July was up 2.8% compared to the prior year. Global permanent placement revenue growth rates also decelerated during the quarter, with June revenues declining 1.6% compared to 2.1% for the full quarter.
For the first 3 weeks of July, permanent placement revenues declined 17.6% compared to the same period last year. As you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time. With that said, we offer the following third quarter guidance: Revenues, $1,335,000,000 to $1,395,000,000; income per share, $0.68 to $0.74. Note that our third quarter guidance considers the estimated revenue and cost impacts to all U.S. staffing and Protiviti office of converting to new front office CRM and project management systems, respectively. These are both scheduled to occur in the third quarter.
The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 4.0% on a reported basis and 4.6% adjusted for billing days and currency, including Protiviti, and negative EPS growth of 3%. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

It was the largest single monthly job expansion since October of 2015. This was on the heels of weaker reports in April and May. The U.S. unemployment rate ticked up to 4.9% as a result of more workers entering the workforce in June.
Outside the United States, we were pleased with the improved revenue growth rates in our international staffing and Protiviti operations. The Brexit vote in the U.K. has dominated news headlines, but we believe it is too early to tell what, if any, impact it will have on our operations there, and the U.K. only accounts for 3% of our revenues in any event.
The demand for skilled talent remains a consistent theme for us for a number of years now. Many of our specialty areas have had unemployment rates of less than half the overall rate of unemployment in the United States. The unemployment rate for accountants and auditors is just 2.2% and for software developers, it is just 1% according to recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. These are just 2 examples that place a spotlight on the talent shortages that exist in the United States and elsewhere in some job categories. This is resulting in demand for both temporary and full-time staffing in the professional segments we serve.
Looking at Protiviti, it is building a strong brand that is resulting in continued expansion of its client base and a broadening of its service offerings. This is a business that benefits from a strong regulatory environment because of its strength in helping clients navigate these environments. Protiviti excels in helping clients develop stronger internal controls, data security measures and other important safeguards.
At this time, Keith and I will be happy to answer your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

I'd say our Robert Half technology division, our growth rates did slow during the quarter on very tough comps. Note that a year ago, we did grow at 19%. For our tech-support division or subdivision, which is desktop support, helpdesk, et cetera, clients did get more cautious on the demand side. There was less sense of urgency. For our Tech development positions, which are the programmer, analysts, the software engineers, candidate supply was the issue, which continue to tighten. Further, in the tech development area, we withdrew from a very large client due to their, what we viewed as excessive pricing demands. Our support development mix is about 50-50 based on hours [ph] and it's 40-60 in favor of development based on dollars. As it relates to our new systems, let's talk a little bit about those and we'll talk about impact as well. So first of all, we're replacing 15 -year-old proprietary legacy systems, which were very difficult to use and maintain. We're going to a single global front office platform. Note that we've already rolled this out in 5 other countries successfully, I might add. It is cloud-based versus our own hosted data center, which will have the benefit of giving our people mobile access to our system. It has a modern user interface, which will significantly enhance the new higher ramp time over time. It further greatly facilitates future changes, including our innovation initiatives, including integration with the client-facing digital functionality that we've been working on for some time. Further, we get realtime reporting in dashboards. In short, we're actually very excited to be where we are and to be on the -- right on the verge of this conversion. There is going to be some disruption using the other 5 countries as a guide, understanding that none are at the size and scale. That is the case in the United States. We estimate the revenue impact to be between 0.5 day and 1.5 days of revenue. And in the U.S., that's about $14 million of revenue impact at the midpoint. Protiviti, it actually has the benefit of taking the people that are going to be on training and figuring out their chargeability, their rate, et cetera. And the impact to their revenues will be about $2 million. So that overall, again, at the midpoint of our estimate, we're thinking about a $16 [ph] million revenue impact that converts at our normal gross margins to about an $8 million gross margin impact. Further, there's going to be out-of-pocket training, out-of-pocket travel. There's going to be labor costs we've connected to the support of the conversion period, both before and after. So we estimate the SG&A impact to be between $4 million and $5 million, call it $4.5 million at the midpoint, so that would total up to an operating impact of $12 million to $13 million, which is $0.05 to $0.07 per share. So while relative to the quarter, it has a significant impact on the basis that this is something you do every 15 or 20 years, and we have a long history of getting a lot of use out of our software. It's not that large of an impact but the facts are it all falls in the third quarter, not only for staffing but Protiviti as well is going through their new project management system and hence, the Protiviti inclusion and the numbers that I just talked about."

They grew 23% a year ago, but clearly fell short of their estimates as well. Our FSI regulatory consulting practice was negatively impacted by heightened client cost-cutting, which impacted both our hours build and our rates. New projects that we started had lower rates than previously completed projects. Our other solution practices had a very solid quarter. Our gross margins compressed by about 180 basis points due to this lower mix of higher margin, FSI regulatory practice and the lower staff utilization attributable than to less-than-expected revenue growth. Protiviti operating margins were still quite good at 9%, but they certainly compare unfavorably to a year ago's very strong 11%. Our Q3 Protiviti guidance assumes mid-single-digit revenue growth, again on very tough comps. They grew 23% a year ago in the third quarter.

But even in the other divisions, we see the lower level positions, call it accounting operations with relatively more supply than we do the upper-level position where supply is more of an issue, but not as much of an issue as it is in Tech. I think one of the highlights for the quarter is how we did -- how well we did with our gross margins. That's particularly in accounting finance and that's not only better pay bill spreads, but that's also mix gravitating to higher-level, longer-duration assignments.

You've got clients ever more selective. They want to see more candidates before making a decision. There's more vetting as a way to slow play us or slow the process generally. So we clearly are seeing sales cycles slowing in the perm side. As we go down the P&L, gross margins, we do expect to see up [ph] 10 to 20 basis points year-over-year due to continued strong spreads, due to continued mix shift to the higher level accounting and finance assignments. Protiviti gross margin's going to be down 3.5 to 4 percentage points. That's lower mix of the higher margin FSI regulatory, and it's the cost impact of the annual campus hires and the interns, which come on board in the third quarter. SG&A, up 60 basis points year-over-year. 40 to 50 of that is the sales force and Protiviti conversion. One thing that was quite unusual in the quarter and continues on in the third quarter bit [ph] is our internal medical insurance cost. For the first time in many, many, many years, we had a negative surprise in our internal medical insurance cost, which were up almost 40 basis points in the second quarter year-over-year. Those higher costs are expected to continue into the third quarter but may be not quite to that extent on a year-over-year basis. Protiviti's SG&A would be up 1 to 2 percentage points with the additional training and travel costs related to their conversion, which then as you go down to the P&L, at our midpoint of guidance, you've got temp operating margins down about 50 basis points, primarily due to the higher SG&A from the conversion to salesforce. Perm operating margins down 1 to 2 percentage points, primarily because of the conversion to salesforce.com. And then Protiviti, its operating margins would be down about 5 percentage points as a combination of the lower gross margin that we talked about earlier and the higher SG&A because of one, their conversion; two, the training and travel costs relative to their new hires and their interns. But again, remember, the comparable for Protiviti, its third quarter operating margins were 15.7%. Those were the toughest operating margin comps we had of any division a year ago. So while they will make sequential progress in both revenues and operating margin, notwithstanding their conversion, they're comparing to a year ago's very high comps."

In the U.K., with all the Brexit talk, remember U.K. is 3% of our revenues. While on the one hand, some clients have deferred hiring.

Clearly, given that we made headcount commitments almost a year in advance with the benefit of hindsight, we were a little aggressive in the hiring that we committed to with Protiviti. But over a few quarters, we can work that out. We had double-digit operating margins the second half of last year. We still believe, and our estimates consider, that we'll have double-digit operating margins in the second half of this year, just not as strong as they were a year ago. So there's been a pullback with our financial services clients that have gotten much more focused on their costs, that's had a double impact because it's not only fewer hours for us but they're the most profitable hours that we've had, but that's something we can adjust to over time. It's just that when you commit to your staff levels 3 or 4 quarters in advance, you can't turn on a dime marrying that to the demand as we now see it. So the margins are still going to good and decent and double digit, so there's nothing wrong with a business growing at Protiviti's rates given the comps that they have to have low double-digit operating margins. It's just less than we enjoyed a year ago and so the comparison, when you put them next to each other, it's negative."

The rest of our divisions, primarily need more orders than we need more candidates. So you asked kind of a double negative way. It appears that the U.S. economy's slugging along in the 1% to 2% GDP path that it has for some time. But as clients have gotten more cautious, our growth rates have slowed. And then the third quarter is going to be a very noisy quarter for these conversions that we've got going that will go impact virtually every single person that works for us in the United States. So third quarter, it's very hard to figure out trend lines given how noisy it's going to be. But if you step above that, it seems to be more of the same versus the last 2 [ph] quarters -- versus last few quarters may be with clients getting a little more cautious. What has to change is they need to get less cautious, right? They need to do less vetting. They need to say, ""Yes, I'll take them."" Rather than, ""Show me somebody else or let me compare it."""

Now let's discuss Robert Half's second quarter 2016 results. Quarterly revenues were $1.344 billion, up 6% from the second quarter 1 year ago. Income per share was $0.71, also up 6% from last year's second quarter. Cash flow from operations was $129 million, and capital expenditures were $25 million in the second quarter. We paid our stockholders a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share on June 15, for a total cash outlay of $29 million. We also repurchased 1 million Robert Half shares during the quarter at a cost of $38 million. We have 8.7 million shares still available for repurchase under our board-authorized stock repurchase plan.
Our second quarter results reflect continued solid demand for our professional staffing and consulting services. Our financial staffing divisions and Protiviti reported the strongest year-over-year revenue gains. In the second quarter, unlevered return on equity for the company was 35%. 
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our results."

This is up 6% from the second quarter of 2015 on a reported basis and up 5% on a same-day, constant-currency basis. Second quarter staffing revenues were up 4% on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $911 million in the second quarter, up 3%. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $234 million, up 8% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 328 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the United States. 
The second quarter had 63.9 billing days compared to 63.2 billing days in last year's second quarter. The difference in billing days had the effect of increasing reported year-over-year revenue growth rates for the quarter by 1%. The current quarter has 64.1 billing days compared to 64.2 billing days in the third quarter of 2015.
Currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $4 million in the second quarter. Exchange rates decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.3%. 
Global revenues for Protiviti were $199 million in the second quarter, with $164 million in revenues in the United States and $35 million in revenues outside the U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 8% year-over-year on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. revenues were up 6%, and non-U.S. revenues were up 17% from last year's second quarter. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $400,000 in the second quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.2%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms served clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries.
Along with our earnings release today, you'll find a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day, constant-currency basis. This data is further broken out by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure. We offer to give you insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations in the second quarter was 37.6% of applicable revenues. This is a 30 basis point improvement from the same period 1 year ago due primarily to higher pay/bill spreads. The second quarters of 2016 and 2015 include workers' compensation credits of $1.4 million and $2.1 million, respectively, pursuant to third-party actuarial reviews of our workers' compensation accruals.
Second quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.9% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is down slightly from last year's 10.1%. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased by 10 basis points versus 1 year ago to 43.8%.
Second quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $56 million or 28.1% of Protiviti revenues. Last year, second quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $54 million or 29.9% of Protiviti revenues. 
Second quarter SG&A costs were 32.3% of staffing revenues compared to 31.9% in the second quarter 1 year ago. SG&A costs of for Protiviti were 19.1% of Protiviti revenues in the second quarter versus 18.6% of Protiviti revenues in the same period last year.
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $131 million in the second quarter of 2016, up 2% from the previous year. Operating margin was 11.5%, down slightly from the 11.8% in last year's second quarter. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $107 million in operating income, an increase of 2% from the second quarter of 2015. This resulted in an operating margin of 10.4%.
Operating income for our permanent placement division was $24 million in the second quarter, up 2% from the previous year and producing an operating margin of 21.7%. Second quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $18 million, a decrease of 13% from the prior year. This produced an operating margin of 9.0%. 
At the end of the second quarter, accounts receivable were $732 million. Implied days sales outstanding or DSO was 49.6 days. 
Before we move to third quarter guidance, I'd like to give you some more color on our Q2 results, specifically the monthly revenue trends we saw in the second quarter and thus far in July, all normalized for billing days and currency. 
Globally, year-over-year revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions decelerated during the second quarter, and we exited the quarter with June revenues growing 3.7% compared to an increase of 4.5% for the full quarter. Revenue growth for our staffing and consulting services in the first 2 weeks of July was up 2.8% compared to the prior year. 
Global permanent placement revenue growth rates also decelerated during the quarter, with June revenues declining 1.6% compared to 2.1% for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks of July, permanent placement revenues declined 17.6% compared to the same period last year. 
As you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time. With that said, we offer the following third quarter guidance: revenues, $1,335,000,000 to $1,395,000,000; income per share, $0.68 to $0.74. 
Note that our third quarter guidance considers the estimated revenue and cost impacts to all U.S. staffing and Protiviti office of converting to new front-office CRM and project management systems, respectively. These are both scheduled to occur in the third quarter. The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 4.0% on a reported basis and 4.6% adjusted for billing days and currency, including Protiviti, and negative EPS growth of 3%. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

It was the largest single monthly job expansion since October of 2015. This was on the heels of weaker reports in April and May. The U.S. unemployment rate ticked up to 4.9% as a result of more workers entering the workforce in June.
Outside the United States, we were pleased with the improved revenue growth rates in our international staffing and Protiviti operations. The Brexit vote in the U.K. has dominated news headlines, but we believe it is too early to tell what, if any, impact it will have on our operations there, and the U.K. only accounts for 3% of our revenues in any event.
The demand for skilled talent remains a consistent theme for us. For a number of years now, many of our specialty areas have had unemployment rates of less than half the overall rate of unemployment in the United States. The unemployment rate for accountants and auditors is just 2.2%, and for software developers, it is just 1%, according to recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. These are just 2 examples that place a spotlight on the talent shortages that exist in the United States and elsewhere in some job categories. This is resulting in demand for both temporary and full-time staffing in the professional segments we serve.
Looking at Protiviti, it is building a strong brand that is resulting in continued expansion of its client base and a broadening of its service offerings. This is a business that benefits from a strong regulatory environment because of its strength in helping clients navigate these environments. Protiviti excels at helping clients develop stronger internal controls, data security measures and other important safeguards.

I'd say our Robert Half Technology division, our growth rates did slow during the quarter on very tough comps. Note that a year ago, we did grow at 19%.

I'd say our Robert Half Technology division, our growth rates did slow during the quarter on very tough comps. Note that a year ago, we did grow at 19%. For our tech support division or subdivision, which is desktop support, help desk, et cetera, clients did get more cautious on the demand side. There was less sense of urgency. For our tech development positions, which are the programmer, analysts, the software engineers, candidate supply was the issue, which continued to tighten. Further, in the tech development area, we withdrew from a very large client due to their, what we viewed as excessive pricing demands. Our support development mix is about 50-50 based on hours, and it's 40-60 in favor of development based on dollars. As it relates to our new systems, let's talk a little bit about those and we'll talk about impact as well. So first of all, we're replacing 15-year-old proprietary legacy systems, which were very difficult to use and maintain. We're going to a single, global front-office platform. Note that we've already rolled this out in 5 other countries successfully, I might add. It is cloud-based versus our own hosted data center, which will have the benefit of giving our people mobile access to our system. It has a modern user interface, which will significantly enhance the new hire ramp time over time. It further greatly facilitates future changes, including our innovation initiatives, including integration with the client-facing digital functionality that we've been working on for some time. Further, we get real-time reporting in dashboards. In short, we're actually very excited to be where we are and to be on the -- right on the verge of this conversion. There is going to be some disruption. Using the other 5 countries as a guide, understanding that none are at the size and scale -- that is the case in the United States, we estimate the revenue impact to be between 0.5 day and 1.5 days of revenue. And in the U.S., that's about $14 million of revenue impact at the midpoint. Protiviti, it actually has the benefit of taking the people that are going to be on training and figuring out their chargeability, their rate, et cetera. And the impact to their revenues will be about $2 million, so that overall, again, at the midpoint of our estimate, we're thinking about a $16 million revenue impact that converts at our normal gross margins to about an $8 million gross margin impact. Further, there is going to be out-of-pocket training, out-of-pocket travel. There is going to be labor costs with -- connected to the support of the conversion period, both before and after. So we estimate the SG&A impact to be between $4 million and $5 million, call it $4.5 million at the midpoint. So that would total up to an operating income impact of $12 million to $13 million, which is $0.05 to $0.07 per share. So while relative to the quarter, it has a significant impact on the basis that this is something you do every 15 or 20 years, and we have a long history of getting a lot of use out of our software. It's not that large of impact, but the facts are it all falls in the third quarter not only for staffing, but Protiviti as well is going to their new project management system and hence, the Protiviti inclusion and the numbers that I've just talked about."

They grew 23% a year ago but clearly fell short of their estimates as well. Our FSI regulatory consulting practice was negatively impacted by heightened client cost-cutting, which impacted both our hours billed and hour rates. New projects that we started had lower rates than previously completed projects. Our other solution practices had a very solid quarter. Our gross margins compressed by about 180 basis points due to this lower mix of higher-margin FSI regulatory practice and the lower staff utilization attributable than -- to less-than-expected revenue growth. Protiviti operating margins were still quite good at 9%, but they certainly compare unfavorably to a year ago's very strong 11%. Our Q3 Protiviti guidance assumes mid-single-digit revenue growth, again on very tough comps. They grew 23% a year ago in the third quarter. Operating margins, which -- while they're projected to rise sequentially, they will be quite a bit lower than the very high levels a year ago."

But even in the other divisions, we see the lower-level positions, call it accounting operations, with relatively more supply than we do the upper-level position, where supply is more of an issue but not as much of an issue as it is in tech. I think one of the highlights for the quarter is how we did -- how well we did with our gross margins. That's particularly in accounting finance. And that's not only better pay/bill spreads, but that's also mix gravitating to higher-level, longer-duration assignments.

You've got clients ever more selective. They want to see more candidates before making a decision. There's more vetting as a way to slow play us or slow the process generally. So we clearly are seeing sales cycles slowing in the perm side. As we go down the P&L, gross margins, we do expect to see up 10 to 20 basis points year-over-year due to continued strong spreads, due to continued mix shift to the higher-level accounting and finance assignments. Protiviti gross margin is going to be down 3.5 to 4 percentage points. That's lower mix of the higher-margin FSI regulatory, and it's the cost impact of the annual campus hires and the interns which come on board in the third quarter; SG&A, up 60 basis points year-over-year. 40 to 50 of that is the Salesforce and Protiviti conversion. One thing that was quite unusual in the quarter and continues on into the third quarter bit is our internal medical insurance cost. For the first time in many, many, many years, we had a negative surprise in our internal medical insurance cost, which were up almost 40 basis points in the second quarter year-over-year. Those higher costs are expected to continue into the third quarter but maybe not quite to that extent on a year-over-year basis. Protiviti's SG&A would be up 1 to 2 percentage points with the additional training and travel cost related to their conversion, which then, as you go down the P&L, at our midpoint of guidance, you've got temp operating margins down about 50 basis points primarily due to the higher SG&A from the conversion to Salesforce, perm operating margins down 1 to 2 percentage points primarily because of the conversion to Salesforce.com. And then Protiviti, its operating margins would be down about 5 percentage points as a combination of the lower gross margin that we talked about earlier and the higher SG&A because of, one, their conversion; two, the training and travel costs relative to their new hires and their interns. But again, remember, the comparable for Protiviti, its third quarter operating margins were 15.7%. Those were the toughest operating margin comps we had of any division a year ago. So while they will make sequential progress in both revenues and operating margin, notwithstanding their conversion, they're comparing to a year ago's very high comps."

Clearly, given that we made headcount commitments almost a year in advance with the benefit of hindsight, we were a little aggressive in the hiring that we committed to with Protiviti. But over a few quarters, we can work that out. We had double-digit operating margins the second half of last year. We still believe and our estimates consider that we'll have double-digit operating margins in the second half of this year, just not as strong as they were a year ago. So there's been a pullback with our financial services clients that have gotten much more focused on their cost. That's had a double impact because it's not only fewer hours for us, but they're the most profitable hours that we've had. But that's something we can adjust to over time. It's just that when you commit to your staff levels 3 or 4 quarters in advance, you can't turn on a dime marrying that to the demand as we now see it. So the margins are still going to be good and decent and double digit. There's nothing wrong with a business growing at Protiviti's rates given the comps that they have to have low double-digit operating margins. It's just less than we enjoyed a year ago. And so the comparison, when you put them next to each other, it's negative."

We will -- we remain committed to them, and it will take a few quarters to get the utilization back up to where it had been in the near past. As we'd look forward to this year's hiring season on campus and with interns, we will throttle that back further. We'll look at the contractor usage of Protiviti, where they had -- do have variable labor cost primarily with contractors sourced through Robert Half. Those will be looked at. But we will have solid operating margins for the next few quarters. And in the background, we will throttle back our capacity -- our additions to capacity given new revenue realities."

It appears that the U.S. economy is slugging along in the 1% to 2% GDP path that it has for some time. But as clients have gotten more cautious, our growth rates have slowed. And then the third quarter is going to be a very noisy quarter for these conversions that we've got going that are going to impact virtually every single person that works for us in the United States. So third quarter, it's very hard to figure out trend lines given how noisy it's going to be. But if you step above that, it seems to be more of the same versus the last through quarters -- versus the last few quarters maybe with clients getting a little more cautious. What has to change is they need to get less cautious, right. They need to do less vetting. They need to say, ""Yes, I'll take them,"" rather than, ""Show me somebody else and let me compare."""

Now let's discuss Robert Half's second quarter 2016 results. Quarterly revenues were $1.344 billion, up 6% from the second quarter 1 year ago. Income per share was $0.71, also up 6% from last year's second quarter. Cash flow from operations was $129 million and capital expenditures were $25 million in the second quarter. We paid our stockholders a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share on June 15, for a total cash outlay of $29 million. We also repurchased 1 million Robert Half shares during the quarter at a cost of $38 million. We have 8.7 million shares still available for repurchase under our board-authorized stock repurchase plan.
Our second quarter results reflect continued solid demand for our professional staffing and consulting services. Our financial staffing divisions and Protiviti reported the strongest year-over-year revenue gains. In the second quarter, unlevered return on equity for the company was 35%. 
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our results."

This is up 6% from the second quarter of 2015 on a reported basis and up 5% on a same-day, constant-currency basis. Second quarter staffing revenues were up 4% on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. staffing revenues were $911 million in the second quarter, up 3%. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $234 million, up 8% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 328 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the United States. 
The second quarter had 63.9 billing days compared to 63.2 billing days in last year's second quarter. The difference in billing days had the effect of increasing reported year-over-year revenue growth rates for the quarter by 1%. The current quarter has 64.1 billing days compared to 64.2 billing days in the third quarter of 2015.
Currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $4 million in the second quarter. Exchange rates decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.3%. 
Global revenues for Protiviti were $199 million in the second quarter, with $164 million in revenues in the United States and $35 million in revenues outside the U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 8% year-over-year on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. revenues were up 6%, and non-U.S. revenues were up 17% from last year's second quarter. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $400,000 in the second quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.2%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries.
Along with our earnings release today, you'll find a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day, constant-currency basis. This data is further broken out by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure we offer to give you insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations in the second quarter was 37.6% of applicable revenues. This is a 30 basis point improvement from the same period 1 year ago due primarily to higher pay/bill spreads. The second quarters of 2016 and 2015 include workers' compensation credits of $1.4 million and $2.1 million, respectively, pursuant to third-party actuarial reviews of our workers' compensation accruals.
Second quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.9% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is down slightly from last year's 10.1%. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased by 10 basis points versus 1 year ago to 43.8%.
Second quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $56 million or 28.1% of Protiviti revenues. Last year, second quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $54 million or 29.9% of Protiviti revenues. 
Second quarter SG&A costs were 32.3% of staffing revenues compared to 31.9% in the second quarter 1 year ago. SG&A costs of for Protiviti were 19.1% of Protiviti revenues in the second quarter versus 18.6% of Protiviti revenues in the same period last year.
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $131 million in the second quarter of 2016, up 2% from the previous year. Operating margin was 11.5%, down slightly from the 11.8% in last year's second quarter. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $107 million in operating income, an increase of 2% from the second quarter of 2015. This resulted in an operating margin of 10.4%.
Operating income for our permanent placement division was $24 million in the second quarter, up 2% from the previous year and producing an operating margin of 21.7%. Second quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $18 million, a decrease of 13% from the prior year. This produced an operating margin of 9.0%. 
At the end of the second quarter, accounts receivable were $732 million. Implied days sales outstanding or DSO was 49.6 days. 
Before we move to third quarter guidance, I'd like to give you some more color on our Q2 results, specifically the monthly revenue trends we saw in the second quarter and thus far in July, all normalized for billing days and currency. 
Globally, year-over-year revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions decelerated during the second quarter, and we exited the quarter with June revenues growing 3.7% compared to an increase of 4.5% for the full quarter. Revenue growth for our staffing and consulting services in the first 2 weeks of July was up 2.8% compared to the prior year. 
Global permanent placement revenue growth rates also decelerated during the quarter with June revenues declining 1.6% compared to 2.1% for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks of July, permanent placement revenues declined 17.6% compared to the same period last year. 
As you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time. With that said, we offer the following third quarter guidance: revenues, $1,335,000,000 to $1,395,000,000; income per share, $0.68 to $0.74. 
Note that our third quarter guidance considers the estimated revenue and cost impacts to all U.S. staffing and Protiviti offices of converting to new front-office CRM and project management systems, respectively. These are both scheduled to occur in the third quarter. The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 4.0% on a reported basis and 4.6% adjusted for billing days and currency, including Protiviti, and negative EPS growth of 3%. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

It was the largest single monthly job expansion since October of 2015. This was on the heels of weaker reports in April and May. The U.S. unemployment rate ticked up to 4.9% as a result of more workers entering the workforce in June.
Outside the United States, we were pleased with the improved revenue growth rates in our international staffing and Protiviti operations. The Brexit vote in the U.K. has dominated news headlines, but we believe it is too early to tell what, if any, impact it will have on our operations there, and the U.K. only accounts for 3% of our revenues in any event.
The demand for skilled talent remains a consistent theme for us. For a number of years now, many of our specialty areas have had unemployment rates of less than half the overall rate of unemployment in the United States. The unemployment rate for accountants and auditors is just 2.2%, and for software developers, it is just 1%, according to recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. These are just 2 examples that place a spotlight on the talent shortages that exist in the United States and elsewhere in some job categories. This is resulting in demand for both temporary and full-time staffing in the professional segments we serve.
Looking at Protiviti, it is building a strong brand that is resulting in continued expansion of its client base and a broadening of its service offerings. This is a business that benefits from a strong regulatory environment because of its strength in helping clients navigate these environments. Protiviti excels at helping clients develop stronger internal controls, data security measures and other important safeguards.

I'd say our Robert Half Technology division, our growth rates did slow during the quarter on very tough comps. Note that a year ago, we did grow at 19%. For our tech support division or subdivision, which is desktop support, help desk, et cetera, clients did get more cautious on the demand side. There was less sense of urgency. For our tech development positions, which are the programmer, analysts, the software engineers, candidate supply was the issue, which continued to tighten. Further, in the tech development area, we withdrew from a very large client due to their, what we viewed as excessive pricing demands. Our support development mix is about 50-50 based on hours, and it's 40-60 in favor of development based on dollars. As it relates to our new systems, let's talk a little bit about those, then we'll talk about impact as well. So first of all, we're replacing 15-year-old proprietary legacy systems, which were very difficult to use and maintain. We're going to a single, global front-office platform. Note that we've already rolled this out in 5 other countries successfully, I might add. It is cloud-based versus our own hosted data center, which will have the benefit of giving our people mobile access to our system. It has a modern user interface, which will significantly enhance the new hire ramp time over time. It further greatly facilitates future changes, including our innovation initiatives, including integration with the client-facing digital functionality that we've been working on for some time. Further, we get real-time reporting in dashboards. In short, we're actually very excited to be where we are and to be on the -- right on the verge of this conversion. There is going to be some disruption. Using the other 5 countries as a guide, understanding that none are at the size and scale that is the case in the United States, we estimate the revenue impact to be between 0.5 day and 1.5 days of revenue. And in the U.S., that's about $14 million of revenue impact at the midpoint. Protiviti, it actually has the benefit of taking the people that are going to be on training and figuring out their chargeability, their rate, et cetera. And the impact to their revenues will be about $2 million, so that overall, again, at the midpoint of our estimate, we're thinking about a $16 million revenue impact that converts at our normal gross margins to about an $8 million gross margin impact. Further, there is going to be out-of-pocket training, out-of-pocket travel. There is going to be labor costs with -- connected to the support of the conversion period, both before and after. So we estimate the SG&A impact to be between $4 million and $5 million, call it $4.5 million at the midpoint. So that would total up to an operating income impact of $12 million to $13 million, which is $0.05 to $0.07 per share. So while, relative to the quarter, it has a significant impact on the basis that this is something you do every 15 or 20 years, and we have a long history of getting a lot of use out of our software. It's not that large of impact, but the facts are it all falls in the third quarter not only for staffing, but Protiviti as well is going to their new project management system and hence, the Protiviti inclusion and the numbers that I've just talked about."

Our FSI regulatory consulting practice was negatively impacted by heightened client cost-cutting, which impacted both our hours billed and our rates. New projects that we started had lower rates than previously completed projects. Our other solution practices had a very solid quarter. Our gross margins compressed by about 180 basis points due to this lower mix of higher-margin FSI regulatory practice and the lower staff utilization attributable than -- to less-than-expected revenue growth. Protiviti operating margins were still quite good at 9%, but they certainly compare unfavorably to a year ago's very strong 11%. Our Q3 Protiviti guidance assumes mid-single-digit revenue growth, again on very tough comps. They grew 23% a year ago in the third quarter.

I think one of the highlights for the quarter is how we did -- how well we did with our gross margins. That's particularly in accounting finance.

You've got clients ever more selective. They want to see more candidates before making a decision. There's more vetting as a way to slow play us or slow the process generally. So we clearly are seeing sales cycles slowing in the perm side. As we go down the P&L, gross margins, we do expect to see up 10 to 20 basis points year-over-year due to continued strong spreads, due to continued mix shift to the higher-level accounting and finance assignments. Protiviti gross margin is going to be down 3.5 to 4 percentage points. That's lower mix of the higher-margin FSI regulatory, and it's the cost impact of the annual campus hires and the interns which come on board in the third quarter; SG&A, up 60 basis points year-over-year. 40 to 50 of that is the Salesforce and Protiviti conversion. One thing that was quite unusual in the quarter, and continues on into the third quarter a bit, is our internal medical insurance cost. For the first time in many, many, many years, we had a negative surprise in our internal medical insurance cost, which were up almost 40 basis points in the second quarter year-over-year. Those higher costs are expected to continue into the third quarter but maybe not quite to that extent on a year-over-year basis. Protiviti's SG&A would be up 1 to 2 percentage points with the additional training and travel costs related to their conversion, which then, as you go down the P&L, at our midpoint of guidance, you've got temp operating margins down about 50 basis points, primarily due to the higher SG&A from the conversion to Salesforce. Perm operating margins down 1 to 2 percentage points, primarily because of the conversion to Salesforce.com. And then Protiviti, its operating margins would be down about 5 percentage points as a combination of the lower gross margin that we talked about earlier and the higher SG&A because of, one, their conversion; two, the training and travel costs relative to their new hires and their interns. But again, remember, the comparable for Protiviti, its third quarter operating margins were 15.7%. Those were the toughest operating margin comps we had of any division a year ago. So while they will make sequential progress in both revenues and operating margin, notwithstanding their conversion, they're comparing to a year ago's very high comps."

Clearly, given that we made headcount commitments almost a year in advance, with the benefit of hindsight, we were a little aggressive in the hiring that we committed to with Protiviti. But over a few quarters, we can work that out. We had double-digit operating margins the second half of last year. We still believe and our estimates consider that we'll have double-digit operating margins in the second half of this year, just not as strong as they were a year ago. So there's been a pullback with our financial services clients that have gotten much more focused on their cost. That's had a double impact because it's not only fewer hours for us, but they're the most profitable hours that we've had. But that's something we can adjust to over time. It's just that when you commit to your staff levels 3 or 4 quarters in advance, you can't turn on a dime marrying that to the demand as we now see it. So the margins are still going to be good and decent and double digit. There's nothing wrong with a business growing at Protiviti's rates given the comps that they have to have low double-digit operating margins. It's just less than we enjoyed a year ago.

It appears that the U.S. economy is slugging along in the 1% to 2% GDP path that it has for some time. But as clients have gotten more cautious, our growth rates have slowed. And then the third quarter is going to be a very noisy quarter for these conversions that we've got going that are going to impact virtually every single person that works for us in the United States. So third quarter, it's very hard to figure out trend lines given how noisy it's going to be. But if you step above that, it seems to be more of the same versus the last through quarters -- versus the last few quarters maybe with clients getting a little more cautious.

Now let's discuss Robert Half's second quarter 2016 results. Quarterly revenues were $1.344 billion, up 6% from the second quarter 1 year ago. Income per share was $0.71, also up 6% from last year's second quarter. Cash flow from operations was $129 million and capital expenditures were $25 million in the second quarter. We paid our stockholders a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share on June 15, for a total cash outlay of $29 million. We also repurchased 1 million Robert Half shares during the quarter at a cost of $38 million. We have 8.7 million shares still available for repurchase under our board-authorized stock repurchase plan.
Our second quarter results reflect continued solid demand for our professional staffing and consulting services. Our financial staffing divisions and Protiviti reported the strongest year-over-year revenue gains. In the second quarter, unlevered return on equity for the company was 35%. 
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our results."

U.S. staffing revenues were $911 million in the second quarter, up 3%. Non-U.S. staffing revenues were $234 million, up 8% when adjusted for billing days and currency exchange rates. We have 328 staffing locations worldwide, including 86 locations in 17 countries outside the United States. 
The second quarter had 63.9 billing days compared to 63.2 billing days in last year's second quarter. The difference in billing days had the effect of increasing reported year-over-year revenue growth rates for the quarter by 1%. The current quarter has 64.1 billing days compared to 64.2 billing days in the third quarter of 2015.
Currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $4 million in the second quarter. Exchange rates decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.3%. 
Global revenues for Protiviti were $199 million in the second quarter, with $164 million in revenues in the United States and $35 million in revenues outside the U.S. Protiviti revenues were up 8% year-over-year on a same-day, constant-currency basis. U.S. revenues were up 6%, and non-U.S. revenues were up 17% from last year's second quarter. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $400,000 in the second quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.2%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries.
Along with our earnings release today, you'll find a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day, constant-currency basis. This data is further broken out by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP financial measure we offer to give you insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations in the second quarter was 37.6% of applicable revenues. This is a 30 basis point improvement from the same period 1 year ago due primarily to higher pay/bill spreads. The second quarters of 2016 and 2015 include workers' compensation credits of $1.4 million and $2.1 million, respectively, pursuant to third-party actuarial reviews of our workers' compensation accruals.
Second quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.9% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is down slightly from last year's 10.1%. Together with temporary and consulting gross margin, overall staffing gross margin increased by 10 basis points versus 1 year ago to 43.8%.
Second quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $56 million or 28.1% of Protiviti revenues. Last year, second quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $54 million or 29.9% of Protiviti revenues. 
Second quarter SG&A costs were 32.3% of staffing revenues compared to 31.9% in the second quarter 1 year ago. SG&A costs of for Protiviti were 19.1% of Protiviti revenues in the second quarter versus 18.6% of Protiviti revenues in the same period last year.
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $131 million in the second quarter of 2016, up 2% from the previous year. Operating margin was 11.5%, down slightly from the 11.8% in last year's second quarter. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $107 million in operating income, an increase of 2% from the second quarter of 2015. This resulted in an operating margin of 10.4%.
Operating income for our permanent placement division was $24 million in the second quarter, up 2% from the previous year and producing an operating margin of 21.7%. Second quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $18 million, a decrease of 13% from the prior year. This produced an operating margin of 9.0%. 
At the end of the second quarter, accounts receivable were $732 million. Implied days sales outstanding or DSO was 49.6 days. 
Before we move to third quarter guidance, I'd like to give you some more color on our Q2 results, specifically the monthly revenue trends we saw in the second quarter and thus far in July, all normalized for billing days and currency. 
Globally, year-over-year revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions decelerated during the second quarter, and we exited the quarter with June revenues growing 3.7% compared to an increase of 4.5% for the full quarter. Revenue growth for our staffing and consulting services in the first 2 weeks of July was up 2.8% compared to the prior year. 
Global permanent placement revenue growth rates also decelerated during the quarter with June revenues declining 1.6% compared to 2.1% for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks of July, permanent placement revenues declined 17.6% compared to the same period last year. 
As you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time. With that said, we offer the following third quarter guidance: revenues, $1,335,000,000 to $1,395,000,000; income per share, $0.68 to $0.74. 
Note that our third quarter guidance considers the estimated revenue and cost impacts to all U.S. staffing and Protiviti offices of converting to new front-office CRM and project management systems, respectively. These are both scheduled to occur in the third quarter. The midpoint of our guidance implies year-over-year revenue growth of 4.0% on a reported basis and 4.6% adjusted for billing days and currency, including Protiviti, and negative EPS growth of 3%. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Max."

It was the largest single monthly job expansion since October of 2015. This was on the heels of weaker reports in April and May. The U.S. unemployment rate ticked up to 4.9% as a result of more workers entering the workforce in June.
Outside the United States, we were pleased with the improved revenue growth rates in our international staffing and Protiviti operations. The Brexit vote in the U.K. has dominated news headlines, but we believe it is too early to tell what, if any, impact it will have on our operations there, and the U.K. only accounts for 3% of our revenues in any event.
The demand for skilled talent remains a consistent theme for us. For a number of years now, many of our specialty areas have had unemployment rates of less than half the overall rate of unemployment in the United States. The unemployment rate for accountants and auditors is just 2.2%, and for software developers, it is just 1%, according to recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. These are just 2 examples that place a spotlight on the talent shortages that exist in the United States and elsewhere in some job categories. This is resulting in demand for both temporary and full-time staffing in the professional segments we serve.
Looking at Protiviti, it is building a strong brand that is resulting in continued expansion of its client base and a broadening of its service offerings. This is a business that benefits from a strong regulatory environment because of its strength in helping clients navigate these environments. Protiviti excels at helping clients develop stronger internal controls, data security measures and other important safeguards.
At this time, Keith and I would be happy to answer your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

I'd say our Robert Half Technology division, our growth rates did slow during the quarter on very tough comps. Note that a year ago, we did grow at 19%.

I'd say our Robert Half Technology division, our growth rates did slow during the quarter on very tough comps. Note that a year ago, we did grow at 19%. For our tech support division or subdivision, which is desktop support, help desk, et cetera, clients did get more cautious on the demand side. There was less sense of urgency. For our tech development positions, which are the programmer, analysts, the software engineers, candidate supply was the issue, which continued to tighten. Further, in the tech development area, we withdrew from a very large client due to their, what we viewed as excessive pricing demands. Our support development mix is about 50-50 based on hours, and it's 40-60 in favor of development based on dollars. As it relates to our new systems, let's talk a little bit about those, then we'll talk about impact as well. So first of all, we're replacing 15-year-old proprietary legacy systems, which were very difficult to use and maintain. We're going to a single, global front-office platform. Note that we've already rolled this out in 5 other countries successfully, I might add. It is cloud-based versus our own hosted data center, which will have the benefit of giving our people mobile access to our system. It has a modern user interface, which will significantly enhance the new hire ramp time over time. It further greatly facilitates future changes, including our innovation initiatives, including integration with the client-facing digital functionality that we've been working on for some time. Further, we get real-time reporting in dashboards. In short, we're actually very excited to be where we are and to be on the -- right on the verge of this conversion. There is going to be some disruption. Using the other 5 countries as a guide, understanding that none are at the size and scale that is the case in the United States, we estimate the revenue impact to be between 0.5 day and 1.5 days of revenue. And in the U.S., that's about $14 million of revenue impact at the midpoint. Protiviti, it actually has the benefit of taking the people that are going to be on training and figuring out their chargeability, their rate, et cetera. And the impact to their revenues will be about $2 million, so that overall, again, at the midpoint of our estimate, we're thinking about a $16 million revenue impact that converts at our normal gross margins to about an $8 million gross margin impact. Further, there is going to be out-of-pocket training, out-of-pocket travel. There is going to be labor costs with -- connected to the support of the conversion period, both before and after. So we estimate the SG&A impact to be between $4 million and $5 million, call it $4.5 million at the midpoint. So that would total up to an operating income impact of $12 million to $13 million, which is $0.05 to $0.07 per share. So while, relative to the quarter, it has a significant impact on the basis that this is something you do every 15 or 20 years, and we have a long history of getting a lot of use out of our software. It's not that large of impact, but the facts are it all falls in the third quarter not only for staffing, but Protiviti as well is going to their new project management system and hence, the Protiviti inclusion and the numbers that I've just talked about."

Our FSI regulatory consulting practice was negatively impacted by heightened client cost-cutting, which impacted both our hours billed and our rates. New projects that we started had lower rates than previously completed projects. Our other solution practices had a very solid quarter. Our gross margins compressed by about 180 basis points due to this lower mix of higher-margin FSI regulatory practice and the lower staff utilization attributable than -- to less-than-expected revenue growth. Protiviti operating margins were still quite good at 9%, but they certainly compare unfavorably to a year ago's very strong 11%. Our Q3 Protiviti guidance assumes mid-single-digit revenue growth, again on very tough comps. They grew 23% a year ago in the third quarter.

But even in the other divisions, we see the lower-level positions, call it accounting operations, with relatively more supply than we do the upper-level positions, where supply is more of an issue but not as much of an issue as it is in tech. I think one of the highlights for the quarter is how we did -- how well we did with our gross margins. That's particularly in accounting finance. And that's not only better pay/bill spreads, but that's also mix gravitating to higher-level, longer-duration assignments.

You've got clients ever more selective. They want to see more candidates before making a decision. There's more vetting as a way to slow play us or slow the process generally. So we clearly are seeing sales cycles slowing in the perm side. As we go down the P&L, gross margins, we do expect to see up 10 to 20 basis points year-over-year due to continued strong spreads, due to continued mix shift to the higher-level accounting and finance assignments. Protiviti gross margin is going to be down 3.5 to 4 percentage points. That's lower mix of the higher-margin FSI regulatory, and it's the cost impact of the annual campus hires and the interns which come on board in the third quarter; SG&A, up 60 basis points year-over-year. 40 to 50 of that is the Salesforce and Protiviti conversion. One thing that was quite unusual in the quarter, and continues on into the third quarter a bit, is our internal medical insurance cost. For the first time in many, many, many years, we had a negative surprise in our internal medical insurance cost, which were up almost 40 basis points in the second quarter year-over-year. Those higher costs are expected to continue into the third quarter but maybe not quite to that extent on a year-over-year basis. Protiviti's SG&A would be up 1 to 2 percentage points with the additional training and travel costs related to their conversion, which then, as you go down the P&L, at our midpoint of guidance, you've got temp operating margins down about 50 basis points, primarily due to the higher SG&A from the conversion to Salesforce. Perm operating margins down 1 to 2 percentage points, primarily because of the conversion to Salesforce.com. And then Protiviti, its operating margins would be down about 5 percentage points as a combination of the lower gross margin that we talked about earlier and the higher SG&A because of, one, their conversion; two, the training and travel costs relative to their new hires and their interns. But again, remember, the comparable for Protiviti, its third quarter operating margins were 15.7%. Those were the toughest operating margin comps we had of any division a year ago. So while they will make sequential progress in both revenues and operating margin, notwithstanding their conversion, they're comparing to a year ago's very high comps."

Clearly, given that we made headcount commitments almost a year in advance, with the benefit of hindsight, we were a little aggressive in the hiring that we committed to with Protiviti. But over a few quarters, we can work that out. We had double-digit operating margins the second half of last year. We still believe and our estimates consider that we'll have double-digit operating margins in the second half of this year, just not as strong as they were a year ago. So there's been a pullback with our financial services clients that have gotten much more focused on their cost. That's had a double impact because it's not only fewer hours for us, but they're the most profitable hours that we've had. But that's something we can adjust to over time. It's just that when you commit to your staff levels 3 or 4 quarters in advance, you can't turn on a dime marrying that to the demand as we now see it. So the margins are still going to be good and decent and double digit. There's nothing wrong with a business growing at Protiviti's rates given the comps that they have to have low double-digit operating margins. It's just less than we enjoyed a year ago. And so the comparison, when you put them next to each other, it's negative."

Now let's discuss Robert Half's third quarter 2016 results. Revenues for the quarter were $1.339 billion, up 2% from the third quarter 1 year ago. Income per share was $0.71 compared to $0.73 in last year's third quarter. Cash flow from operations was $153 million, and capital expenditures were $20 million in the third quarter.
We paid our stockholders a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share on September 15, for a total cash outlay of $28 million. We also repurchased 1.2 million Robert Half shares during the quarter at a cost of $46 million. We have 7.5 million shares still available for repurchase under our board authorized stock repurchase plan.
We saw solid demand in the third quarter, particularly for our accounting- and finance-related professional staffing and consulting services. Our Accountemps and Robert Half Management Resources staffing divisions and Protiviti reported the highest year-over-year revenue gains. Our international operations also posted strong results. Unlevered return on equity for the company remained strong at 33%.
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our third quarter results."

As Max mentioned, global revenues were $1.339 billion in the third quarter. This is up 2% from the third quarter 1 year ago on both a reported and same-day, constant currency basis.
Let's break this out between our staffing business and Protiviti. Global staffing revenues were up 1% in the third quarter on a same-day, constant currency basis from 1 year ago. U.S. staffing revenues were $890 million, roughly flat with last year; and non-U.S. staffing revenues were $231 million, up 7% when adjusted for billing days and exchange rates. We have 326 staffing locations worldwide, including 84 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
The third quarter had 64.1 billing days compared to 64.2 days in last year's third quarter. The fourth quarter has 61.4 billing days compared to 62.3 days in the fourth quarter of 2015.  
In the third quarter, currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $3 million. Exchange rates decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.3%.
Third quarter global revenues for Protiviti were $217 million, including $183 million in the United States and $34 million outside the U.S. Overall revenues for Protiviti were up 8% from 1 year ago on a same-day, constant currency basis. U.S. revenues were up 6%, and non-U.S. revenues were up 17% from last year's third quarter. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $300,000 in the third quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.2%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries.
Along with our earnings release today, you'll find a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day, constant currency basis. This data is further broken out by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP measure we offer to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 37.4% of applicable revenues in the third quarter. This is a 10 basis point improvement from the same period 1 year ago, as higher pay/bill spreads offset slightly lower temp-to-hire conversion revenues.
Third quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.4% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is down modestly from last year's 10.0%. This modest mix shift caused overall staffing gross margin to decrease by 20 basis points versus 1 year ago to 43.3%.
Gross margin for Protiviti was $67 million in the third quarter or 30.9% of Protiviti revenues. Last year's third quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $66 million or 32.9% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 32.7% of staffing revenues in the third quarter compared to 32.1% in the third quarter 1 year ago.
SG&A costs for Protiviti in the third quarter were 17.9% of Protiviti revenues versus 17.2% of Protiviti revenues in the same period last year.
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $118 million in the third quarter, producing an operating margin of 10.5%. This compares to an operating margin of 11.5% in last year's third quarter. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $98 million in operating income, resulting in an operating margin of 9.6%.
Operating income for our permanent placement division was $20 million in the third quarter, producing an operating margin of 19.3%. 
Third quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $28 million, yielding an operating margin of 13.0%.
Accounts receivable were $743 million at the end of the third quarter. Implied days sales outstanding, or DSO, was 50.5 days.
During the quarter, we successfully implemented a new front-office CRM system for all U.S. staffing branches and a new project management system for Protiviti. The conversions went smoothly, and the related disruption and out-of-pocket costs were at the low end of our previous range. We estimate that revenues and EPS for the quarter were impacted by $9 million and $0.05 per share, respectively.
Before we move to fourth quarter guidance, I'd like to talk about the monthly trends we saw in the third quarter and thus far, in October.
Globally, year-over-year revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions decelerated during the third quarter, and we exited the quarter with September revenues roughly flat versus the prior year compared to a 2% increase for the full quarter. Revenue growth for our staffing and consulting services in the first 2 weeks of October was down 1.5% compared to the prior year.
Global permanent placement revenue growth rates also decelerated during the first part of the third quarter, with September down 4% compared to the 5% decline for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks of October, permanent placement revenues increased 1% compared to the same period last year. All of these trends I described have been normalized for billing days and currency. As you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time. With that said, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: revenues, $1,250,000,000 to $1,310,000,000; income per share, $0.60 to $0.66. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.
Now I'll turn it back to Max."

The U.S. economy added fewer jobs in September than economists had expected, and the unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 5%. Unemployment levels in the professional fields we serve remain much lower than the overall U.S. rate, but we do continue to see our clients taking longer to make hiring decisions. We have talked about this longer time frame on prior conference calls. Internationally, we continued to see solid growth in many countries, most notably, Germany.
Businesses' appetite for specialized talent in areas important to their growth and profitability remained intact. The -- for computer systems design and related services, for example, the average unemployment rate in the United States is 2.3%. Overall, the average unemployment rate for college degree workers 25 or older is now 2.5%. Employers continue to encounter a widening skills gap in key areas, and they need help finding professionals who are a fit with their needs and work environment.
We were pleased with the results for Protiviti. Protiviti has been doing solid business in all of its practice areas, and it currently works with 70% of Fortune 100 companies. Their sweet spot, of course, is teaming with clients to protect and enhance enterprise value by identifying, anticipating and solving critical business problems.

And related to that, if you saw client taking even more time as the quarter progressed, you've spoken about that during the second quarter, so I just wondered if that's changed or if it's gotten incrementally longer?

On the pace of deceleration, I'd say that July, we actually ended July stronger than we began it. We were encouraged by that. August wasn't bad. But then September, where we usually start getting a sequential lift in September, we didn't see the lift we typically get. Instead, it was sequentially about flat. And then again, traditionally, we get even more lift yet again in October, and we didn't see that lift either. So it's essentially sequential flattening starting in July rather than the lift we typically see in September and early October. The issue around clients taking more time, I mean, clearly, they remain cautious with little sense of urgency. It's in part due to macro uncertainty, a part due to election uncertainty. They cite budget pressures. They cite cost control measures. They, therefore, get even more selective. They only want your ideal candidates. That in turn pressures candidates supply when they're only looking for the top tranche of the candidate pool you have. They spend more time vetting, they want us to do more interviews. It's not that we have an absence of orders. It's more that the orders that we do have, it just takes longer to get a start if we're on the temp side or it's longer to make a placement if we're on the firm side. So frankly, Mark, it's a continuation of what we've talked about for 2 or 3 quarters, notwithstanding the easier comps. On the Protiviti side, they had very tough comps. Notwithstanding those comps, they still grew mid-single digits. Generally speaking, we were pleased relative to expectations on Protiviti. As to CRM, we were very pleased with the conversion. That happened the week of August 22. Most of the impact, frankly, was during the weeks preceding that where all the training took place, where we essentially took our best producers out of production as they train the trainers, who in turn trained our staff. So from a financial impact where we first estimated the 0.5 day to 1.5 days on the staffing side, it came in closer to a half a day. Protiviti came in virtually precisely where we estimated it to be. So from a revenue standpoint, the 9 million splits out to [ph] 7 million staffing, 2 million Protiviti. The gross margin of 5 million impact breaks out between 3 million, staffing; 2 million, Protiviti. The SG&A impact was about what we expected at 4.5, and that splits out 3.5 staffing; 1 million, Protiviti. So virtually no surprises on the out-of-pocket cost impact. The revenue disruption impact actually better than we expected. It was quite a large undertaking. We're elated to have it behind us, and we're elated with the capabilities it has and provides to us as we move forward."

I'd say short term, Mark, this isn't about getting more short-term productivity. Short term, it's more about replacing our old 15-year legacy system with something we could maintain, with something that provided global mobile access because it's cloud-based; with something as we move forward in time, as we provide more and more digital services to complement our traditional services, we needed an infrastructure that would facilitate that.

But one thing we did look at, we have not only bill rates, which by the way, were up 3.5% this quarter year-over-year, which is down a bit from, I believe, it was 4.8% last quarter. So we not only look at bill rate trends, but we also looked at hours billed trends. And while they've gone slightly negative and are projected to go slightly negative in the fourth quarter, if you look back at 2001 and if you look it back at 2008, they fell much more abruptly than what's implied in what we forecast.

So by vertical, I'd say generally speaking, the trend lines you saw during the third quarter would remain intact during the fourth, such that from a staffing perspective, we would see a decline of about 1% year-over-year same-day, constant currency. However, there is 1 fewer day this year than last. There will be a little bit of currency drag so that on a reported basis, your staffing growth rates would be about -- would be down about 3%. And again, the embedded 1% same-day, constant currency is at about the rate we started the quarter. Protiviti gross on a mid-single-digit rate versus their 15% tough year-ago comps. Gross margin, encouragingly, we believe temp gross margins will be up 30 to 50 basis points in the fourth quarter. We had much better-than-expected experience with our state unemployment costs. We've been conservative for the first part of the year, which will give us some benefit in the fourth quarter. That 30 to 50 basis point improvement does not include potential even further improvement when we get our semiannual workers' comp review, so maybe there's some upside there. Protiviti, similar to the third quarter on a year-on-year basis, their gross margin would be down a couple of points because they've got less mix of a higher-margin FSI, which we've talked about in the past. But again, that's consistent with what we just saw on the SG&A side, on staffing, the dollars year-on-year would be about flat, but as I talked about on a reported basis, you've got revenues down 3% so that's going to create some negative leverage of around 1 point or 100 basis points. Protiviti SG&A would also be up about 100 basis points. Their marketing costs are intended to be higher. They've got higher administrative costs to support their higher headcount. So if you look at our projected operating margins on the temp side, would be down 50 to 70 basis points as the higher gross margin gets offset with the negative leverage in SG&A. Perm would be down about 1 percentage point, same reason. Protiviti would be down 3 to 4 percentage points, still double digit versus a very high 14% a year ago. The tax rate is going to be higher this year than last. We're thinking in the 37.5% range for the fourth quarter. Last year, it was low at 35.3% because we got some discrete credits that won't repeat. Shares before consideration or further buybacks would be in the 127 5 [ph] range."

The U.S. was solid. Non-U.S. was very strong. Australia, Japan, solid in EU. So from a revenue standpoint, Protiviti's third quarter was pretty much spot on what we had expected. They had some gross margin compression, and that compression was less than we expected, actually quite a bit less than we expected. They did a very good job controlling their costs. The used fewer contractors, which is a variable portion of their cost structure. They had fewer experienced hires come on board. So Protiviti, from a profitability standpoint in the third quarter, while not as much as the year ago, which was a tough comps, it was actually pretty significantly better than the guidance we had given for the third quarter. Fourth quarter were still embedded and are guided just mid-single-digit growth. The comps a year ago were again very tough, 15% growth. Profitability remains double digit, notwithstanding it's a even shorter quarter for Protiviti because many of their clients have a soft close between Christmas and New Year's, which shortens the effective length of their quarter even more. So clearly, as we've talked about on prior calls, their FSI clients have gotten more cost conscious. That's resulted in fewer hours for us. The hours that we do have are at somewhat lower rates.

That said, I'd rather start better than the prior quarter than worse, which we did. However, our guidance does assume that there would be slight negative year-over-year growth in perm. Temp to hire traditionally follows perm. So just as perm was a little softer than temp this quarter, so was temp to hire as it -- as compared to temp hours billed. It's all about ultimately full-time hiring the environment for full time hiring, one follows the other.

Now let's discuss Robert Half's third quarter 2016 results. Revenues for the quarter were $1.339 billion, up 2% from the third quarter 1 year ago. Income per share was $0.71 compared to $0.73 in last year's third quarter. Cash flow from operations was $153 million, and capital expenditures were $20 million in the third quarter.
We paid our stockholders a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share on September 15, for a total cash outlay of $28 million. We also repurchased 1.2 million Robert Half shares during the quarter at a cost of $46 million. We have 7.5 million shares still available for repurchase under our board authorized stock repurchase plan.
We saw solid demand in the third quarter, particularly for our accounting- and finance-related professional staffing and consulting services. Our Accountemps and Robert Half Management Resources staffing divisions and Protiviti reported the highest year-over-year revenue gains. Our international operations also posted strong results. Unlevered return on equity for the company remained strong at 33%.
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our third quarter results."

As Max mentioned, global revenues were $1.339 billion in the third quarter. This is up 2% from the third quarter 1 year ago on both a reported and same-day, constant currency basis.
Let's break this out between our staffing business and Protiviti. Global staffing revenues were up 1% in the third quarter on a same-day, constant currency basis from 1 year ago. U.S. staffing revenues were $890 million, roughly flat with last year; and non-U.S. staffing revenues were $231 million, up 7% when adjusted for billing days and exchange rates. We have 326 staffing locations worldwide, including 84 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
The third quarter had 64.1 billing days compared to 64.2 days in last year's third quarter. The fourth quarter has 61.4 billing days compared to 62.3 days in the fourth quarter of 2015.  
In the third quarter, currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $3 million. Exchange rates decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.3%.
Third quarter global revenues for Protiviti were $217 million, including $183 million in the United States and $34 million outside the U.S. Overall revenues for Protiviti were up 8% from 1 year ago on a same-day, constant currency basis. U.S. revenues were up 6%, and non-U.S. revenues were up 17% from last year's third quarter. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $300,000 in the third quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.2%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries.
Along with our earnings release today, you'll find a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day, constant currency basis. This data is further broken out by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP measure we offer to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 37.4% of applicable revenues in the third quarter. This is a 10 basis point improvement from the same period 1 year ago, as higher pay/bill spreads offset slightly lower temp-to-hire conversion revenues.
Third quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.4% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is down modestly from last year's 10.0%. This modest mix shift caused overall staffing gross margin to decrease by 20 basis points versus 1 year ago to 43.3%.
Gross margin for Protiviti was $67 million in the third quarter or 30.9% of Protiviti revenues. Last year's third quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $66 million or 32.9% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 32.7% of staffing revenues in the third quarter compared to 32.1% in the third quarter 1 year ago.
SG&A costs for Protiviti in the third quarter were 17.9% of Protiviti revenues versus 17.2% of Protiviti revenues in the same period last year.
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $118 million in the third quarter, producing an operating margin of 10.5%. This compares to an operating margin of 11.5% in last year's third quarter. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $98 million in operating income, resulting in an operating margin of 9.6%.
Operating income for our permanent placement division was $20 million in the third quarter, producing an operating margin of 19.3%. 
Third quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $28 million, yielding an operating margin of 13.0%.
Accounts receivable were $743 million at the end of the third quarter. Implied days sales outstanding, or DSO, was 50.5 days.
During the quarter, we successfully implemented a new front-office CRM system for all U.S. staffing branches and a new project management system for Protiviti. The conversions went smoothly, and the related disruption and out-of-pocket costs were at the low end of our previous range. We estimate that revenues and EPS for the quarter were impacted by $9 million and $0.05 per share, respectively.
Before we move to fourth quarter guidance, I'd like to talk about the monthly trends we saw in the third quarter and thus far, in October.
Globally, year-over-year revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions decelerated during the third quarter, and we exited the quarter with September revenues roughly flat versus the prior year compared to a 2% increase for the full quarter. Revenue growth for our staffing and consulting services in the first 2 weeks of October was down 1.5% compared to the prior year.
Global permanent placement revenue growth rates also decelerated during the first part of the third quarter, with September down 4% compared to the 5% decline for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks of October, permanent placement revenues increased 1% compared to the same period last year. All of these trends I described have been normalized for billing days and currency. As you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time. With that said, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: revenues, $1,250,000,000 to $1,310,000,000; income per share, $0.60 to $0.66. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.
Now I'll turn it back to Max."

The U.S. economy added fewer jobs in September than economists had expected, and the unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 5%. Unemployment levels in the professional fields we serve remain much lower than the overall U.S. rate, but we do continue to see our clients taking longer to make hiring decisions. We have talked about this longer time frame on prior conference calls. Internationally, we continued to see solid growth in many countries, most notably, Germany.
Businesses' appetite for specialized talent in areas important to their growth and profitability remained intact. The -- for computer systems design and related services, for example, the average unemployment rate in the United States is 2.3%. Overall, the average unemployment rate for college degree workers 25 or older is now 2.5%.

And related to that, if you saw client taking even more time as the quarter progressed, you've spoken about that during the second quarter, so I just wondered if that's changed or if it's gotten incrementally longer? And then also if you could address specifically how the implementation of the CRM system ended up impacting the quarter, just in terms of from a time frame perspective when everything was completed? And what sort of results you're seeing from that new implementation?"

On the pace of deceleration, I'd say that July, we actually ended July stronger than we began it. We were encouraged by that. August wasn't bad. But then September, where we usually start getting a sequential lift in Septembe",466,"Okay, several questions here. On the pace of deceleration, I'd say that July, we actually ended July stronger than we began it. We were encouraged by that. August wasn't bad. But then September, where we usually start getting a sequential lift in September, we didn't see the lift we typically get. Instead, it was sequentially about flat. And then again, traditionally, we get even more lift yet again in October, and we didn't see that lift either. So it's essentially sequential flattening starting in July rather than the lift we typically see in September and early October. The issue around clients taking more time, I mean, clearly, they remain cautious with little sense of urgency. It's in part due to macro uncertainty, a part due to election uncertainty. They cite budget pressures. They cite cost control measures. They, therefore, get even more selective. They only want your ideal candidates. That in turn pressures candidates supply when they're only looking for the top tranche of the candidate pool you have. They spend more time vetting, they want us to do more interviews. It's not that we have an absence of orders. It's more that the orders that we do have, it just takes longer to get a start if we're on the temp side or it's longer to make a placement if we're on the firm side. So frankly, Mark, it's a continuation of what we've talked about for 2 or 3 quarters, notwithstanding the easier comps. On the Protiviti side, they had very tough comps. Notwithstanding those comps, they still grew mid-single digits. Generally speaking, we were pleased relative to expectations on Protiviti. As to CRM, we were very pleased with the conversion. That happened the week of August 22. Most of the impact, frankly, was during the weeks preceding that where all the training took place, where we essentially took our best producers out of production as they train the trainers, who in turn trained our staff. So from a financial impact where we first estimated the 0.5 day to 1.5 days on the staffing side, it came in closer to a half a day. Protiviti came in virtually precisely where we estimated it to be. So from a revenue standpoint, the 9 million splits out to 7 million staffing, 2 million Protiviti. The gross margin of 5 million impact breaks out between 3 million, staffing; 2 million, Protiviti. The SG&A impact was about what we expected at 4.5, and that splits out 3.5 staffing; 1 million, Protiviti. So virtually no surprises on the out-of-pocket cost impact. The revenue disruption impact actually better than we expected. It was quite a large undertaking. We're elated to have it behind us, and we're elated with the capabilities it has and provides to us as we move forward."

I'd say short term, Mark, this isn't about getting more short-term productivity. Short term, it's more about replacing our old 15-year legacy system with something we could maintain, with something that provided global mobile access because it's cloud-based; with something as we move forward in time, as we provide more and more digital services to complement our traditional services, we needed an infrastructure that would facilitate that. So this isn't a short-term productivity play. It's more a long-term, make it easier to support, make it less expensive to support, but more importantly, we needed a platform that we could integrate to the client and candidate-facing services that we intend to provide."

So by vertical, I'd say generally speaking, the trend lines you saw during the third quarter would remain intact during the fourth, such that from a staffing perspective, we would see a decline of about 1% year-over-year same-day, constant currency. However, there is 1 fewer day this year than last. There will be a little bit of currency drag so that on a reported basis, your staffing growth rates would be about -- would be down about 3%. And again, the embedded 1% same-day, constant currency is at about the rate we started the quarter. Protiviti gross on a mid-single-digit rate versus their 15% tough year-ago comps. Gross margin, encouragingly, we believe temp gross margins will be up 30 to 50 basis points in the fourth quarter. We had much better-than-expected experience with our state unemployment costs. We've been conservative for the first part of the year, which will give us some benefit in the fourth quarter. That 30 to 50 basis point improvement does not include potential even further improvement when we get our semiannual workers' comp review, so maybe there's some upside there. Protiviti, similar to the third quarter on a year-on-year basis, their gross margin would be down a couple of points because they've got less mix of a higher-margin FSI, which we've talked about in the past. But again, that's consistent with what we just saw on the SG&A side, on staffing, the dollars year-on-year would be about flat, but as I talked about on a reported basis, you've got revenues down 3% so that's going to create some negative leverage of around 1 point or 100 basis points. Protiviti SG&A would also be up about 100 basis points. Their marketing costs are intended to be higher. They've got higher administrative costs to support their higher headcount. So if you look at our projected operating margins on the temp side, would be down 50 to 70 basis points as the higher gross margin gets offset with the negative leverage in SG&A. Perm would be down about 1 percentage point, same reason. Protiviti would be down 3 to 4 percentage points, still double digit versus a very high 14% a year ago. The tax rate is going to be higher this year than last. We're thinking in the 37.5% range for the fourth quarter. Last year, it was low at 35.3% because we got some discrete credits that won't repeat. Shares before consideration or further buybacks would be in the 127 5 range."

The U.S. was solid. Non-U.S. was very strong. Australia, Japan, solid in EU. So from a revenue standpoint, Protiviti's third quarter was pretty much spot on what we expected. They had some gross margin compression, and that compression was less than we expected, actually quite a bit less than we expected. They did a very good job controlling their costs. They used fewer contractors, which is a variable portion of their cost structure. They had fewer experienced hires come on board. So Protiviti, from a profitability standpoint in the third quarter, while not as much as the year ago, which was a tough comp, it was actually pretty significantly better than the guidance we had given for the third quarter. Fourth quarter were still embedded and are guided just mid-single-digit growth. The comps a year ago were again very tough, 15% growth. Profitability remains double digit, notwithstanding it's even shorter quarter for Protiviti because many of their clients have a soft close between Christmas and New Year's, which shortens the effective length of their quarter even more. So clearly, as we've talked about on prior calls, their FSI clients have gotten more cost conscious. That's resulted in fewer hours for us. The hours that we do have are at somewhat lower rates. But overall, all things considered, we were very pleased with the quarter Protiviti had and the one that we're projecting for the fourth."

Now let's discuss Robert Half's third quarter 2016 results. Revenues for the quarter were $1.339 billion, up 2% from the third quarter 1 year ago. Income per share was $0.71 compared to $0.73 in last year's third quarter. Cash flow from operations was $153 million, and capital expenditures were $20 million in the third quarter.
We paid our stockholders a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share on September 15, for a total cash outlay of $28 million. We also repurchased 1.2 million Robert Half shares during the quarter at a cost of $46 million. We have 7.5 million shares still available for repurchase under our board authorized stock repurchase plan.
We saw solid demand in the third quarter, particularly for our accounting and finance-related professional staffing and consulting services. Our Accountemps and Robert Half Management Resources staffing divisions and Protiviti reported the highest year-over-year revenue gains. Our international operations also posted strong results. Unlevered return on equity for the company remains strong at 33%.
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our third quarter results."

As Max mentioned, global revenues were $1.339 billion in the third quarter. This is up 2% from the third quarter 1 year ago on both a reported and same-day, constant currency basis.
Let's break this out between our staffing business and Protiviti. Global staffing revenues were up 1% in the third quarter on a same-day, constant currency basis from 1 year ago. U.S. staffing revenues were $890 million, roughly flat with last year; and non-U.S. staffing revenues were $231 million, up 7% when adjusted for billing days and exchange rates. We have 326 staffing locations worldwide, including 84 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
The third quarter had 64.1 billing days compared to 64.2 days in last year's third quarter. The fourth quarter has 61.4 billing days compared to 62.3 days in the fourth quarter of 2015.  
In the third quarter, currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $3 million. Exchange rates decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.3%.
Third quarter global revenues for Protiviti were $217 million, including $183 million in the United States and $34 million outside the U.S. Overall revenues for Protiviti were up 8% from 1 year ago on a same-day, constant currency basis. U.S. revenues were up 6%, and non-U.S. revenues were up 17% from last year's third quarter. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $300,000 in the third quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.2%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries.
Along with our earnings release today, you'll find a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day, constant currency basis. This data is further broken out by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP measure we offer to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 37.4% of applicable revenues in the third quarter. This is a 10 basis point improvement from the same period 1 year ago, as higher pay/bill spreads offset slightly lower temp-to-hire conversion revenues.
Third quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.4% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is down modestly from last year's 10.0%. This modest mix shift caused overall staffing gross margin to decrease by 20 basis points versus 1 year ago to 43.3%.
Gross margin for Protiviti was $67 million in the third quarter or 30.9% of Protiviti revenues. Last year's third quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $66 million or 32.9% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 32.7% of staffing revenues in the third quarter compared to 32.1% in the third quarter 1 year ago.
SG&A costs for Protiviti in the third quarter were 17.9% of Protiviti revenues versus 17.2% of Protiviti revenues in the same period last year.
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $118 million in the third quarter, producing an operating margin of 10.5%. This compares to an operating margin of 11.5% in last year's third quarter. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $98 million in operating income, resulting in an operating margin of 9.6%.
Operating income for our permanent placement division was $20 million in the third quarter, producing an operating margin of 19.3%. 
Third quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $28 million, yielding an operating margin of 13.0%.
Accounts receivable were $743 million at the end of the third quarter. Implied days sales outstanding, or DSO, was 50.5 days.
During the quarter, we successfully implemented a new front-office CRM system for all U.S. staffing branches and a new project management system for Protiviti. The conversions went smoothly and the related disruption and out-of-pocket costs were at the low end of our previous range. We estimate that revenues and EPS for the quarter were impacted by $9 million and $0.05 per share, respectively.
Before we move to fourth quarter guidance, I'd like to talk about the monthly trends we saw in the third quarter and thus far, in October.
Globally, year-over-year revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions decelerated during the third quarter, and we exited the quarter with September revenues roughly flat versus the prior year compared to a 2% increase for the full quarter. Revenue growth for our staffing and consulting services in the first 2 weeks of October was down 1.5% compared to the prior year.
Global permanent placement revenue growth rates also decelerated during the first part of the third quarter, with September down 4% compared to the 5% decline for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks of October, permanent placement revenues increased 1% compared to the same period last year. All of these trends I describe have been normalized for billing days and currency. As you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time. With that said, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: revenues, $1,250,000,000 to $1,310,000,000; income per share, $0.60 to $0.66. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.
Now I'll turn it back to Max."

The U.S. economy added fewer jobs in September than economists had expected, and the unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 5%. Unemployment levels in the professional fields we serve remain much lower than the overall U.S. rate, but we do continue to see our clients taking longer to make hiring decisions. We have talked about this longer time frame on prior conference calls. Internationally, we continued to see solid growth in many countries, most notably, Germany.
Businesses' appetite for specialized talent in areas important to their growth and profitability remain intact. The -- for computer systems design and related services, for example, the average unemployment rate in the United States is 2.3%. Overall, the average unemployment rate for college degree workers 25 or older is now 2.5%. Employers continue to encounter a widening skills gap in key areas, and they need help finding professionals who are a fit with their needs and work environment.
We were pleased with the results for Protiviti. Protiviti has been doing solid business in all of its practice areas, and it currently works with 70% of Fortune 100 companies.

On the pace of deceleration, I'd say that July, we actually ended July stronger than we began it. We were encouraged by that. August wasn't bad. But then September, where we usually start getting a sequential lift in September, we didn't see the lift we typically get. Instead, it was sequentially about flat. And then again, traditionally, we get even more lift yet again in October, and we didn't see that lift either. So it's essentially sequential flattening starting in July rather than the lift we typically see in September and early October. The issue around clients taking more time, I mean, clearly, they remain cautious with little sense of urgency. It's in part due to macro uncertainty, a part due to election uncertainty. They cite budget pressures. They cite cost control measures. They, therefore, get even more selective. They only want your ideal candidates. That in turn pressures candidate supply when they're only looking for the top tranche of the candidate pool you have. They spend more time vetting, they want us to do more interviews. It's not that we have an absence of orders. It's more that the orders that we do have, it just takes longer to get a start if we're on the temp side or it's longer to make a placement if we're on the perm side. So frankly, Mark, it's a continuation of what we've talked about for 2 or 3 quarters, notwithstanding the easier comps. On the Protiviti side, they had very tough comps. Notwithstanding those comps, they still grew mid-single digits. Generally speaking, we were pleased relative to expectations on Protiviti. As to CRM, we were very pleased with the conversion. That happened the week of August 22. Most of the impact, frankly, was during the weeks preceding that where all the training took place, where we essentially took our best producers out of production as they trained the trainers, who in turn trained our staff. So from a financial impact where we first estimated 0.5 day to 1.5 days on the staffing side, it came in closer to 0.5 day. Protiviti came in virtually precisely where we estimated it to be. So from a revenue standpoint, the $9 million splits out to $7 million staffing, $2 million Protiviti. The gross margin of $5 million impact breaks out between $3 million, staffing; $2 million, Protiviti. The SG&A impact was about what we expected at $4.5 million, and that splits out $3.5 million staffing; $1 million, Protiviti. So virtually no surprises on the out-of-pocket cost impact. The revenue disruption impact actually better than we expected. It was quite a large undertaking. We're elated to have it behind us, and we're elated with the capabilities it has and provides to us as we move forward."

I'd say short term, Mark, this isn't about getting more short-term productivity. Short term, it's more about replacing our old 15-year legacy system with something we could maintain, with something that provided global mobile access because it's cloud-based; with something as we move forward in time, as we provide more and more digital services to complement our traditional services, we needed an infrastructure that would facilitate that. So this isn't a short-term productivity play.

But one thing we did look at, we have not only bill rates, which by the way, were up 3.5% this quarter year-over-year, which is down a bit from, I believe, it was 4.8% last quarter. So we not only looked at bill rate trends, but we also looked at hours billed trends. And while they've gone slightly negative and are projected to go slightly negative in the fourth quarter, if you look back at 2001 and if you look it back at 2008, they fell much more abruptly than what's implied in what we forecast.

So by vertical, I'd say, generally speaking, the trend lines you saw during the third quarter would remain intact during the fourth, such that from a staffing perspective, we would see a decline of about 1% year-over-year, same-day, constant currency. However, there is 1 fewer day this year than last. There will be a little bit of currency drag so that on a reported basis, your staffing growth rates would be about -- would be down about 3%. And again, the embedded 1% same-day, constant currency is at about the rate we started the quarter. Protiviti grows on a mid-single-digit rate versus their 15% tough year-ago comps. Gross margin, encouragingly, we believe temp gross margins will be up 30 to 50 basis points in the fourth quarter. We've had much better-than-expected experience with our state unemployment costs. We've been conservative for the first part of the year, which will give us some benefit in the fourth quarter. That 30 to 50 basis point improvement does not include potential even further improvement when we get our semiannual workers' comp review, so maybe there's some upside there. Protiviti, similar to the third quarter on a year-on-year basis, their gross margin would be down a couple of points because they've got less mix of the higher-margin FSI, which we've talked about in the past. But again, that's consistent with what we just saw on the SG&A side, on staffing, the dollars year-on-year would be about flat, but as I talked about on a reported basis, you've got revenues down 3% so that's going to create some negative leverage of around 1 point or 100 basis points. Protiviti SG&A would also be up about 100 basis points. Their marketing costs are intended to be higher. They've got higher administrative costs to support their higher headcount. So if you look at our projected operating margins, on the temp side would be down 50 to 70 basis points as the higher gross margin gets offset with the negative leverage in SG&A. Perm would be down about 1 percentage point, same reason. Protiviti would be down 3 to 4 percentage points, still double digit versus a very high 14% a year ago. The tax rate is going to be higher this year than last. We're thinking in the 37.5% range for the fourth quarter. Last year, it was low at 35.3% because we got some discrete credits that won't repeat. Shares before consideration of further buybacks would be in the 127.5 million [ph] range."

The U.S. was solid. Non-U.S. was very strong. Australia, Japan, solid in EU. So from a revenue standpoint, Protiviti's third quarter was pretty much spot on what we expected. They had some gross margin compression, and that compression was less than we expected, actually quite a bit less than we expected. They did a very good job controlling their costs. They used fewer contractors, which is a variable portion of their cost structure. They had fewer experienced hires come on board. So Protiviti, from a profitability standpoint in the third quarter, while not as much as the year ago, which was a tough comp, it was actually pretty significantly better than the guidance we had given for the third quarter. Fourth quarter, we're still -- embedded in our guidance is mid-single-digit growth. The comps a year ago were again very tough, 15% growth. Profitability remains double digit, notwithstanding it's an even shorter quarter for Protiviti because many of their clients have a soft close between Christmas and New Year's, which shortens the effective length of their quarter even more. So clearly, as we've talked about on prior calls, their FSI clients have gotten more cost conscious. That's resulted in fewer hours for us. The hours that we do have are at somewhat lower rates.

And second, this was the seventh consecutive quarter where revenue came in at or below the midpoint of your guidance range. And I have 2 questions. First of all, why is -- I want to get a better understanding of why fourth quarter guidance is so much weaker than normal, even when you're coming off a third quarter that had some disruption effect that's going away? And the other question is what is preventing you from making your revenue guidance ranges more conservative than they've been for almost 2 years?"

We're simply looking at current trends all the way through last week. And based on their trend -- those trends, based on the discussions we've had with our field management teams, those are the calls we've made. I'd say as to missing the midpoint of revenue guidance, we've clearly done much better than you referenced at the bottom line. And I would also say that most of those misses, as you call them, have been 1% or 2% misses. So I think for context, we need to talk about the extent of the misses. But further, I'd say we call it like it is. And we're not sand baggers, we're not back slappers, and so we try to call it like it is, and we're close. We're usually within 1% or 2% of the revenues, and we're usually at or above the EPS. But where I grew up, coming 98% or 99% of $1 billion more revenue estimate for the quarter isn't bad."

To some degree, Robert Half Technology is more project-driven than Accountemps. Protiviti is certainly more project-driven than, traditionally, Accountemps. To the extent we've added these additional non-Accountemps services, to some degree, there's a little more volatility because they're more project-driven. But Accountemps itself, I don't think it's gotten anymore variable or volatile. And the classic split between how accounting operations performs within Accountemps versus how the more staff accountant or financial positions perform within Accountemps, they're all pretty consistent. And I might add that in the third quarter just ended, we reported pretty decent growth in our finance and accounting divisions. It was the non-finance and accounting divisions that lowered those rates somewhat."

That said, I'd rather start better than the prior quarter than worse, which we did. However, our guidance does assume that there would be slight negative year-over-year growth in perm. Temp-to-hire traditionally follows perm. So just as perm was a little softer than temp this quarter, so was temp-to-hire as it -- as compared to temp hours billed. It's all about, ultimately full-time hiring, the environment for full-time hiring, one follows the other. Clearly, temp-to-hire in this cycle has been somewhat anemic as has perm generally, but that was also the case in Q3 just ended."

We also repurchased 1.2 million Robert Half shares during the quarter at a cost of $46 million. We have 7.5 million shares still available for repurchase under our board authorized stock repurchase plan.
We saw solid demand in the third quarter, particularly for our accounting and finance-related professional staffing and consulting services. Our Accountemps and Robert Half Management Resources staffing divisions and Protiviti reported the highest year-over-year revenue gains. Our international operations also posted strong results. Unlevered return on equity for the company remains strong at 33%.
I'll turn the call over to Keith now for a closer look at our third quarter results."

As Max mentioned, global revenues were $1.339 billion in the third quarter. This is up 2% from the third quarter 1 year ago on both a reported and same-day, constant currency basis.
Let's break this out between our staffing business and Protiviti. Global staffing revenues were up 1% in the third quarter on a same-day, constant currency basis from 1 year ago. U.S. staffing revenues were $890 million, roughly flat with last year; and non-U.S. staffing revenues were $231 million, up 7% when adjusted for billing days and exchange rates. We have 326 staffing locations worldwide, including 84 locations in 17 countries outside the United States.
The third quarter had 64.1 billing days compared to 64.2 days in last year's third quarter. The fourth quarter has 61.4 billing days compared to 62.3 days in the fourth quarter of 2015.  
In the third quarter, currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing reported year-over-year staffing revenues by $3 million. Exchange rates decreased year-over-year reported staffing growth rates by 0.3%.
Third quarter global revenues for Protiviti were $217 million, including $183 million in the United States and $34 million outside the U.S. Overall revenues for Protiviti were up 8% from 1 year ago on a same-day, constant currency basis. U.S. revenues were up 6%, and non-U.S. revenues were up 17% from last year's third quarter. Exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year-over-year Protiviti revenues by $300,000 in the third quarter and decreasing the year-over-year reported growth rate by 0.2%. Protiviti and its independently owned Member Firms serve clients through a network of 75 locations in 25 countries.
Along with our earnings release today, you'll find a supplemental schedule showing year-over-year revenue growth rates on both a reported and same-day, constant currency basis. This data is further broken out by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. This is a non-GAAP measure we offer to provide insight into certain revenue trends in our operations.
Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was 37.4% of applicable revenues in the third quarter. This is a 10 basis point improvement from the same period 1 year ago, as higher pay/bill spreads offset slightly lower temp-to-hire conversion revenues.
Third quarter revenues for our permanent placement operations were 9.4% of consolidated staffing revenues, which is down modestly from last year's 10.0%. This modest mix shift caused overall staffing gross margin to decrease by 20 basis points versus 1 year ago to 43.3%.
Gross margin for Protiviti was $67 million in the third quarter or 30.9% of Protiviti revenues. Last year's third quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $66 million or 32.9% of Protiviti revenues.
Staffing SG&A costs were 32.7% of staffing revenues in the third quarter compared to 32.1% in the third quarter 1 year ago.
SG&A costs for Protiviti in the third quarter were 17.9% of Protiviti revenues versus 17.2% of Protiviti revenues in the same period last year.
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $118 million in the third quarter, producing an operating margin of 10.5%. This compares to an operating margin of 11.5% in last year's third quarter. Our temporary and consulting staffing divisions reported $98 million in operating income, resulting in an operating margin of 9.6%.
Operating income for our permanent placement division was $20 million in the third quarter, producing an operating margin of 19.3%. 
Third quarter operating profit for Protiviti was $28 million, yielding an operating margin of 13.0%.
Accounts receivable were $743 million at the end of the third quarter. Implied days sales outstanding, or DSO, was 50.5 days.
During the quarter, we successfully implemented a new front-office CRM system for all U.S. staffing branches and a new project management system for Protiviti. The conversions went smoothly and the related disruption and out-of-pocket costs were at the low end of our previous range. We estimate that revenues and EPS for the quarter were impacted by $9 million and $0.05 per share, respectively.
Before we move to fourth quarter guidance, I'd like to talk about the monthly trends we saw in the third quarter and thus far, in October.
Globally, year-over-year revenue growth rates for our temporary and consulting staffing divisions decelerated during the third quarter, and we exited the quarter with September revenues roughly flat versus the prior year compared to a 2% increase for the full quarter. Revenue growth for our staffing and consulting services in the first 2 weeks of October was down 1.5% compared to the prior year.
Global permanent placement revenue growth rates also decelerated during the first part of the third quarter, with September down 4% compared to the 5% decline for the full quarter. For the first 3 weeks of October, permanent placement revenues increased 1% compared to the same period last year. All of these trends I describe have been normalized for billing days and currency. As you know, we hesitate to read too much into these numbers as they represent very brief periods of time. With that said, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: revenues, $1,250,000,000 to $1,310,000,000; income per share, $0.60 to $0.66. We limit our guidance to 1 quarter. All estimates we provide on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release and in our SEC filings.
Now I'll turn it back to Max."

The U.S. economy added fewer jobs in September than economists had expected, and the unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 5%. Unemployment levels in the professional fields we serve remain much lower than the overall U.S. rate, but we do continue to see our clients taking longer to make hiring decisions. We have talked about this longer time frame on prior conference calls. Internationally, we continued to see solid growth in many countries, most notably, Germany.
Businesses' appetite for specialized talent in areas important to their growth and profitability remain intact. The -- for computer systems design and related services, for example, the average unemployment rate in the United States is 2.3%. Overall, the average unemployment rate for college degree workers 25 or older is now 2.5%. Employers continue to encounter a widening skills gap in key areas, and they need help finding professionals who are a fit with their needs and work environment.
We were pleased with the results for Protiviti. Protiviti has been doing solid business in all of its practice areas, and it currently works with 70% of Fortune 100 companies. Their sweet spot, of course, is teaming with clients to protect and enhance enterprise value by identifying, anticipating and solving critical business problems.

On the pace of deceleration, I'd say that July, we actually ended July stronger than we began it. We were encouraged by that. August wasn't bad. But then September, where we usually start getting a sequential lift in September, we didn't see the lift we typically get. Instead, it was sequentially about flat. And then again, traditionally, we get even more lift yet again in October, and we didn't see that lift either. So it's essentially sequential flattening starting in July rather than the lift we typically see in September and early October. The issue around clients taking more time, I mean, clearly, they remain cautious with little sense of urgency. It's in part due to macro uncertainty, a part due to election uncertainty. They cite budget pressures. They cite cost control measures. They, therefore, get even more selective. They only want your ideal candidates. That in turn pressures candidate supply when they're only looking for the top tranche of the candidate pool you have. They spend more time vetting, they want us to do more interviews. It's not that we have an absence of orders. It's more that the orders that we do have, it just takes longer to get a start if we're on the temp side or it's longer to make a placement if we're on the perm side. So frankly, Mark, it's a continuation of what we've talked about for 2 or 3 quarters, notwithstanding the easier comps. On the Protiviti side, they had very tough comps. Notwithstanding those comps, they still grew mid-single digits. Generally speaking, we were pleased relative to expectations on Protiviti. As to CRM, we were very pleased with the conversion. That happened the week of August 22. Most of the impact, frankly, was during the weeks preceding that where all the training took place, where we essentially took our best producers out of production as they trained the trainers, who in turn trained our staff. So from a financial impact where we first estimated 0.5 day to 1.5 days on the staffing side, it came in closer to 0.5 day. Protiviti came in virtually precisely where we estimated it to be. So from a revenue standpoint, the $9 million splits out to $7 million staffing, $2 million Protiviti. The gross margin of $5 million impact breaks out between $3 million, staffing; $2 million, Protiviti. The SG&A impact was about what we expected at $4.5 million, and that splits out $3.5 million staffing; $1 million, Protiviti. So virtually no surprises on the out-of-pocket cost impact. The revenue disruption impact actually better than we expected. It was quite a large undertaking. We're elated to have it behind us, and we're elated with the capabilities it has and provides to us as we move forward."

Short term, it's more about replacing our old 15-year legacy system with something we could maintain, with something that provided global mobile access because it's cloud-based; with something as we move forward in time, as we provide more and more digital services to complement our traditional services, we needed an infrastructure that would facilitate that.

But one thing we did look at, we have not only bill rates, which by the way, were up 3.5% this quarter year-over-year, which is down a bit from, I believe, it was 4.8% last quarter. So we not only looked at bill rate trends, but we also looked at hours billed trends. And while they've gone slightly negative and are projected to go slightly negative in the fourth quarter, if you look back at 2001 and if you look it back at 2008, they fell much more abruptly than what's implied in what we forecast.

So by vertical, I'd say, generally speaking, the trend lines you saw during the third quarter would remain intact during the fourth, such that from a staffing perspective, we would see a decline of about 1% year-over-year, same-day, constant currency. However, there is 1 fewer day this year than last. There will be a little bit of currency drag so that on a reported basis, your staffing growth rates would be about -- would be down about 3%. And again, the embedded 1% same-day, constant currency is at about the rate we started the quarter. Protiviti grows on a mid-single-digit rate versus their 15% tough year-ago comps. Gross margin, encouragingly, we believe temp gross margins will be up 30 to 50 basis points in the fourth quarter. We've had much better-than-expected experience with our state unemployment costs. We've been conservative for the first part of the year, which will give us some benefit in the fourth quarter. That 30 to 50 basis point improvement does not include potential even further improvement when we get our semiannual workers' comp review, so maybe there's some upside there. Protiviti, similar to the third quarter on a year-on-year basis, their gross margin would be down a couple of points because they've got less mix of the higher-margin FSI, which we've talked about in the past. But again, that's consistent with what we just saw on the SG&A side, on staffing, the dollars year-on-year would be about flat, but as I talked about on a reported basis, you've got revenues down 3% so that's going to create some negative leverage of around 1 point or 100 basis points. Protiviti SG&A would also be up about 100 basis points. Their marketing costs are intended to be higher. They've got higher administrative costs to support their higher headcount. So if you look at our projected operating margins, on the temp side would be down 50 to 70 basis points as the higher gross margin gets offset with the negative leverage in SG&A. Perm would be down about 1 percentage point, same reason. Protiviti would be down 3 to 4 percentage points, still double digit versus a very high 14% a year ago. The tax rate is going to be higher this year than last. We're thinking in the 37.5% range for the fourth quarter. Last year, it was low at 35.3% because we got some discrete credits that won't repeat. Shares before consideration of further buybacks would be in the 127.5 million [ph] range."

Our overall thought is to keep our headcounts constant and level while we get a better read on demand because the last thing we want to do is essentially have a self-fulfilling prophecy by reducing our capacity."

The U.S. was solid. Non-U.S. was very strong. Australia, Japan, solid in EU. So from a revenue standpoint, Protiviti's third quarter was pretty much spot on what we expected. They had some gross margin compression, and that compression was less than we expected, actually quite a bit less than we expected. They did a very good job controlling their costs. They used fewer contractors, which is a variable portion of their cost structure. They had fewer experienced hires come on board. So Protiviti, from a profitability standpoint in the third quarter, while not as much as the year ago, which was a tough comp, it was actually pretty significantly better than the guidance we had given for the third quarter. Fourth quarter, we're still -- embedded in our guidance is mid-single-digit growth. The comps a year ago were again very tough, 15% growth. Profitability remains double digit, notwithstanding it's an even shorter quarter for Protiviti because many of their clients have a soft close between Christmas and New Year's, which shortens the effective length of their quarter even more. So clearly, as we've talked about on prior calls, their FSI clients have gotten more cost conscious. That's resulted in fewer hours for us. The hours that we do have are at somewhat lower rates.

If you recall last quarter, we hobbled out of the starting gate. I think we were down 17% or something, and we certainly didn't finish the quarter anything like that. So quite frankly, perm is volatile. It's more volatile than temp. The start over a 3-week period of time doesn't mean much. That said, I'd rather start better than the prior quarter than worse, which we did. However, our guidance does assume that there would be slight negative year-over-year growth in perm. Temp-to-hire traditionally follows perm. So just as perm was a little softer than temp this quarter, so was temp-to-hire as it -- as compared to temp hours billed. It's all about, ultimately full-time hiring, the environment for full-time hiring, one follows the other. Clearly, temp-to-hire in this cycle has been somewhat anemic as has perm generally, but that was also the case in Q3 just ended."
