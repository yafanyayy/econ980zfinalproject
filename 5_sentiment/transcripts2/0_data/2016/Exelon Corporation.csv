Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter call. 
Before I go into the results, I want to take a moment to thank our crews who worked hard to restore power for our customers in Baltimore and Philadelphia affected by the January storms. 
BGE and PECO were able to restore approximately 22,000 customers throughout the weather even, keeping the average restoration times to less than 3 hours, which is a remarkable accomplishment given the challenges associated with traveling and the working conditions that has the storm intensified. 
I'll start off by reiterating our strategy and our capital allocation philosophy. The balance sheet strength is a priority that guides every strategic decision. It allows us to deliver stable growth, sustainable earnings and attractive dividend for our shareholders. Our strategy for delivering these objectives is to harvest free cash flow from Genco, to invest primarily in the utilities for the benefit of our customers, invest in long term contracted assets, which meet our return requirements and return capital to the shareholders. 
Consistent with this capital allocation policy, we're announcing today an evolution in our dividend policy. Our board has approved a policy to raise our dividend by 2.5% each year for the next 3 years beginning with the June 2016 dividend. The dividend increase shows our commitment to provide an attractive total return proposition for our shareholders and reflect the shift in focus towards our regulated utility and long-term contract businesses. 
Our balance sheet and our cash flow profile support the shift of the dividend policy and maintain a high credit quality and investment-grade rating remains a top priority. We continue to derisk the company by growing our regulated business. This allows us to generate earnings with a lower risk profile. We remain as focused as ever on careful discipline use of capital. 
Let's turn now to 2015 results in each of our businesses and our goals for 2016. Despite a difficult year in the markets, we've delivered earnings of $2.49 a share in 2015, demonstrating once again our ability to run business as well and manage through even the most challenging environments. 
And our utilities 2015 was a record year for us in many respects and growing regulated business continues to thrive. We achieved a major earnings milestone, our utilities earned over $1 billion in net income delivering the highest utility earnings on record. We invested nearly $3.7 billion and needed improvements for our customers across the utilities, including the AMI and the grid modernization investments, significant gas and electric infrastructure and an innovative technology and customer-oriented systems.  Our track record for reliability and customer service has allowed us to earn solid returns. 
Our utility earnings on aggregate across Exelon is at 9.5% in 2015. Our returns reflect the constructive regulatory relationship in our territories. PECO received the unanimous approval for both its $127 million rate case settlement and a $275 million long-term infrastructure improvement  plan. BGE received approval for recovery of more than $200 million of energy efficiency and gas infrastructure replacement investments and at ComEd, we achieved our fourth consecutive year of constructed outcomes in our formula rate file. 
This year, we filed a rate reduction at ComEd, showing ability to contain costs and limit the impact of capital investments on our customers build even during the current smarter investment cycles. 
The utilities continue to drive high operational performance and that performance is getting better each year. Of the 26 metrics we tracked, 21 of them were best or second best ever in 2015, including reliability and customer satisfaction. 
As for our goals in the utility business in 2016, our first primary goal is closing the PHI transaction. At which point, we'll begin the important job of integrating PHI of the Exelon family utilities. 
We'll bring our management models to PHI utilities in the quarter to improve the experience of the customers in the region. we'll work diligently to develop and implement an effective regulatory strategy for PHI. We'll invest approximately $4 billion in our existing utilities to refurbish and modernize the grid to improve service for our customers. That is part of the $18 billion we'll invest in our existing utilities over the next 5 years. 
We will work to maintain first quartile operational and customer satisfaction numbers, while continuing to focus on productivity and cost management. 
Finally, we expect the decision in our November 2015 BGE rate case in June and we'll file our annual formula rate update at ComEd in April. 
By executing on these goals, we'll deliver one of the most compelling utility earnings growth stories. 
Our Generation business had a solid year. Operationally in 2015, Constellation performed well even in the face of weak markets. Nuclear capacity factor was 93.7. Refueling outage performance was very strong. 
Average refueling outage duration was 22 days, that's the lowest average since 2002. 
Our gas and hydro plants outperformed the dispatched matched targets. Our solar and wind assets were the same for the energy capture funds. 
Our power business went 15 months without unemployed ocean recordable incident. It's the-based safety performance ever. 
At Constellation, our generation to load matching strategy contribute meaningfully to the earnings. Our load serving business experienced growth in both power and gas. 
In 2015, we served 195 terawatt hours of wholesale and retail load, materially growing that platform from 155 terawatt hours the prior year.  We continue to have high customer wind and renewable rates. 
We are now top 10 marketer of natural gas and it significantly increased our delivery to retail gas to 720 bcf last year. 
In 2016, Exelon Generation will continue to operate world-class fleet of assets, the highest level of performance, while continuing to execute our strategy of growing the contracted Generation business with 350 megawatts of wind projects in development. 
At Constellation, we will achieve our targets of serving 210 terawatt hours of load across all wholesale and retail base using our commercial platform as both a risk management vehicle and an earnings driver. 
Each of our business is well positioned to continue strong performance in 2016 operationally and financially. We have some important priorities we are targeting in 2016. We'll continue our broad efficacy efforts to ensure that our unique class of nuclear assets are properly valued for the clean, safe and reliable attributes. 
Developments in New York for a clean energy standard is constructing. The leadership of the governor in New York has been very positive but more work needs to be done, and we will engage with key stakeholders in the state. We continued with our specific efforts with legislators and stakeholders in Illinois on the low carbon portfolio standard. 
We provided ample time to reach the resolution on the nuclear assets, suffering significant losses in the process. If we don't see significant results, we will make the economically rational decision. We continue to engage with MISO on a constructive reform to address the issues in zone. We're working in the states in which we operate and develop compliance for the clean power pool. 
This has been a challenging period for our sector. We are tackling those challenges aggressively. We're reducing our cost by $350 million. We'll continue to shift our business mix to a more regulated exposure, both organically with our $18 billion capital into our existing utilities over the next 5 years and through our strategic acquisition of Pepco will which will raise that number of capital investments to $25 billion over the next 5 years. 
The company remains on a solid footing. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to run the businesses with the highest operational levels. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack for the financial details."
296181,323432855,925486,"Exelon Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris stated, we had a strong year financially and operationally across the company. For the full year, we delivered earnings of $2.49 per share and $0.38 per share for the fourth quarter. If bonus have n",1428,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris stated, we had a strong year financially and operationally across the company. 
For the full year, we delivered earnings of $2.49 per share and $0.38 per share for the fourth quarter. If bonus have not been extended, we would have delivered earnings of $2.58 per share, meaningful exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range.  The appendix contains details on our fourth quarter financial results by operating company on Slides 21 and 22. 
My remarks today will focus on 2016 earnings and O&M guidance, our credit profile, the cost management initiative and an update of our gross margin disclosures. 
Turning to Slide 6, we expect to deliver 2016 full year adjusted operating earnings of $2.40 to $2.70 and $0.60 to $0.70 per share for the first quarter. 
While we anticipate closing the Pepco Holdings deal in the first quarter, our guidance as a standalone figure that assumes the equity and debt issued for the PHI deal is unwound during the year. The impact of extension the of bonus depreciation is included in the guidance. 
Our growing utilities earnings primarily reflects increased capital investment in distribution and transmission to improve reliability and customer service at ComEd as well as increased rates for PECO's recent distribution rate case, partially offset by higher O&M at PECO and BGE related to storm and bad debt costs. 
Our strong operating performance at our utilities is fostering a positive regulatory environment in all our jurisdictions and is evident in the transformation and allowed an earned return that we've achieved at BGE since the Constellation merger. 
BGE has improved reliability and customer satisfaction in every year as compared to 2012, the year of the merger, which in turn, has led to improved regulatory outcomes and earned our lease over the same period. 
Last November, BGE filed an electric and gas distribution rate case to Maryland Public Service Commission, requesting revenue requirement increases of $121 million and $80 million to its electric and gas distribution rates, respectively. The requested rates of return on equity in the application are 10.6% for electric distribution and 10.5% for gas distribution. We expect the Maryland PSC to roll on the rate case in the June time frame with the new rates going into effect shortly afterward the final order. The revenue requirement increases reflect the continued investment, including Smart Grid, being made at BGE to improve reliability and customer service. 
Constellation had an record year in 2015 driven by higher realized margins that benefited from a lower cost-to-serve our load and strong performance in our portfolio management group. 
In 2016, we expect a more normalized cost-to-serve load and portfolio management performance, which we expect will have a negative impact on our earnings relative to an extraordinary 2015. 
Overall at Exelon Generation, the earnings impact from normalized margins and higher decommissioning trust, partially offset by fewer nuclear outages and cost management efforts, result in a forecast decrease in ExGen's earnings range versus last year. 
Our cost management initiative savings in 2016 should largely offset the impact of inflation at ExGen where labor and wage inflation are significant components of O&M. 
For reference, more detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found in the appendix on Slides 23 through 26. 
Moving to Slide 7. As we've said in the past, bonus depreciation has a negative impact on earnings with a positive impact on cash. 
In 2016, it creates a rounded $0.09 earnings drag at the consolidated level with $0.06 impact at Exelon Generation and a $0.03 impact at ComEd. 
On the cash, increases cash flow by $625 million in 2016. 
Despite the negative earnings impact of bonus depreciation in 2016 through '18, we are affirming the CAGR of 3% to 5% for the enterprise and 7% to 9% for the utilities through 2018 that we disclosed at the EEI. 
In addition, the extension of bonus depreciation will likely have a further effect on Exelon as a whole after the closing of the Pepco Holdings deal. Once the merger is completed, and we begin the integration of PHI's operating, planning and regulatory functions, we'll provide an update on PHI's forecast and the resulting increase in impact on Exelon's forecast. 
On Slide 8, our top financial priority remains maintaining our investment grade credit rating and ensuring the strength of our balance sheet. The 5-year extension of bonus depreciation improves the free cash flow positioned at ExGen, which has a positive impact on our metrics. ExGen free cash flow over the 2016 to 2018 period is now projected to be $5.35 billion or $3.2 billion after taking into account committed growth capital. 
Since our EEI disclosure, Exelon Generation has commenced developing a further 350 megawatts of long term contracted wind projects in Michigan and Oklahoma. 
As you'll note on the slide, given our strong cash flow outlook, ExGen has declining debt EBITDA ratio, starting at 3.2 in 2016 and decreasing to 2.3x debt-to-EBITDA by 2018. 
Bottom line, we're growing durable earnings and shrinking debt. 
Turning to Slide 9. I will provide an update on the cost management initiative that we announced towards the end of last year. We recently finalized the savings initiatives in January and have incorporated them in our current long-range plan. 
As we mentioned at the EEI, the total identified savings are in the $350 million range where savings are split equally between Exelon Generation in our corporate shared services organization. $100 million of the savings at the shared services organization will be achieved within our information technology function with the remainder coming from various corporate functions such as finance, legal, Human Resources and supply. The corporate savings will be allocated roughly equally between Exelon Generation and the utilities. 
Overall, this means that roughly 3/4 of the total cost-savings for the company will hit the bottom line in Exelon Generation, while the remaining quarter of the savings will be realized at utilities, mostly passed on to our customers. 
As a result, we expected run rate earnings benefit from our cost management initiative of $0.13 to $0.18 per share beginning in 2018 with approximately 35% of the run rate savings achieved by the end of this year. 
Our proven track record of cutting costs were running our business efficiently gives us confidence we'll be able to achieve or exceed these savings. 
Slide 10 shows our 2016 O&M forecast relative to 2015. We project O&M for 2016 to be flat to 2015, and we expect a slightly negative O&M CAGR across the enterprise over the 2015 t 2018 period and a negative 1% CAGR at Exelon Generation. 
ExGen's year-over-year decrease is driven by a combination of factors: Fewer planned nuclear outages compared to 2015; lower pension cost and the impacts of the cost management initiative. 
The year-over-year increase at PECO and BGE is due to inflation and budgeting for normal storm and bad debt costs, which results in an incremental year-over-year O&M growth. 
Slide 11 provides our fourth quarter gross margin update. This quarter's gross margin update now includes the impact of Kewaunee RSSA to 2016 and 2017 total gross margin. 
As we saw the forward prices and heat rates for 2017 increase by the end of the quarter, we reduced our deviation to ratable. 
For 2017, we ended the quarter with a power position of 5% to 8% behind ratable on a total portfolio basis when considering our crossed commodity hedges. We then further behind ratable in the Mid-West approximately 13% to 16% when considering cross commodity hedges. We continue to align our hedging strategy with our views of the market. 
In 2016, total gross margin is flat to our last disclosure. As you know, we're highly hedged in 2016, which combined with the inclusion of Kewaunee RSSA allowed us to offset the impact of lower prices in 2016. 
During the quarter, we also executed on $50 million on both tower new business and non-tower new business. 
Total gross margin increased by $50 million in both 2017 and 2018. The increase in 2017 is partially driven by the Kewaunee RSSA, which mitigates losses, while the increase in 2018 is driven by higher power prices across most of the regions most notably in NiHub with round-the-clock prices increasing by in $0.64 per for megawatt hour. 
During the quarter, we also executed on $15 million of nonpowered new business for both 2017 and 2018. 
As a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will help you in your modeling efforts. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll now open up the line for questions."

One working with MISO on Zone 4 reforms, and we like the design to be more like the new PJM capacity market design. But that in itself will not save Clinton. As you know, there's a lot of work going on in Springfield with the administration and the legislature, and we have had very strong support from the leadership and the legislature and administration coming to a resolution on the energy outlook for Illinois. It's not only that the clean energy standard, but there's an environmental jobs, green jobs build and there's the utility of the future build that have to be negotiated together.

Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter call. Before I go into the results, I want to take a moment to thank our crews who worked hard to restore power for our customers in Baltimore and Philadelphi",1293,"Thanks, Francis, and good morning to everybody. Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter call. 
Before I go into the results, I want to take a moment to thank our crews who worked hard to restore power for our customers in Baltimore and Philadelphia affected by the January storms. 
BGE and PECO were able to restore approximately 22,000 customers throughout the weather event, keeping the average restoration times to less than 3 hours, which is a remarkable accomplishment given the challenges associated with traveling and the working conditions that has the storm intensified. 
I'll start off by reiterating our strategy and our capital allocation philosophy. The balance sheet strength is a priority that guides every strategic decision. It allows us to deliver stable growth, sustainable earnings and an attractive dividend for our shareholders. Our strategy for delivering these objectives is to harvest free cash flow from the Genco, to invest primarily in the utilities for the benefit of our customers, invest in long term contracted assets which meet our return requirements, and return capital to the shareholders. 
Consistent with this capital allocation policy, we're announcing today an evolution in our dividend policy. Our board has approved a policy to raise our dividend by 2.5% each year for the next 3 years, beginning with the June 2016 dividend. The dividend increase shows our commitment to provide an attractive total return proposition for our shareholders and reflects the shift and focus towards our regulated utility and long-term contract businesses. 
Our balance sheet and our cash flow profile support the shift of the dividend policy and maintain a high credit quality and investment-grade rating remains a top priority. We continue to derisk the company by growing our regulated business. This has allowed us to generate earnings with a lower risk profile. We remained as focused as ever on careful discipline use of capital. 
Let's turn now to 2015 results in each of our businesses and our goals for 2016. Despite a difficult year in the markets, we've delivered earnings of $2.49 a share in 2015, demonstrating once again our ability to run businesses well and manage through even most challenging environments. 
At our utilities, 2015 was a record year for us in many respects and growing regulated business continues to thrive. We achieved a major earnings milestone. Our utilities earned over $1 billion in net income, delivering the highest utility earnings on record. We invested nearly $3.7 billion in needed improvements for our customers across the utilities, including the AMI and the grid modernization investments, significant gas and electric infrastructure and an innovative technology and customer-oriented systems.  Our track record for reliability and customer service has allowed us to earn solid returns. 
Our utility earnings on aggregate across Exelon is at 9.5% in 2015. Our returns reflect the constructive regulatory relationship in our territories. PECO received a unanimous approval for both its $127 million rate case settlement and a $275 million long-term infrastructure improvement  plan. BGE received approval for recovery of more than $200 million of energy efficiency and gas infrastructure replacement investments. And at ComEd, we achieved our fourth consecutive year of constructed outcomes in our formula rate file. 
This year, we filed a rate reduction at ComEd, showing our ability to contain cost and limit the impact of capital investments on our customers build even during the current Smart Grid investment cycles. 
The utilities continue to drive high operational performance, and that performance is getting better each year. Of the 26 metrics we tracked, 21 of them were best or second best ever in 2015, including reliability and customer satisfaction. 
As for our goals in the utility business in 2016, our first primary goal is closing the PHI transaction at which point, we'll begin the important job of integrating PHI, the Exelon family utilities. 
We'll bring our management model to PHI utilities in order to improve the experience of the customers in the region. We'll work diligently to develop and implement an effective regulatory strategy for PHI. We'll invest approximately $4 billion in our existing utilities to refurbish and modernize the grid to improve service for our customers. That is part of the $18 billion we'll invest in our existing utilities over the next 5 years. 
We will work to maintain first quartile operational and customer satisfaction numbers, while continuing to focus on productivity and cost management. 
Finally, we expect the decision in our November 2015 BGE rate case in June and we'll file our annual formula rate update at ComEd in April. 
By executing on these goals, we'll deliver one of the most compelling utility earnings growth stores. 
Our Generation business had a solid year. Operationally in 2015, the Constellations -- in Constellation performed well even in the face of weak markets. Nuclear capacity factor was 93.7%. Refueling outage performance was very strong. 
Average refueling outage duration was 22 days, that's the lowest average since 2002. 
Our gas and hydro plants outperformed the dispatched matched targets. Our solar and wind assets did the same for the energy capture funds. 
Our power business went 15 months without unemployed ocean recordable incident. It's the best safety performance ever. 
At Constellation, our generation to load matching strategy contribute meaningfully to the earnings. Our load serving business experienced growth in both power and gas. 
In 2015, we served 195 terawatt hours of wholesale and retail load, materially growing that platform from 155 terawatt hours the prior year.  We continue to have high customer wind and renewable rates. 
We are now top 10 marketer of natural gas and it significantly increased our delivery of retail gas to 720 bcf last year. 
In 2016, at Exelon Generation, will continue to operate world-class fleet of assets highest level of performance, while continuing to execute our strategy of growing the contracted Generation business with 350 megawatts of wind projects in development. 
At Constellation, we will achieve our targets of serving 210 terawatt hours of load across our wholesale and retail base using our commercial platform as both a risk management vehicle and an earnings driver. 
Each of our business is well positioned to continue strong performance in 2016 operationally and financially. We have some important priorities we are targeting in 2016. We'll continue our broad efficacy efforts to ensure that our unique class of nuclear assets are properly valued for the clean, safe and reliable attributes. 
Developments in New York for a clean energy standard are constructing. The leadership of the governor in New York has been very positive, but more work needs to be done. Then we will engage with key stakeholders in the state. We continue with our specific efforts with legislators and stakeholders in Illinois on the low carbon portfolio standard. 
We provided ample time to reach the resolution on the nuclear assets, suffering significant losses in the process. If we don't see significant results, we will make the economically rational decision. We continue to engage with MISO on a constructive reform to address the issues in Zone 4. We'll work in the states in which we operate to develop compliance plans for the clean power pool. 
This has been a challenging period for our sector. We are tackling those challenges aggressively. We're reducing our costs by $350 million. We'll continue to shift our business mix to more regulated exposure, both organically with our $18 billion capital into our existing utilities over the next 5 years and through our strategic acquisition of Pepco, which will raise that number of capital investment to $25 billion over the next 5 years. 
The company remains on a solid footing. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to run the businesses with the highest operational levels. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack for the financial details."
296181,323432855,925682,"Exelon Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris stated, we had a strong year financially and operationally across the company. For the full year, we delivered earnings of $2.49 per share and $0.38 per share for the fourth quarter. If bonus had no",1435,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris stated, we had a strong year financially and operationally across the company. 
For the full year, we delivered earnings of $2.49 per share and $0.38 per share for the fourth quarter. If bonus had not been extended, we would have delivered earnings of $2.58 per share, meaningfully exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range.  The appendix contains details on our fourth quarter financial results by operating company on Slides 21 and 22. 
My remarks today will focus on 2016 earnings and O&M guidance, our credit profile, the cost management initiative and an update of our gross margin disclosures. 
Turning to Slide 6, we expect to deliver 2016 full year adjusted operating earnings of $2.40 to $2.70 and $0.60 to $0.70 per share for the first quarter. 
While we anticipate closing the Pepco Holdings deal in the first quarter, our guidance is the standalone figure that assumes the equity and debt issued for the PHI deal is unwound during the year. The impact of the extension of bonus depreciation is included in the guidance. 
Our growing utilities earnings primarily reflects increased capital investment in distribution and transmission to improve reliability and customer service at ComEd, as well as increased rates for PECO's recent distribution rate case, partially offset by higher O&M at PECO and BGE related to storm and bad debt costs. 
Our strong operating performance at our utilities is fostering a positive regulatory environment in all our jurisdictions and is evident in the transformation it allowed and earned returns that we've achieved at BGE since the Constellation merger. 
BGE has improved reliability and customer satisfaction in every year as compared to 2012, the year of the merger, which in turn, has led to improved regulatory outcomes and earned ROEs over that same period. 
Last November, BGE filed an electric and gas distribution rate case with the Maryland Public Service Commission, requesting revenue requirement increases of $121 million and $80 million to its electric and gas distribution rates, respectively. The requested rates of return on equity in the application are 10.6% for electric distribution and 10.5% for gas distribution. We expect the Maryland PSC to rule on the rate case in the June time frame with the new rates going into effect shortly after the final order. The revenue requirement increases reflect the continued investment, including Smart Grid being made at BGE to improve reliability and customer service. 
Constellation had an record year in 2015, driven by higher realized margins that benefited from a lower cost-to-serve our load and strong performance in our portfolio management group. 
In 2016, we expect a more normalized cost-to-serve load and portfolio management performance, which we expect will have a negative impact on our earnings relative to an extraordinary 2015. 
Overall, at Exelon Generation, the earnings impact from normalized margins and higher decommissioning costs, partially offset by fewer nuclear outages and cost management efforts, result in a forecast decrease in ExGen's earnings range versus last year. 
Our cost management initiative savings in 2016 should largely offset the impact of inflation at ExGen where labor and wage inflation are significant components of O&M. 
For reference, more detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found in the appendix on Slides 23 through 26. 
Moving to Slide 7. As we've said in the past, bonus depreciation has a negative impact on earnings, but a positive impact on cash. 
In 2016, it creates a rounded $0.09 earnings drag at the consolidated level with the $0.06 impact at Exelon Generation and a $0.03 impact at ComEd. 
On the cash front, it increases cash flow by $625 million in 2016. 
Despite the negative earnings impact of bonus depreciation in 2016 through '18, we are affirming the CAGR of 3% to 5% for the enterprise and 7% to 9% for the utilities through 2018 that we disclosed at EEI. 
In addition, the extension of bonus depreciation will likely have a further effect on Exelon as a whole after the closing of the Pepco Holdings deal. Once the merger is completed, and we begin the integration of PHI's operating, planning and regulatory functions, we'll provide an update on PHI's forecast and the resulting increase in impact on Exelon's forecast. 
On Slide 8, our top financial priority remains maintaining our investment grade credit rating and ensuring the strength of our balance sheet. The 5-year extension of bonus depreciation improves the free cash flow positioned at ExGen, which has a positive impact on our FFO to debt metrics. ExGen free cash flow over the 2016 to 2018 period is now projected to be $5.35 billion or $3.2 billion after taking into account committed growth capital. 
Since our EEI disclosure, Exelon Generation has commenced developing a further 350 megawatts of long-term contracted wind projects in Michigan and Oklahoma. 
As you'll note on the slide, given our strong cash flow outlook, ExGen has declining debt-to-EBITDA ratio, starting at 3.2x in 2016 and decreasing to 2.3x debt-to-EBITDA by 2018. 
Bottom line, we're growing durable earnings and shrinking debt. 
Turning to Slide 9. I will provide an update on the cost management initiative that we announced towards the end of last year. We recently finalized the savings initiatives in January and have incorporated them into our -- in our current long-range plan. 
As we mentioned at EEI, the total identified savings are in the $350 million range with savings split equally between Exelon Generation and our corporate shared services organization. $100 million of the savings at the shared services organization will be achieved within our information technology function with the remainder coming from various corporate functions such as finance, legal, Human Resources and supply. The corporate savings will be allocated roughly equally between Exelon Generation and the utilities. 
Overall, this means that roughly 3/4 of the total cost savings for the company will hit the bottom line at Exelon Generation, while the remaining 1/4 of the savings will be realized at utilities, mostly passed on to our customers. 
As a result, we expected run rate earnings benefit from our cost management initiative of $0.13 to $0.18 per share beginning in 2018, with approximately 35% of the run rate savings achieved by the end of this year. 
Our proven track record of cutting costs and running our business efficiently gives us confidence we'll be able to achieve or exceed these savings. 
Slide 10 shows our 2016 O&M forecast relative to 2015. We project O&M for 2016 to be flat to 2015, and we expect a slightly negative O&M CAGR across the enterprise over the 2015 to 2018 period, and a negative 1% CAGR at Exelon Generation. 
ExGen's year-over-year decrease is driven by a combination of factors: Fewer planned nuclear outages compared to 2015; lower pension costs; and the impacts of the cost management initiative. 
The year-over-year increase at PECO and BGE is due to inflation and budgeting for normal storm and bad debt costs, which results in the incremental year-over-year O&M growth. 
Slide 11 provides our fourth quarter gross margin update. This quarter's gross margin update now includes the impact of the Ginna RSSA to 2016 and 2017 total gross margin. 
As we saw, the forward prices and heat rates for 2017 increase by the end of the quarter, we reduced our deviation to ratable. 
For 2017, we ended the quarter with a power position of 5% to 8% behind ratable on a total portfolio basis when considering our crossed commodity hedges. We're then further behind ratable in the Mid-West, approximately 13% to 16% when considering cross commodity hedges. We continue to align our hedging strategy with our views on the market. 
In 2016, total gross margin is flat to our last disclosure. As you know, we're highly hedged in 2016, which combined with the inclusion of the Ginna RSSA allowed us to offset the impacts of lower prices in 2016. 
During the quarter, we also executed on $50 million of both tower new business and non-tower new business. 
Total gross margin increased by $50 million in both 2017 and 2018. The increase in 2017 is partially driven by the Ginna RSSA, which mitigates losses, while the increase in 2018 is driven by higher power prices across most of the regions, most notably in NiHub with the round-the-clock prices increasing by in $0.64 per megawatt hour. 
During the quarter, we also executed on $15 million of non-power new business for both 2017 and 2018. 
As a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will help you in your modeling efforts. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll now open up the line for questions."

We had -- as we talked back 3 years ago now when we had to restructure the dividend, we had grown the dividend at Exelon based off of the earnings and cash flow on a very volatile business, the Genco. We had to make the shift and take the pain at the time to refocus the payout in where that reliable cash flow would come from. We set out at that time after the merge with Constellation improving the performance for the customers, the reliability of BGE and along with that, improving the profitability. ComEd has done a phenomenal job improving reliability, making prudent investments and as our shareholders have seen as you have seen that the strategic plan we laid a few years ago is paying off, and it's -- can be seen, it's transparent that by 2018, theoretically, the utilities would be covering the dividend. In discussion with shareholders and feedback at the end of the year, the certainty that -- and our confidence in the business needed to be fully displayed in dialogue with the board. We thought that we can make these increases. We've talked about the free cash flow, we've talked about the balance sheet, and we're committed to that through 2018. I think it's a positive sign in the right direction that we feel confident in our strategy going forward."

Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter call. Before I go into the results, I want to take a moment to thank our crews who worked hard to restore power for our customers in Baltimore and Philadelphi",1293,"Thanks, Francis, and good morning to everybody. Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter call. 
Before I go into the results, I want to take a moment to thank our crews who worked hard to restore power for our customers in Baltimore and Philadelphia affected by the January storms. 
BGE and PECO were able to restore approximately 22,000 customers throughout the weather event, keeping the average restoration times to less than 3 hours, which is a remarkable accomplishment given the challenges associated with traveling and the working conditions as the storm intensified. 
I'll start off by reiterating our strategy and our capital allocation philosophy. The balance sheet strength is a priority that guides every strategic decision. It allows us to deliver stable growth, sustainable earnings and an attractive dividend for our shareholders. Our strategy for delivering these objectives is to harvest free cash flow from the Genco, to invest primarily in the utilities for the benefit of our customers, invest in long term contracted assets which meet our return requirements, and return capital to the shareholders. 
Consistent with this capital allocation policy, we're announcing today an evolution in our dividend policy. Our board has approved a policy to raise our dividend by 2.5% each year for the next 3 years, beginning with the June 2016 dividend. The dividend increase shows our commitment to provide an attractive total return proposition for our shareholders and reflects the shift and focus towards our regulated utility and long-term contract businesses. 
Our balance sheet and our cash flow profile support the shift of the dividend policy and maintain a high credit quality and investment-grade rating remains a top priority. We continue to derisk the company by growing our regulated business. This has allowed us to generate earnings with a lower risk profile. We remained as focused as ever on careful discipline use of capital. 
Let's turn now to 2015 results in each of our businesses and our goals for 2016. Despite a difficult year in the markets, we've delivered earnings of $2.49 a share in 2015, demonstrating once again our ability to run businesses well and manage through even most challenging environments. 
At our utilities, 2015 was a record year for us in many respects and growing regulated business continues to thrive. We achieved a major earnings milestone. Our utilities earned over $1 billion in net income, delivering the highest utility earnings on record. We invested nearly $3.7 billion in needed improvements for our customers across the utilities, including the AMI and the grid modernization investments, significant gas and electric infrastructure and an innovative technology and customer-oriented systems.  Our track record for reliability and customer service has allowed us to earn solid returns. 
Our utility earnings on aggregate across Exelon is at 9.5% in 2015. Our returns reflect the constructive regulatory relationship in our territories. PECO received a unanimous approval for both its $127 million rate case settlement and a $275 million long-term infrastructure improvement  plan. BGE received approval for recovery of more than $200 million of energy efficiency and gas infrastructure replacement investments. And at ComEd, we achieved our fourth consecutive year of constructed outcomes in our formula rate file. 
This year, we filed a rate reduction at ComEd, showing our ability to contain cost and limit the impact of capital investments on our customers build even during the current Smart Grid investment cycles. 
The utilities continue to drive high operational performance, and that performance is getting better each year. Of the 26 metrics we tracked, 21 of them were best or second best ever in 2015, including reliability and customer satisfaction. 
As for our goals in the utility business in 2016, our first primary goal is closing the PHI transaction at which point, we'll begin the important job of integrating PHI, the Exelon family utilities. 
We'll bring our management model to PHI utilities in order to improve the experience of the customers in the region. We'll work diligently to develop and implement an effective regulatory strategy for PHI. We'll invest approximately $4 billion in our existing utilities to refurbish and modernize the grid to improve service for our customers. That is part of the $18 billion we'll invest in our existing utilities over the next 5 years. 
We will work to maintain first quartile operational and customer satisfaction numbers, while continuing to focus on productivity and cost management. 
Finally, we expect the decision in our November 2015 BGE rate case in June and we'll file our annual formula rate update at ComEd in April. 
By executing on these goals, we'll deliver one of the most compelling utility earnings growth stores. 
Our Generation business had a solid year. Operationally in 2015, the Constellations -- in Constellation performed well even in the face of weak markets. Nuclear capacity factor was 93.7%. Refueling outage performance was very strong. 
Average refueling outage duration was 22 days, that's the lowest average since 2002. 
Our gas and hydro plants outperformed the dispatched matched targets. Our solar and wind assets did the same for the energy capture funds. 
Our power business went 15 months without an employed OSHA recordable incident. It's the best safety performance ever. 
At Constellation, our generation to load matching strategy contribute meaningfully to the earnings. Our load serving business experienced growth in both power and gas. 
In 2015, we served 195 terawatt hours of wholesale and retail load, materially growing that platform from 155 terawatt hours the prior year.  We continue to have high customer wind and renewable rates. 
We are now top 10 marketer of natural gas and it significantly increased our delivery of retail gas to 720 bcf last year. 
In 2016, at Exelon Generation, will continue to operate world-class fleet of assets highest level of performance, while continuing to execute our strategy of growing the contracted Generation business with 350 megawatts of wind projects in development. 
At Constellation, we will achieve our targets of serving 210 terawatt hours of load across our wholesale and retail base using our commercial platform as both a risk management vehicle and an earnings driver. 
Each of our business is well positioned to continue strong performance in 2016 operationally and financially. We have some important priorities we are targeting in 2016. We'll continue our broad efficacy efforts to ensure that our unique class of nuclear assets are properly valued for the clean, safe and reliable attributes. 
Developments in New York for a clean energy standard are constructing. The leadership of the governor in New York has been very positive, but more work needs to be done. Then we will engage with key stakeholders in the state. We continue with our specific efforts with legislators and stakeholders in Illinois on the low carbon portfolio standard. 
We provided ample time to reach the resolution on the nuclear assets, suffering significant losses in the process. If we don't see significant results, we will make the economically rational decision. We continue to engage with MISO on a constructive reform to address the issues in Zone 4. We'll work in the states in which we operate to develop compliance plans for the clean power pool. 
This has been a challenging period for our sector. We are tackling those challenges aggressively. We're reducing our costs by $350 million. We'll continue to shift our business mix to more regulated exposure, both organically with our $18 billion capital into our existing utilities over the next 5 years and through our strategic acquisition of Pepco, which will raise that number of capital investment to $25 billion over the next 5 years. 
The company remains on a solid footing. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to run the businesses with the highest operational levels. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack for the financial details."
296181,323432855,925864,"Exelon Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris stated, we had a strong year financially and operationally across the company. For the full year, we delivered earnings of $2.49 per share and $0.38 per share for the fourth quarter. If bonus had no",1436,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris stated, we had a strong year financially and operationally across the company. 
For the full year, we delivered earnings of $2.49 per share and $0.38 per share for the fourth quarter. If bonus had not been extended, we would have delivered earnings of $2.58 per share, meaningfully exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range.  The appendix contains details on our fourth quarter financial results by operating company on Slides 21 and 22. 
My remarks today will focus on 2016 earnings and O&M guidance, our credit profile, the cost management initiative and an update of our gross margin disclosures. 
Turning to Slide 6, we expect to deliver 2016 full year adjusted operating earnings of $2.40 to $2.70 and $0.60 to $0.70 per share for the first quarter. 
While we anticipate closing the Pepco Holdings deal in the first quarter, our guidance is the standalone figure that assumes the equity and debt issued for the PHI deal is unwound during the year. The impact of the extension of bonus depreciation is included in the guidance. 
Our growing utilities earnings primarily reflects increased capital investment in distribution and transmission to improve reliability and customer service at ComEd, as well as increased rates for PECO's recent distribution rate case, partially offset by higher O&M at PECO and BGE related to storm and bad debt costs. 
Our strong operating performance at our utilities is fostering a positive regulatory environment in all our jurisdictions and is evident in the transformation it allowed and earned returns that we've achieved at BGE since the Constellation merger. 
BGE has improved reliability and customer satisfaction in every year as compared to 2012, the year of the merger, which in turn, has led to improved regulatory outcomes and earned ROEs over that same period. 
Last November, BGE filed an electric and gas distribution rate case with the Maryland Public Service Commission, requesting revenue requirement increases of $121 million and $80 million to its electric and gas distribution rates, respectively. The requested rates of return on equity in the application are 10.6% for electric distribution and 10.5% for gas distribution. We expect the Maryland PSC to rule on the rate case in the June time frame with the new rates going into effect shortly after the final order. The revenue requirement increases reflect the continued investment, including Smart Grid being made at BGE to improve reliability and customer service. 
Constellation had an record year in 2015, driven by higher realized margins that benefited from a lower cost-to-serve our load and strong performance in our portfolio management group. 
In 2016, we expect a more normalized cost-to-serve load and portfolio management performance, which we expect will have a negative impact on our earnings relative to an extraordinary 2015. 
Overall, at Exelon Generation, the earnings impact from normalized margins and higher decommissioning costs, partially offset by fewer nuclear outages and cost management efforts, result in a forecast decrease in ExGen's earnings range versus last year. 
Our cost management initiative savings in 2016 should largely offset the impact of inflation at ExGen where labor and wage inflation are significant components of O&M. 
For reference, more detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found in the appendix on Slides 23 through 26. 
Moving to Slide 7. As we've said in the past, bonus depreciation has a negative impact on earnings, but a positive impact on cash. 
In 2016, it creates a rounded $0.09 earnings drag at the consolidated level with the $0.06 impact at Exelon Generation and a $0.03 impact at ComEd. 
On the cash front, it increases cash flow by $625 million in 2016. 
Despite the negative earnings impact of bonus depreciation in 2016 through '18, we are affirming the CAGR of 3% to 5% for the enterprise and 7% to 9% for the utilities through 2018 that we disclosed at EEI. 
In addition, the extension of bonus depreciation will likely have a further effect on Exelon as a whole after the closing of the Pepco Holdings deal. Once the merger is completed, and we begin the integration of PHI's operating, planning and regulatory functions, we'll provide an update on PHI's forecast and the resulting increase in impact on Exelon's forecast. 
On Slide 8, our top financial priority remains maintaining our investment grade credit rating and ensuring the strength of our balance sheet. The 5-year extension of bonus depreciation improves the free cash flow positioned at ExGen, which has a positive impact on our FFO to debt metrics. ExGen free cash flow over the 2016 to 2018 period is now projected to be $5.35 billion or $3.2 billion after taking into account committed growth capital. 
Since our EEI disclosure, Exelon Generation has commenced developing a further 350 megawatts of long-term contracted wind projects in Michigan and Oklahoma. 
As you'll note on the slide, given our strong cash flow outlook, ExGen has declining debt-to-EBITDA ratio, starting at 3.2x in 2016 and decreasing to 2.3x debt-to-EBITDA by 2018. 
Bottom line, we're growing durable earnings and shrinking debt. 
Turning to Slide 9. I will provide an update on the cost management initiative that we announced towards the end of last year. We recently finalized the savings initiatives in January and have incorporated them into our -- in our current long-range plan. 
As we mentioned at EEI, the total identified savings are in the $350 million range with savings split equally between Exelon Generation and our corporate shared services organization. $100 million of the savings at the shared services organization will be achieved within our information technology function with the remainder coming from various corporate functions such as finance, legal, Human Resources and supply. The corporate savings will be allocated roughly equally between Exelon Generation and the utilities. 
Overall, this means that roughly 3/4 of the total cost savings for the company will hit the bottom line at Exelon Generation, while the remaining 1/4 of the savings will be realized at utilities, and ultimately passed on to our customers. 
As a result, we expected run rate earnings benefit from our cost management initiative of $0.13 to $0.18 per share beginning in 2018, with approximately 35% of the run rate savings achieved by the end of this year. 
Our proven track record of cutting costs and running our business efficiently gives us confidence we'll be able to achieve or exceed these savings. 
Slide 10 shows our 2016 O&M forecast relative to 2015. We project O&M for 2016 to be flat to 2015, and we expect a slightly negative O&M CAGR across the enterprise over the 2015 to 2018 period, and a negative 1% CAGR at Exelon Generation. 
ExGen's year-over-year decrease is driven by a combination of factors: Fewer planned nuclear outages compared to 2015; lower pension costs; and the impacts of the cost management initiative. 
The year-over-year increase at PECO and BGE is due to inflation and budgeting for normal storm and bad debt costs, which results in the incremental year-over-year O&M growth. 
Slide 11 provides our fourth quarter gross margin update. This quarter's gross margin update now includes the impact of the Ginna RSSA to 2016 and 2017 total gross margin. 
As we saw, the forward prices and heat rates for 2017 increase by the end of the quarter, we reduced our deviation to ratable. 
For 2017, we ended the quarter with a power position of 5% to 8% behind ratable on a total portfolio basis when considering our crossed commodity hedges. We're then further behind ratable in the Mid-West, approximately 13% to 16% when considering cross commodity hedges. We continue to align our hedging strategy with our views on the market. 
In 2016, total gross margin is flat to our last disclosure. As you know, we're highly hedged in 2016, which combined with the inclusion of the Ginna RSSA allowed us to offset the impacts of lower prices in 2016. 
During the quarter, we also executed on $50 million of both tower new business and non-tower new business. 
Total gross margin increased by $50 million in both 2017 and 2018. The increase in 2017 is partially driven by the Ginna RSSA, which mitigates losses, while the increase in 2018 is driven by higher power prices across most of the regions, most notably in NiHub with the round-the-clock prices increasing by in $0.64 per megawatt hour. 
During the quarter, we also executed on $15 million of non-power new business for both 2017 and 2018. 
As a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will help you in your modeling efforts. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll now open up the line for questions."

The money producing plants are the larger drill unit sites that will run into the 2040s, that's Byron, Braidwood, LaSalle, Limerick, Peach Bottom and they're positioned well in the markets and Peach Bottom is in the 30s, I think. But the others are in the 40s. So we've got a long run left on these profitable plants. If the smaller units or the single site units cannot be profitable, and we can't get a market design, they will be retired and there is an upside based off of that retirement on free cash flow and earnings. We will remove the drag. As Jack described, we're very focused on the debt-to-EBITDA ratios at the Genco. And over this period of time, we'll be reducing over $3 billion of debt at the Genco in continuing to manage that matching our assets with our debt. We feel very comfortable where we're at, but it is a misnomer that the result there that these are 10-year assets with a large debt profile on them. Jack, do you want to?"

We set out at that time after the merger with Constellation improving the performance for the customers, the reliability of BGE and along with that, improving the profitability. ComEd has done a phenomenal job improving reliability, making prudent investments and as our shareholders have seen as you have seen that the strategic plan we laid a few years ago is paying off, and it's -- can be seen, it's transparent that by 2018, theoretically, the utilities would be covering the dividend. In discussion with shareholders and feedback at the end of the year, the certainty that -- and our confidence in the business needed to be fully displayed in dialogue with the board. We thought that we can make these increases. We've talked about the free cash flow, we've talked about the balance sheet, and we're committed to that through 2018.

Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter call. Before I go into the results, I want to take a moment to thank our crews who worked hard to restore power for our customers in Baltimore and Philadelphi",1293,"Thanks, Francis, and good morning to everybody. Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter call. 
Before I go into the results, I want to take a moment to thank our crews who worked hard to restore power for our customers in Baltimore and Philadelphia affected by the January storms. 
BGE and PECO were able to restore approximately 22,000 customers throughout the weather event, keeping the average restoration times to less than 3 hours, which is a remarkable accomplishment given the challenges associated with traveling and the working conditions as the storm intensified. 
I'll start off by reiterating our strategy and our capital allocation philosophy. The balance sheet strength is a priority that guides every strategic decision. It allows us to deliver stable growth, sustainable earnings and an attractive dividend for our shareholders. Our strategy for delivering these objectives is to harvest free cash flow from the Genco, to invest primarily in the utilities for the benefit of our customers, invest in long term contracted assets which meet our return requirements, and return capital to the shareholders. 
Consistent with this capital allocation policy, we're announcing today an evolution in our dividend policy. Our board has approved a policy to raise our dividend by 2.5% each year for the next 3 years, beginning with the June 2016 dividend. The dividend increase shows our commitment to provide an attractive total return proposition for our shareholders and reflects the shift and focus towards our regulated utility and long-term contract businesses. 
Our balance sheet and our cash flow profile support the shift of the dividend policy and maintain a high credit quality and investment-grade rating remains a top priority. We continue to derisk the company by growing our regulated business. This has allowed us to generate earnings with a lower risk profile. We remained as focused as ever on careful discipline use of capital. 
Let's turn now to 2015 results in each of our businesses and our goals for 2016. Despite a difficult year in the markets, we've delivered earnings of $2.49 a share in 2015, demonstrating once again our ability to run businesses well and manage through even most challenging environments. 
At our utilities, 2015 was a record year for us in many respects and growing regulated business continues to thrive. We achieved a major earnings milestone. Our utilities earned over $1 billion in net income, delivering the highest utility earnings on record. We invested nearly $3.7 billion in needed improvements for our customers across the utilities, including the AMI and the grid modernization investments, significant gas and electric infrastructure and an innovative technology and customer-oriented systems. Our track record for reliability and customer service has allowed us to earn solid returns. 
Our utility earnings on aggregate across Exelon is at 9.5% in 2015. Our returns reflect the constructive regulatory relationship in our territories. PECO received a unanimous approval for both its $127 million rate case settlement and a $275 million long-term infrastructure improvement plan. BGE received approval for recovery of more than $200 million of energy efficiency and gas infrastructure replacement investments. And at ComEd, we achieved our fourth consecutive year of constructed outcomes in our formula rate file. 
This year, we filed a rate reduction at ComEd, showing our ability to contain cost and limit the impact of capital investments on our customers build even during the current Smart Grid investment cycles. 
The utilities continue to drive high operational performance, and that performance is getting better each year. Of the 26 metrics we tracked, 21 of them were best or second best ever in 2015, including reliability and customer satisfaction. 
As for our goals in the utility business in 2016, our first primary goal is closing the PHI transaction at which point, we'll begin the important job of integrating PHI, the Exelon family utilities. 
We'll bring our management model to PHI utilities in order to improve the experience of the customers in the region. We'll work diligently to develop and implement an effective regulatory strategy for PHI. We'll invest approximately $4 billion in our existing utilities to refurbish and modernize the grid to improve service for our customers. That is part of the $18 billion we'll invest in our existing utilities over the next 5 years. 
We will work to maintain first quartile operational and customer satisfaction numbers, while continuing to focus on productivity and cost management. 
Finally, we expect the decision in our November 2015 BGE rate case in June and we'll file our annual formula rate update at ComEd in April. 
By executing on these goals, we'll deliver one of the most compelling utility earnings growth stores. 
Our Generation business had a solid year. Operationally in 2015, the Constellations -- in Constellation performed well even in the face of weak markets. Nuclear capacity factor was 93.7%. Refueling outage performance was very strong. 
Average refueling outage duration was 22 days, that's the lowest average since 2002. 
Our gas and hydro plants outperformed the dispatched matched targets. Our solar and wind assets did the same for the energy capture funds. 
Our power business went 15 months without an employed OSHA recordable incident. It's the best safety performance ever. 
At Constellation, our generation to load matching strategy contribute meaningfully to the earnings. Our load serving business experienced growth in both power and gas. 
In 2015, we served 195 terawatt hours of wholesale and retail load, materially growing that platform from 155 terawatt hours the prior year. We continue to have high customer wind and renewable rates. 
We are now top 10 marketer of natural gas and it significantly increased our delivery of retail gas to 720 bcf last year. 
In 2016, at Exelon Generation, will continue to operate world-class fleet of assets highest level of performance, while continuing to execute our strategy of growing the contracted Generation business with 350 megawatts of wind projects in development. 
At Constellation, we will achieve our targets of serving 210 terawatt hours of load across our wholesale and retail base using our commercial platform as both a risk management vehicle and an earnings driver. 
Each of our business is well positioned to continue strong performance in 2016 operationally and financially. We have some important priorities we are targeting in 2016. We'll continue our broad efficacy efforts to ensure that our unique class of nuclear assets are properly valued for the clean, safe and reliable attributes. 
Developments in New York for a clean energy standard are constructing. The leadership of the governor in New York has been very positive, but more work needs to be done. Then we will engage with key stakeholders in the state. We continue with our specific efforts with legislators and stakeholders in Illinois on the low carbon portfolio standard. 
We provided ample time to reach the resolution on the nuclear assets, suffering significant losses in the process. If we don't see significant results, we will make the economically rational decision. We continue to engage with MISO on a constructive reform to address the issues in Zone 4. We'll work in the states in which we operate to develop compliance plans for the clean power pool. 
This has been a challenging period for our sector. We are tackling those challenges aggressively. We're reducing our costs by $350 million. We'll continue to shift our business mix to more regulated exposure, both organically with our $18 billion capital into our existing utilities over the next 5 years and through our strategic acquisition of Pepco, which will raise that number of capital investment to $25 billion over the next 5 years. 
The company remains on a solid footing. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to run the businesses with the highest operational levels. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack for the financial details."
296181,323432855,926186,"Exelon Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris stated, we had a strong year financially and operationally across the company. For the full year, we delivered earnings of $2.49 per share and $0.38 per share for the fourth quarter. If bonus had no",1436,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris stated, we had a strong year financially and operationally across the company. 
For the full year, we delivered earnings of $2.49 per share and $0.38 per share for the fourth quarter. If bonus had not been extended, we would have delivered earnings of $2.58 per share, meaningfully exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range. The appendix contains details on our fourth quarter financial results by operating company on Slides 21 and 22. 
My remarks today will focus on 2016 earnings and O&M guidance, our credit profile, the cost management initiative and an update of our gross margin disclosures. 
Turning to Slide 6, we expect to deliver 2016 full year adjusted operating earnings of $2.40 to $2.70 and $0.60 to $0.70 per share for the first quarter. 
While we anticipate closing the Pepco Holdings deal in the first quarter, our guidance is the standalone figure that assumes the equity and debt issued for the PHI deal is unwound during the year. The impact of the extension of bonus depreciation is included in the guidance. 
Our growing utilities earnings primarily reflects increased capital investment in distribution and transmission to improve reliability and customer service at ComEd, as well as increased rates for PECO's recent distribution rate case, partially offset by higher O&M at PECO and BGE related to storm and bad debt costs. 
Our strong operating performance at our utilities is fostering a positive regulatory environment in all our jurisdictions and is evident in the transformation it allowed and earned returns that we've achieved at BGE since the Constellation merger. 
BGE has improved reliability and customer satisfaction in every year as compared to 2012, the year of the merger, which in turn, has led to improved regulatory outcomes and earned ROEs over that same period. 
Last November, BGE filed an electric and gas distribution rate case with the Maryland Public Service Commission, requesting revenue requirement increases of $121 million and $80 million to its electric and gas distribution rates, respectively. The requested rates of return on equity in the application are 10.6% for electric distribution and 10.5% for gas distribution. We expect the Maryland PSC to rule on the rate case in the June time frame with the new rates going into effect shortly after the final order. The revenue requirement increases reflect the continued investment, including Smart Grid being made at BGE to improve reliability and customer service. 
Constellation had an record year in 2015, driven by higher realized margins that benefited from a lower cost-to-serve our load and strong performance in our portfolio management group. 
In 2016, we expect a more normalized cost-to-serve load and portfolio management performance, which we expect will have a negative impact on our earnings relative to an extraordinary 2015. 
Overall, at Exelon Generation, the earnings impact from normalized margins and higher decommissioning costs, partially offset by fewer nuclear outages and cost management efforts, result in a forecast decrease in ExGen's earnings range versus last year. 
Our cost management initiative savings in 2016 should largely offset the impact of inflation at ExGen where labor and wage inflation are significant components of O&M. 
For reference, more detail on the year-over-year drivers by operating company can be found in the appendix on Slides 23 through 26. 
Moving to Slide 7. As we've said in the past, bonus depreciation has a negative impact on earnings, but a positive impact on cash. 
In 2016, it creates a rounded $0.09 earnings drag at the consolidated level with the $0.06 impact at Exelon Generation and a $0.03 impact at ComEd. 
On the cash front, it increases cash flow by $625 million in 2016. 
Despite the negative earnings impact of bonus depreciation in 2016 through '18, we are affirming the CAGR of 3% to 5% for the enterprise and 7% to 9% for the utilities through 2018 that we disclosed at EEI. 
In addition, the extension of bonus depreciation will likely have a further effect on Exelon as a whole after the closing of the Pepco Holdings deal. Once the merger is completed, and we begin the integration of PHI's operating, planning and regulatory functions, we'll provide an update on PHI's forecast and the resulting increase in impact on Exelon's forecast. 
On Slide 8, our top financial priority remains maintaining our investment grade credit rating and ensuring the strength of our balance sheet. The 5-year extension of bonus depreciation improves the free cash flow positioned at ExGen, which has a positive impact on our FFO to debt metrics. ExGen free cash flow over the 2016 to 2018 period is now projected to be $5.35 billion or $3.2 billion after taking into account committed growth capital. 
Since our EEI disclosure, Exelon Generation has commenced developing a further 350 megawatts of long-term contracted wind projects in Michigan and Oklahoma. 
As you'll note on the slide, given our strong cash flow outlook, ExGen has declining debt-to-EBITDA ratio, starting at 3.2x in 2016 and decreasing to 2.3x debt-to-EBITDA by 2018. 
Bottom line, we're growing durable earnings and shrinking debt. 
Turning to Slide 9. I will provide an update on the cost management initiative that we announced towards the end of last year. We recently finalized the savings initiatives in January and have incorporated them into our -- in our current long-range plan. 
As we mentioned at EEI, the total identified savings are in the $350 million range with savings split equally between Exelon Generation and our corporate shared services organization. $100 million of the savings at the shared services organization will be achieved within our information technology function with the remainder coming from various corporate functions such as finance, legal, Human Resources and supply. The corporate savings will be allocated roughly equally between Exelon Generation and the utilities. 
Overall, this means that roughly 3/4 of the total cost savings for the company will hit the bottom line at Exelon Generation, while the remaining 1/4 of the savings will be realized at utilities, and ultimately passed on to our customers. 
As a result, we expected run rate earnings benefit from our cost management initiative of $0.13 to $0.18 per share beginning in 2018, with approximately 35% of the run rate savings achieved by the end of this year. 
Our proven track record of cutting costs and running our business efficiently gives us confidence we'll be able to achieve or exceed these savings. 
Slide 10 shows our 2016 O&M forecast relative to 2015. We project O&M for 2016 to be flat to 2015, and we expect a slightly negative O&M CAGR across the enterprise over the 2015 to 2018 period, and a negative 1% CAGR at Exelon Generation. 
ExGen's year-over-year decrease is driven by a combination of factors: Fewer planned nuclear outages compared to 2015; lower pension costs; and the impacts of the cost management initiative. 
The year-over-year increase at PECO and BGE is due to inflation and budgeting for normal storm and bad debt costs, which results in the incremental year-over-year O&M growth. 
Slide 11 provides our fourth quarter gross margin update. This quarter's gross margin update now includes the impact of the Ginna RSSA to 2016 and 2017 total gross margin. 
As we saw, the forward prices and heat rates for 2017 increase by the end of the quarter, we reduced our deviation to ratable. 
For 2017, we ended the quarter with a power position of 5% to 8% behind ratable on a total portfolio basis when considering our crossed commodity hedges. We're then further behind ratable in the Mid-West, approximately 13% to 16% when considering cross commodity hedges. We continue to align our hedging strategy with our views on the market. 
In 2016, total gross margin is flat to our last disclosure. As you know, we're highly hedged in 2016, which combined with the inclusion of the Ginna RSSA allowed us to offset the impacts of lower prices in 2016. 
During the quarter, we also executed on $50 million of both tower new business and non-tower new business. 
Total gross margin increased by $50 million in both 2017 and 2018. The increase in 2017 is partially driven by the Ginna RSSA, which mitigates losses, while the increase in 2018 is driven by higher power prices across most of the regions, most notably in NiHub with the round-the-clock prices increasing by in $0.64 per megawatt hour. 
During the quarter, we also executed on $15 million of non-power new business for both 2017 and 2018. 
As a reminder, the appendix includes several schedules that will help you in your modeling efforts. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll now open up the line for questions."

We continue to work on Clinton. Clinton is negative. We have 2 initiatives underway. One working with MISO on Zone 4 reforms, and we like the design to be more like the new PJM capacity market design. But that in itself will not save Clinton. As you know, there's a lot of work going on in Springfield with the administration and the legislature, and we have had a very strong support from the leadership and the legislature and the administration by coming to a resolution on the energy outlook for Illinois. It's not only that the clean energy standard, but there's an environmental jobs, green jobs build and there's the utility of the future build that have to be negotiated together. There's been progress made in that dialogue, but it is critical that we have -- that we're able to present to the legislature this spring a combined package that ensures the financial viability of our assets as they contribute highly reliability in environmental or we will have to make the rational economic decision. It's our job to get the stakeholders together. We're working hard on that and to bring the leadership what was the consensus package that's good for all of Illinois and its customers. So we're in this spring time in Illinois, and we're hopeful that we can have reasonable hedge prevail and negotiate a balanced outcome. And as I said, present that to leadership so they can provide continued support."

Financially, where we closed near the upper end of the range even with the milder weather. And operationally, our utilities and plants continue to operate at high levels. 
The big news for the quarter is we closed the Pepco Holdings transaction in March. We are excited to have Pepco utilities as part of the Exelon family. We know it's been a long journey, and it took much longer than any of us anticipated, but we appreciate the patients of our investors as we pursued the merger. Our employees who worked tirelessly from the inception to the completion of the deal and the main stakeholders who supported was critical to getting the deal done. 
PHI is an important piece of our strategy to become a more regulated company with more stable earnings streams. While we're still in the early stages of integrating PHI, PHI's earnings outlook is consistent, if not better, than what we showed you at EEI. That brings meaningful benefits to our customers, communities and Delaware District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, including bill credits and reliability investments. More than $500 million in total commitments have been made and will be achieved due to this merger. 
We are now focused on integrating Pepco into Exelon. We will bring our management model and our best practices to improve the experience of our customers. 
The transaction confirms Exelon's role as a leader in the industry. We serve 10 million customers or than any other utility company. We will spend nearly $23 billion in capital cost our utilities in generating business over the next 3 years, which is the second highest among our peers.  We have the largest pure TND by rate base and within the top 5 when including rate base generation. 
We are the second largest generator of electricity in the country, the largest competitor by a factor of nearly 2, while producing power at the lowest carbon intensity of any large generator. 
We are the leader in the retail electric provider in the country, serving 133 -- 139 terawatts. 
The culture of the industry leadership is found throughout our organization, positioning us very well for the future. 
Switching to operational performance. Our first quarter of operating performance was strong, and we're on track for a strong year. At our legacy utilities, our safety and CAIDI are on track to meet reliability targets, we're top quartile in both. 
At the Genco, our nuclear plants ran at a capacity factor of 95.8%. Our solar and wind assets outperformed their energy capture targets. 
Switching to Illinois in the nuclear plants. While there's much to celebrate this quarter, we also need to make tough decisions on the future of Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear stations in Illinois. The board has given the authority to go-forward with early retirements for Clinton and Quad Cities plants. If for Clinton, adequate legislation is not passed during the spring legislative session that is scheduled to end May 31 and if for Quad Cities adequate legislation is not passed and the plant is not clear at the upcoming PJM auction. Otherwise, we plan to retire Clinton on June 1, 2017, and Quad Cities on June 1 of 2018.  This is consistent with planned refueling outage and capacity market obligations. 
We commit to our employees -- we committed our employees, our shareholders and the communities to try to find a path of profitability for our distressed assets. This is because these plants are vital to the communities that they are located in and provide economic and environmental value to the state. The state's own analysis showed that closing Clinton and Quad Cities would result in $1.2 billion in lost economic activity and 4,200 jobs lost and a significant reduction of supply of reliable electricity for Illinois residents and businesses. 
We work hard over the last few years to find a path to sustainable profitability. Deferring $120 million in strategic capital of these plans, we pursued legislation and regulatory market changes. We've been successful in some areas, with PJM market reforms that were put into place last year, the cost reductions that we've achieved and the large number of stakeholders who have worked so hard to help in this fight. We have strong allies in our cost, our employees, our Quad communities the bill sponsors and cosponsors, our partners in labor and our vendors among others. 
I want to thank them all very much for their support and regret the impact on this decision that we have on them. But for reasons outside of our control, we have not seen progress in Illinois policy reports. 
Also, the Supreme Court state creates uncertainty regarding the EPA's Clean Power Plan. Power prices have fallen to a 15-year low in PJM causing the economics of Clinton and Quad Cities to further deteriorate. 
These plans have loss $800 million in cash flow from 2009 to 2015. Just to be clear, we are not covering our operating costs for our risk, let alone receiving a return on our invested capital. We've done all we can up to this point, and we continue to work through the spring legislative session to enact the much-needed reforms. However, without adequate legislation, we no longer see a path for profitability and can no longer sustain the ongoing losses. 
On a more positive note, we continue to see a path way to reform in New York, where Governor Cuomo, the legislature of the Public Service Commission, have recognized the need to preserve the state's nuclear plants. New York is quickly moving forward to implement a clean energy standard that will allow us to continue to operate our challenged 9-mile plants. 
I'll turn the call over to Jack to discuss the first quarter results further."

As Chris stated, we had a str",1101,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will cover our first quarter results, 2016 guidance, update our gross margins disclosures and provide an update on developments since Q4. 
I'll start on Slide 8. As Chris stated, we had a strong quarter financially and operationally across the company. For the first quarter, we delivered adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.68 per share, near the top of our guidance range of $0.60 to $0.70 per share. This compares to $0.71 per share for the first quarter of 2015. 
Exelon's utilities delivered a combination $0.37 per share. During the quarter, we saw unfavorable mild weather at PECO and ComEd versus plant, which was partially offset by lower bad debt expense at BGE. There are only 8 days of PHI included in our results, which had a minimal impact in the quarter. 
Generation had a great quarter earning $0.34 per share. We had strong performance from our nuclear assets with better capacity factors than budgeted. And while we power prices and lower volatility were a drag our Constellation team delivered strong results. Our generation to load matching strategy continues to provide value, and we benefited from a lower cost-to-serve our customers. 
For the second quarter, we are providing guidance of $0.50 to $0.60 per share. This compares to our realized earnings of $0.59 per share for the second quarter of 2015. The appendix contains details on our first quarter financial results compared to the first quarter of 2015 results by operating company on Slide 16 and 17. 
Turning to Slide 9. We are affirming our full year guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share, which now includes the contribution from PHI and assumes an average of 926 million shares outstanding for 2016.  This should help calibrate your segment models. 
On Slide 10, we are still working through a comprehensive financial plan now that we've closed the PHI deal. But I want to address the pieces that we can today. We are reaffirming our earnings growth at our legacy utilities of 7% to 9% per year from 2015 to 2018. On PHI, we are still working through the plan but see the contribution equal to or better than what we showed you at EEI and consistent with sustaining our 7% to 9% utility growth target. 
On Slide 11, we should make this growth targets, we are going to be busy on the regulatory plan. The PHI utilities has been out of rate cases for at least 2 years yet continue to invest $800 million per year to improve reliability and customer service, leading to low earned-- leading to the low earned ROEs that we show on Slide 30 in the appendix. 
However, by the third quarter, we plan to file distribution cases in all of PHI's jurisdictions and expect decisions in all cases by the middle of next year providing needed revenue release. 
Atlantic City Electric and Pepco Maryland have already filed their cases. 8 [ph] filed in electric distribution base rate case on March 22 with  the New Jersey Board of Public utilities requesting $84 million revenue increase and a 10.6% return on equity. 
It also included power ahead the 5-year, $176 million grid resiliency plant. On April 19, Pepco requested a rate increase of $127 million with the Maryland Public Service Commission.  The rate case includes smart meter recovery and a 2-year, $32 million grid resiliency plan. 
In addition to reducing the number and length of outages, Pepco's 5 years smart grid program is generating nearly $4 and customer benefits for every dollar invested. 
In addition, ComEd made its annual formula rate filing with the Illinois Commerce Commission. ComEd requested a revenue requirement increase of $138 million, reflecting approximately $2.4 billion in capital investments made in 2015. 
Those investments, which included $663 million for Smart Grid related work that help strengthen to modernize electric system, resulting in record power reliability and customer satisfaction, operational savings and new ways to save on electric bills for ComEd customers. More details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 33, 34 through 37 in the appendix. 
Slide 12 provides our first quarter gross margin update. In 2016, total gross margin is flat to our last disclosure. During the quarter, we executed on $200 million of power new business and $100 million of nonpower new business. 
We're highly hedged for the rest of this year and well-balanced and our generation to load matching strategy. 
Total gross margin decreased in the first quarter by $150 million in 2017 and $200 million in 2018 as PJM power prices moved approximately $1.60 to $2.10 lower since the beginning of the year. We ended the quarter approximately 5% to 8% behind ratable in both of these years when considering cross commodity hedges with the majority of our link concentrated in the Midwest to align to our fundamental view of spot market upside at NiHub. 
Power prices have risen since the start of the second quarter and we are timing our hedging activity to lock in the value of the recent price increases, while remaining well positioned to capture our fundamental view. 
On Slide 13, I wanted to give you a quick update on some tax implications that are associated with the completion of the PHI merger. With the inclusion of PHI, we expect to realize $700 million to $850 million of additional cash from 2017 to 2019 related to legacy NOLs and the impact of bonus depreciation. However, now is a very modest cash taxpayer for 2018, we have less ability to take the domestic production activities production, or DPAP, in 2018, which effectively increases our overall consolidated tax rate by as much as 200 basis points or the equivalent of $0.06 to $0.08 per share in 2018. 
Although this is onetime negative impact to 2018 ExGen earnings, it comes with significant positive cash flow, and we expect to return to normalize tax rates in 2019. 
With the variability of interest rates, I'd like to remind you that ComEd's allowed ROE is based on 30-year treasury rate plus 580 basis points and that's sensitive to moves in this rate. Every 25 basis point move in treasury rates results in a $0.01 move in EPS. 
Before turning the call over to Chris, I wanted to raise a few scheduling points. We'll be hosting an Analyst Day on August 10 in Philadelphia, and we'll get details around shortly. Therefore, we will not be having a second quarter earnings call, and we'll release earnings before Analyst Day. 
I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

Steve, the support is the same support we have for the original bill labor, the host communities. And in addition, we now have the support of some groups that represent climate scientists and others that are concerned with greenhouse gas emissions.",309,"Sure. Steve, the support is the same support we have for the original bill labor, the host communities. And in addition, we now have the support of some groups that represent climate scientists and others that are concerned with greenhouse gas emissions. In terms of how the program would work, let me just start with the policy analogy that I think all if you're familiar with the. The existing state-of-the-art programs for renewables provides compensation to qualified resources through renewable energy credits Rex. The Rex value is the difference between available wholesale revenues and the cost needed to keep the existing renewables in operation and get new renewables build. All this is done in order to get the benefit of greenhouse gas reductions, while protecting customers. If wholesale revenues go up, the needed Rec payment goes down. We see that happening every day in Rec spot markets. As that program is designed the same way. It's a payment for the state value of 0 emission credits from nuclear plants, which represents the difference between the needed revenues and the cost of operating the plants. In the case of the New York and Illinois programs, the way it would work is that experts at the commissions will determine on a prospective basis the cost of operating the plants, plus risks, less available market revenues. And where there is a delta between that. In other words, where the cost and risks are not covered by available market revenues, that program will kick in and provide compensation for greenhouse gas of wins. The program is not a PPA or a contract difference. If revenues or cost are different, there's no true-up. And so Steve, I think if you have additional questions, perhaps after the call, we could work with Dan and Emily to set up a meeting, both are more programmatic details."

Once again, we had a great quarter financially, where we closed near the upper end of the range even with the milder weather.

Once again, we had a great quarter financially, where we closed near the upper end of the range even with the milder weather. And operationally, our utilities and plants continue to operate at high levels. 
The big news for the quarter is we closed the Pepco Holdings transaction in March. We are excited to have Pepco utilities as part of the Exelon family. We know this has been a long journey and it took much longer than any of us anticipated. But we appreciate the patience of our investors as we pursued the merger, our employees who worked tirelessly from the inception to the completion of the deal and the many stakeholders who supported and was critical to getting the deal done. 
PHI is an important piece of our strategy to become a more regulated company with more stable earnings streams. While we are still in the early stages of integrating PHI, PHI's earnings outlook is consistent, if not better, than what we showed you at EEI. It brings meaningful benefits to our customers, communities in Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, including bill credits and reliability investments. More than $500 million in total commitments have been made and will be achieved due to this merger. We are now focused on integrating Pepco into Exelon. We will bring our management model and our best practices to improve the experience of our customers. 
The transaction confirms Exelon's role as a leader in the industry. We serve 10 million customers, more than any other utility company. We will spend nearly $23 billion in capital across our utilities and generating business over the next 3 years, which is the second-highest among our peers. We are the largest pure T&D by rate base and within the top 5 when including rate base generation. We are the second-largest generator of electricity in the country, the largest competitor by a factor of nearly 2, while producing power at the lowest carbon intensity of any large generator. We are the leader in the retail electric provider in the country, serving 133 -- 139 terawatts. The culture of the industry leadership is found throughout our organization, positioning us very well for the future. 
Switching to operational performance. Our first quarter operating performance was strong, and we're on track for a strong year. At our legacy utilities, our safety and CAIDI are on track to meet reliability targets. We're in the top quartile on both. At the Genco, our nuclear plants ran at a capacity factor of 95.8%. Our solar and wind assets outperformed their energy capture targets. 
Switching to Illinois nuclear plants. While there's much to celebrate this quarter, we also need to make tough decisions on the future of Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear stations in Illinois. The board has given the authority to go forward with early retirements for our Clinton and Quad Cities plants if for Clinton adequate legislation is not passed during this spring legislative session that is scheduled to end May 31 and if for Quad Cities adequate legislation is not passed and the plant has not cleared the upcoming PJM auction. Otherwise, we plan to retire Clinton on June 1, 2017, and Quad Cities on June 1, 2018.  This is consistent with planned refueling outage and capacity market obligations. 
We commit to our employees -- we committed our employees, our shareholders and the communities to try to find a path for profitability for our distressed assets. This is because these plants are vital to the communities that they are located in and provide economic and environmental value to the state. The state's own analysis showed that closing Clinton and Quad Cities would result in $1.2 billion in lost economic activity and 4,200 jobs lost and a significant reduction of supply of reliable electricity for Illinois residents and businesses. 
We worked hard over the last few years to find a path to sustainable profitability. Deferring $120 million in strategic capital at these plants, we pursued legislation and regulatory market changes. We've been successful in some areas with PJM market reforms that were put into place last year, the cost reductions that we have achieved and the large number of stakeholders who have worked so hard to help in this fight. We have strong allies in our cause, our employees, our plant communities, the bill sponsors and cosponsors, our partners in labor and our vendors among others. I want to thank them all very much for their support and regret the impact on this decision that we have on them. 
But for reasons outside of our control, we have not seen progress in Illinois policy reports. Also the Supreme Court stay creates uncertainty regarding the EPA's Clean Power Plan. Power prices have fallen to a 15-year low in PJM, causing the economics of Clinton and Quad Cities to further deteriorate. These plants have lost $800 million in cash flow from 2009 to 2015. Just to be clear, we are not covering our operating costs or our risk, let alone receiving a return on our invested capital. We've done all we can up to this point and we continue to work through the spring legislative session to enact the much-needed reforms. However, without adequate legislation, we no longer see a path for profitability and no longer can sustain the ongoing losses. 
On a more positive note, we continue to see a pathway to reform in New York, where Governor Cuomo and the legislator of the Public Service Commission have recognized the need to preserve the state's nuclear plants. New York is quickly moving forward to implement a clean energy standard that will allow us to continue to operate our challenged Ginna and Nine Mile plants. 
I'll turn the call over to Jack to discuss the first quarter results further."

My remarks today will cover our first quarter results, 2016 guidance, update our gross margin disclosures and provide an update on developments since Q4. I'll start on Slide 8. As Chris stated, we had a stro",1098,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will cover our first quarter results, 2016 guidance, update our gross margin disclosures and provide an update on developments since Q4. 
I'll start on Slide 8. As Chris stated, we had a strong quarter financially and operationally across the company. For the first quarter, we delivered adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.68 per share, near the top of our guidance range of $0.60 to $0.70 per share. This compares to $0.71 per share for the first quarter of 2015. Exelon's utilities delivered a combined $0.37 per share. 
During the quarter, we saw unfavorable mild weather at PECO and ComEd versus plan, which was partially offset by lower bad debt expense at BGE. There are only 8 days of PHI included in our results, which had a minimal impact on the quarter. Generation had a great quarter, earning $0.34 per share. We had strong performance from our nuclear assets with better capacity factors than budgeted. And while weak power prices and lower volatility were a drag, our Constellation team delivered strong results. Our generation to load matching strategy continues to provide value and we benefited from a lower cost to serve our customers. 
For the second quarter, we are providing guidance of $0.50 to $0.60 per share. This compares to our realized earnings of $0.59 per share for the second quarter of 2015. The appendix contains details on our first quarter financial results compared to the first quarter of 2015 results by operating company on Slide 16 and 17. 
Turning to Slide 9. We are affirming our full year guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share, which now includes the contribution from PHI and assumes an average of 926 million shares outstanding for 2016. This should help calibrate your segment models. 
On Slide 10, we are still working through a comprehensive financial plan now that we've closed the PHI deal but want to address the pieces that we can today. We are reaffirming our earnings growth at our legacy utilities of 7% to 9% per year from 2015 to 2018. On PHI, we are still working through the plan but see the contribution equal to or better than what we showed you at EEI and consistent with sustaining our 7% to 9% utility growth target. 
On Slide 11, to meet these growth targets, we are going to be busy on the regulatory front. The PHI utilities have been out of rate cases for at least 2 years yet continue to invest $800 million per year to improve reliability and customer service, leading to the low earned ROEs that we show on Slide 30 in the appendix. However, by the third quarter, we plan to have filed the distribution cases in all of PHI's jurisdictions and expect decisions in all cases by the middle of next year, providing needed revenue release. 
Atlantic City Electric and Pepco Maryland have already filed their cases. ACE filed an electric distribution base rate case on March 22 with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, requesting an $84 million revenue increase and a 10.6% return on equity. It also included PowerAhead, a 5-year, $176 million grid resiliency plan. On April 19, Pepco requested a rate increase of $127 million with the Maryland Public Service Commission.  The rate case includes smart meter recovery and a 2-year, $32 million grid resiliency plan. In addition to reducing the number and length of outages, Pepco's 5-year smart grid program is generating nearly $4 in customer benefits for every dollar invested. 
In addition, ComEd made its annual formula rate filing with the Illinois Commerce Commission. ComEd requested a revenue requirement increase of $138 million, reflecting approximately $2.4 billion in capital investments made in 2015. Those investments, which included $663 million for smart grid-related work that helped strengthen and modernize the electric system, resulting in record power reliability and customer satisfaction, operational savings and new ways to save on electric bills for ComEd customers. More details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 33, 34 through 37 in the appendix. 
Slide 12 provides our first quarter gross margin update. In 2016, total gross margin is flat to our last disclosure. During the quarter, we executed on $200 million of power new business and $100 million of non-power new business. We're highly hedged for the rest of this year and well-balanced on our generation to load matching strategy. Total gross margin decreased in the first quarter by $150 million in 2017 and $200 million in 2018 as PJM power prices moved approximately $1.60 to $2.10 lower since the beginning of the year. We ended the quarter approximately 5% to 8% behind ratable in both of these years when considering cross-commodity hedges with a majority of our link concentrated in the Midwest to align to our fundamental view of spot market upside at NiHub. Power prices have risen since the start of the second quarter, and we are timing our hedging activity to lock in the value of the recent price increases while remaining well positioned to capture our fundamental view. 
On Slide 13, I wanted to give you a quick update on some tax implications that are associated with the completion of the PHI merger. With the inclusion of PHI, we expect to realize $700 million to $850 million of additional cash from 2017 to 2019 related to legacy NOLs and the impact of bonus depreciation. However, now as a very modest cash taxpayer for 2018, we have less ability to take the domestic production activities deduction, or DPAD, in 2018, which effectively increases our overall consolidated tax rate by as much as 200 basis points or the equivalent of $0.06 to $0.08 per share in 2018. Although this is a one-time negative impact to 2018 ExGen earnings, it comes with significant positive cash flow, and we expect to return to normalized tax rates in 2019. With the variability of interest rates, I'd like to remind you that ComEd's allowed ROE is based on a 30-year treasury rate plus 580 basis points, and thus sensitive to moves in this rate. Every 25 basis point move in treasury rates results in a $0.01 move in EPS. 
Before turning the call over to Chris, I wanted to raise a few scheduling points. We'll be hosting an Analyst Day on August 10 in Philadelphia, and we'll get details around shortly. Therefore, we will not be having a second quarter earnings call, and we'll release earnings before Analyst Day. I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

Balance sheet strength remains a top financial priority. We have a strong strategy to deliver stable growth, sustainable earnings and an attractive dividend to our shareholders. We will be growing that dividend at 2.5% each year for the next 3 years, starting with the dividend payable on June. From a capital deployment perspective, we will continue to harvest free cash flow from the Generation business to invest primarily in our utilities to benefit our customers; invest in long-term contracted assets, which meet our return requirements; and return capital to our shareholders. This is the right strategy for our markets and our assets.

And in addition, we now have the support of some groups that represent climate scientists and others that are concerned with greenhouse gas emissions. In terms of how the program would work, let me just start with the policy analogy that I think all of you are familiar with. The existing state RPS programs for renewables provide compensation to qualified resources through renewable energy credits, RECs. The REC value is the difference between available wholesale revenues and the cost needed to keep the existing renewables in operations and get new renewables built. All this is done in order to get the benefit of greenhouse gas reductions while protecting customers. If wholesale revenues go up, the needed REC payment goes down. We see that happening every day in REC spot markets. The ZEC program is designed the same way. It's a payment for the state value of zero emission credits from nuclear plants, which represents the difference between the needed revenues and the cost of operating the plants. In the case of the New York and Illinois programs, the way it would work is that experts at the commissions will determine on a prospective basis the cost of operating the plants plus risks, less available market revenues. And where there's a delta between that, in other words, where the cost and risks are not covered by available market revenues, the ZEC program will kick in and provide compensation for greenhouse gas [indiscernible]. The program is not a PPA or a contract for differences. If revenues or costs are different, there's no true-up. And so Steve, I think if you have additional questions, perhaps after the call, we could work with Dan and Emily to set up a meeting, go through more programmatic details."

Once again, we had a great quarter financially, where we closed near the upper end of the range even with the milder weather.

Once again, we had a great quarter financially, where we closed near the upper end of the range even with the milder weather. And operationally, our utilities and plants continue to operate at high levels. 
The big news for the quarter is we closed the Pepco Holdings transaction in March. We are excited to have Pepco utilities as part of the Exelon family. We know this has been a long journey and it took much longer than any of us anticipated. But we appreciate the patience of our investors as we pursued the merger, our employees who worked tirelessly from the inception to the completion of the deal and the many stakeholders who supported was critical to getting the deal done. 
PHI is an important piece of our strategy to become a more regulated company with more stable earnings streams. While we are still in the early stages of integrating PHI, PHI's earnings outlook is consistent, if not better, than what we showed you at EEI. It brings meaningful benefits to our customers, communities in Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, including bill credits and reliability investments. More than $500 million in total commitments have been made and will be achieved due to this merger. We are now focused on integrating Pepco into Exelon. We will bring our management model and our best practices to improve the experience of our customers. 
The transaction confirms Exelon's role as a leader in the industry. We serve 10 million customers, more than any other utility company. We will spend nearly $23 billion in capital across our utilities and generating business over the next 3 years, which is the second-highest among our peers. We are the largest pure T&D by rate base and within the top 5 when including rate base generation. We are the second-largest generator of electricity in the country, the largest competitor by a factor of nearly 2, while producing power at the lowest carbon intensity of any large generator. We are the leader in the retail electric provider in the country, serving 133 -- 139 terawatts. The culture of the industry leadership is found throughout our organization, positioning us very well for the future. 
Switching to operational performance. Our first quarter operating performance was strong, and we're on track for a strong year. At our legacy utilities, our safety and CAIDI are on track to meet reliability targets. We're in the top quartile on both. At the Genco, our nuclear plants ran at a capacity factor of 95.8%. Our solar and wind assets outperformed their energy capture targets. 
Switching to Illinois nuclear plants. While there's much to celebrate this quarter, we also need to make tough decisions on the future of Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear stations in Illinois. The board has given me authority to go forward with early retirements for Clinton and Quad Cities plants if for Clinton adequate legislation is not passed during this spring legislative session that is scheduled to end May 31 and if for Quad Cities adequate legislation is not passed and the plant has not cleared the upcoming PJM auction. Otherwise, we plan to retire Clinton on June 1, 2017, and Quad Cities on June 1, 2018.  This is consistent with planned refueling outage and capacity market obligations. 
We commit to our employees -- we committed to our employees, our shareholders and their communities to try to find a path for profitability for our distressed assets. This is because these plants are vital to the communities that they are located in and provide economic and environmental value to the state. The state's own analysis showed that closing Clinton and Quad Cities would result in $1.2 billion in lost economic activity and 4,200 jobs lost and a significant reduction of supply of reliable electricity for Illinois residents and businesses. 
We worked hard over the last few years to find a path to sustainable profitability. Deferring $120 million in strategic capital at these plants, we pursued legislation and regulatory market changes. We've been successful in some areas with PJM market reforms that were put into place last year, the cost reductions that we have achieved and the large number of stakeholders who have worked so hard to help in this fight. We have strong allies in our cause, our employees, our plant communities, the bill sponsors and cosponsors, our partners in labor and our vendors among others. I want to thank them all very much for their support and regret the impact on this decision that we have on them. 
But for reasons outside of our control, we have not seen progress in Illinois policy reports. Also the Supreme Court stay creates uncertainty regarding the EPA's Clean Power Plan. Power prices have fallen to a 15-year low in PJM, causing the economics of Clinton and Quad Cities to further deteriorate. These plants have lost $800 million in cash flow from 2009 to 2015. Just to be clear, we are not covering our operating costs or our risk, let alone receiving a return on our invested capital. We've done all we can up to this point and we continue to work through the spring legislative session to enact the much-needed reforms. However, without adequate legislation, we no longer see a path for profitability and no longer can sustain the ongoing losses. 
On a more positive note, we continue to see a pathway to reform in New York, where Governor Cuomo, the legislature, the Public Service Commission have recognized the need to preserve the state's nuclear plants. New York is quickly moving forward to implement a clean energy standard that will allow us to continue to operate our challenged Ginna and Nine Mile plants. 
I'll turn the call over to Jack to discuss the first quarter results further."
296181,331984338,976063,"Exelon Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 06, 2016",2016-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will cover our first quarter results, 2016 guidance, update our gross margin disclosures and provide an update on developments since Q4. I'll start on Slide 8. As Chris stated, we had a stro",1099,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will cover our first quarter results, 2016 guidance, update our gross margin disclosures and provide an update on developments since Q4. 
I'll start on Slide 8. As Chris stated, we had a strong quarter financially and operationally across the company. For the first quarter, we delivered adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.68 per share, near the top of our guidance range of $0.60 to $0.70 per share. This compares to $0.71 per share for the first quarter of 2015. Exelon's utilities delivered a combined $0.37 per share. 
During the quarter, we saw unfavorable mild weather at PECO and ComEd versus plan, which was partially offset by lower bad debt expense at BGE. There are only 8 days of PHI including [ph] in our results, which had a minimal impact on the quarter. Generation had a great quarter, earning $0.34 per share. We had strong performance from our nuclear assets with better capacity factors than budgeted. And while weak power prices and lower volatility were a drag, our Constellation team delivered strong results. Our generation to load matching strategy continues to provide value and we benefited from a lower cost to serve our customers. 
For the second quarter, we are providing guidance of $0.50 to $0.60 per share. This compares to our realized earnings of $0.59 per share for the second quarter of 2015. The appendix contains details on our first quarter financial results compared to the first quarter of 2015 results by operating company on Slide 16 and 17. 
Turning to Slide 9. We are affirming our full year guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share, which now includes the contribution from PHI and assumes an average of 926 million shares outstanding for 2016. This should help calibrate your segment models. 
On Slide 10, we are still working through a comprehensive financial plan now that we have closed the PHI deal but want to address the pieces that we can today. We are reaffirming our earnings growth at our legacy utilities of 7% to 9% per year from 2015 to 2018. On PHI, we are still working through the plan but see the contribution equal to or better than what we showed you at EEI and consistent with sustaining our 7% to 9% utility growth target. 
On Slide 11, to meet these growth targets, we are going to be busy on the regulatory front. The PHI utilities have been out of rate cases for at least 2 years yet continue to invest $800 million per year to improve reliability and customer service, leading to the low earned ROEs that we show on Slide 30 in the appendix. However, by the third quarter, we plan to have filed distribution cases in all of PHI's jurisdictions and expect decisions in all cases by the middle of next year, providing needed revenue release. 
Atlantic City Electric and Pepco Maryland have already filed their cases. ACE filed an electric distribution base rate case on March 22 with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, requesting an $84 million revenue increase and a 10.6% return on equity. It also included PowerAhead, a 5-year, $176 million grid resiliency plan. On April 19, Pepco requested a rate increase of $127 million with the Maryland Public Service Commission.  The rate case includes smart meter recovery and a 2-year, $32 million grid resiliency plan. In addition to reducing the number and length of outages, Pepco's 5-year smart grid program is generating nearly $4 in customer benefits for every dollar invested. 
In addition, ComEd made its annual formula rate filing with the Illinois Commerce Commission. ComEd requested a revenue requirement increase of $138 million, reflecting approximately $2.4 billion in capital investments made in 2015. Those investments, which included $663 million for smart grid-related work that helped strengthen and modernize the electric system, resulting in record power reliability and customer satisfaction, operational savings and new ways to save on electric bills for ComEd customers. More details on the rate cases can be found on Slides 33, 34 through 37 in the appendix. 
Slide 12 provides our first quarter gross margin update. In 2016, total gross margin is flat to our last disclosure. During the quarter, we executed on $200 million of power new business and $100 million of non-power new business. We're highly hedged for the rest of this year and well-balanced on our generation to load matching strategy. Total gross margin decreased in the first quarter by $150 million in 2017 and $200 million in 2018 as PJM power prices moved approximately $1.60 to $2.10 lower since the beginning of the year. We ended the quarter approximately 5% to 8% behind ratable in both of these years when considering cross-commodity hedges with a majority of our link concentrated in the Midwest to align to our fundamental view of spot market upside at NiHub. Power prices have risen since the start of the second quarter, and we are timing our hedging activity to lock in the value of the recent price increases while remaining well positioned to capture our fundamental view. 
On Slide 13, I wanted to give you a quick update on some tax implications that are associated with the completion of the PHI merger. With the inclusion of PHI, we expect to realize $700 million to $850 million of additional cash from 2017 to 2019 related to legacy NOLs and the impacts of bonus depreciation. However, now as a very modest cash taxpayer for 2018, we have less ability to take the domestic production activities deduction, or DPAD, in 2018, which effectively increases our overall consolidated tax rate by as much as 200 basis points or the equivalent of $0.06 to $0.08 per share in 2018. Although this is a one-time negative impact to 2018 ExGen earnings, it comes with significant positive cash flow, and we expect to return to normalized tax rates in 2019. With the variability of interest rates, I'd like to remind you that ComEd's allowed ROE is based on a 30-year treasury rate plus 580 basis points, and thus sensitive to moves in this rate. Every 25 basis point move in treasury rates results in a $0.01 move in EPS. 
Before turning the call over to Chris, I wanted to raise a few scheduling points. We'll be hosting an Analyst Day on August 10 in Philadelphia, and we'll get details around shortly. Therefore, we will not be having a second quarter earnings call, and we'll release earnings before Analyst Day. I will now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

Balance sheet strength remains a top financial priority. We have a strong strategy to deliver stable growth, sustainable earnings and an attractive dividend to our shareholders. We will be growing that dividend at 2.5% each year for the next 3 years, starting with the dividend payable in June. From a capital deployment perspective, we will continue to harvest free cash flow from the Generation business to invest primarily in our utilities to benefit our customers; invest in long-term contracted assets, which meet our return requirements; and return capital to our shareholders. This is the right strategy for our markets and our assets.

Steve, the support is the same support we had for the original bill, labor, the host communities. And in addition, we now have the support of some groups that represent climate scientists and others that are concerned with greenhouse gas emissions. In terms of how the program would work, let me just start with the policy analogy that I think all of you are familiar with. The existing state RPS programs for renewables provide compensation to qualified resources through renewable energy credits, RECs. The REC value is the difference between available wholesale revenues and the cost needed to keep the existing renewables in operations and get new renewables built. All this is done in order to get the benefit of greenhouse gas reductions while protecting customers. If wholesale revenues go up, the needed REC payment goes down. We see that happening every day in REC spot markets. The ZEC program is designed the same way. It's a payment for the state value of zero emission credits from nuclear plants, which represents the difference between the needed revenues and the cost of operating the plants. In the case of the New York and Illinois programs, the way it would work is that experts at the commissions will determine on a prospective basis the cost of operating the plants plus risks, less available market revenues. And where there's a delta between that, in other words, where the cost and risks are not covered by available market revenues, the ZEC program will kick in and provide compensation for greenhouse gas avoidance. The program is not a PPA or a contract for difference. If revenues or costs are different, there's no true-up. And so Steve, I think if you have additional questions, perhaps after the call, we could work with Dan and Emily to set up a meeting, go through more programmatic details."

We appreciate your time and interest in Exelon and joining the call today. 
We hosted our Analyst Day in August, and you have a lot of information that we passed on to understand the business and our value proposition. 
With that fresh in your mind, today's call will focus on the third quarter results, some business updates, including actions we are taking with recent power weaknesses. 
We had a great third quarter across our utilities Constellation and our generating fleet. Our GAAP basis -- on a GAAP basis, we earned $0.53 versus $0.69 last year quarter-over-quarter. 
On the operating basis, we earned $0.91 a share, up from last year's $0.83 per share and well above our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. Jack is going to cover the details on earnings drivers, but let me make a few observations. 
At the utilities, the hot summer weather was a big help, with revenues up on higher volumes, although [ph] electricity sold and lower cost with less storm activity across the system. The excellent reliability we provided to our customers over a hot summer reinforces the benefits of our capital investment programs. 
ExGen had a great operational quarter, with the nuclear fleet producing more power ever in a quarter. 
Finally, Constellation really hit a sweet spot in the third quarter. 
The sustained hot weather enabled us to sell high volumes of electricity to customers while limited price volatility brought the cost to serve the customers down, allowing us to profit on both volumes and margins. The continued success at Constellation in the third quarter reinforces the value of our gen to load matching strategy. 
So if you look at Slide 6, as we talk about best-in-class operation, at the Analyst Day, we emphasized best-in-class operation across all our businesses, which we see as the ticket of entry at the utilities and economic imperative at the Generation business. And I'm happy to report that the third quarter was operationally strong. 
On our color block chart highlighted operating performance and customer satisfaction for the utilities. Legacy Exelon utilities remain almost entirely first quartile. I'm proud of our customer satisfaction results, but am disappointed with our OSHA results, and we are taking corrective actions and should get these numbers back to first quartile shortly. 
At PHI, we are encouraged by the process we're making, although some of this success has been helped by good weather and limited storm activity. We still have a long way to go to meet the reliability commitments we've made, but we are working hard to provide the service our customers deserve. 
I mentioned already but the nuclear team had a very good quarter, with capacity factor of 96.3% and no unplanned outage days even with the summer's sustained heat. For the year-to-date, the nuclear capacity factor is at 94.8%. 
Constellation also had a great quarter, completing the acquisition of ConEd Solutions and beginning that integration. 
We continue to see a robust renewable rate, with margins in contract durations holding at levels we discussed at the Analyst Day. 
So I want to thank all of our employees for excellent operations over the quarter and professionalism in what was a very hot summer with fantastic results. 
On the regulatory team side, at the utilities are very busy as we work through a full load of rate cases at PHI, in particular. We've completed one rate case at PHI. The New Jersey BPU unanimously approved the ACE rate case settlement in August, yielding a good outcome. It brought needed benefits to the New Jersey customers months earlier than [ph] we would have litigated the case. We appreciate the efforts of all the parties in New Jersey in making this happen. 
We are encouraged by the progress that we are making so far, but we're also aware that improving operations and returns at PHI will take time. These are the first sets [ph] of rate cases. We plan to refile at each PHI utility again in 2017. We -- it will take 2 cycles to, what we believe, align our revenues with the significant capital being deployed to benefit our customers, improve reliability and help the environment overall. 
Talking about our key priorities, for us, [ph] is finding economically sustainable path for our financially challenged nuclear plants. We're currently on very different paths but expect clarity this quarter in New York and also Illinois. 
In New York, we're making progress on finalizing the contracts with NYSERDA and expect to have them signed for all 3 plants in November. This aligns with the expected approval from New York PSC on the acquisition from the FitzPatrick plant. 
We expect the CES from Ginna Nine Mile 1 and 2 to add approximately $0.08 to $0.10 of EPS and expect FitzPatrick to add another $0.02 to $0.08 per share a year, depending on the refueling outage schedules. 
As expected, a group of independent power producers filed a challenge in federal court. The lawsuit does not request a stay or an expedited trial, and we continue to believe that the CES design is sound, and that it will withstand any legal challenge. 
In Illinois, we continue to work with a wide group of parties on comprehensive energy package that would preserve the Clinton and Quad Cities stations operating rights. It will advance the utility investment aimed at energy efficiency and reliability and will support further growth in renewable energy production in Illinois. The time line is short for the resolution, with 2 windows during a 6-day veto session in November and the beginning of December. 
We remain hopeful that we can reach a constructive solution that truly is the best interest for our state and our fellow Illinois citizens. 
But absent of [ph] the action during the upcoming veto session, both facilities will close. We are moving forward with the retirement of the plants. We have already notified PJM of our intent to retire Quad Cities and will inform MISO in the beginning of December if the legislation does not pass. 
A few years ago, we asked you to wait a while we work through the process in Illinois, and we have appreciated your patience. We are now very close to the ultimate resolution in both Illinois and New York. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Jack, and he will walk you through the numbers."
296181,405975553,1061677,"Exelon Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Exelon Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will cover our third quarter and year-to-date results, our updated 2016 guidance range, progress on our current rate cases and our gross margin disclosures. Starting on Slide 9. As Chris sta",1584,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will cover our third quarter and year-to-date results, our updated 2016 guidance range, progress on our current rate cases and our gross margin disclosures. 
Starting on Slide 9. As Chris stated, we had a very strong quarter financially and operationally across the company. For the third quarter, we delivered adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.91 per share, exceeding our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. 
Exelon utilities delivered a great quarter, with a combined $0.53 per share of operating earnings. This was driven by favorable weather at ComEd and PECO where cooling degree days were 39% and 37% above normal, respectively, as well as lower O&M expense versus planned across all our utilities primarily due to lower-than-normal storm activity. 
Generation delivered $0.41 per share of operating earnings in the quarter. We have strong performance at our Constellation business, where our generation-to-load matching strategy continued to provide value and we benefited from a lower cost to serve our customers. 
On Slide 10, the $0.91 per share in the third quarter of this year was $0.08 per share better than the third quarter of 2015. Upside came from favorable weather across our service territories, the inclusion of PHI and higher distribution revenues at both ComEd and PECO due to increased capital investment and increased rates, respectively. This was partially offset by a decrease in earnings at ExGen, driven primarily by increased taxes due to the inability to use the domestic production activities deduction and lower capacity prices. 
On Slide 11, our year-to-date earnings of $2.24 per share or $0.11 per share higher relative to the same period last year, driven by performance at the utilities. The primary drivers are favorable weather, increased distribution revenues across all of our utilities due to higher rates and increased capital investment and the addition of PHI. ExGen is down $0.16 per share from this time last year due to increased decommissioning costs, increased taxes and share count differential.
Turning to Slide 12, we are raising our full year guidance range from $2.40 per share to $2.70 per share to $2.55 per share to $2.75 per share, reflecting, in particular, the strong results that we've seen at ComEd and PECO year-to-date. 
Turning to Slide 13, we've laid out the schedule for the next 6 months of activity in all our current rate case proceedings across Exelon utilities. As you know, we've filed distribution cases in all of PHI's jurisdictions and expect decisions spread throughout the third quarter of next year, providing needed revenue relief as we continue to make significant investments on behalf of our customers. 
Our investments in our utilities are needed to improve the customer experience and create value for customers. As Chris mentioned, in August, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved the settlement authorizing Atlantic City Electric to increase its electric distribution rate by $45 million. The new rates went into effect immediately, which was 7 months earlier than expected. This really recognizes Atlantic City Electric's commitment to enhancing its energy infrastructure. Over the past 5 years, Atlantic City Electric has spent approximately $716 million in energy system upgrades to benefit its customers. 
The settlement is a good start, but there's more work to be done in the other jurisdictions. We still have rate cases outstanding at the other PHI utilities. In these cases, we're asking for $326 million in revenue requirement increases. These increases reflect recovery on multiple years of smart meter and other capital investments meant to improve the reliability of the grid across all the PHI jurisdictions. We're expecting the Pepco Maryland decision in mid-November, followed by Delmarva Maryland in February. 
In addition, ComEd made its annual formula rate filing with the Illinois Commerce Commission in the second quarter of this year, with the decision expected in December. ComEd requested a revenue requirement increase of $132 million related to approximately $2.4 billion in capital investments made in 2015. These investments, which include $663 million for smart grid-related work, have strengthened and modernized the electric system. More details in the rate cases can be found on Slides 28 through 33 in the appendix. 
Slide 14 provides our third quarter gross margin update, including our 2019 disclosures. We're including the 2019 numbers a couple of weeks earlier than our normal course of EEI [ph] as we wanted to package together some interrelated updates for you today. 
Our total gross margin uses September 30 curves and does not include the impacts of the CES program in New York or the purchase of FitzPatrick. But we have included these impacts below the lines to provide a full picture for 2017 through 2019, and we anticipate formally including both of them at our fourth quarter call. 
2016 total gross margin increased $50 million during the third quarter, lifted by strong performance primarily at Constellation. We're highly hedged for the rest of this year and remain well balanced on our generation-to-load matching strategy. 
Total gross margin decreased from the second quarter to the third quarter by $100 million in 2017 and $250 million in 2018. The decline is driven by lower power prices on the unhedged portion of our output. We have seen power prices at NiHub and West Hub for these years move higher since the end of September, with 2017 increasing approximately $0.50 to $0.75 per megawatt hour, respectively. 2018 prices have increased approximately $0.20 to $0.50 per megawatt hour, respectively, and as a result, total gross margin on our unhedged generation has recovered since 9/30 by $50 million. 
At the end of the quarter, our hedge position was approximately 7% to 10% behind ratable in 2017 and 4% to 6% behind ratable in 2018 when considering cross-commodity hedges and reflecting our more positive fundamental view on the power markets. The majority of our link remains concentrated in the Midwest to align with our view of power market upside at NiHub. 
Total gross margins for 2019 is $6.8 billion, which is $450 million less than in 2018. The majority of the decline from 2018 is due to $175 million in lower capacity revenues, which we provided at Analyst Day, $125 million from a full year of retirement for Quad Cities and $200 million from a roll-off of intermoney [ph] hedges versus 2018. 
We see multiple reasons why we'd expect a better realized power price environment than what's captured in these numbers. First, forward [ph] beyond 2017 and especially beyond 2018 reflect a highly illiquid market with limited real price discovery. Liquidity will improve as we get closer to the delivery year, and that will help prices. 
In addition, our worth [ph] on power market shows too many plants continuing to operate even though they're not economically viable. These plants will need to close, and [ph] like we've done with certain of our fossil plants and our planned nuclear retirements. 
Second, our generation-to-load matching strategy and our portfolio management team at Constellation have a proven ability to extract value out of various market conditions. Our Constellation business is set up to profit in periods of extremes. This summer, we captured better margins since our contracts are priced using forward summer market volatility. And when we don't see that volatility, such as this summer, we capture additional value. We saw the same thing during the polar vortex, a period with extremes but in the opposite direction. Our gross margin projections on this page do not anticipate these events repeating and assume normal weather, leaving the -- an opportunity for additional upside. 
And finally, the CES program in New York and the acquisition of FitzPatrick will add $500 million in gross margin in 2019 and annual EPS contributions of $0.10 to $0.18 per year starting -- annually starting next year. 
Turning to Slide 15. Even though we don't believe this market will be a reality, we are acting as if it will. We're reducing expected O&M expenditures by $100 million in 2018 and $125 million in 2019 at ExGen relative to what we showed you at Analyst Day, adding to the $400 million of savings we've already taken out of the business. 
We are finding additional savings as we focus our operations and reduce development efforts at Generation as we close out the growth CapEx program in 2017. 
We run an efficient organization, but we need to look for ways to reduce cost beyond introductions. Our focus on -- our focus at ExGen remains on maximizing our cash generation to meet our commitments of funding utility equity needs and debt reduction. These efforts will help keep us on track. 
Finally, turning to Slide 16, our sources and uses slide. We expect adjusted cash flow from operations of $6.85 billion in 2016. In September, the U.S. Tax Court ruled against us on a like-kind [ph] exchange issue related to our sale of fossil [ph] generation in 1999. The outcome of the merit was not unexpected. We were fully reserved for the underlying claim. Whether we do not agree with the decision and particularly disagree with the decision to issue penalties which we did not think was likely are warranted, we realize very clear that we were entitled to rely upon legal counsel. We believe the court came to an conclusion and we expect to appeal the decision early next year. We plan to issue approximately $1 billion of long-term debt to support the payment to the IRS. 
I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

We are optimizing the fleet, all of this brings us back to the value proposition. We're targeting the best-in-class utility EPS growth of 7% to 9% through 2020, the strong free cash flow at ExGen will provide the incremental equity needs of the utilities as we focus on debt reduction at ExGen. We're focused on optimizing the value of our ExGen business by seeking the fair compensation for the carbon print generation fleet enclosing uneconomic plans. We will be opportunistically [indiscernible] selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans and maximize value through the gen to load matching strategy, which has another big quarter. We continue to focus on sustaining strong investment-grade credit metrics, growing our dividend in a consistent visible manners. And I want to thank you for your interest. And now we're ready to take questions."

And obviously there have been a number of headwinds of the preventive those policies from being fully realized and fully recognized in the impact that carbon has on the climate is measured by the federal government. So we haven't seen programs that treat carbon after the social cost of carbon. We're going to continue to work on those things. But the plans we have in New York are now underway. We think of as preserving those units for the day where we have that best design in place. And we think that day is going to come eventually. But we need a solution to keep the units that are important to our customers in place so that they're available once we do have the carbon signal in the market. And that's how we reconcile it. So we have to take this word is it comes to us and the world currently  isn't our most favorite design of putting price on carbon in the market.

And I would add just from a market perspective, portfolio perspective, a couple of things.

I think it gets into the nature of market participants as you're well aware when you think about the financial institution to start with that in adding liquidity in this marketplace in years past, we don't see nearly the depth of that. But what's interesting is the power market have been illiquid for quite some time. But when you look at open interest just on the gas market, for example, we've seen a change there where it's very front-end loaded versus kind of the outer years. And I think what's important with that is -- I'll give you an example. When you look at the price change in the quarter in PJM, in particular, versus the end of June versus the end of September, you saw that the prices -- the price of gas in each of those years when you include the basis price weren't great, down equally. Yet we dropped power prices more materially on the back-end of the forward curve than we did in nearby 2017, and that gets into some of the illiquidity in the market. As it relates to our portfolio, we take all these factors into account, both the things there, we're doing internally with our other assets, we have what other we going to do with their own assets. We've been very that we've been aggressive with managing our portfolio as it relates to our ratable plan, and we'll continue down that path. The last thing I would add is that we talked a lot about the benefits of our Generation to Load Strategy, and we do what was supposed to be every dollars. It also has a huge benefit from a market perspective because it doesn't force us to go to that and [indiscernible] counter market. We have a strong customer base and a very, very strong [indiscernible] certain business now that matches output of generation to quantity of load very well, and we're going to continue to grow that, and we've done it all organically very well and through acquisition by [indiscernible] and ComEd, and that's going to be big benefit also."

We appreciate your time and interest in Exelon and joining the call today. 
We hosted our Analyst Day in August, and you have a lot of information that we passed on to understand the business and our value proposition. 
With that fresh in your mind, today's call will focus on the third quarter results, some business updates, including actions we are taking with recent power weaknesses. 
We had a great third quarter across our utilities Constellation and our generating fleet. Our GAAP basis -- on a GAAP basis, we earned $0.53 versus $0.69 last year quarter-over-quarter. 
On the operating basis, we earned $0.91 a share, up from last year's $0.83 per share and well above our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. Jack is going to cover the details on earnings drivers, but let me make a few observations. 
At the utilities, the hot summer weather was a big help, with revenues up on higher volumes of electricity sold and lower cost with less storm activity across the system. The excellent reliability we provided to our customers over a hot summer reinforces the benefits of our capital investment programs. 
ExGen had a great operational quarter, with the nuclear fleet producing more power ever in a quarter. 
Finally, Constellation really hit a sweet spot in the third quarter. 
The sustained hot weather enabled us to sell high volumes of electricity to customers while limited price volatility brought the cost to serve the customers down, allowing us to profit on both volumes and margins. The continued success at Constellation in the third quarter reinforces the value of our gen to load matching strategy. 
So if you look at Slide 6, as we talk about best-in-class operation, at the Analyst Day, we emphasized best-in-class operation across all our businesses, which we see as the ticket of entry at the utilities and economic imperative at the Generation business. And I'm happy to report that the third quarter was operationally strong. 
On our color block chart highlighted operating performance and customer satisfaction for the utilities. Legacy Exelon utilities remain almost entirely first quartile. I'm proud of our customer satisfaction results, but am disappointed with our OSHA results, and we are taking corrective actions and should get these numbers back to first quartile shortly. 
At PHI, we are encouraged by the process we're making, although some of this success has been helped by good weather and limited storm activity. We still have a long way to go to meet the reliability commitments we've made, but we are working hard to provide the service our customers deserve. 
I mentioned already but the nuclear team had a very good quarter, with capacity factor of 96.3% and no unplanned outage days even with the summer's sustained heat. For the year-to-date, the nuclear capacity factor is at 94.8%. 
Constellation also had a great quarter, completing the acquisition of ConEd Solutions and beginning that integration. 
We continue to see a robust renewable rate, with margins in contract durations holding at levels we discussed at the Analyst Day. 
So I want to thank all of our employees for excellent operations over the quarter and professionalism in what was a very hot summer with fantastic results. 
On the regulatory team side, at the utilities are very busy as we work through a full load of rate cases at PHI, in particular. We've completed one rate case at PHI. The New Jersey BPU unanimously approved the ACE rate case settlement in August, yielding a good outcome. It brought needed benefits to the New Jersey customers months earlier than we would have litigated the case. We appreciate the efforts of all the parties in New Jersey in making this happen. 
We are encouraged by the progress that we are making so far, but we're also aware that improving operations and returns at PHI will take time. These are the first sets of rate cases. We plan to refile at each PHI utility again in 2017. We -- it will take 2 cycles to, what we believe, align our revenues with the significant capital being deployed to benefit our customers, improve reliability and help the environment overall. 
Talking about our key priorities, for us, is finding economically sustainable path for our financially challenged nuclear plants. We're currently on very different paths but expect clarity this quarter in New York and also Illinois. 
In New York, we're making progress on finalizing the contracts with NYSERDA and expect to have them signed for all 3 plants in November. This aligns with the expected approval from New York PSC on the acquisition from the FitzPatrick plant. 
We expect the CES from Ginna Nine Mile 1 and 2 to add approximately $0.08 to $0.10 of EPS and expect FitzPatrick to add another $0.02 to $0.08 per share a year, depending on the refueling outage schedules. 
As expected, a group of independent power producers filed a challenge in federal court. The lawsuit does not request a stay or an expedited trial, and we continue to believe that the CES design is sound, and that it will withstand any legal challenge. 
In Illinois, we continue to work with a wide group of parties on comprehensive energy package that would preserve the Clinton and Quad Cities stations operating rights. It will advance the utility investment aimed at energy efficiency and reliability and will support further growth in renewable energy production in Illinois. The time line is short for the resolution, with 2 windows during a 6-day veto session in November and the beginning of December. 
We remain hopeful that we can reach a constructive solution that truly is the best interest for our state and our fellow Illinois citizens. 
But absent of the action during the upcoming veto session, both facilities will close. We are moving forward with the retirement of the plants. We have already notified PJM of our intent to retire Quad Cities and will inform MISO in the beginning of December if the legislation does not pass. 
A few years ago, we asked you to wait a while we work through the process in Illinois, and we have appreciated your patience. We are now very close to the ultimate resolution in both Illinois and New York. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Jack, and he will walk you through the numbers."

My remarks today will cover our third quarter and year-to-date results, our updated 2016 guidance range, progress on our current rate cases and our gross margin disclosures. Starting on Slide 9. As Chris sta",1583,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will cover our third quarter and year-to-date results, our updated 2016 guidance range, progress on our current rate cases and our gross margin disclosures. 
Starting on Slide 9. As Chris stated, we had a very strong quarter financially and operationally across the company. For the third quarter, we delivered adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.91 per share, exceeding our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. 
Exelon utilities delivered a great quarter, with a combined $0.53 per share of operating earnings. This was driven by favorable weather at ComEd and PECO where cooling degree days were 39% and 37% above normal, respectively, as well as lower O&M expense versus planned across all our utilities primarily due to lower-than-normal storm activity. 
Generation delivered $0.41 per share of operating earnings in the quarter. We have strong performance at our Constellation business, where our generation-to-load matching strategy continued to provide value and we benefited from a lower cost to serve our customers. 
On Slide 10, the $0.91 per share in the third quarter of this year was $0.08 per share better than the third quarter of 2015. Upside came from favorable weather across our service territories, the inclusion of PHI and higher distribution revenues at both ComEd and PECO due to increased capital investment and increased rates, respectively. This was partially offset by a decrease in earnings at ExGen, driven primarily by increased taxes due to the inability to use the domestic production activities deduction and lower capacity prices. 
On Slide 11, our year-to-date earnings of $2.24 per share or $0.11 per share higher relative to the same period last year, driven by performance at the utilities. The primary drivers are favorable weather, increased distribution revenues across all of our utilities due to higher rates and increased capital investment and the addition of PHI. ExGen is down $0.16 per share from this time last year due to increased decommissioning costs, increased taxes and share count differential.
Turning to Slide 12, we are raising our full year guidance range from $2.40 per share to $2.70 per share to $2.55 per share to $2.75 per share, reflecting, in particular, the strong results that we've seen at ComEd and PECO year-to-date. 
Turning to Slide 13, we've laid out the schedule for the next 6 months of activity in all our current rate case proceedings across Exelon utilities. As you know, we've filed distribution cases in all of PHI's jurisdictions and expect decisions spread throughout the third quarter of next year, providing needed revenue relief as we continue to make significant investments on behalf of our customers. 
Our investments in our utilities are needed to improve the customer experience and create value for customers. As Chris mentioned, in August, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved the settlement authorizing Atlantic City Electric to increase its electric distribution rate by $45 million. The new rates went into effect immediately, which was 7 months earlier than expected. This really recognizes Atlantic City Electric's commitment to enhancing its energy infrastructure. Over the past 5 years, Atlantic City Electric has spent approximately $716 million in energy system upgrades to benefit its customers. 
The settlement is a good start, but there's more work to be done in the other jurisdictions. We still have rate cases outstanding at the other PHI utilities. In these cases, we're asking for $326 million in revenue requirement increases. These increases reflect recovery on multiple years of smart meter and other capital investments meant to improve the reliability of the grid across all the PHI jurisdictions. We're expecting the Pepco Maryland decision in mid-November, followed by Delmarva Maryland in February. 
In addition, ComEd made its annual formula rate filing with the Illinois Commerce Commission in the second quarter of this year, with the decision expected in December. ComEd requested a revenue requirement increase of $132 million related to approximately $2.4 billion in capital investments made in 2015. These investments, which include $663 million for smart grid-related work, have strengthened and modernized the electric system. More details in the rate cases can be found on Slides 28 through 33 in the appendix. 
Slide 14 provides our third quarter gross margin update, including our 2019 disclosures. We're including the 2019 numbers a couple of weeks earlier than our normal course of EEI as we wanted to package together some interrelated updates for you today. 
Our total gross margin uses September 30 curves and does not include the impacts of the CES program in New York or the purchase of FitzPatrick. But we have included these impacts below the lines to provide a full picture for 2017 through 2019, and we anticipate formally including both of them at our fourth quarter call. 
2016 total gross margin increased $50 million during the third quarter, lifted by strong performance primarily at Constellation. We're highly hedged for the rest of this year and remain well balanced on our generation-to-load matching strategy. 
Total gross margin decreased from the second quarter to the third quarter by $100 million in 2017 and $250 million in 2018. The decline is driven by lower power prices on the unhedged portion of our output. We have seen power prices at NiHub and West Hub for these years move higher since the end of September, with 2017 increasing approximately $0.50 to $0.75 per megawatt hour, respectively. 2018 prices have increased approximately $0.20 to $0.50 per megawatt hour, respectively, and as a result, total gross margin on our unhedged generation has recovered since 9/30 by $50 million. 
At the end of the quarter, our hedge position was approximately 7% to 10% behind ratable in 2017 and 4% to 6% behind ratable in 2018 when considering cross-commodity hedges and reflecting our more positive fundamental view on the power markets. The majority of our link remains concentrated in the Midwest to align with our view of power market upside at NiHub. 
Total gross margins for 2019 is $6.8 billion, which is $450 million less than in 2018. The majority of the decline from 2018 is due to $175 million in lower capacity revenues, which we provided at Analyst Day, $125 million from a full year of retirement for Quad Cities and $200 million from a roll-off of in-the-money hedges versus 2018. 
We see multiple reasons why we'd expect a better realized power price environment than what's captured in these numbers. First, forwards beyond 2017 and especially beyond 2018 reflect a highly illiquid market with limited real price discovery. Liquidity will improve as we get closer to the delivery year, and that will help prices. 
In addition, our worth on power market shows too many plants continuing to operate even though they're not economically viable. These plants will need to close, and like we've done with certain of our fossil plants and our planned nuclear retirements. 
Second, our generation-to-load matching strategy and our portfolio management team at Constellation have a proven ability to extract value out of various market conditions. Our Constellation business is set up to profit in periods of extremes. This summer, we captured better margins since our contracts are priced using forward summer market volatility. And when we don't see that volatility, such as this summer, we capture additional value. We saw the same thing during the polar vortex, a period with extremes but in the opposite direction. Our gross margin projections on this page do not anticipate these events repeating and assume normal weather, leaving the -- an opportunity for additional upside. 
And finally, the CES program in New York and the acquisition of FitzPatrick will add $500 million in gross margin in 2019 and annual EPS contributions of $0.10 to $0.18 per year starting -- annually starting next year. 
Turning to Slide 15. Even though we don't believe this market will be a reality, we are acting as if it will. We're reducing expected O&M expenditures by $100 million in 2018 and $125 million in 2019 at ExGen relative to what we showed you at Analyst Day, adding to the $400 million of savings we've already taken out of the business. 
We are finding additional savings as we focus our operations and reduce development efforts at Generation as we close out the growth CapEx program in 2017. 
We run an efficient organization, but we need to look for ways to reduce cost beyond introductions. Our focus on -- our focus at ExGen remains on maximizing our cash generation to meet our commitments of funding utility equity needs and debt reduction. These efforts will help keep us on track. 
Finally, turning to Slide 16, our sources and uses slide. We expect adjusted cash flow from operations of $6.85 billion in 2016. In September, the U.S. Tax Court ruled against us on a like-kind [ph] exchange issue related to our sale of fossil generation in 1999. The outcome of the merits was not unexpected. We were fully reserved for the underlying claim. However, we do not agree with the decision and particularly disagree with the decision to issue penalties which we did not think was likely or warranted. The law is very clear that we were entitled to rely upon the opinion of legal counsel. We believe the court came to an erroneous conclusion, and we expect to appeal the decision early next year. We plan to issue approximately $1 billion of long-term debt to support the payment to the IRS. 
I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

And we've had a lot to be proud about at the company, but we're not happy with the outlook that we see at ExGen. 
As Jack talked, we're taking actions. The limited liquidity in the forwards beyond 2017 and the true lack of lockage discipline by -- on economic generators are distorting the market. 
That said, we're not just going to sit around and wait on the power markets to recover. As we said, we're taking further actions to control our future at ExGen, aggressively managing our cost across -- or even against these forwards, cutting $100 million in cost from 2018 and $125 million from 2019 on top of the $400 million we've already cut across the business. And we're pursuing the compensation for the 0-carbon attributes of our plants, as we've done in New York. We are optimizing the fleet. 
All of this brings us back to the value proposition. We're targeting the best-in-class utility EPS growth of 7% to 9% through 2020. The strong free cash flow at ExGen will provide the incremental equity needs at the utilities as we focus on debt reduction at the ExGen. We're focused on optimizing the value of our ExGen business by seeking the fair compensation for the carbon pre-generation fleet and closing uneconomic plants. We will be opportunistically [indiscernible] selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans and maximize value through the gen-to-load matching strategy, which had another big quarter.

Look. We've -- the market is what it is. Today, we have over 30 states with renewable portfolio standards that recognize the environmental contributions of virtually every resource in the market that does what our nuclear plants do. So we're seeking to get fair treatment. At the same time, from a policy perspective, we've been clear for many years now that we think the right move is to put a cost occlusion in the market. That is, in the case of climate, establish a price on requirement. And we're going to continue to pursue those things. But obviously, there have been a number of headwinds that have prevented those policies from being fully realized and fully recognizing the impact that carbon has on climate, as measured by the federal government. So we haven't seen programs that trade [ph] carbon up to the social cost of carbon. We're going to continue to work on those things. But the plans we have in New York and Illinois, we think of as preserving those units for the day where we have that best design in place. And we think that day is going to come eventually, but we need a bridge solution to keep the units that are important to our customers in place so that they're available once we do have a carbon signal in the market. And that's how we reconcile it. But we have to take this world as it comes to us, and the world currently isn't our most favorite design of putting a price on carbon in the market. We have these separate stay programs, and it's important for our customers that these nuclear plants be preserved, and that's what's driving our initiatives. Joe?"

And I would add, just from a market perspective, portfolio perspective, a couple of things. One is, on the market side, I think the illiquidity of the market is somewhat independent of what Joe is saying. I think it gets into the nature of market participants. As you're well aware, when you think about the financial institutions to start with that added liquidity in this marketplace in years past, we don't see nearly the depth of that. But what's interesting is the power markets have been illiquid for quite some time. But when you look at open interest just on the gas market, for example, we've seen a change there where it's very front-end loaded versus kind of the outer years. And I think what's important with that is -- and let me give you an example. When you look at the price change in the quarter in PJM, in particular, versus -- the end of June versus the end of September, you saw that the prices -- the price of gas in each of those years, when you include the basis prices weren't great, fell equally. Yet we dropped power prices more materially on the back end of the forward curve than we did in the nearby 2017, and that gets into some of the illiquidity in the market. As it relates to our portfolio, we take all these factors into account, both the things that we're doing internally with our other assets, we have an estimate of what other folks are going to do with their own assets. We've been very clear that we've been aggressively managing our portfolio as it relates to our ratable plan, and we'll continue down that path. The last thing I would add is that we talk a lot about the benefits of our Generation to Load Strategy, and we do it with both [ph] in the dollars. It also has a huge benefit from a market perspective because it doesn't force us to go to that illiquid over-the-counter market. We have a strong customer base and a very, very strong load serving business now that matches output of generation to quantity of load very well. And we're going to continue to grow that, and we've done it both organically very well and through acquisition with like Integrys and ComEd, and that's been a big benefit also."

We appreciate your time and interest in Exelon and joining the call today. 
We hosted our Analyst Day in August, and you have a lot of information that we passed on to understand the business and our value proposition.  With that fresh in your mind, today's call will focus on the third quarter results, some business updates, including actions we are taking with recent power weaknesses. 
We had a great third quarter across our utilities Constellation and our generating fleet. Our GAAP basis -- on a GAAP basis, we earned $0.53 versus $0.69 last year quarter-over-quarter. 
On the operating basis, we earned $0.91 a share, up from last year's $0.83 per share and well above our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. Jack is going to cover the details on earnings drivers, but let me make a few observations. 
At the utilities, the hot summer weather was a big help, with revenues up on higher volumes of electricity sold and lower cost with less storm activity across the system. The excellent reliability we provided to our customers over a hot summer reinforces the benefits of our capital investment programs.  ExGen had a great operational quarter, with the nuclear fleet producing more power ever in a quarter. Finally, Constellation really hit a sweet spot in the third quarter. 
The sustained hot weather enabled us to sell high volumes of electricity to customers while limited price volatility brought the cost to serve the customers down, allowing us to profit on both volumes and margins. The continued success at Constellation in the third quarter reinforces the value of our gen to load matching strategy. 
So if you look at Slide 6, as we talk about best-in-class operation, at the Analyst Day, we emphasized best-in-class operation across all our businesses, which we see as the ticket of entry at the utilities and economic imperative at the Generation business. And I'm happy to report that the third quarter was operationally strong. 
On our color block charts highlighted operating performance and customer satisfaction for the utilities, legacy Exelon utilities remain almost entirely first quartile. I'm proud of our customer satisfaction results, but am disappointed with our OSHA results, and we are taking corrective actions and should get these numbers back to first quartile shortly. 
At PHI, we are encouraged by the process we're making. Although some of this success has been helped by good weather and limited storm activity, we still have a long way to go to meet the reliability commitments we've made, but we are working hard to provide the service our customers deserve. 
I mentioned already but the nuclear team had a very good quarter, with a capacity factor of 96.3% and no unplanned outage days even with the summer's sustained heat. For the year-to-date, the nuclear capacity factor is at 94.8%. 
Constellation also had a great quarter, completing the acquisition of ConEd Solutions and beginning that integration. 
We continue to see a robust renewable rate, with margins in contract durations holding at levels we discussed at the Analyst Day. So I want to thank all of our employees for excellent operations over the quarter and professionalism in what was a very hot summer with fantastic results. 
On the regulatory team side, at the utilities are very busy as we work through a full load of rate cases at PHI, in particular. We've completed one rate case at PHI. The New Jersey BPU unanimously approved the ACE rate case settlement in August, yielding a good outcome. It brought needed benefits to the New Jersey customers months earlier than we would have litigated the case. We appreciate the efforts of all the parties in New Jersey in making this happen. 
We are encouraged by the progress that we are making so far, but we're also aware that improving operations and returns at PHI will take time. These are the first sets of rate cases. We plan to refile at each PHI utility again in 2017. We -- it will take 2 cycles to, what we believe, align our revenues with the significant capital being deployed to benefit our customers, improve reliability and help the environment overall. 
Talking about our key priorities, for us, is finding economically sustainable paths for our financially challenged nuclear plants. We're currently on very different paths but expect clarity this quarter in New York and also Illinois. 
In New York, we're making progress on finalizing the contracts with NYSERDA and expect to have them signed for all 3 plants in November. This aligns with the expected approval from New York PSC on the acquisition from the FitzPatrick plant. 
We expect the CES from GINNA Nine Mile I and II to add approximately $0.08 to $0.10 of EPS and expect FitzPatrick to add another $0.02 to $0.08 per share a year, depending on the refuel outage schedules. 
As expected, a group of independent power producers filed a challenge in federal court. The lawsuit does not request a stay or an expedited trial, and we continue to believe that the CES design is sound, and that it will withstand any legal challenge. 
In Illinois, we continue to work with a wide group of parties on a comprehensive energy package that would preserve the Clinton and Quad Cities stations operating rights. It will advance the utility investment aimed at energy efficiency and reliability and will support further growth in renewable energy production in Illinois. The time line is short for the resolution, with 2 windows during a 6-day veto session in November and the beginning of December. 
We remain hopeful that we can reach a constructive solution that truly is of best interest for our state and our fellow Illinois citizens. 
But absent of the action during the upcoming veto session, both facilities will close. We are moving forward with the retirement of the plants. We have already notified PJM of our intent to retire Quad Cities and will inform MISO in the beginning of December if the legislation does not pass. 
A few years ago, we asked you to wait a while we worked through the process in Illinois, and we have appreciated your patience. We are now very close to the ultimate resolution in both Illinois and New York. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Jack, and he will walk you through the numbers."

My remarks today will cover our third quarter and year-to-date results, our updated 2016 guidance range, progress on our current rate cases and our gross margin disclosures. Starting on Slide 9. As Chris sta",1588,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will cover our third quarter and year-to-date results, our updated 2016 guidance range, progress on our current rate cases and our gross margin disclosures. 
Starting on Slide 9. As Chris stated, we had a very strong quarter financially and operationally across the company. For the third quarter, we delivered adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.91 per share, exceeding our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. 
Exelon utilities delivered a great quarter, with a combined $0.53 per share of operating earnings. This was driven by favorable weather at ComEd and PECO where cooling degree days were 39% and 37% above normal, respectively, as well as lower O&M expense versus planned across all our utilities primarily due to lower-than-normal storm activity. 
Generation delivered $0.41 per share of operating earnings in the quarter. We have strong performance at our Constellation business, where our Generation to Load matching strategy continued to provide value and we benefited from a lower cost to serve our customers. 
On Slide 10, the $0.91 per share in the third quarter of this year was $0.08 per share better than the third quarter of 2015. Upside came from favorable weather across our service territories, the inclusion of PHI and higher distribution revenues at both ComEd and PECO due to increased capital investment and increased rates, respectively. This was partially offset by a decrease in earnings at ExGen, driven primarily by increased taxes due to the inability to use the domestic production activities deduction and lower capacity prices. 
On Slide 11, our year-to-date earnings of $2.24 per share are $0.11 per share higher relative to the same period last year, driven by performance at the utilities. The primary drivers are favorable weather, increased distribution revenues across all of our utilities due to higher rates and increased capital investment and the addition of PHI. ExGen is down $0.16 per share from this time last year due to increased decommissioning costs, increased taxes and share count differential.
Turning to Slide 12, we are raising our full year guidance range from $2.40 per share to $2.70 per share to $2.55 per share to $2.75 per share, reflecting, in particular, the strong results that we've seen at ComEd and PECO year-to-date. 
Turning to Slide 13, we've laid out the schedule for the next 6 months of activity in all our current rate case proceedings across Exelon utilities. As you know, we filed distribution cases in all of PHI's jurisdictions and expect decisions spread throughout the third quarter of next year, providing needed revenue relief as we continue to make significant investments on behalf of our customers. 
Our investments in our utilities are needed to improve the customer experience and create value for customers. As Chris mentioned, in August, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved the settlement authorizing Atlantic City Electric to increase its electric distribution rate by $45 million. The new rates went into effect immediately, which was 7 months earlier than expected. This really recognizes Atlantic City Electric's commitment to enhancing its energy infrastructure. Over the past 5 years, Atlantic City Electric has spent approximately $716 million in energy system upgrades to benefit its customers. 
The settlement is a good start, but there's more work to be done in the other jurisdictions. We still have rate cases outstanding at the other PHI utilities. In these cases, we're asking for $326 million in revenue requirement increases. These increases reflect recovery on multiple years of smart meter and other capital investments meant to improve the reliability of the grid across all the PHI jurisdictions. We're expecting the Pepco Maryland decision in mid-November, followed by Delmarva Maryland in February. 
In addition, ComEd made its annual formula rate filing with the Illinois Commerce Commission in the second quarter of this year, with the decision expected in December. ComEd requested a revenue requirement increase of $132 million related to approximately $2.4 billion in capital investments made in 2015. These investments, which include $663 million for smart grid-related work, have strengthened and modernized the electric system. More details in the rate cases can be found on Slides 28 through 33 in the appendix. 
Slide 14 provides our third quarter gross margin update, including our 2019 disclosures. We're including the 2019 numbers a couple of weeks earlier than our normal course of EDI as we wanted to package together some interrelated updates for you today. 
Our total gross margin uses September 30 curves and does not include the impacts of the CES program in New York or the purchase of FitzPatrick. But we have included these impacts below the lines to provide a full picture for 2017 through 2019, and we anticipate formally including both of them at our fourth quarter call. 
2016 total gross margin increased $50 million during the third quarter, lifted by strong performance primarily at Constellation. We're highly hedged for the rest of this year and remain well balanced on our Generation to Load matching strategy. 
Total gross margin decreased from the second quarter to the third quarter by $100 million in 2017 and $250 million in 2018. The decline is driven by lower power prices on the unhedged portion of our output. We have seen power prices at NiHub and West Hub for these years move higher since the end of September, with 2017 increasing approximately $0.50 to $0.75 per megawatt hour, respectively. 2018 prices have increased approximately $0.20 to $0.50 per megawatt hour, respectively, and as a result, total gross margin on our unhedged generation has recovered since 9/30 by $50 million. 
At the end of the quarter, our hedge position was approximately 7% to 10% behind ratable in 2017 and 4% to 6% behind ratable in 2018 when considering cross-commodity hedges and reflecting our more positive fundamental view on the power markets. The majority of our link remains concentrated in the Midwest to align with our view of power market upside at NiHub. 
Total gross margins for 2019 is $6.8 billion, which is $450 million less than in 2018. The majority of the decline from 2018 is due to $175 million in lower capacity revenues, which we provided at Analyst Day, $125 million from a full year of retirement for Quad Cities and $200 million from a roll-off of in-the-money hedges versus 2018. 
We see multiple reasons why we'd expect a better realized power price environment than what's captured in these numbers. First, forwards beyond 2017 and especially beyond 2018 reflect a highly illiquid market with limited real price discovery. Liquidity will improve as we get closer to the delivery year, and that will help prices. 
In addition, our work on power market shows too many plants continuing to operate even though they're not economically viable. These plants will need to close, and like we've done with certain of our fossil plants and our planned nuclear retirements. 
Second, our Generation to Load matching strategy and our portfolio management team at Constellation have a proven ability to extract value out of various market conditions. Our Constellation business is set up to profit in periods of extremes. This summer, we captured better margins since our contracts are priced using forward summer market volatility. And when we don't see that volatility, such as this summer, we capture additional value. We saw the same thing during the polar vortex, a period with extremes but in the opposite direction. Our gross margin projections on this page do not anticipate these events repeating and assume normal weather, leaving the -- an opportunity for additional upside. 
And finally, the CES program in New York and the acquisition of FitzPatrick will add $500 million in gross margin in 2019 and annual EPS contributions of $0.10 to $0.18 per year starting -- annually starting next year. 
Turning to Slide 15. Even though we don't believe this market will be a reality, we are acting as if it will. We're reducing expected O&M expenditures by $100 million in 2018 and $125 million in 2019 at ExGen relative to what we showed you at Analyst Day, adding to the $400 million of savings we've already taken out of the business. 
We are finding additional savings as we focus our operations and reduce development efforts at Generation as we close out the growth CapEx program in 2017. 
We run an efficient organization, but we need to look for ways to reduce cost beyond these reductions. Our focus on -- our focus at ExGen remains on maximizing our cash generation to meet our commitments of funding utility equity needs and debt reduction. These efforts will help keep us on track. 
Finally, turning to Slide 16, our sources and uses slide. We expect adjusted cash flow from operations of $6.85 billion in 2016. In September, the U.S. Tax Court ruled against us on a like-kind exchange issue related to our sale of fossil generation in 1999. The outcome on numerics was not unexpected. We were fully reserved for the underlying claim. However, we do not agree with the decision and particularly disagree with the decision to issue penalties, which we did not think was likely or warranted. The law is very clear that we were entitled to rely upon the opinion of legal counsel. We believe the court came to an erroneous conclusion, and we expect to appeal the decision early next year. We plan to issue approximately $1 billion of long-term debt to support the payment to the IRS. 
I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

And we've had a lot to be proud about at the company, but we're not happy with the outlook that we see at ExGen. 
As Jack talked, we're taking actions. The limited liquidity in the forwards beyond 2017 and the true lack of discipline by uneconomic generators are distorting the market. 
That said, we're not just going to sit around and wait on the power markets to recover. As we said, we're taking further actions to control our future at ExGen, aggressively managing our cost across -- or even against these forwards, cutting $100 million in cost from 2018 and $125 million from 2019 on top of the $400 million we've already cut across the business. And we're pursuing the compensation for the 0-carbon attributes of our plants, as we've done in New York. 
We are optimizing the fleet. All of this brings us back to the value proposition. We're targeting the best-in-class utility EPS growth of 7% to 9% through 2020. The strong free cash flow at ExGen will provide the incremental equity needs at the utilities as we focus on debt reduction at the ExGen. We're focused on optimizing the value of our ExGen business by seeking the fair compensation for the carbon pre-generation fleet and closing uneconomic plants. We will be opportunistically -- that's a good word, to selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans and maximize value through the gen-to-load matching strategy, which had another big quarter. We'll continue to focus on sustaining strong investment-grade credit metrics, growing our dividend in a consistent visible manner.

Look. We've -- the market is what it is. Today, we have over 30 states with renewable portfolio standards that recognize the environmental contributions of virtually every resource in the market that does what our nuclear plants do. So we're seeking to get fair treatment. At the same time, from a policy perspective, we've been clear for many years now that we think the right move is to put a cost occlusion in the market. That is, in the case of climate, establish a price on requirement. And we're going to continue to pursue those things. But obviously, there have been a number of headwinds that have prevented those policies from being fully realized and fully recognizing the impact that carbon has on climate, as measured by the federal government. So we haven't seen programs that trade [ph] carbon up to the social cost of carbon. We're going to continue to work on those things. But the plans we have in New York and Illinois, we think of as preserving those units for the day where we have that best design in place. And we think that day is going to come eventually, but we need a bridge solution to keep the units that are important to our customers in place so that they're available once we do have a carbon signal in the market. And that's how we reconcile it. But we have to take this world as it comes to us, and the world currently isn't our most favorite design of putting a price on carbon in the market. We have these separate state programs, and it's important for our customers that these nuclear plants be preserved, and that's what's driving our initiatives. Joe?"

And I would add, just from a market perspective, portfolio perspective, a couple of things. One is, on the market side, I think the illiquidity of the market is somewhat independent of what Joe is saying. I think it gets into the nature of market participants. As you're well aware, when you think about the financial institutions to start with that added liquidity in this marketplace in years past, we don't see nearly the depth of that. But what's interesting is the power markets have been illiquid for quite some time. But when you look at open interest just on the gas market, for example, we've seen a change there where it's very front-end loaded versus kind of the outer years. And I think what's important with that is -- and let me give you an example. When you look at the price change in the quarter in PJM, in particular, versus -- the end of June versus the end of September, you saw that the prices -- the price of gas in each of those years, when you include the basis prices weren't great, fell equally. Yet we dropped power prices more materially on the back end of the forward curve than we did in the nearby 2017, and that gets into some of the illiquidity in the market. As it relates to our portfolio, we take all these factors into account, both the things that we're doing internally with our other assets, we have an estimate of what other folks are going to do with their own assets. We've been very clear that we've been aggressively managing our portfolio as it relates to our ratable plan, and we'll continue down that path. The last thing I would add is that we talk a lot about the benefits of our Generation to Load Strategy, and we do it with both [ph] in the dollars. It also has a huge benefit from a market perspective because it doesn't force us to go to that illiquid over-the-counter market. We have a strong customer base and a very, very strong load serving business now that matches output of generation to quantity of load very well. And we're going to continue to grow that, and we've done it both organically very well and through acquisition with like Integrys and ComEd, and that's been a big benefit also."

We appreciate your time and interest in Exelon and joining the call today. 
We hosted our Analyst Day in August, and you have a lot of information that we passed on to understand the business and our value proposition.  With that fresh in your mind, today's call will focus on the third quarter results, some business updates, including actions we are taking with recent power weaknesses. 
We had a great third quarter across our utilities Constellation and our generating fleet. Our GAAP basis -- on a GAAP basis, we earned $0.53 versus $0.69 last year quarter-over-quarter. 
On the operating basis, we earned $0.91 a share, up from last year's $0.83 per share and well above our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. Jack is going to cover the details on earnings drivers, but let me make a few observations. 
At the utilities, the hot summer weather was a big help, with revenues up on higher volumes of electricity sold and lower cost with less storm activity across the system. The excellent reliability we provided to our customers over a hot summer reinforces the benefits of our capital investment programs.  ExGen had a great operational quarter, with the nuclear fleet producing more power ever in a quarter. Finally, Constellation really hit a sweet spot in the third quarter. 
The sustained hot weather enabled us to sell high volumes of electricity to customers while limited price volatility brought the cost to serve the customers down, allowing us to profit on both volumes and margins. The continued success at Constellation in the third quarter reinforces the value of our gen to load matching strategy. 
So if you look at Slide 6, as we talk about best-in-class operation, at the Analyst Day, we emphasized best-in-class operation across all our businesses, which we see as the ticket of entry at the utilities and economic imperative at the Generation business. And I'm happy to report that the third quarter was operationally strong. 
On our color block charts highlighted operating performance and customer satisfaction for the utilities, legacy Exelon utilities remain almost entirely first quartile. I'm proud of our customer satisfaction results, but am disappointed with our OSHA results, and we are taking corrective actions and should get these numbers back to first quartile shortly. 
At PHI, we are encouraged by the process we're making. Although some of this success has been helped by good weather and limited storm activity, we still have a long way to go to meet the reliability commitments we've made, but we are working hard to provide the service our customers deserve. 
I mentioned already but the nuclear team had a very good quarter, with a capacity factor of 96.3% and no unplanned outage days even with the summer's sustained heat. For the year-to-date, the nuclear capacity factor is at 94.8%. 
Constellation also had a great quarter, completing the acquisition of ConEd Solutions and beginning that integration. 
We continue to see a robust renewable rate, with margins in contract durations holding at levels we discussed at the Analyst Day. So I want to thank all of our employees for excellent operations over the quarter and professionalism in what was a very hot summer with fantastic results. 
On the regulatory team side, at the utilities are very busy as we work through a full load of rate cases at PHI, in particular. We've completed one rate case at PHI. The New Jersey BPU unanimously approved the ACE rate case settlement in August, yielding a good outcome. It brought needed benefits to the New Jersey customers months earlier than we would have litigated the case. We appreciate the efforts of all the parties in New Jersey in making this happen. 
We are encouraged by the progress that we are making so far, but we're also aware that improving operations and returns at PHI will take time. These are the first sets of rate cases. We plan to refile at each PHI utility again in 2017. We -- it will take 2 cycles to, what we believe, align our revenues with the significant capital being deployed to benefit our customers, improve reliability and help the environment overall. 
Talking about our key priorities, for us, is finding economically sustainable paths for our financially challenged nuclear plants. We're currently on very different paths but expect clarity this quarter in New York and also Illinois. 
In New York, we're making progress on finalizing the contracts with NYSERDA and expect to have them signed for all 3 plants in November. This aligns with the expected approval from New York PSC on the acquisition from the FitzPatrick plant. 
We expect the CES from GINNA Nine Mile I and II to add approximately $0.08 to $0.10 of EPS and expect FitzPatrick to add another $0.02 to $0.08 per share a year, depending on the refuel outage schedules. 
As expected, a group of independent power producers filed a challenge in federal court. The lawsuit does not request a stay or an expedited trial, and we continue to believe that the CES design is sound, and that it will withstand any legal challenge. 
In Illinois, we continue to work with a wide group of parties on a comprehensive energy package that would preserve the Clinton and Quad Cities stations operating rights. It will advance the utility investment aimed at energy efficiency and reliability and will support further growth in renewable energy production in Illinois. The time line is short for the resolution, with 2 windows during a 6-day veto session in November and the beginning of December. 
We remain hopeful that we can reach a constructive solution that truly is of best interest for our state and our fellow Illinois citizens. 
But absent of the action during the upcoming veto session, both facilities will close. We are moving forward with the retirement of the plants. We have already notified PJM of our intent to retire Quad Cities and will inform MISO in the beginning of December if the legislation does not pass. 
A few years ago, we asked you to wait a while we worked through the process in Illinois, and we have appreciated your patience. We are now very close to the ultimate resolution in both Illinois and New York. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Jack, and he will walk you through the numbers."

My remarks today will cover our third quarter and year-to-date results, our updated 2016 guidance range, progress on our current rate cases and our gross margin disclosures. Starting on Slide 9. As Chris sta",1588,"Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. My remarks today will cover our third quarter and year-to-date results, our updated 2016 guidance range, progress on our current rate cases and our gross margin disclosures. 
Starting on Slide 9. As Chris stated, we had a very strong quarter financially and operationally across the company. For the third quarter, we delivered adjusted non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.91 per share, exceeding our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. 
Exelon utilities delivered a great quarter, with a combined $0.53 per share of operating earnings. This was driven by favorable weather at ComEd and PECO where cooling degree days were 39% and 37% above normal, respectively, as well as lower O&M expense versus planned across all our utilities primarily due to lower-than-normal storm activity. 
Generation delivered $0.41 per share of operating earnings in the quarter. We have strong performance at our Constellation business, where our Generation to Load matching strategy continued to provide value and we benefited from a lower cost to serve our customers. 
On Slide 10, the $0.91 per share in the third quarter of this year was $0.08 per share better than the third quarter of 2015. Upside came from favorable weather across our service territories, the inclusion of PHI and higher distribution revenues at both ComEd and PECO due to increased capital investment and increased rates, respectively. This was partially offset by a decrease in earnings at ExGen, driven primarily by increased taxes due to the inability to use the domestic production activities deduction and lower capacity prices. 
On Slide 11, our year-to-date earnings of $2.24 per share are $0.11 per share higher relative to the same period last year, driven by performance at the utilities. The primary drivers are favorable weather, increased distribution revenues across all of our utilities due to higher rates and increased capital investment and the addition of PHI. ExGen is down $0.16 per share from this time last year due to increased decommissioning costs, increased taxes and share count differential.
Turning to Slide 12, we are raising our full year guidance range from $2.40 per share to $2.70 per share to $2.55 per share to $2.75 per share, reflecting, in particular, the strong results that we've seen at ComEd and PECO year-to-date. 
Turning to Slide 13, we've laid out the schedule for the next 6 months of activity in all our current rate case proceedings across Exelon utilities. As you know, we filed distribution cases in all of PHI's jurisdictions and expect decisions spread throughout the third quarter of next year, providing needed revenue relief as we continue to make significant investments on behalf of our customers. 
Our investments in our utilities are needed to improve the customer experience and create value for customers. As Chris mentioned, in August, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved the settlement authorizing Atlantic City Electric to increase its electric distribution rate by $45 million. The new rates went into effect immediately, which was 7 months earlier than expected. This really recognizes Atlantic City Electric's commitment to enhancing its energy infrastructure. Over the past 5 years, Atlantic City Electric has spent approximately $716 million in energy system upgrades to benefit its customers. 
The settlement is a good start, but there's more work to be done in the other jurisdictions. We still have rate cases outstanding at the other PHI utilities. In these cases, we're asking for $326 million in revenue requirement increases. These increases reflect recovery on multiple years of smart meter and other capital investments meant to improve the reliability of the grid across all the PHI jurisdictions. We're expecting the Pepco Maryland decision in mid-November, followed by Delmarva Maryland in February. 
In addition, ComEd made its annual formula rate filing with the Illinois Commerce Commission in the second quarter of this year, with the decision expected in December. ComEd requested a revenue requirement increase of $132 million related to approximately $2.4 billion in capital investments made in 2015. These investments, which include $663 million for smart grid-related work, have strengthened and modernized the electric system. More details in the rate cases can be found on Slides 28 through 33 in the appendix. 
Slide 14 provides our third quarter gross margin update, including our 2019 disclosures. We're including the 2019 numbers a couple of weeks earlier than our normal course of EDI as we wanted to package together some interrelated updates for you today. 
Our total gross margin uses September 30 curves and does not include the impacts of the CES program in New York or the purchase of FitzPatrick. But we have included these impacts below the lines to provide a full picture for 2017 through 2019, and we anticipate formally including both of them at our fourth quarter call. 
2016 total gross margin increased $50 million during the third quarter, lifted by strong performance primarily at Constellation. We're highly hedged for the rest of this year and remain well balanced on our Generation to Load matching strategy. 
Total gross margin decreased from the second quarter to the third quarter by $100 million in 2017 and $250 million in 2018. The decline is driven by lower power prices on the unhedged portion of our output. We have seen power prices at NiHub and West Hub for these years move higher since the end of September, with 2017 increasing approximately $0.50 to $0.75 per megawatt hour, respectively. 2018 prices have increased approximately $0.20 to $0.50 per megawatt hour, respectively, and as a result, total gross margin on our unhedged generation has recovered since 9/30 by $50 million. 
At the end of the quarter, our hedge position was approximately 7% to 10% behind ratable in 2017 and 4% to 6% behind ratable in 2018 when considering cross-commodity hedges and reflecting our more positive fundamental view on the power markets. The majority of our link remains concentrated in the Midwest to align with our view of power market upside at NiHub. 
Total gross margins for 2019 is $6.8 billion, which is $450 million less than in 2018. The majority of the decline from 2018 is due to $175 million in lower capacity revenues, which we provided at Analyst Day, $125 million from a full year of retirement for Quad Cities and $200 million from a roll-off of in-the-money hedges versus 2018. 
We see multiple reasons why we'd expect a better realized power price environment than what's captured in these numbers. First, forwards beyond 2017 and especially beyond 2018 reflect a highly illiquid market with limited real price discovery. Liquidity will improve as we get closer to the delivery year, and that will help prices. 
In addition, our work on power market shows too many plants continuing to operate even though they're not economically viable. These plants will need to close, and like we've done with certain of our fossil plants and our planned nuclear retirements. 
Second, our Generation to Load matching strategy and our portfolio management team at Constellation have a proven ability to extract value out of various market conditions. Our Constellation business is set up to profit in periods of extremes. This summer, we captured better margins since our contracts are priced using forward summer market volatility. And when we don't see that volatility, such as this summer, we capture additional value. We saw the same thing during the polar vortex, a period with extremes but in the opposite direction. Our gross margin projections on this page do not anticipate these events repeating and assume normal weather, leaving the -- an opportunity for additional upside. 
And finally, the CES program in New York and the acquisition of FitzPatrick will add $500 million in gross margin in 2019 and annual EPS contributions of $0.10 to $0.18 per year starting -- annually starting next year. 
Turning to Slide 15. Even though we don't believe this market will be a reality, we are acting as if it will. We're reducing expected O&M expenditures by $100 million in 2018 and $125 million in 2019 at ExGen relative to what we showed you at Analyst Day, adding to the $400 million of savings we've already taken out of the business. 
We are finding additional savings as we focus our operations and reduce development efforts at Generation as we close out the growth CapEx program in 2017. 
We run an efficient organization, but we need to look for ways to reduce cost beyond these reductions. Our focus on -- our focus at ExGen remains on maximizing our cash generation to meet our commitments of funding utility equity needs and debt reduction. These efforts will help keep us on track. 
Finally, turning to Slide 16, our sources and uses slide. We expect adjusted cash flow from operations of $6.85 billion in 2016. In September, the U.S. Tax Court ruled against us on a like-kind exchange issue related to our sale of fossil generation in 1999. The outcome on numerics was not unexpected. We were fully reserved for the underlying claim. However, we do not agree with the decision and particularly disagree with the decision to issue penalties, which we did not think was likely or warranted. The law is very clear that we were entitled to rely upon the opinion of legal counsel. We believe the court came to an erroneous conclusion, and we expect to appeal the decision early next year. We plan to issue approximately $1 billion of long-term debt to support the payment to the IRS. 
I'll now turn the call back to Chris for his closing remarks."

And we've had a lot to be proud about at the company, but we're not happy with the outlook that we see at ExGen. 
As Jack talked, we're taking actions. The limited liquidity in the forwards beyond 2017 and the true lack of discipline by uneconomic generators are distorting the market. 
That said, we're not just going to sit around and wait on the power markets to recover. As we said, we're taking further actions to control our future at ExGen, aggressively managing our cost across -- or even against these forwards, cutting $100 million in cost from 2018 and $125 million from 2019 on top of the $400 million we've already cut across the business. And we're pursuing the compensation for the 0-carbon attributes of our plants, as we've done in New York. 
We are optimizing the fleet. All of this brings us back to the value proposition. We're targeting the best-in-class utility EPS growth of 7% to 9% through 2020. The strong free cash flow at ExGen will provide the incremental equity needs at the utilities as we focus on debt reduction at the ExGen. We're focused on optimizing the value of our ExGen business by seeking the fair compensation for the carbon pre-generation fleet and closing uneconomic plants. We will be opportunistically -- that's a good word, to selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate our debt reduction plans and maximize value through the gen-to-load matching strategy, which had another big quarter. We'll continue to focus on sustaining strong investment-grade credit metrics, growing our dividend in a consistent visible manner.

I can't speak to other fleets, but I can tell you that we have a very strong focus on capital, a very strong focus on efficiency.

Look. We've -- the market is what it is. Today, we have over 30 states with renewable portfolio standards that recognize the environmental contributions of virtually every resource in the market that does what our nuclear plants do. So we're seeking to get fair treatment. At the same time, from a policy perspective, we've been clear for many years now that we think the right move is to put a cost occlusion in the market. That is, in the case of climate, establish a price on requirement. And we're going to continue to pursue those things. But obviously, there have been a number of headwinds that have prevented those policies from being fully realized and fully recognizing the impact that carbon has on climate, as measured by the federal government. So we haven't seen programs that trade [ph] carbon up to the social cost of carbon. We're going to continue to work on those things. But the plans we have in New York and Illinois, we think of as preserving those units for the day where we have that best design in place. And we think that day is going to come eventually, but we need a bridge solution to keep the units that are important to our customers in place so that they're available once we do have a carbon signal in the market. And that's how we reconcile it. But we have to take this world as it comes to us, and the world currently isn't our most favorite design of putting a price on carbon in the market. We have these separate state programs, and it's important for our customers that these nuclear plants be preserved, and that's what's driving our initiatives. Joe?"

And I would add, just from a market perspective, portfolio perspective, a couple of things. One is, on the market side, I think the illiquidity of the market is somewhat independent of what Joe is saying. I think it gets into the nature of market participants. As you're well aware, when you think about the financial institutions to start with that added liquidity in this marketplace in years past, we don't see nearly the depth of that. But what's interesting is the power markets have been illiquid for quite some time. But when you look at open interest just on the gas market, for example, we've seen a change there where it's very front-end loaded versus kind of the outer years. And I think what's important with that is -- and let me give you an example. When you look at the price change in the quarter in PJM, in particular, versus -- the end of June versus the end of September, you saw that the prices -- the price of gas in each of those years, when you include the basis prices weren't great, fell equally. Yet we dropped power prices more materially on the back end of the forward curve than we did in the nearby 2017, and that gets into some of the illiquidity in the market. As it relates to our portfolio, we take all these factors into account, both the things that we're doing internally with our other assets, we have an estimate of what other folks are going to do with their own assets. We've been very clear that we've been aggressively managing our portfolio as it relates to our ratable plan, and we'll continue down that path. The last thing I would add is that we talk a lot about the benefits of our Generation to Load Strategy, and we do it with both [ph] in the dollars. It also has a huge benefit from a market perspective because it doesn't force us to go to that illiquid over-the-counter market. We have a strong customer base and a very, very strong load serving business now that matches output of generation to quantity of load very well. And we're going to continue to grow that, and we've done it both organically very well and through acquisition with like Integrys and ComEd, and that's been a big benefit also."

We -- as we're going through the integration, I think things are going very, very well. As we mentioned before, it's going to be a long haul in terms of rate cases being filed every 12 to 15 months for the next 5 years. We've had some good progress in New Jersey. We're in the throes of the case in Maryland at this point, and I guess, we'll know about November 15 the outcome of that. So a little hard to predict. Maryland's somewhat challenging. We are continuing to work on improving reliability, improving all of our performance levels as well as working to improve our image reputation and brand in Maryland. But I think this is going be one of those things where it's going to take us a few cases to get through to a better level of performance. So we're seeing November 14 or 15 where we are, and we're going to make this happen. It just may take us a few cases into it."
