MAA wrapped up calendar year 2015 with another quarter of strong performance. Importantly, we expect the favorable leasing conditions across our region and the trend supporting a record high occupancy and solid momentum in rent growth to continue in 2016. As outlined in our earnings release, our forecast for MAA for the coming year is defined by continued record occupancy results, consistent with what was captured in 2015, and rent growth that is also consistent with the strong momentum from last year and that remained well above long-term averages. Operating expenses are expected to remain well in check, with real estate taxes being the only item driving any pressure and reflecting the continued strong valuation and leasing fundamentals, that are supporting the apartment market.
During the fourth quarter, we captured positive pricing momentum across the portfolio, above the year-over-year and sequential quarterly basis. Tom will provide you with more detail surrounding leasing conditions across our markets, but overall we believe the supply and demand dynamics across our high-growth Sunbelt region, coupled with a portfolio that is uniquely diversified across both large and secondary markets and that offers a price point appealing to the largest segment of rental market will drive solid results in 2016. 
As noted in yesterday's earnings release, we were successful in securing a couple of acquisitions in the fourth quarter, both of which have an efficient and accretive Phase II benefit to them, which enabled the deals to work within our disciplined underwriting model. We expect the transaction market in 2016 will be similar to 2015, with robust transaction activity fueled by high level of new development and lease-up projects being brought to market.
With the continued high level of investor and buyer interest surrounding current valuations, we remain disciplined in our approach and have forecasted 2016 a comparable volume of acquisitions and new development funding as compared to 2015, that we plan to match fund with the disposition activity and internally generated free cash flow. Start expansion at our newly acquired The Denton property that Kansas City, we now have $117 million of new on development underway with each of the 5 projects representing highly accretive Phase II expansions of existing successful properties. 
During 2016, we also anticipate another active year of redevelopment through our very accretive kitchen and bath remodeling program. I'll recap for you the changes in our balance sheet and transactions completed in the fourth quarter, which further expands our growth capacity. As noted in our earnings release, through a combination of capital recycling completed last year and the free cash flow now being generated, the balance sheet was further deleveraged in 2015, with day to market cap at 32.2% by year end. We anticipate continued strengthening of the balance sheet in 2016. In summary, we believe MAA's balance sheet is well positioned for future opportunities as they emerge.
Before turning the call over to Tom, I want to say to all our MAA Associates, how much I appreciate all of your hard work and tremendous results in 2015. Thanks to your efforts, MAA produced pop it is for our shareholders in calendar year 2015, and we are well-positioned to continue our legacy of outperformance over the full cycle, as we head into 2016. 
And with that, I'm going to hand it over to Tom. Tom?"

Our fourth quarter NOI performance of 7.3%, was driven by revenue growth of 5.4% of prior year. We have good momentum in rents and so our effective rents increased 4.4% on year-on-year basis and 70 basis points sequentially. Strong average physical occupancy contributed 70 basis points over the prior year. Overall expenses remain in line, just 2.4%. Expense discipline has been a hallmark of our operations for years. Our industry-leading initiatives such as our vendor owned inventory shops talking program, which will be completed this year, have allowed us to keep the expense line consistently in check. 
January demand trends continue to positive momentum. Average physical occupancy of 96.1 ran 94 basis points ahead of last year. Our 60-day exposure, which is current vacancy plus all notices for 60-day period, is just 7%. This is a 120 basis points stronger than same time last year. January rents on a year-over-year basis were up 5%. Occupancy exposure critical beginning of the year better than we've seen in recent years. 
On the market front, the growth of the large markets is driving strong revenue results. They were led by Orlando, Fort Worth, Atlanta and Phoenix. The secondary markets achieved 4.4% revenue growth. And these markets were benefiting from improved job growth as well as sophisticated operating platform, that has a competitive advantages across our footprint and markets.
Revenue growth in Charleston, Greenville, Savanna and Jacksonville all stood out. As mentioned above, momentum is strong across our markets, with occupancy, rent growth and exposure all showing positive trends. For our market in Houston, which represents just 3.5% of our portfolio. We will continue to monitor closely and protect occupancy in this market. 
Turnover for the quarter was down by 7.5% and down 180 basis points on a rolling 12-month basis to 52.5%. Moveouts to home buying was down 100 basis points and remained below historic norms. Moveouts to home rentals was down 6% and represents just 7% of our total moveouts. Our focus on minimizing the time between occupancy again paid off. The improvement in average days between occupancy for the quarter of 2.5 days, help drop-down the fourth quarter average physical occupancy or a record average physical occupancy to 96.1.
During 2015, we have completed 5,781 interior unit upgrades, 3,200 of those were on legacy COP communities. We expect to redevelop 5,000 units next year and expect the mix to continue to favor legacy COP portfolio. As a reminder, on average, we spent $4,500 per unit and received a $95 increase over comparable non-renovated unit, generating a year 1 cash return of well over 20%. Our active lease-up communities are performing well and we completed construction of 220 Riverside in Jacksonville in the fourth quarter. As you will notice in our release, we moved the stabilization of this community up to Q1 of '16, rather than Q2, because of better than planned lease-up supported by rents about pro forma. Colonial Grand at Bellevue II and West Creek 1 both stabilized on schedule for the fourth quarter. Station Square and Corner II and Cityscape at Market Center II are currently 67.5% and 82.1% leased and expected to stabilize in the fourth and third quarters of this year, respectively. We ended 2015 in strong fashion and are well-positioned for 2016.

I will provide some additional commentary on fourth quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity and then finally, of initial guidance for 2016. 
The record occupancy levels, continued pricing momentum and solid expense control during the fourth quarter produced record levels of core FFO per share for both the quarter and full year 2015. Core FFO, which excludes certain noncash and nonroutine items were $1.45, representing a 10% increase over the prior year. The current capital 20 just for the quarter were $8.6 million or $0.11 per share, which produce Core FFO about $1.34 per share, strong coverage of our $0.82 per quarter dividend. Core FFO for the full year, was 551 per share, also representing 10% increase over prior year. Our core AFFO for the year was 4.8 per share representing a 12% increase over the prior year. Down performance for the quarter was primarily produced by same-store NOI growth, driven by continued record high average occupancy levels during the quarter 70 basis points above the prior year. Our operating expenses also remained well under control in the quarter, increasingly 2.4% over the prior year, with favorable real estate tax some benefit in the fourth quarter.
During the fourth quarter, we acquired 2 new communities for a total investment of $79 million, including land parcels for 2 Phase II expansions, which both started during the quarter. These purchases being our full year acquisition investment to $327 million for 7 new communities, containing 1,782 units. We also funded an additional $13.6 million of development cost for the 5 committees under construction during the quarter, all Phase II expansions, leaving $74 million of $117 million total projected cost to be funded as of year end. We expect NOI yields in 7% to 7.5% range for these communities once they are completed and stabilized. We also invested $8.3 million in our redevelop program during the fourth quarter, bringing our full year investment and program to about $31 million. We continue to capture increases of 10% of units rom this program. 
During fourth quarter, we completed several important financial goals for the year. We recast our unsecured revolving credit facility, increasing including our borrowing capacity to $750 million to $500 million, extending maturity to 4.5 years in equivalent terms to reflect our stronger credit profile.
We also refinanced $150 million term loan, including the rate by 25 basis points, extending the maturity and modifying the terms to be consistent with our new credit facility. Of course, we also executed very successful bond issuance during the fourth quarter, issuing $400 million of 10 year notes at a coupon rate of 4%, price of 98.99%, which completed our refinancing plans for 2015 debt maturities. We're very pleased with the investor support and execution of this issue as we think it provides further confirmation the strength of our balance sheet. 
At year end, our leverage defined as net debt to gross assets was 190 basis points below the prior year, 40.6%. Our recurring EBIT continues to grow and affected quality of our earnings profile, covering fixed charges of about 4.5x. At year end, 96% of our that debt fixed was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates and average effective rate of 3.8%, with well maturities averaging 5 years. We also have a $700 million of total cash and credit available at year end. 
Finally, we did provide an issue always guidance for 2016 with the release, Core FFO is projected to be 5.68 to 5.88 per share or 5.78 at the midpoint based on average shares outstanding about $79.6 million. Core AFFO is projected to be 4.98 to 5.18 per share or 5.08 at the midpoint, representing about 6% growth over prior year.
The primary driver of 2016 performance is expected to be same-store NOI growth, which is forecasted to be 4% or 5%, based on 3% and 3.75% to 4% growth in revenues and 2 or 3 quarters growth in operating expenses. Our revenue projections included expectation of continued record high occupancy levels, averaging 96.1% through 2016, combined with continued rental pricing above long-term trends similar to 2015 levels, ranging 4%, 4.5%. We expect operating expenses to remain well under control with the real estate taxes continuing to present all year pressure and operating performance pushes valuations higher. We expect acquisition volume to be similar to 2015, with $300 million to $400 million of purchases including our projections. We also expect to fund an additional $50 million to $60 million of construction cost to the completion of 5 committees under development. We plan to essentially match fund these investments with $200 million to $300 million of multi payment dispositions, $30 million to $60 million of commercial assets and positions and with $90 million to $95 million of internally generated free cash flow. And due to the timing required to recycle assets along with the initial loss of NOI deals, our forecast for the full year, includes $0.04 to $0.06 per share of dilution related to these 2016 disposition plans. Our current plans do not include the need for new equity during 2016, and we expect to end the year with our leverage, and another flat year of reduction from prior year.
That's all we have in the way of fair comments. So Priscilla, we'll now turn the call back over to you for questions."

And our deal flow is running higher this time this year than it was at the same point last year. So we think the transaction market is going to be very active over the course of the year. And so we put a number out there, $300 million to $400 million, which is consistent with -- we did over a little over $300 million this year and we will see what happens. I'm optimistic that we'll see some things that are become increasingly compelling and we may find some situations, where we have these Phase 2 opportunities associated with like we did in December. And I think that we'll see how things play out over the course of the year. We have assumed in our guidance that we will do $200 million or $300 million dispositions, so we're going to wait on that, that will be more backend loaded over the course of the year, depending on what opportunities emerge on the acquisition front. So David, it's not specific detailed answer to you, but it's really more just a reflection of the thing conditions are going to be consistent, if not a little bit more robust from an activity perspective, and that may yield some opportunities for us."

I'll tell you, what you're expecting for 2016 first and foremost is not any deceleration in momentum in our business.

So on top of that, and so you flatten 2015 to hold that level. On top of that, we expect pricing levels to be consistent with 2015. Again, well above long-term averages or norms. We expect pricing of about 4% to 4.5%, so that really revenue growth and then we have expense control we talked about the bottom line of NOI.

And also, as we talked about, we had little better performance in '15 in capturing some of the final remaining portions of the synergies from our margin. We really had a strong performance in 2015 and the fees to give you context, 15% in 2015 over '14.

And we and frankly I think many in the sector were surprised how strong the markets were last year, and I think everybody for the most part was raising the guidance for the course of the year. As we got into 2016 guidance, we're coming off a year, where average daily physical occupancy was higher than we have seen in our 22-year history. We ended the fourth quarter with highest average daily physical occupancy we're ever had. So to go into 2016, with an anticipation that we're going to beat that again and get about average daily physical occupancy of 96%. We just -- we're little hesitant to take that back and we think we're going to hold it. We think that the conditions are great in our markets and great in our region and we think we're going to hold that record occupancy. And we think we're going to get very solid rent growth of 4% to 4.5% as well, again in line with past year. But just the incremental lift in occupancy is not expected to repeat itself again in 2016. And that's the big difference between '16 and '15."

I mean frankly, where we see our opportunities are, where we see private capital come in, tie up the date on very, very aggressive terms and then run into some kind of a problem and getting their financing or they don't get loan proceeds, equivalent to what thought they were going to get and they go back to developer to try to reiterate the deal and the developer sort of blows up and then they come back to us.

MAA wrapped up calendar year 2015 with another quarter of strong performance. Importantly, we expect the favorable leasing conditions across our region and the trend supporting record-high occupancy and solid momentum in rent growth to continue in 2016. 
As outlined in our earnings release, our forecast for MAA for the coming year is defined by continued record occupancy results, consistent with what was captured in 2015. And rent growth that is also consistent with the strong momentum from last year, and that remained well above long-term averages. Operating expenses are expected to remain well in check, with real estate taxes being the only item driving any pressure and reflecting the continued strong valuation and leasing fundamentals that are supporting the apartment market.
During the fourth quarter, we captured positive pricing momentum across the portfolio on both the year-over-year and sequential quarterly basis. Tom will provide you with more detail surrounding leasing conditions across our markets. But overall, we believe the supply and demand dynamics across our high-growth Sunbelt region, coupled with a portfolio that is uniquely diversified across both large and secondary markets and that offers a price point appealing to the largest segment of the rental market, will drive solid results in 2016. 
As noted in yesterday's earnings release, we were successful in securing a couple of acquisitions in the fourth quarter, both of which have an efficient and accretive Phase II benefit to them, which enabled the deals to work within our disciplined underwriting model. We expect the transaction market in 2016 will be similar to 2015, with robust transaction activity fueled by a high level of new development and lease-up projects being brought to market, with the continued high level of investor and buyer interest surrounding current valuations. 
We remain disciplined in our approach and have forecasted 2016 a comparable volume of acquisitions and new development funding as compared to 2015 that we plan to match fund with the disposition activity and internally generated free cash flow. 
With the start of expansion at our newly acquired Denton property in Kansas City, we now have $117 million of new development underway, with each of the 5 projects representing highly accretive Phase II expansions of existing successful properties. During 2016, we also anticipate another active year of redevelopment through our very accretive kitchen and bath  remodeling program. 
I'll recap for you the changes in our balance sheet and transactions completed in the fourth quarter, which further expands our growth capacity. As noted in our earnings release, through a combination of the capital recycling completed last year and the free cash flow now being generated, the balance sheet was further deleveraged in 2015, with debt-to-market cap at 32.2% by year end. We anticipate continued strengthening of the balance sheet in 2016. In summary, we believe MAA's balance sheet is well positioned for future opportunities as they emerge.
Before turning the call over to Tom, I want to say to all our MAA associates how much I appreciate all of your hard work and tremendous results in 2015. Thanks to your efforts, MAA produced top tier total investment returns for our shareholders in calendar year 2015, and we are well positioned to continue our legacy of outperformance over the full cycle as we head into 2016. 
And with that, I'm going to hand it over to Tom. Tom?"

Our fourth quarter NOI performance of 7.3% was driven by revenue growth of 5.4% of the prior year. We have good momentum in rents. And so our effective rents increased 4.4% on a year-on-year basis and 70 basis points sequentially. Strong average physical occupancy contributed 70 basis points over the prior year. 
Overall expenses remained in line, up just 2.4%. Expense discipline has been a hallmark of our operation for years. Our industry-leading initiatives such as our vendor-owned inventory shop stocking program, which will be completed this year, have allowed us to keep the expense line consistently in check. 
January demand trends continued the positive momentum. Average physical occupancy of 96.1% ran 94 basis points ahead of last year. Our 60-day exposure, which is current vacancy plus all notices for a 60-day period, is just 7%. This is 120 basis points stronger than the same time last year. January blended rents on a year-over-year basis are up 5%. Occupancy exposure at the critical beginning of the year are better than we've seen in recent years. 
On the market front, the vibrant job growth of the large markets is driving strong revenue results. They were led by Orlando, Fort Worth, Atlanta and Phoenix. The secondary markets achieved 4.4% revenue growth, and these markets were benefiting from improved job growth as well as sophisticated operating platform that has the competitive advantages across our footprint end markets.  Revenue growth in Charleston, Greenville, Savannah and Jacksonville all stood out. 
As mentioned above, momentum is strong across our markets, with occupancy, rent growth and exposure, all showing positive trends. Our market worry bead is Houston, which represents just 3.5% of our portfolio. We will continue to monitor Houston closely and protect occupancy in this market. 
Turnover for the quarter was down by 7.5% and down 180 basis points on a rolling 12-month basis to 52.5%. Move-outs to home buying was down 100 basis points and remained below historic norms. Move-outs to home rentals was down 6% and represents just 7% of our total move-outs. Our focus on minimizing the time between occupancy again paid off. The improvements in average days vacant between occupants for the quarter of 2.5 days helped drive down the fourth quarter average physical occupancy or drove the record average physical occupancy to 96.1%.
During 2015, we've completed 5,781 interior unit upgrades. 3,200 of those were on legacy CLP communities. We expect to redevelop 5,000 units next year and expect the mix to continue to favor legacy CLP portfolio. As a reminder, on average, we spend $4,500 per unit and receive a $95 increase over our comparable nonrenovated unit, generating a year 1 cash return of well over 20%. 
Our active lease-up communities are performing well, and we completed construction of 220 Riverside in Jacksonville in the fourth quarter. As you will notice in our release, we moved the stabilization of this community up to Q1 of '16 rather than Q2 because of better-than-planned lease-up, supported by rents above pro forma. Colonial Grand at Bellevue II and Retreat at West Creek I both stabilized on schedule for the fourth quarter. Station Square at Cosner's Corner II and and Cityscape at Market Center II are currently 67.5% and 82.1% leased and expected to stabilize in the fourth and third quarters of this year, respectively. We ended 2015 in strong fashion and are well positioned for 2016.

I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's fourth quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity, and then finally, on initial guidance for 2016. 
The record occupancy levels, continued pricing momentum and solid expense control during the fourth quarter produced record levels of core FFO per share for both the quarter and the full year 2015. Core FFO, which excludes certain noncash and nonroutine items, was $1.45, representing a 10% increase over the prior year. The current capital expenditures for the quarter were $8.6 million or $0.11 per share, which produced core FFO of $1.34 per share, providing strong coverage of our $0.82 per share quarterly dividend. 
Core FFO for the full year was $5.51 per share, also representing a 10% increase over the prior year. And our core AFFO for the year was $4.80 per share, representing a 12% increase over the prior year. The outperformance for the quarter was primarily produced by same-store NOI growth, driven by continued record-high average occupancy levels during the quarter, 70 basis points above the prior year. And our operating expenses also remained well under control during the quarter, increasingly only 2.4% over the prior year, with favorable real estate tax appeals providing some benefit in the fourth quarter.
During the fourth quarter, we acquired 2 new communities for a total investment of $79 million, including the land parcels for 2 Phase II expansions, which are both started during the quarter. These purchases bring our full year acquisition investment to $327 million for 7 new communities containing 1,782 units. We also funded an additional $13.6 million of development cost for the 5 committees under construction during the quarter, all Phase II expansions, leaving $74 million of the $117 million total projected cost to be funded as of year end. We expect NOI yields in 7% to 7.5% range for these communities once they are completed and stabilized. We also invested $8.3 million in our redevelopment program during the fourth quarter, bringing our full year investment and program to about $31 million. We continue to capture rent increases of 10% above the nonrenovated units from this program. 
During the fourth quarter, we completed several important financing goals for the year. We recast our unsecured revolving credit facility, increasing our borrowing capacity to $750 million from $500 million, extending maturity to 4.5 years and the improving the terms to reflect our stronger credit profile. We also refinanced $150 million term loan, improving the rate by 25 basis points, extending the maturity and modifying the terms to be consistent with our new credit facility. And of course, we also executed very successful bond issuance during the fourth quarter, issuing $400 million of 10-year notes at a coupon rate of 4% priced at 98.99%, which completed our refinancing plans of 2015 debt maturities. We're very pleased with the investor support and execution of this issuance, which we think and we believe provides further confirmation of the strength of our balance sheet. 
At year end, our leverage, defined as net debt to gross assets, was 190 basis points below the prior year, 40.6%. Our recurring EBITDA continues to grow and reflect the quality of our earnings profile, covering fixed charges about 4.5x. At year end, 96% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates at an average effective rate of 3.8%, with well laddered maturities averaging 5 years. And we also have a $700 million of total cash and credit available at year end. 
Finally, we did provide and issue earnings guidance for 2016 with the release. Core FFO is projected to be $5.68 to $5.88 per share or $5.78 at the midpoint based on average shares and units outstanding of about 79.6 million. Core AFFO is projected to be $4.98 to $5.18 per share or $5.08 at the midpoint, representing about a 6% growth over the prior year.
The primary driver of 2016 performance is expected to be same-store NOI growth, which is forecasted to be 4% to 5% based on a 3.75% to 4.25% growth in revenues and 2.75% to 3.75% growth in operating expenses. Our revenue projections include expectations of continued record-high occupancy levels averaging 96.1% through 2016 combined with continued rental pricing above long-term trends, similar to 2015 levels, ranging 4% to 4.5%. We expect operating expenses to remain well under control, with the real estate taxes continuing to present the only pressure, and strong operating performance pushes valuations higher. 
We expect acquisition volume to be similar to 2015, with $300 million to $400 million of purchases included in our projections. We also expect to fund an additional $50 million to $60 million of construction cost through the completion of the 5 committees under development. We plan to essentially match fund these investments with $200 million to $300 million of multi-payment dispositions, $30 million to $60 million of commercial assets and land dispositions and with $90 million to $95 million of internally generated free cash flow. And given the timing required to recycle assets along with the initial loss of NOI yields, our forecast for the full year includes $0.04 to $0.06 per share of dilution related to these 2016 disposition plans. Our current plans do not include the need for new equity during 2016, and we expect to end the year with our leverage, and another flat year of reduction from the prior year.
That's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Priscilla, we'll now turn the call back over to you for questions."

I'll tell you, what we're expecting for 2016 first and foremost is not any deceleration in momentum in our business. And what we're projecting is for occupancy level of 96.1%, which is, by the way, a record high for the company that we had in 2015, to carry through 2016. And I'm talking about average 365 days a year -- for the year, which is pretty strong occupancy that's full. And so on top of that -- and so you're flat with 2015 to hold that level. On top of that, we expect pricing levels to be consistent with 2015, again well above long-term averages or norms. We expect pricing to go up 4% to 4.5%. And so that really is producing revenue growth. And then we have the expense control we talked about that drops to the bottom line of NOI. The comparison to 2015, I think the challenge there is that we had about 150 basis points of things in our 2015 revenue that were unusual. I won't hestitate to call them one-time, but similar to that one-time items, such as we built our occupancy 75 basis points in the year, getting to that 96.1% with on average 75 basis points in revenue above the prior year. And then related to that, we -- while we were building occupancy, we also had higher fee performance related -- some of it related to building our occupancy. Fees, as you have app fees, processing fees, PEP fees, all those things. And also, as we've talked about, we had a little better performance in '15 in capturing some of the final remaining portions of the synergies from the -- from our merger. We really had a strong performance in 2015 in the fees. To give you context, they grew 15% in 2015 over '14.

I mean, the takeaway from that is that when you look at 2015, the surprise factor was occupancy. And we had anticipated that coming out of 2014 that we would hold the 2014 occupancy, which was pretty strong, and we did really contemplate seeing occupancy lift as much as it did over the course of 2015. And we, and frankly, I think many in this sector, were surprised at how strong the markets were last year. And I think everybody, for the most part, was raising guidance over the course of the year. As we got into 2016 guidance, we're coming off a year, where average daily physical occupancy was higher than we've seen in our 22-year history. We ended the fourth quarter with the highest average daily physical occupancy we've ever had. So to go into 2016 with an anticipation that we're going to beat that again and get above average daily physical occupancy of 96%, we just -- we're a little hesitant to take that back. And we think we're going to hold it. We think that the conditions are great in our markets and great in our region, and we think we're going to hold that record occupancy. And we think we're going to get very solid rent growth of 4% to 4.5% as well, again in line with what we saw this past year. But just the incremental lift in occupancy is not expected to repeat itself again in 2016. And that's the big difference between '16 and '15."

As you move into second quarter, you have a little more information; third, a lot; and fourth, you're finalized. I think as this year -- and so what happened last year is we started out -- the pressure is coming from Texas, Florida, a little bit in George, as we have some revaluations occurring there. But we start out the year with an expectation. And in 2015, really high numbers coming out of Texas. We got in the second and third, particularly third quarter, we started to get some information, believing that, that was going to moderate a little bit in the fourth quarter. We got that finalized notice. And so that's why it came down in '15. Looking into '16, we're still getting very high numbers out of Texas, and then we've got revaluations in Georgia and then -- and some in Florida. So I would tell you, where we sit today, we expect to think about assessors, what they do. They're doing their valuation or the assessment in 2016 looking backwards at 2015. A record year for the company in many areas. And so we expect those initial valuations to come out high, and we expect to jump on early, hopefully have some success. And we have some success in [indiscernible] what we think will come out built in our numbers. But hopefully, we'll meet that and even be able to have more success.

It appears its financing windows are wide open very much from a loan-to-value prospective, very much consistent with what we saw in 2015. I think that despite the slight bump that the Fed has made in interest rates earlier, the expectation is that rates are going to continue to remain pretty low this year. So from our perspective, it's really hard to see how the valuation market is going to change much. I think it's going to be another active year, another -- fueled by a lot of investor interest.

I mean frankly, where we see our opportunities are, where we see private capital come in, tie up a deal on very, very aggressive terms and then run into some kind of a problem in getting their financing or they don't get loan proceeds equivalent to what thought they were going to get and they go back to the developer to try to retrade the deal and the developer sort of blows up and then they come back to us. And so I mean, every deal we bought last year was on a rebound. And I think that from an operating perspective, we're not seeing any real weakness yet. But I just think as the deal flow picks up, we think that may very well yield some increased opportunity."

MAA wrapped up calendar year 2015 with another quarter of strong performance. Importantly, we expect the favorable leasing conditions across our region and the trends supporting record-high occupancy and solid momentum in rent growth to continue in 2016. 
As outlined in our earnings release, our forecast for MAA for the coming year is defined by continued record occupancy results, consistent with what was captured in 2015. And rent growth that is also consistent with the strong momentum from last year, and that remained well above long-term averages. Operating expenses are expected to remain well in check, with real estate taxes being the only item driving any pressure and reflecting the continued strong valuation and leasing fundamentals that are supporting the apartment market.
During the fourth quarter, we captured positive pricing momentum across the portfolio on both the year-over-year and sequential quarterly basis. Tom will provide you with more detail surrounding leasing conditions across our markets. But overall, we believe the supply and demand dynamics across our high-growth Sunbelt region, coupled with a portfolio that is uniquely diversified across both large and secondary markets and that offers a price point appealing to the largest segment of the rental market, will drive solid results in 2016. 
As noted in yesterday's earnings release, we were successful in securing a couple of acquisitions in the fourth quarter, both of which have an efficient and accretive Phase II benefit to them, which enabled the deals to work within our disciplined underwriting model. We expect the transaction market in 2016 will be similar to 2015, with robust transaction activity fueled by a high level of new development and lease-up projects being brought to market, with the continued high level of investor and buyer interest surrounding current valuations. 
We remain disciplined in our approach and have forecasted 2016 a comparable volume of acquisitions and new development funding as compared to 2015 that we plan to match fund with the disposition activity and internally generated free cash flow. 
With the start of expansion at our newly acquired Denton property in Kansas City, we now have $117 million of new development underway, with each of the 5 projects representing highly accretive Phase II expansions of existing successful properties. During 2016, we also anticipate another active year of redevelopment through our very accretive kitchen and bath remodeling program. 
Al will recap for you the changes in our balance sheet and transactions completed in the fourth quarter, which further expands our growth capacity. As noted in our earnings release, through a combination of the capital recycling completed last year and the free cash flow now being generated, the balance sheet was further deleveraged in 2015, with debt-to-market cap at 32.2% by year end. We anticipate continued strengthening of the balance sheet in 2016. In summary, we believe MAA's balance sheet is well positioned for future opportunities as they emerge.
Before turning the call over to Tom, I want to say to all our MAA associates how much I appreciate all of your hard work and tremendous results in 2015. Thanks to your efforts, MAA produced top tier total investment returns for our shareholders in calendar year 2015, and we are well positioned to continue our legacy of outperformance over the full cycle as we head into 2016. 
And with that, I'm going to hand it over to Tom. Tom?"

Our fourth quarter NOI performance of 7.3% was driven by revenue growth of 5.4% over the prior year. We have good momentum in rents and saw effective rents increase 4.4% on a year-on-year basis and 70 basis points sequentially. Strong average physical occupancy contributed 70 basis points over the prior year. 
Overall expenses remained in line, up just 2.4%. Expense discipline has been a hallmark of our operation for years. Our industry-leading initiatives such as our vendor-owned inventory shop stocking program, which will be completed this year, have allowed us to keep the expense line consistently in check. 
January demand trends continued the positive momentum. Average physical occupancy of 96.1% ran 94 basis points ahead of last year. Our 60-day exposure, which is current vacancy plus all notices for a 60-day period, is just 7%. This is 120 basis points stronger than the same time last year. January blended rents on a year-over-year basis are up 5%. Occupancy exposure at the critical beginning of the year are better than we've seen in recent years. 
On the market front, the vibrant job growth of the large markets is driving strong revenue results. They were led by Orlando, Fort Worth, Atlanta and Phoenix. The secondary markets achieved 4.4% revenue growth, and these markets were benefiting from improved job growth as well as a sophisticated operating platform that has a competitive advantages across our footprint end markets.  Revenue growth in Charleston, Greenville, Savannah and Jacksonville all stood out. 
As mentioned above, momentum is strong across our markets, with occupancy, rent growth and exposure, all showing positive trends. Our market worry bead is Houston, which represents just 3.5% of our portfolio. We will continue to monitor Houston closely and protect occupancy in this market. 
Turnover for the quarter was down by 7.5% and down 180 basis points on a rolling 12-month basis to 52.5%. Move-outs to home buying was down 100 basis points and remained below historic norms. Move-outs to home rentals was down 6% and represents just 7% of our total move-outs. Our focus on minimizing the time between occupants again paid off. The improvements in average days vacant between occupants for the quarter of 2.5 days helped drive down the fourth quarter average physical occupancy -- or drive the record average physical occupancy to 96.1%.
During 2015, we've completed 5,781 interior unit upgrades. 3,200 of those were on legacy CLP communities. We expect to redevelop 5,000 units next year and expect the mix to continue to favor legacy CLP portfolio. As a reminder, on average, we spend $4,500 per unit and receive a $95 increase over our comparable nonrenovated unit, generating a year 1 cash return of well over 20%. 
Our active lease-up communities are performing well, and we completed construction of 220 Riverside in Jacksonville in the fourth quarter. As you will notice in our release, we moved the stabilization of this community up to Q1 of '16 rather than Q2 because of better-than-planned lease-up, supported by rents above pro forma. Colonial Grand at Bellevue II and Retreat at West Creek I both stabilized on schedule for the fourth quarter. Station Square at Cosner's Corner II and and Cityscape at Market Center II are currently 67.5% and 82.1% leased and expected to stabilize in the fourth and third quarters of this year, respectively. We ended 2015 in strong fashion and are well positioned for 2016.

I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's fourth quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity, and then finally, on initial guidance for 2016. 
The record occupancy levels, continued pricing momentum and solid expense control during the fourth quarter produced record levels of core FFO per share for both the quarter and the full year 2015. Core FFO, which excludes certain noncash and nonroutine items, was $1.45, representing a 10% increase over the prior year. The current capital expenditures for the quarter were $8.6 million or $0.11 per share, which produced core AFFO of $1.34 per share, providing strong coverage of our $0.82 per share quarterly dividend. 
Core FFO for the full year was $5.51 per share, also representing a 10% increase over the prior year. And our core AFFO for the year was $4.80 per share, representing a 12% increase over the prior year. The outperformance for the quarter was primarily produced by same-store NOI growth, driven by continued record-high average occupancy levels during the quarter, 70 basis points above the prior year. And our operating expenses also remained well under control during the quarter, increasingly only 2.4% over the prior year, with favorable real estate tax appeals providing some benefit in the fourth quarter.
During the fourth quarter, we acquired 2 new communities for a total investment of $79 million, including the land parcels for 2 Phase II expansions, which are both started during the quarter. These purchases bring our full year acquisition investment to $327 million for 7 new communities containing 1,782 units. We also funded an additional $13.6 million of development cost for the 5 committees under construction during the quarter, all Phase II expansions, leaving $74 million of the $117 million total projected cost to be funded as of year end. We expect NOI yields in 7% to 7.5% range for these communities once they are completed and stabilized. We also invested $8.3 million in our redevelopment program during the fourth quarter, bringing our full year investment in that program to about $31 million. We continue to capture rent increases of 10% above the nonrenovated units from this program. 
During the fourth quarter, we completed several important financing goals for the year. We recast our unsecured revolving credit facility, increasing our borrowing capacity to $750 million from $500 million, extending the maturity to 4.5 years and improving the terms to reflect our stronger credit profile. We also refinanced $150 million term loan, improving the rate by 25 basis points, extending the maturity and modifying the terms to be consistent with our new credit facility. And of course, we also executed a very successful bond issuance during the fourth quarter, issuing $400 million of 10-year notes at a coupon rate of 4% priced at 98.99%, which completed our refinancing plans of 2015 debt maturities. We were very pleased with the investor support and execution of this issuance, which we think and we believe provides further confirmation of the strength of our balance sheet. 
At year end, our leverage, defined as net debt to gross assets, was 190 basis points below the prior year at 40.6%. Our recurring EBITDA continues to grow and reflect the quality of our earnings profile, covering fixed charges about 4.5x. At year end, 96% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates at an average effective rate of 3.8%, with well laddered maturities averaging 5 years. And we also had over $700 million of total cash and credit available at year end. 
Finally, we did provide and issue earnings guidance for 2016 with the release. Core FFO is projected to be $5.68 to $5.88 per share or $5.78 at the midpoint based on average shares and units outstanding of about 79.6 million. Core AFFO is projected to be $4.98 to $5.18 per share or $5.08 at the midpoint, representing about a 6% growth over the prior year.
The primary driver of 2016 performance is expected to be same-store NOI growth, which is forecasted to be 4% to 5% based on a 3.75% to 4.25% growth in revenues and 2.75% to 3.75% growth in operating expenses. Our revenue projections include expectations of continued record-high occupancy levels averaging 96.1% through 2016 combined with continued rental pricing above long-term trends, similar to 2015 levels, ranging 4% to 4.5%. We expect operating expenses to remain well under control, with the real estate taxes continuing to present the only pressure, as the strong operating performance pushes valuations higher. 
We expect acquisition volume to be similar to 2015, with $300 million to $400 million of purchases included in our projections. We also expect to fund an additional $50 million to $60 million of construction cost through the completion of the 5 communities under development. We plan to essentially match fund these investments with $200 million to $300 million of multi-payment dispositions, $30 million to $60 million of commercial assets and land dispositions and with $90 million to $95 million of internally generated free cash flow. And given the timing required to recycle assets along with the initial loss of NOI yield, our forecast for the full year includes $0.04 to $0.06 per share of dilution related to these 2016 disposition plans. Our current plans do not include the need for new equity during 2016, and we expect to end the year with our leverage, and another slight year of reduction from the prior year.
That's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Priscilla, we'll now turn the call back over to you for questions."

I'll tell you, what we're expecting for 2016 first and foremost is not any deceleration in momentum in our business. And what we're projecting is for occupancy level of 96.1%, which is, by the way, a record high for the company that we had in 2015, to carry through 2016. And I'm talking about average 365 days a year -- for the year, which is pretty strong occupancy that's full. And so on top of that -- and so you're flat with 2015 to hold that level. On top of that, we expect pricing levels to be consistent with 2015, again well above long-term averages or norms. We expect pricing to go up 4% to 4.5%. And so that really is producing the revenue growth. And then we have the expense control we talked about that drops the bottom line of NOI. The comparison to 2015, I think the challenge there is that we had about 150 basis points of things in our 2015 revenue that were unusual. I won't hesitate to call them one-time, but similar to that one-time items, such as we built our occupancy 75 basis points in the year, getting to that 96.1% with on average 75 basis points in revenue above the prior year. And then related to that, we -- while we were building occupancy, we also had higher fee performance related -- some of it related to building that occupancy. Fees, as you have app fees, processing fees, pet fees, all those things. And also, as we've talked about, we had a little better performance in '15 in capturing some of the final remaining portions of the synergies from the -- from our merger. We really had a strong performance in 2015 in the fees. To give you context, they grew 15% in 2015 over '14.

I mean, the takeaway from that is that when you look at 2015, the surprise factor was occupancy. And we had anticipated that coming out of 2014 that we would hold the 2014 occupancy, which was pretty strong, and we didn't really contemplate seeing occupancy lift as much as it did over the course of 2015. And we, and frankly, I think many in this sector, were surprised at how strong the markets were last year. And I think everybody, for the most part, was raising guidance over the course of the year. As we got into 2016 guidance, we're coming off a year, where average daily physical occupancy was higher than we've seen in our 22-year history. We ended the fourth quarter with the highest average daily physical occupancy we've ever had. So to go into 2016 with an anticipation that we're going to beat that again and get above average daily physical occupancy of 96%, we just -- we're a little hesitant to take that back. And we think we're going to hold it. We think that the conditions are great in our markets and great in our region, and we think we're going to hold that record occupancy. And we think we're going to get very solid rent growth of 4% to 4.5% as well, again in line with what we saw this past year. But just the incremental lift in occupancy is not expected to repeat itself again in 2016. And that's the big difference between '16 and '15."

As you move into second quarter, you have a little more information; third, a lot; and fourth, you're finalized. I think as this year -- and so what happened last year is we started out -- the pressure is coming from Texas, Florida, a little bit in Georgia, as we have some revaluations occurring there. But we start out the year with an expectation. And in 2015, really high numbers coming out of Texas. We got in the second and third, particularly third quarter, we started to get some information, believing that, that was going to moderate a little bit in the fourth quarter. We got that finalized notice. And so that's why it came down in '15. Looking into '16, we're still getting very high numbers out of Texas, and then we've got revaluations in Georgia and then -- and some in Florida. So I would tell you, where we sit today, we expect to think about assessors, what they do. They're doing their valuation or their assessment in 2016 looking backwards at 2015. A record year for the company in many areas. And so we expect those initial valuations to come out high, and we expect to jump on them early, hopefully have some success. And we have some success in fighting what we think will come out built in our numbers. But hopefully, we'll meet that and even be able to have more success. But I'll you right now, given the performance we had in '15, the valuations are based off of income, it's hard to see those taxes begin to moderate significantly until the cycle changes.

It appears its financing windows are wide open very much from a loan-to-value perspective, very much consistent with what we saw in 2015. I think that despite the slight bump that the Fed has made in interest rates earlier, the expectation is that rates are going to continue to remain pretty low this year. So from our perspective, it's really hard to see how the valuation market is going to change much. I think it's going to be another active year, another -- fueled by a lot of investor interest.

MAA wrapped up calendar year 2015 with another quarter of strong performance. Importantly, we expect the favorable leasing conditions across our region and the trends supporting record-high occupancy and solid momentum in rent growth to continue in 2016. 
As outlined in our earnings release, our forecast for MAA for the coming year is defined by continued record occupancy results, consistent with what was captured in 2015. And rent growth that is also consistent with the strong momentum from last year, and that remained well above long-term averages. Operating expenses are expected to remain well in check, with real estate taxes being the only item driving any pressure and reflecting the continued strong valuation and leasing fundamentals that are supporting the apartment market.
During the fourth quarter, we captured positive pricing momentum across the portfolio on both the year-over-year and sequential quarterly basis. Tom will provide you with more detail surrounding leasing conditions across our markets. But overall, we believe the supply and demand dynamics across our high-growth Sunbelt region, coupled with a portfolio that is uniquely diversified across both large and secondary markets and that offers a price point appealing to the largest segment of the rental market, will drive solid results in 2016. 
As noted in yesterday's earnings release, we were successful in securing a couple of acquisitions in the fourth quarter, both of which have an efficient and accretive Phase II benefit to them, which enabled the deals to work within our disciplined underwriting model. We expect the transaction market in 2016 will be similar to 2015, with robust transaction activity fueled by a high level of new development and lease-up projects being brought to market, with the continued high level of investor and buyer interest surrounding current valuations. 
We remain disciplined in our approach and have forecasted 2016 a comparable volume of acquisitions and new development funding as compared to 2015 that we plan to match fund with the disposition activity and internally generated free cash flow. 
With the start of expansion at our newly acquired Denton property in Kansas City, we now have $117 million of new development underway, with each of the 5 projects representing highly accretive Phase II expansions of existing successful properties. During 2016, we also anticipate another active year of redevelopment through our very accretive kitchen and bath remodeling program. 
Al will recap for you the changes in our balance sheet and transactions completed in the fourth quarter, which further expands our growth capacity. As noted in our earnings release, through a combination of the capital recycling completed last year and the free cash flow now being generated, the balance sheet was further deleveraged in 2015, with debt-to-market cap at 32.2% by year-end. We anticipate continued strengthening of the balance sheet in 2016. In summary, we believe MAA's balance sheet is well positioned for future opportunities as they emerge.
Before turning the call over to Tom, I want to say to all our MAA associates how much I appreciate all of your hard work and tremendous results in 2015. Thanks to your efforts, MAA produced top tier total investment returns for our shareholders in calendar year 2015, and we are well positioned to continue our legacy of outperformance over the full cycle as we head into 2016. 
And with that, I'm going to hand it over to Tom. Tom?"

Our fourth quarter NOI performance of 7.3% was driven by revenue growth of 5.4% over the prior year. We have good momentum in rents and saw effective rents increase 4.4% on a year-on-year basis and 70 basis points sequentially. Strong average physical occupancy contributed 70 basis points over the prior year. 
Overall expenses remained in line, up just 2.4%. Expense discipline has been a hallmark of our operation for years. Our industry-leading initiatives such as our vendor-owned inventory shop stocking program, which will be completed this year, have allowed us to keep the expense line consistently in check. 
January demand trends continued the positive momentum. Average physical occupancy of 96.1% ran 94 basis points ahead of last year. Our 60-day exposure, which is current vacancy plus all notices for a 60-day period, is just 7%. This is 120 basis points stronger than the same time last year. January blended rents on a year-over-year basis are up 5%. Occupancy exposure at the critical beginning of the year are better than we've seen in recent years. 
On the market front, the vibrant job growth of the large markets is driving strong revenue results. They were led by Orlando, Fort Worth, Atlanta and Phoenix. The secondary markets achieved 4.4% revenue growth, and these markets were benefiting from improved job growth as well as a sophisticated operating platform that has a competitive advantages across our footprint end markets. Revenue growth in Charleston, Greenville, Savannah and Jacksonville all stood out. 
As mentioned above, momentum is strong across our markets, with occupancy, rent growth and exposure, all showing positive trends. Our market worry bead is Houston, which represents just 3.5% of our portfolio. We will continue to monitor Houston closely and protect occupancy in this market. 
Turnover for the quarter was down by 7.5% and down 180 basis points on a rolling 12-month basis to 52.5%. Move-outs to home buying was down 100 basis points and remained below historic norms. Move-outs to home rentals was down 6% and represents just 7% of our total move-outs. Our focus on minimizing the time between occupants again paid off. The improvements in average days vacant between occupants for the quarter of 2.5 days helped drive down the fourth quarter average physical occupancy -- or drive the record average physical occupancy to 96.1%.
During 2015, we've completed 5,781 interior unit upgrades. 3,200 of those were on legacy CLP communities. We expect to redevelop 5,000 units next year and expect the mix to continue to favor legacy CLP portfolio. As a reminder, on average, we spend $4,500 per unit and receive a $95 increase over our comparable nonrenovated unit, generating a year 1 cash return of well over 20%. 
Our active lease-up communities are performing well, and we completed construction of 220 Riverside in Jacksonville in the fourth quarter. As you will notice in our release, we moved the stabilization of this community up to Q1 of '16 rather than Q2 because of better-than-planned lease-up, supported by rents above pro forma. Colonial Grand at Bellevue II and Retreat at West Creek I both stabilized on schedule for the fourth quarter. Station Square at Cosner's Corner II and Cityscape at Market Center II are currently 67.5% and 82.1% leased and expected to stabilize in the fourth and third quarters of this year, respectively. We ended 2015 in strong fashion and are well positioned for 2016.

I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's fourth quarter earnings performance, balance sheet activity, and then finally, on initial guidance for 2016. 
The record occupancy levels, continued pricing momentum and solid expense control during the fourth quarter produced record levels of core FFO per share for both the quarter and the full year 2015. Core FFO, which excludes certain noncash and nonroutine items, was $1.45, representing a 10% increase over the prior year. The current capital expenditures for the quarter were $8.6 million or $0.11 per share, which produced core AFFO of $1.34 per share, providing strong coverage of our $0.82 per share quarterly dividend. 
Core FFO for the full year was $5.51 per share, also representing a 10% increase over the prior year. And our core AFFO for the year was $4.80 per share, representing a 12% increase over the prior year. The outperformance for the quarter was primarily produced by same-store NOI growth, driven by continued record-high average occupancy levels during the quarter, 70 basis points above the prior year. And our operating expenses also remained well under control during the quarter, increasingly only 2.4% over the prior year, with favorable real estate tax appeals providing some benefit in the fourth quarter.
During the fourth quarter, we acquired 2 new communities for a total investment of $79 million, including the land parcels for 2 Phase II expansions, which are both started during the quarter. These purchases bring our full year acquisition investment to $327 million for 7 new communities containing 1,782 units. We also funded an additional $13.6 million of development cost for the 5 committees under construction during the quarter, all Phase II expansions, leaving $74 million of the $117 million total projected cost to be funded as of year-end. We expect NOI yields in 7% to 7.5% range for these communities once they are completed and stabilized. We also invested $8.3 million in our redevelopment program during the fourth quarter, bringing our full year investment in that program to about $31 million. We continue to capture rent increases of 10% above the nonrenovated units from this program. 
During the fourth quarter, we completed several important financing goals for the year. We recast our unsecured revolving credit facility, increasing our borrowing capacity to $750 million from $500 million, extending the maturity to 4.5 years and improving the terms to reflect our stronger credit profile. We also refinanced $150 million term loan, improving the rate by 25 basis points, extending the maturity and modifying the terms to be consistent with our new credit facility. And of course, we also executed a very successful bond issuance during the fourth quarter, issuing $400 million of 10-year notes at a coupon rate of 4% priced at 98.99%, which completed our refinancing plans of 2015 debt maturities. We were very pleased with the investor support and execution of this issuance, which we think and we believe provides further confirmation of the strength of our balance sheet. 
At year-end, our leverage, defined as net debt to gross assets, was 190 basis points below the prior year at 40.6%. Our recurring EBITDA continues to grow and reflect the quality of our earnings profile, covering fixed charges about 4.5x. At year-end, 96% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates at an average effective rate of 3.8%, with well laddered maturities averaging 5 years. And we also had over $700 million of total cash and credit available at year-end. 
Finally, we did provide and issue earnings guidance for 2016 with the release. Core FFO is projected to be $5.68 to $5.88 per share or $5.78 at the midpoint based on average shares and units outstanding of about 79.6 million. Core AFFO is projected to be $4.98 to $5.18 per share or $5.08 at the midpoint, representing about a 6% growth over the prior year.
The primary driver of 2016 performance is expected to be same-store NOI growth, which is forecasted to be 4% to 5% based on a 3.75% to 4.25% growth in revenues and 2.75% to 3.75% growth in operating expenses. Our revenue projections include expectations of continued record-high occupancy levels averaging 96.1% through 2016 combined with continued rental pricing above long-term trends, similar to 2015 levels, ranging 4% to 4.5%. We expect operating expenses to remain well under control, with the real estate taxes continuing to present the only pressure, as the strong operating performance pushes valuations higher. 
We expect acquisition volume to be similar to 2015, with $300 million to $400 million of purchases included in our projections. We also expect to fund an additional $50 million to $60 million of construction cost through the completion of the 5 communities under development. We plan to essentially match fund these investments with $200 million to $300 million of multi-payment dispositions, $30 million to $60 million of commercial assets and land dispositions and with $90 million to $95 million of internally generated free cash flow. And given the timing required to recycle assets along with the initial loss of NOI yield, our forecast for the full year includes $0.04 to $0.06 per share of dilution related to these 2016 disposition plans. Our current plans do not include the need for new equity during 2016, and we expect to end the year with our leverage, and another slight year of reduction from the prior year.
That's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Priscilla, we'll now turn the call back over to you for questions."

And our deal flow is running higher this time this year than it was at the same point last year. So we think the transaction market is going to be very active over the course of the year. And so we put a number out there, $300 million to $400 million, which is consistent with -- and we did over a little over $300 million this year. And we'll see what happens. I'm optimistic that we'll see some things that are -- have become increasingly compelling, and we may find some situations where we have these Phase II opportunities associated with them like we did in December. And I think that we'll see how things play out over the course of the year. We have assumed in our guidance that we'll do $200 million to $300 million of dispositions. We're going to wait on that. That will be more back-end loaded over the course of the year, depending on what opportunities emerge on the acquisition front. So that -- David, it's not a specific detailed answer to you, but it is really more just a reflection of -- we think conditions are going to be consistent, if not a little bit more robust, from an activity perspective.

I'll tell you, what we're expecting for 2016 first and foremost is not any deceleration in momentum in our business.

And I'm talking about average 365 days a year -- for the year, which is pretty strong occupancy that's full. And so on top of that -- and so you're flat with 2015 to hold that level. On top of that, we expect pricing levels to be consistent with 2015, again well above long-term averages or norms. We expect pricing to go up 4% to 4.5%. And so that really is producing the revenue growth. And then we have the expense control we talked about that drops the bottom line of NOI. The comparison to 2015, I think the challenge there is that we had about 150 basis points of things in our 2015 revenue that were unusual. I won't hesitate to call them one-time, but similar to that one-time items, such as we built our occupancy 75 basis points in the year, getting to that 96.1% with on average 75 basis points in revenue above the prior year. And then related to that, we -- while we were building occupancy, we also had higher fee performance related -- some of it related to building that occupancy. Fees, as you have app fees, processing fees, pet fees, all those things. And also, as we've talked about, we had a little better performance in '15 in capturing some of the final remaining portions of the synergies from the -- from our merger. We really had a strong performance in 2015 in the fees. To give you context, they grew 15% in 2015 over '14.

I mean, the takeaway from that is that when you look at 2015, the surprise factor was occupancy. And we had anticipated that coming out of 2014 that we would hold the 2014 occupancy, which was pretty strong, and we didn't really contemplate seeing occupancy lift as much as it did over the course of 2015. And we, and frankly, I think many in this sector, were surprised at how strong the markets were last year. And I think everybody, for the most part, was raising guidance over the course of the year. As we got into 2016 guidance, we're coming off a year, where average daily physical occupancy was higher than we've seen in our 22-year history. We ended the fourth quarter with the highest average daily physical occupancy we've ever had. So to go into 2016 with an anticipation that we're going to beat that again and get above average daily physical occupancy of 96%, we just -- we're a little hesitant to take that back. And we think we're going to hold it. We think that the conditions are great in our markets and great in our region, and we think we're going to hold that record occupancy. And we think we're going to get very solid rent growth of 4% to 4.5% as well, again in line with what we saw this past year. But just the incremental lift in occupancy is not expected to repeat itself again in 2016. And that's the big difference between '16 and '15."

As you move into second quarter, you have a little more information; third, a lot; and fourth, you're finalized. I think as this year -- and so what happened last year is we started out -- the pressure is coming from Texas, Florida, a little bit in Georgia, as we have some revaluations occurring there. But we start out the year with an expectation. And in 2015, really high numbers coming out of Texas. We got in the second and third, particularly third quarter, we started to get some information, believing that, that was going to moderate a little bit in the fourth quarter. We got that finalized notice. And so that's why it came down in '15. Looking into '16, we're still getting very high numbers out of Texas, and then we've got revaluations in Georgia and then -- and some in Florida. So I would tell you, where we sit today, we expect to think about assessors, what they do. They're doing their valuation or their assessment in 2016 looking backwards at 2015. A record year for the company in many areas. And so we expect those initial valuations to come out high, and we expect to jump on them early, hopefully have some success. And we have some success in fighting what we think will come out built in our numbers. But hopefully, we'll meet that and even be able to have more success. But I'll you right now, given the performance we had in '15, the valuations are based off of income, it's hard to see those taxes begin to moderate significantly until the cycle changes.

It appears its financing windows are wide open very much from a loan-to-value perspective, very much consistent with what we saw in 2015. I think that despite the slight bump that the Fed has made in interest rates earlier, the expectation is that rates are going to continue to remain pretty low this year. So from our perspective, it's really hard to see how the valuation market is going to change much. I think it's going to be another active year, another -- fueled by a lot of investor interest.

As detailed in our earnings release, MAA started 2016 with solid first quarter operating results that were ahead of expectations. Average daily physical occupancy at 96.2% and effective rent growth at 4.5% drove same store revenues higher than forecasted. We expect the solid momentum in leasing across our portfolio to continue over the balance of this year. 
As Tom will outline in his comments, in the first quarter, our properties continued to post low resident turnover, strong occupancy and captured solid pricing performance. Importantly, we entered the busy summer leasing season with the portfolio well positioned to take advantage of the favorable leasing conditions. 
Given the strong start to the year, we have raised the midpoint of our earnings guidance for Core FFO for the full year to $5.81 per share. Investor interest in apartment real estate remains high across our markets, and we continue to find the acquisition environment challenging with pricing reflecting strong demand from private and institutional buyers. Cap rate continue to hold up despite a higher volume and new supply coming into the market. 
Our deal flow and transaction pipeline is more robust than we've seen over the last couple of years and we're certainly underwriting a higher volume of opportunity. We continue to believe that as we work later into the cycle, we will find more opportunities that meet our underwriting criteria. Until then, we plan to remain disciplined and deploy capital only when we are comfortable with the value proposition and earnings accretion to be captured. 
As Al will recap, our balance sheet is in a very strong position and we continue to build capacity for future growth. As noted in our earnings release, Moody's recently moved MAA's current Baa2 rating to a positive outlook. We believe our established record of producing steady value growth and strong operating performance, coupled with credit and coverage metrics that are stronger than any point in our company history, has MAA well positioned to continue to build on long-term competitive advantages across our footprint. 
After several years of strong operating performance, questions surrounding the sustainability of the current leasing environment is certainly a hot topic. Based on what we are experiencing across our portfolio, which is diversified across urban, inter loop, suburban and satellite cities submarket locations in both large and secondary markets, demand does not appear to be weakening and all indications are that we will continue to capture good leasing velocity over the next few quarters. 
Conversations with a number of developers suggest that construction financing is becoming increasingly harder to secure. And those pressures, coupled with higher land and construction cost, are raising the bar to justify these starts. It's worth noting that new construction permitting across our markets is down so far this year compared to the trends we've seen over the last 2 years. We continue to believe that new supply trends are unlikely to materially disrupt the positive momentum for apartment leasing within our submarkets. 
Across our portfolio, the outlook for the ratio of new job growth to new apartment deliveries actually improves in 2017 as compared to this year. And while our crystal ball is certainly no better than anyone else's, I do still believe our business retained cyclical patterns. It's difficult to see any sort of near-term significant deterioration of leasing fundamentals. While our occupancy comparisons get tougher in the back half of the year, given the essentially full occupancy status of the portfolio last year, the rent trends remain encouraging. 
So overall, our focus for the balance of the year remains centered on taking full advantage of the great operating fundamentals to drive earnings and build platform strength and capacity, while remaining very active in the transaction market and disciplined in our assessment of new growth opportunities. 
Before turning the call over to Tom, I do want to thank our MAA Associates for their focus and efforts in preparing for the upcoming busy summer leasing season. You have the portfolio well positioned and I very much appreciate all of your hard work and great results. Tom?"

Our fourth quarter NOI performance of 7.1% was driven by revenue growth of 5.5% over the prior year and 1.1% sequentially. We have good momentum in rents and saw effective rents increase 4.5% on a year-over-yea",531,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter NOI performance of 7.1% was driven by revenue growth of 5.5% over the prior year and 1.1% sequentially. We have good momentum in rents and saw effective rents increase 4.5% on a year-over-year basis. Strong average physical occupancy contributed 60 basis point of revenue growth over the prior year. 
Overall expenses remain in line, up just 2.9%. Expense discipline has been a hallmark of our operation for years. Our industry-leading initiatives such as our vendor-owned inventory shop stocking program, which will be completed this year, have allowed us to keep the expense line consistently in check. 
April demand trends continue the positive momentum. Average physical occupancy of 96.2% ran 40 basis points ahead of last year. Our 60-day exposure, which is current vacancy, plus all notices for a 60-day period, is just 8.2%, in line with the same time last year. April blended rents on a lease-over-lease basis are up 4.8%. Occupancy exposure and pricing are all in good shape as we head into our summer leasing season. 
On the market front, the vibrant job growth of the large markets is driving strong revenue results of 5.9%. They were led by Orlando, Fort Worth, Atlanta and Charlotte. The secondary markets achieved 4.6% revenue growth. In these markets we're benefiting from improved job growth, as well as a sophisticated operating platform that has competitive advantages across our footprint and markets. Revenue growth in Charleston, Greenville, Savannah and Jacksonville stood out. 
As mentioned above, momentum is strong across our markets with occupancy, rent growth and exposure all showing positive trends. Our only market worry be is Houston, which represents just 3.5% of our portfolio. We will continue to monitor closely and protect occupancy in this market. 
Move-outs for the portfolio were down for the quarter by 4.4% over the prior year and turnover remain low at 52.2% on a rolling 12-month basis. Move-outs to home buying were down 4.6%. Move-outs to home rentals were also down 14% and represents less than 7% of our total move-outs. 
Our focus on minimizing the time between occupancy again paid off. The decrease in average days vacant between occupants for the quarter helped drive the first quarter average physical occupancy to 96.2%. 
During the quarter, we completed over 14,000 interior unit upgrades. We expect the redevelopment of -- we expect to redevelop approximately 5,000 units this year. As a reminder, on average, we spend about $4,500 per unit and receive an average rent increase of $95 over our comparable nonrenovated unit. This generates a year 1 cash return of well over 20%. 
Our active lease-up communities are performing well. You will notice in the supplemental data that we completed the construction of Station Square at Cosner's Corner II during the quarter. It's currently 94.2% occupied and due to the stronger-than-expected lease-up, we moved the stabilization date forward 1 quarter to the third quarter 2016. Cityscape at Market Center II is leasing well. They are 84% leased and expected to stabilize on schedule in the third quarter this year. 
We're off to a solid start and are well positioned as we head into the summer leasing season. Al?"

I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's first quarter earnings performance, balance sheet position and then finally, on revised earnings guidance for 2016. 
Core FFO, which excludes certain noncash and nonroutine items, was $1.44 per share for the quarter, which represents a 9% increase over the prior year. And this performance was $0.05 per share above the midpoint of our previous guidance. The strong performance for the quarter was primarily produced by favorable property revenues, which was broad-based. Average occupancy, average effective rents, fees and collections were all slightly better than expectations for the quarter, producing about 2/3 of the favorability. 
Operating expenses, interests and G&A expenses combined to produce the remainder of the favorability. 
During the first quarter, we acquired one new community located in Fredericksburg Virginia for a total investment of $61 million, which was stabilized on acquisition. We also sold one commercial property during the first quarter, Colonial Promenade located in Covington Louisiana, which included both operating retail and land parcels. Total proceeds for this disposition were $33.2 million and we recorded a total gain on sale of $2.4 million related to the transaction. Also, this property represented the final wholly-owned operating commercial asset acquired from Colonial. 
During the quarter, we completed the construction of one new community, Station Square at Cosner's Corner Phase II located in Fredericksburg, which remains in lease-up and was 78% occupied at quarter end. We have 4 communities, all Phase II expansions, remaining under development at the end of the quarter. We bought an additional $13 million of construction cost during the quarter and expect to fund about $63 million to complete the current development communities over the next year or so. 
We continue to expect NOI yields in the 7% to 7.5% range for this communities once completed and stabilized. 
We also invested $6.2 million in our interior redevelopment program during the first quarter, cash and rent increases of 9% above nonrenovated units. 
Our balance sheet remains in great shape. As Eric mentioned, during the quarter, Moody's affirmed MAA's unsecured debt rating of Baa2 and revised the outlook on the company to positive from stable. Now, 2 of the 3 primary rating agencies have a positive outlook on MAA, which further exhibits the strength of our balance sheet. 
At quarter end, our leverage, defined as net debt to gross assets, was 40.7% and defined as total debt to market capital was 29.7%. Our recurring EBITDA covered our fixed charges over 4.2x. At quarter end, 93% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates at an average effective rate of just 3.7% with well laddered maturities averaging 4.6 years. We also had over $645 million of total cash and credit available at quarter end, providing flexibility. 
And finally, as Eric mentioned, we are revising our earnings guidance for 2016 with this release. We're increasing our Core FFO projection by $0.03 per share at the midpoint to reflect both the strength of the first quarter results and also the offsetting impact of revised transaction volume and timing. 
Core FFO is now projected to be $5.71 to $5.91 per share or $5.81 at the midpoint based on average shares and units sales outstanding of about $79.6 million. 
Core AFFO is projected to be $5.01 to $5.21 per share or $5.11 per share at the midpoint. You may notice in our release that we introduced one additional metric this quarter, funds available for distribution or FAD, which represents Core FFO less all capital spending, including discretionary items such as redevelopment and revenue-enhancing capital, as well as corporate and cash [indiscernible] expenditures. The intention is to show the overall strength of our earnings and cash flow. For the full year, we expect our FAD or FFO less all internal CapEx, to be sufficient to cover our total annual dividend with $95 million remaining for investment or to build capacity for future growth. 
We are maintaining our guidance range for same store NOI for the full year, along with the other components of previous guidance with the one exception of projected acquisition volume, which we now expect to be between $250 million and $350 million for the year. 
Our current plans do not include any need for new equity during 2016, and we now expect to the end the year with our leverage about 130 basis points below the 2015 year-end level. 
So that's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Lindy, we'll now turn the call over to you for questions."

Occupancy level and the rent level are coming off the Q1 was a little bit higher. That's expenses than offset by the change in volume and the timing of the transactions we talk as about ted offset that and takes us through that back for that year.

I think we all hope, of course, the economy continues to move along but it is cyclical. And while we've had some great performance dynamics over the last 4 or 5 years, it probably does moderate at some point over the next 4 or 5 years. And as a consequence or rising rates and as a consequence of perhaps reaching more normalized sort of trends from an operating perspective, I think our competitive advantages in the markets where we focus our capital grow.

You're still in the lease-up mode, but yet you haven't reached stabilization of break even, if you will. Usually, you're late in the term of a construction financing. And if you're not getting rents and or if the lease-up is not going as fast as fast as you thought it would, that's where the most pressure is created. And frankly, that's where we think the better buying opportunities will continue to emerge. Now we've seen some of those, but we've also seen some very aggressive investors willing to come in and make some what we feel to be some very, very aggressive assumptions and by on that basis, which we're not going to do.

As detailed in our earnings release, MAA started 2016 with solid first quarter operating results that were ahead of expectations. Average daily physical occupancy at 96.2% and effective rent growth at 4.5%, drove same store revenues higher than forecasted. We expect the solid momentum in leasing across our portfolio to continue over the balance of the year.
As Tom will outline in his comments, in the first quarter, our properties continued to post low resident turnover, strong occupancy and captured solid pricing performance. Importantly, we entered the busy summer leasing season with the portfolio well positioned to take advantage of the favorable leasing conditions.
Given the strong start to the year, we have raised the midpoint of our earnings guidance for Core FFO for the full year to $5.81 per share. Investor interest in apartment real estate remains high across our markets, and we continue to find the acquisition environment challenging with pricing reflecting strong demand from private and institutional buyers. Cap rates continue to hold up despite a higher volume and new supply coming into the market.
Our deal flow and transaction pipeline is more robust than we've seen over the last couple of years, and we're certainly underwriting a higher volume of opportunity. We continue to believe that as we work later into the cycle, we will find more opportunities that meet our underwriting criteria. Until then, we plan to remain disciplined and deploy capital only when we are comfortable with the value proposition and earnings accretion to be captured.
As Al will recap, our balance sheet is in a very strong position, and we continue to build capacity for future growth. As noted in our earnings release, Moody's recently moved MAA's current Baa2 rating to a positive outlook. We believe our established record of producing steady value growth and strong operating performance, coupled with credit and coverage metrics that are stronger than any point in our company history, has MAA well positioned to continue to build on long-term competitive advantages across our footprint.
After several years of strong operating performance, questions surrounding the sustainability of the current leasing environment is certainly a hot topic. Based on what we are experiencing across our portfolio, which is diversified across urban, inner loop, suburban and satellite city submarket locations, in both large and secondary markets, demand does not appear to be weakening and all indications are that we will continue to capture good leasing velocity over the next few quarters.
Conversations with a number of developers suggest that construction financing is becoming increasingly harder to secure, and those pressures coupled with higher land and construction costs, are raising the bar to justify new starts. It's worth noting that new construction permitting across our markets is down so far this year compared to the trends we've seen over the last 2 years. We continue to believe that new supply trends are unlikely to materially disrupt the positive momentum for apartment leasing within our submarkets.
Across our portfolio, the outlook for the ratio of new job growth to new apartment deliveries actually improves in 2017 as compared to this year. And while our crystal ball is certainly no better than anyone else's, I do still believe our business retains cyclical patterns. It's difficult to see any sort of near-term significant deterioration of leasing fundamentals. While our occupancy comparisons get tougher in the back half of the year, given the essentially full occupancy status of the portfolio last year, the rent trends remained encouraging.
So overall, our focus for the balance of the year remains centered on taking full advantage of the great operating fundamentals to drive earnings and build platform strength and capacity, while remaining very active in the transaction market and disciplined in our assessment of new growth opportunities.
Before turning the call over to Tom, I do want to thank our MAA associates for their focus and efforts in preparing for the upcoming busy summer leasing season. You have the portfolio well positioned, and I very much appreciate all of your hard work and great results. Tom?"

Our fourth quarter NOI performance of 7.1% was driven by revenue growth of 5.5% over the prior year and 1.1% sequentially. We have good momentum in rents and saw effective rents increase 4.5% on a year-over-year basis. Strong average physical occupancy contributed 60 basis of revenue growth over the prior year.
Overall, expenses remain in line, up just 2.9%. Expense discipline has been a hallmark of our operation for years. Our industry-leading initiatives such as our vendor owned inventory shops stocking program, which will be completed this year have allowed us to keep the expense line consistently in check. 
April demand trends continued the positive momentum. Average physical occupancy of 96.2% ran 40 basis points ahead of last year. Our 60-day exposure, which is current vacancy, plus all notices for a 60-day period, is just 8.2%, in line with the same time last year. April blended rents on a lease-over-lease basis are up 4.8%. Occupancy exposure and pricing are all in good shape as we head into our summer leasing season.
On the market front, the vibrant job growth of the large markets is driving strong revenue results of 5.9%. They were led by Orlando, Fort Worth, Atlanta and Charlotte. The secondary markets achieved 4.6% revenue growth. In these markets we're benefiting from improved job growth as well as a sophisticated operating platform that has competitive advantages across our footprint end markets. Revenue growth in Charleston, Greenville, Savannah and Jacksonville stood up -- stood out.
As mentioned above, momentum is strong across our markets with occupancy, rent growth and exposure all showing positive trends. Our only market worry bead is Houston, which represents just 3.5% of our portfolio. We will continue to monitor closely and protect occupancy in this market. 
Move-outs for the portfolio were down for the quarter by 4.4% over the prior year and turnover remained low at 52.2% on a rolling 12-month basis. Move-outs to home buying were down 4.6%. Move-outs to home rentals were also down 14% and represent less than 7% of our total move-outs.
Our focus on minimizing the time between occupants again paid off, the decrease in average days vacant between occupants for the quarter helped drive the first quarter average physical occupancy to 96.2%.
During the quarter, we completed over 1,400 interior unit upgrades. We expect the redevelopment of -- we expect to redevelop approximately 5,000 units this year. As a reminder, on average, we spend about $4,500 per unit and receive an average rent increase of $95 over a comparable nonrenovated unit. This generates a year one cash return of well over 20%.
Our active lease-up communities are performing well. You will notice in the supplemental data that we completed the construction of Station Square at Cosner's Corner II during the quarter. It's currently 94.2% occupied and due to the stronger-than-expected lease-up, we've moved the stabilization date forward one quarter to the third quarter of 2016. Cityscape at Market Center II is leasing well. They are 84% leased and expected to stabilize on schedule in the third quarter of this year.
We're off to a solid start and are well positioned as we head into the summer leasing season. Al?"

I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's first quarter earnings performance, balance sheet position and then finally, on revised earnings guidance for 2016.
Core FFO, which excludes certain noncash and nonroutine items, was $1.44 per share for the quarter, which represents a 9% increase over the prior year. And this performance was $0.05 per share above the midpoint of our previous guidance. The strong performance for the quarter was primarily produced by favorable property revenues, which was broad-based. Average occupancy, average effective rents, fees and collections were all slightly better than expectations for the quarter, producing about 2/3 of the favorability.
Operating expenses, interests and G&A expenses combined to produce the remainder of the favorability. 
During the first quarter, we acquired one new community located in Fredericksburg, Virginia for a total investment of $61 million, which was stabilized on acquisition. We also sold one commercial property during the first quarter, Colonial Promenade Nord du Lac, located in Covington, Louisiana, which included both operating retail and land parcels. Total proceeds for this disposition were $33.2 million, and we recorded a total gain on sale of $2.4 million related to the transaction. Also this property represented the final wholly-owned operating commercial assets acquired from Colonial.
During the quarter, we completed the construction of one new community, Station Square at Cosner's Corner Phase II located in Fredericksburg, which remains in lease-up and was 78% occupied at quarter end. We have 4 communities all Phase II expansions remaining under development at the end of the quarter. We funded an additional $13 million of construction costs during the quarter and expect to fund about $63 million to complete the current development communities over the next year or so. 
We continue to expect NOI yields in the 7% to 7.5% range for these communities once completed and stabilized. 
We also invested $6.2 million in our interior redevelopment program during the first quarter, capturing rent increases of 9% above nonrenovated units.
Our balance sheet remains in great shape. As Eric mentioned, during the quarter, Moody's affirmed MAA's unsecured debt rating of Baa2 and revised the outlook on the company to positive from stable. Now, 2 of the 3 primary rating agencies have a positive outlook on MAA, which further exhibits the strength of our balance sheet. 
At quarter end, our leverage defined as net debt to gross assets was 40.7% and defined as total debt to market cap was 29.7%. Our recurring EBITDA covered our fixed charges over 4.2x. At quarter end, 93% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates at an average effective rate of just 3.7%, with well laddered maturities averaging 4.6 years. We also had over $645 million of total cash and credit available at quarter end, providing flexibility. 
And finally, as Eric mentioned, we are revising our earnings guidance for 2016 with this release. We're increasing our Core FFO projection by $0.03 per share at the midpoint, to reflect both the strength of the first quarter results and also the offsetting impact of revised transaction volume and timing.
Core FFO is now projected to be $5.71 to $5.91 per share or $5.81 at the midpoint, based on average shares and units outstanding of about $79.6 million. 
Core AFFO is projected to be $5.01 to $5.21 per share or $5.11 per share at the midpoint. You may notice in our release that we introduced one additional metric this quarter, Funds Available for Distribution or FAD, which represents Core FFO less all capital spending, including discretionary items such as, redevelopment and revenue-enhancing capital, as well as corporate and casualty loss expenditures. The intention is to show the overall strength of our earnings and cash flow. For the full year, we expect our FAD or FFO less all internal CapEx to be sufficient to cover our total annual dividend, with $90 million to $95 million remaining for investment or to build capacity for future growth. 
We are maintaining our guidance range for same-store NOI for the full year, along with the other components of previous guidance, with the one exception, our projected acquisition volume, which we now expect to be between $250 million and $350 million for the year. 
Our current plans do not include any need for new equity during 2016, and we now expect to the end the year with our leverage about 130 basis points below the 2015 year-end level.
So that's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Lindy, we'll now turn the call over to you for questions."

We're having a lot of those kind of conversations right now. Obviously, at this point in the cycle, we're being pretty careful with our underwriting and our assumptions. We've looked at a number of them since so far this year, and frankly, just couldn't get comfortable pulling the trigger on a number of deals believing that what the developer was anticipating in terms of rent levels and rent growth, we couldn't get comfortable with it.

Usually, you're late in the term of the construction financing. And if you're not getting the rents and/or the lease-up is not going as fast as fast as you thought it would, that's where the most pressure is created. And frankly, that's where we think the better buying opportunities will continue to emerge. Now we've seen some of those, but we've also seen some very aggressive investors willing to come in and make some, what we feel to be some very, very aggressive assumptions and buy on that basis, which we're not going to do.

As detailed in our earnings release, MAA started 2016 with solid first quarter operating results that were ahead of expectations. Average daily physical occupancy at 96.2% and effective rent growth at 4.5%, drove same store revenues higher than forecasted. We expect the solid momentum in leasing across our portfolio to continue over the balance of the year.
As Tom will outline in his comments, in the first quarter, our properties continued to post low resident turnover, strong occupancy and captured solid pricing performance. Importantly, we entered the busy summer leasing season with the portfolio well positioned to take advantage of the favorable leasing conditions.
Given the strong start to the year, we have raised the midpoint of our earnings guidance for Core FFO for the full year to $5.81 per share. Investor interest in apartment real estate remains high across our markets, and we continue to find the acquisition environment challenging with pricing reflecting strong demand from private and institutional buyers. Cap rates continue to hold up despite a higher volume and new supply coming into the market.
Our deal flow and transaction pipeline is more robust than we've seen over the last couple of years, and we're certainly underwriting a higher volume of opportunity. We continue to believe that as we work later into the cycle, we will find more opportunities that meet our underwriting criteria. Until then, we plan to remain disciplined and deploy capital only when we are comfortable with the value proposition and earnings accretion to be captured.
As Al will recap, our balance sheet is in a very strong position, and we continue to build capacity for future growth. As noted in our earnings release, Moody's recently moved MAA's current Baa2 rating to a positive outlook. We believe our established record of producing steady value growth and strong operating performance, coupled with credit and coverage metrics that are stronger than any point in our company history, has MAA well positioned to continue to build on long-term competitive advantages across our footprint.
After several years of strong operating performance, questions surrounding the sustainability of the current leasing environment is certainly a hot topic. Based on what we are experiencing across our portfolio, which is diversified across urban, inner loop, suburban and satellite city submarket locations, in both large and secondary markets, demand does not appear to be weakening and all indications are that we will continue to capture good leasing velocity over the next few quarters.
Conversations with a number of developers suggest that construction financing is becoming increasingly harder to secure, and those pressures coupled with higher land and construction costs, are raising the bar to justify new starts. It's worth noting that new construction permitting across our markets is down so far this year compared to the trends we've seen over the last 2 years. We continue to believe that new supply trends are unlikely to materially disrupt the positive momentum for apartment leasing within our submarkets.
Across our portfolio, the outlook for the ratio of new job growth to new apartment deliveries actually improves in 2017 as compared to this year. And while our crystal ball is certainly no better than anyone else's, I do still believe our business retains cyclical patterns. It's difficult to see any sort of near-term significant deterioration of leasing fundamentals. While our occupancy comparisons get tougher in the back half of the year, given the essentially full occupancy status of the portfolio last year, the rent trends remained encouraging.
So overall, our focus for the balance of the year remains centered on taking full advantage of the great operating fundamentals to drive earnings and build platform strength and capacity, while remaining very active in the transaction market and disciplined in our assessment of new growth opportunities.
Before turning the call over to Tom, I do want to thank our MAA associates for their focus and efforts in preparing for the upcoming busy summer leasing season. You have the portfolio well positioned, and I very much appreciate all of your hard work and great results. Tom?"

Our fourth quarter NOI performance of 7.1% was driven by revenue growth of 5.5% over the prior year and 1.1% sequentially. We have good momentum in rents and saw effective rents increase 4.5% on a year-over-year basis. Strong average physical occupancy contributed 60 basis of revenue growth over the prior year.
Overall, expenses remain in line, up just 2.9%. Expense discipline has been a hallmark of our operation for years. Our industry-leading initiatives such as our vendor owned inventory shops stocking program, which will be completed this year have allowed us to keep the expense line consistently in check. 
April demand trends continued the positive momentum. Average physical occupancy of 96.2% ran 40 basis points ahead of last year. Our 60-day exposure, which is current vacancy, plus all notices for a 60-day period, is just 8.2%, in line with the same time last year. April blended rents on a lease-over-lease basis are up 4.8%. Occupancy exposure and pricing are all in good shape as we head into our summer leasing season.
On the market front, the vibrant job growth of the large markets is driving strong revenue results of 5.9%. They were led by Orlando, Fort Worth, Atlanta and Charlotte. The secondary markets achieved 4.6% revenue growth. In these markets we're benefiting from improved job growth as well as a sophisticated operating platform that has competitive advantages across our footprint end markets. Revenue growth in Charleston, Greenville, Savannah and Jacksonville stood up -- stood out.
As mentioned above, momentum is strong across our markets with occupancy, rent growth and exposure all showing positive trends. Our only market worry bead is Houston, which represents just 3.5% of our portfolio. We will continue to monitor closely and protect occupancy in this market. 
Move-outs for the portfolio were down for the quarter by 4.4% over the prior year and turnover remained low at 52.2% on a rolling 12-month basis. Move-outs to home buying were down 4.6%. Move-outs to home rentals were also down 14% and represent less than 7% of our total move-outs.
Our focus on minimizing the time between occupants again paid off, the decrease in average days vacant between occupants for the quarter helped drive the first quarter average physical occupancy to 96.2%.
During the quarter, we completed over 1,400 interior unit upgrades. We expect the redevelopment of -- we expect to redevelop approximately 5,000 units this year. As a reminder, on average, we spend about $4,500 per unit and receive an average rent increase of $95 over a comparable nonrenovated unit. This generates a year one cash return of well over 20%.
Our active lease-up communities are performing well. You will notice in the supplemental data that we completed the construction of Station Square at Cosner's Corner II during the quarter. It's currently 94.2% occupied and due to the stronger-than-expected lease-up, we've moved the stabilization date forward one quarter to the third quarter of 2016. Cityscape at Market Center II is leasing well. They are 84% leased and expected to stabilize on schedule in the third quarter of this year.
We're off to a solid start and are well positioned as we head into the summer leasing season. Al?"
332358,330371170,977083,"Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's first quarter earnings performance, balance sheet position and then finally, on revised earnings guidance for 2016.Core FFO, which excludes certain nonc",762,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's first quarter earnings performance, balance sheet position and then finally, on revised earnings guidance for 2016.
Core FFO, which excludes certain noncash and nonroutine items, was $1.44 per share for the quarter, which represents a 9% increase over the prior year. And this performance was $0.05 per share above the midpoint of our previous guidance. The strong performance for the quarter was primarily produced by favorable property revenues, which was broad-based. Average occupancy, average effective rents, fees and collections were all slightly better than expectations for the quarter, producing about 2/3 of the favorability.
Operating expenses, interests and G&A expenses combined to produce the remainder of the favorability. 
During the first quarter, we acquired one new community located in Fredericksburg, Virginia for a total investment of $61 million, which was stabilized on acquisition. We also sold one commercial property during the first quarter, Colonial Promenade Nord du Lac, located in Covington, Louisiana, which included both operating retail and land parcels. Total proceeds for this disposition were $33.2 million, and we recorded a total gain on sale of $2.4 million related to the transaction. Also this property represented the final wholly-owned operating commercial assets acquired from Colonial.
During the quarter, we completed the construction of one new community, Station Square at Cosner's Corner Phase II located in Fredericksburg, which remains in lease-up and was 78% occupied at quarter end. We have 4 communities all Phase II expansions remaining under development at the end of the quarter. We funded an additional $13 million of construction costs during the quarter and expect to fund about $63 million to complete the current development communities over the next year or so. 
We continue to expect NOI yields in the 7% to 7.5% range for these communities once completed and stabilized. 
We also invested $6.2 million in our interior redevelopment program during the first quarter, capturing rent increases of 9% above nonrenovated units.
Our balance sheet remains in great shape. As Eric mentioned, during the quarter, Moody's affirmed MAA's unsecured debt rating of Baa2 and revised the outlook on the company to positive from stable. Now, 2 of the 3 primary rating agencies have a positive outlook on MAA, which further exhibits the strength of our balance sheet. 
At quarter end, our leverage defined as net debt to gross assets was 40.7% and defined as total debt to market cap was 29.7%. Our recurring EBITDA covered our fixed charges over 4.2x. At quarter end, 93% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates at an average effective rate of just 3.7%, with well laddered maturities averaging 4.6 years. We also had over $645 million of total cash and credit available at quarter end, providing flexibility. 
And finally, as Eric mentioned, we are revising our earnings guidance for 2016 with this release. We're increasing our Core FFO projection by $0.03 per share at the midpoint, to reflect both the strength of the first quarter results and also the offsetting impact of revised transaction volume and timing.
Core FFO is now projected to be $5.71 to $5.91 per share or $5.81 at the midpoint, based on average shares and units outstanding of about $79.6 million. 
Core AFFO is projected to be $5.01 to $5.21 per share or $5.11 per share at the midpoint. You may notice in our release that we introduced one additional metric this quarter, Funds Available for Distribution or FAD, which represents Core FFO less all capital spending, including discretionary items such as, redevelopment and revenue-enhancing capital, as well as corporate and casualty loss expenditures. The intention is to show the overall strength of our earnings and cash flow. For the full year, we expect our FAD or FFO less all internal CapEx to be sufficient to cover our total annual dividend, with $90 million to $95 million remaining for investment or to build capacity for future growth. 
We are maintaining our guidance range for same-store NOI for the full year, along with the other components of previous guidance, with the one exception, our projected acquisition volume, which we now expect to be between $250 million and $350 million for the year. 
Our current plans do not include any need for new equity during 2016, and we now expect to the end the year with our leverage about 130 basis points below the 2015 year-end level.
So that's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So Lindy, we'll now turn the call over to you for questions."

Usually, you're late in the term of the construction financing. And if you're not getting the rents and/or the lease-up is not going as fast as fast as you thought it would, that's where the most pressure is created.

As outlined in yesterday's earnings release, second quarter results were ahead of expectations.
Solid rent growth, supported by occupancy that matched last year's strong results generated same-store net operating income that was ahead of our forecast. Core FFO per share of $1.49 was at the top end of our guidance with a favorable NOI performance driving the majority of the outperformance for the quarter. It's also worth noting that core AFFO was $1.25 per share for the second quarter or 16% ahead of the second quarter of last year. As a result of that better-than-expected second-quarter performance, combined with our outlook that leasing in conditions over the rest of the year will support continued solid rent growth and strong occupancy, we raised the expectation for core FFO for the full year. As discussed on our first quarter call, it's important to keep in mind that record level of occupancy that was captured in the back half of last year, particularly in the third quarter, that will serve as this year's comparative benchmark. But to be clear, we anticipate that current strong occupancy and pricing trends will continue. For the full year, we continue to believe that we will capture average physical occupancy at 96.2%, slightly ahead of last year's record performance at 96.1% while also driving solid rent growth that supports the year-over-year gains in revenue, leading to our increased expectations for same-store NOI growth.
I'll will walk you through the more detailed assumptions in these comments covering our revised and increased guidance for both same-store NOI and Core FFO.
Same-store operating metrics remain strong with resident turnover in the second quarter down 4.6% as compared to the second quarter of last year. Daily physical occupancy averaged 96.2% throughout the quarter, matching last year's strong performance. Effective rent increase -- effective rent per unit increased 4.4% over the second quarter of last year and was up 1.4% on a sequential basis with all of our markets registering both positive year-over-year and sequential rent growth with the exception of Houston, which was down slightly by 0.2%. Tom will give you some additional insights on the operating trends we're seeing, as well as outline performance differences across our markets. But overall, we are encouraged with the continued levels of growing demand that is clearly keeping pace with new supply delivery across our diversified portfolio and balance submarket strategy.
We continued to work through a very robust acquisition pipeline with deal flow running well ahead of last year. As outlined in our earnings release, we were successful in the second quarter with the acquisition of a new property and its initially lease-up in the Phoenix, Arizona MSA. This particular acquisition is a good example of the sort of opportunities we target involving a new lease up development with a local developer and motivated capital that enables both our operating and transaction execution capabilities to capture a high quality opportunity at a price that we believe will lead to future value per share. We expect to capture a stabilized NOI yield in the 6% range on this high end new property once we complete the lease up and execute and other opportunities associated with on-site operations and revenue management practices. As new supply continues to come online and a number of our markets were optimistic that additional opportunities will be captured later this year.
So in summary, we like the market trends we're seeing, and the MAA team has the operating platform executing well, the balance sheet is in terrific shape, and our transaction pipeline is very busy. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

Our second quarter NOI performance of 5.7% was driven by revenue growth of 4.4% over the prior year and 1.2% sequentially.
We have good momentum in rents as all in place effective rents increased 4.4% from the prior year. In the second quarter, new rents and renewal rents executed during the quarter and increased 5% on a blended lease-over-lease basis. We also matched the strong average occupancy of the prior year.
Overall, same-store expenses remained in line, up just 2.3%. Expense discipline has been a hallmark of our operation for years. Our industry-leading initiatives such as our vendor owned shops stocking program and our interactive marketing strategy have allowed us to keep the expense line consistently in check.
Third quarter trends continue to positive momentum. Average daily physical occupancy of 96.2% is in line with July of last year. Our 60-day exposure, which is current vacancy plus all notices for a 6 t0-day period is just 7% below over prior year about 50 basis points. New and renewal rents have built on a strong trends of the second quarter. On a blended lease-over-lease basis, our July rents increased 4.3%, and early indications are that August will increase to 5%.
On the market front, of the large markets is driving strong revenue results. They were led by Orlando, Fort Worth, Phoenix and Atlanta. The secondary markets continued to close the effective rent growth gap with the large markets. Since the third quarter of 2015, the rent growth gap between large and secondary markets has narrowed 60 basis points. Revenue growth in Jacksonville, Greeneville and Charleston stood up.
As mentioned, momentum is strong across our markets with occupancy, rent and exposure all showing positive trends. Our only market worry beat is Houston, which represents just 3.4% of our portfolio. We will contain to monitor closely and protect occupancy in this market. As we approach the end of July, our Houston markets daily occupancy is 95.2%, and 60-day exposure is just 6.6%.
Moveouts for the portfolio were down for the quarter by 4.6% on a prior year -- over the prior year, and turnover remained low at 51.5% on a rolling 12-month basis. Moveouts to home buying were down 1%. Moveouts to home rental, which represents just over 7% of our total moveouts, were down 5%. Our focus on minimizing the time between occupancy can pay off and we're able to reduce by 1 day the average vacancy between occupants, which helped drive the second quarter average physical occupancy to 96.2%.
During the quarter, we completed over 1800 interior unit upgrades bringing our total units redeveloped this year to just over 3200. We expect to redevelop over 5000 units this year.
Our redevelopment pipeline of 15,000 to 20,000 units remains robust. As a reminder, on average, we're spending 4500 per unit and receiving an average rent increase of approximately $100 overall comparable non-renovated units, generating a year 1 cash return of well over 20%.
Our lease-up communities are performing well, station square cost corner 2 closed the quarter at 99% occupancy. Cityscape at market Center 2 is leasing well. They're currently 95.6% occupied and expected to stabilize on schedule in the third quarter of this year.

I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's second quarter earnings performance and balance sheet and then finally on revised earnings guidance for the full year.Core FFO for the quarter was $1.49",736,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's second quarter earnings performance and balance sheet and then finally on revised earnings guidance for the full year.
Core FFO for the quarter was $1.49 per share, which represents a 10% increase over the prior year. Deployments was $0.05 per share, above the midpoint of our previous guidance. About 2/3 or $0.03 per share of this outperformance was related to favorable property operating results primarily due to operating expenses as both personnel and marketing costs were better than expected for the quarter. The remaining $0.02 per share was primarily related to gains on cash income claim -- insurance claims sold during in the quarter as shown in the core income statement. Strong rental pricing and continued high occupancy levels carried through the quarter as expected, supporting earnings performance.
As Eric mentioned, we acquired 1 new community during the second quarter, residence at Fountainhead located in Phoenix for total investment of $69.5 million. The committee was in lease up an acquirer and was 75.8% occupied at quarter end. And as Tom mentioned, lease-up continues to progress well, and expected community to complete its initial lease up early next year.
During the second quarter, we sold 3 parcels of commercial land and remaining commercial property originally acquired in the colonial merger for total proceeds of about $4.5 million, producing a small gains on sale of non-appreciable and appreciable reflected on the income statement for the quarter. We had 4 communities, all Phase 2 expenses of current properties remaining under the construction at the end of the quarter. We funded $16.1 million to our completion during the second quarter, and we have an additional $48 million on the $97 million total projected cost remaining to be funded.
We continue to expect stabilizing NOI deals of 7% to 7.5% on average to these committees once competed and stabilized. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. At quarter end, our leverage defined as net debt to gross assets was 40.7%, 70 basis points below the prior year. While our net debt was only 5.7x recurring EBITDA.
Our quarter end, 92% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates at an average effective interest rate of only 3.8% with well maturities averaging 4.7 years. At quarter end, we had almost $600 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity under our unsecured credit facility, providing both strength and flexibility for growth. And given our current expectations for acquisitions and dispositions over the remainder of the year, along with our projections for excess cash of $90 million to $95 million, representing FAD less all dividends, we do not expect new equity this year, and we expect to end this year with our leverage slightly below current levels.
Finally, as Eric mentioned, we are again increasing our earnings guidance for 2016 due to stronger-than-projected performance. We are increasing our core FFO projection by $0.04 per share at the midpoint, reflect both the $0.05 per share second quarter of performance and our revised expectations for real estate taxes for the year now expect to the causes of additional [indiscernible] per share of the remainder of the year as valuations, mainly in Texas, came in higher than expected.
Our forecast generally continues to be based on current strong occupancy levels carrying through the year, with toughest comps in the third quarter, combined with the pricing performance continuing in the 4%, 4.5% range. Core FFO is now projected to be 5 77 to 5 93 per share or 5 85 at the midpoint based on average shares outstanding of 79.6 million.
Core AFFO is now projected to be 5 07 to 5 23 per share or 5 15 at the midpoint, which produces the strong 64% AFFO payout ratio for the year. We also increased our same-store NOI guidance to an expected range of 4.75% to 5.25% for the full year this and I revenue growth, increased range to 4% to 4.5% and lower operating expense growth, decrease range to 2.5% to 3.5%, which includes impact to the higher tax is now projected to grow 5.5% to 6.5% compared to the prior year.
The other major components including transaction and financing assumptions remain similar to our previous guidance. So that's all we have in the way prepared comments. So, Leo, we'll turn the call back over to you for questions."

So I think, I mean, they are really more for that purpose, for sort of severe economic or economic downturn conditions. I think that what you're going to see is that as we have continued to cycle capital out of some of the older investments that we've had, as you point out, a lot given the sort of base, origination of the company and where we sort of came from, a lot of the asset happen to be in some of the more tertiary markets of the portfolio, and that's we cycled a lot of exited close to 20 properties over the last several years, selling over 13,000 apartments. I think as we go forward, you'll see us continue with a primary focus on cycling out of some of the older assets where the CapEx requirements are growing and the after CapEx NOI is likely to show more moderation, and that will continue to, as an example, the 7 properties that we have under contract right now, 3 of them are North Carolina, one of them is in Greensboro, one of them is in Huntsville, and so I think that -- but having said that, you'll see us continue to look at opportunities in places like Charleston, Kansas City, Fredericksburg, clearly other secondary markets but we think and new assets we think the return on capital will be better over the next several years versus what we're selling."

As outlined in yesterday's earnings release, second quarter results were ahead of expectations.
Solid rent growth, supported by occupancy that matched last year's strong results, generated same-store net operating income that was ahead of our forecast. Core FFO per share of $1.49 was at the top end of our guidance with a favorable NOI performance driving the majority of the outperformance for the quarter. It's also worth noting that core AFFO was $1.25 per share for the second quarter or 16% ahead of the second quarter of last year. 
As a result of that better-than-expected second quarter performance, combined with our outlook that leasing conditions over the rest of the year will support continued solid rent growth and strong occupancy, we raised the expectation for core FFO for the full year. As discussed on our first quarter call, it's important to keep in mind that record level of occupancy that was captured in the back half of last year, particularly in the third quarter -- that will serve as this year's comparative benchmark. But to be clear, we anticipate that current strong occupancy and pricing trends will continue. 
For the full year, we continue to believe that we will capture average physical occupancy at 96.2%, slightly ahead of last year's record performance at 96.1% while also driving solid rent growth that supports the year-over-year gains in revenue, leading to our increased expectations for same-store NOI growth. Al will walk you through the more-detailed assumptions in his comments covering our revised and increased guidance for both same-store NOI and core FFO.
Same-store operating metrics remain strong with resident turnover in the second quarter down 4.6% as compared to the second quarter of last year. Daily physical occupancy averaged 96.2% throughout the quarter, matching last year's strong performance. Effective rent increase -- effective rent per unit increased 4.4% over the second quarter of last year and was up 1.4% on a sequential basis with all of our markets registering both positive year-over-year and sequential rent growth with the exception of Houston, which was down slightly by 0.2%. 
Tom will give you some additional insights on the operating trends we're seeing as well as outline performance differences across our markets, but overall, we are encouraged with the continued levels of growing demand that is clearly keeping pace with new supply delivery across our diversified portfolio and balance submarket strategy.
We continued to work through a very robust acquisition pipeline with deal flow running well ahead of last year. As outlined in our earnings release, we were successful in the second quarter with the acquisition of a new property and its initial lease-up in the Phoenix, Arizona, MSA. This particular acquisition is a good example of the sort of opportunities we target involving a new lease-up development with a local developer and motivated capital that enables both our operating and transaction execution capabilities to capture a high-quality opportunity at a price that we believe will add to future value per share. 
We expect to capture a stabilized NOI yield in the 6% range on this high-end new property once we complete the lease-up and execute on the other opportunities associated with on-site operations and revenue management practices. As new supply continues to come online in a number of our markets, we're optimistic that additional opportunities will be captured later this year.
So in summary, we like the market trends we're seeing, and the MAA team has the operating platform executing well. The balance sheet is in terrific shape. And our transaction pipeline is very busy. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

Our second quarter NOI performance of 5.7% was driven by revenue growth of 4.4% over the prior year and 1.2% sequentially.
We have good momentum in rents as all in-place effective rents increased 4.4% from the prior year. In the second quarter, new rents and renewal rents executed during the quarter increased 5% on a blended lease-over-lease basis. We also matched the strong average occupancy of the prior year.
Overall, same-store expenses remained in line, up just 2.3%. Expense discipline has been a hallmark of our operation for years. Our industry-leading initiatives, such as our vendor-owned shop-stocking program and our interactive marketing strategy have allowed us to keep the expense line consistently in check.
Third quarter trends continue the positive momentum. Average daily physical occupancy of 96.2% is in line with July of last year. Our 60-day exposure, which is current vacancy plus all notices for a 60-day period, is just 7% below our prior year by 50 basis points. New and renewal rents have built on the strong trends of the second quarter. On a blended lease-over-lease basis, our July rents increased 4.3%, and early indications are that August will increase to 5%.
On the market front, market [ph] job growth of the large markets is driving strong revenue results. They were led by Orlando, Fort Worth, Phoenix and Atlanta. The secondary markets continued to close the effective rent growth gap with the large markets. Since the third quarter of 2015, the rent growth gap between large and secondary markets has narrowed 60 basis points. Revenue growth in Jacksonville, Greeneville and Charleston stood up.
As mentioned, momentum is strong across our markets with occupancy, rent and exposure all showing positive trends. Our only market worry beat [ph] is Houston, which represents just 3.4% of our portfolio. We will continue to monitor closely and protect occupancy in this market. As we approach the end of July, our Houston market's daily occupancy is 95.2%, and 60-day exposure is just 6.6%.
Moveouts for the portfolio were down for the quarter by 4.6% on a prior -- over the prior year, and turnover remained low at 51.5% on a rolling 12-month basis. Moveouts to home buying were down 1%. Moveouts to home rental, which represents just over 7% of our total moveouts, were down 5%. Our focus on minimizing the time between occupants again paid off, and we were able to reduce by 1 day the average vacancy between occupants, which helped drive the second quarter average physical occupancy to 96.2%.
During the quarter, we completed over 1,800 interior unit upgrades, bringing our total units redeveloped this year to just over 3,200. We expect to redevelop over 5,000 units this year. Our redevelopment pipeline of 15,000 to 20,000 units remains robust. 
As a reminder, on average, we're spending $4,500 per unit and receiving an average rent increase of approximately $100 over our comparable nonrenovated units, generating a year 1 cash return of well over 20%.
Our lease-up communities are performing well. Station Square at Cosner's Corner II closed the quarter at 99% occupancy. Cityscape at Market center II is leasing well. They're currently 95.6% occupied and expected to stabilize on schedule in the third quarter of this year. River's Walk II in Charleston is 71% leased, and Colonial Grand at Randal Lakes in Orlando is 18% leased. Both are on schedule.
Our second quarter acquisition, Residences at Fountainhead in Phoenix, Arizona, is currently 78% occupied. At the midpoint of our summer season, we are on track and the portfolio is performing very well. Al?"

I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's second quarter earnings performance and balance sheet activity and then finally on the revised earnings guidance for the full year.
Core FFO for the quarter was $1.49 per share, which represents a 10% increase over the prior year. The performance was $0.05 per share above the midpoint of our previous guidance. About 2/3 or $0.03 per share of this outperformance was related to favorable property operating results primarily due to operating expenses as both personnel and marketing costs were better than expected for the quarter. 
The remaining $0.02 per share was primarily related to gains on casualty income claim -- insurance claims sold during the quarter as shown in the core income statement. Strong rental pricing and continued high occupancy levels carried through the quarter as expected, supporting earnings performance.
As Eric mentioned, we acquired 1 new community during the second quarter, Residences at Fountainhead located in Phoenix, for a total investment of $69.5 million. The community was at lease-up on acquire and was 75.8% occupied at quarter-end. And as Tom mentioned, lease-up continues to progress well, and we expect the community to complete its initial lease-up early next year.
During the second quarter, we sold 3 parcels of commercial land at a remaining commercial JV property originally acquired in the Colonial merger for total proceeds of about $4.5 million, producing a small gains on sale of nondepreciable and depreciable assets reflected on the income statement for the quarter. 
We had 4 communities, all Phase II expansions of current properties, remaining under construction at the end of the quarter. We funded $16.1 million toward completion during the second quarter, and we have an additional $48 million on the $97 million total projected cost remaining to be funded.
We continue to expect stabilizing NOI deals of 7% to 7.5% on average for these communities once completed and stabilized. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. At quarter-end, our leverage defined as net debt to gross assets was 40.7%, 70 basis points below the prior year, while our net debt was only 5.7x recurring EBITDA.
At quarter-end, 92% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates at an average effective interest rate of only 3.8% with well latter [ph] maturities averaging 4.7 years. At quarter-end, we had almost $600 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity under our unsecured credit facility, providing both strength and flexibility for growth. And given our current expectations for acquisitions and dispositions over the remainder of the year, along with our projections for excess cash of $90 million to $95 million, representing FAD less all dividends, we do not expect new equity this year, and we expect to end this year with our leverage slightly below current levels.
Finally, as Eric mentioned, we are again increasing our earnings guidance for 2016 due to stronger-than-projected performance. We're increasing our core FFO projection by $0.04 per share at the midpoint to reflect both the $0.05 per share second quarter outperformance and our revised expectations for real estate taxes for the year, now expected to cost us an additional $0.01 per share over the remainder of the year as valuations, mainly in Texas, came in a bit higher than expected.
Our forecast generally continues to be based on current strong occupancy levels carrying through the year with toughest comps in the third quarter combined with the pricing performance continuing in the 4% to 4.5% range. Core FFO is now projected to be $5.77 to $5.93 per share or $5.85 at the midpoint based on average shares and units outstanding of 79.6 million.
Core AFFO is now projected to be $5.07 to $5.23 per share or $5.15 at the midpoint, which produces the strong 64% AFFO payout ratio for the year. We also increased our same-store NOI guidance to an expected range of 4.75% to 5.25% for the full year based on higher revenue growth, increased range to 4% to 4.5% and lower operating expense growth, decreased range to 2.5% to 3.5%, which includes impact of the higher real estate taxes now projected to grow 5.5% to 6.5% compared to the prior year.
The other major components, including transaction and financing assumptions, remain similar to our previous guidance. So that's all we have in the way of prepared comments. So, Leo, we'll turn the call back over to you for questions."

So I think -- I mean, they're there really more for that purpose, for sort of severe economic or economic downturn conditions. I think that what you're going to see is that, as we have continued to cycle capital out of some of the older investments that we've had, as you point out, a lot given the sort of base origination of the company and where we sort of came from, a lot of the older assets happen to be in some of the more tertiary markets of the portfolio, and that's where we cycled out a lot of -- we exited close to 20 properties over the last several years, selling over 13,000 apartments. I think as we go forward, you'll see us continue with a primary focus on cycling out of some of the older assets where the CapEx requirements are growing and the after CapEx NOI is likely to show more moderation, and that will continue to, as an example, the 7 properties that we have under contract right now, 3 of them are Winston-Salem, North Carolina. One of them is in Greensboro. One of them is in Huntsville.

I mean, fundamentally, the demand dynamics, job growth, population trends, all the other sort of factors that drive renters and leasing prospects to our properties, all those fundamentals continue to show evidence of sustained strength and consistent with what we've been seeing for some time.

But 2 things that I would tell you is that, obviously, a lot of the supply that we are seeing in some of our markets, it's tending to be more concentrated in some of the more urban core center areas, which happens to be where we don't have a lot of exposure. And so we don't see anything suggesting that anything different is likely to play out in the near term. So we continue to feel okay about that. I mean, we've been saying that supply has picked up over the last couple years, so I mean we're not -- it's not like it's a new thing. I mean, it's just, it happens to be in areas that we don't have a lot of concentration in. But I would tell you, if you're trying to get at what's going to change the chemistry, what's going to change the dynamic, leasing dynamic in a material way and put us into a scenario where we're having the same kind of pressures that some of these portfolios in San Francisco and New York are having, from my perspective, the only thing that really materially weakens the chemistry for us is that we see a material weakening on the demand side of the equation. We see some sort of economic recession take place in a material way that causes job loss to come back into the equation and jobs to really start to pull back. And absent some sort of major disruption on the demand side of the equation, right now, it's hard to see anything that's going to cause a material disruption in the positive leasing chemistry that continues to allow us to deliver, we think, pretty above long-term trend performance. It's moderated from what it was a couple years ago as a consequence really of a little supply but, honestly, just tougher comps. And that's been -- that's where the pressure has been, but the strong trends, per se, are going to continue from what we see today."

We did get majority of our valuations come out in the second quarter, which is typical. Beginning of the year, you're sort of guessing on that just based on trends, and so it came out a little higher than we thought, particularly in Texas, as valuations. Dallas and Houston didn't soften like we had thought -- hoped it would -- any. So I think that's where the only pressure on expense is, so we raised our guidance 1% at the midpoint. On real estate tax guidance, now we think it'll grow 5.5% to 6.5%. That's 1/3 of your operating expenses. But even with that, we reduced -- were able to reduce the midpoint of our expense expectations for the year about 25 basis points. So summary of all that is now we expect to be well under control."

As outlined in yesterday's earnings release, second quarter results were ahead of expectations.
Solid rent growth, supported by occupancy that matched last year's strong results, generated same-store net operating income that was ahead of our forecast. Core FFO per share of $1.49 was at the top end of our guidance, with a favorable NOI performance driving the majority of the outperformance for the quarter. It's also worth noting that core AFFO was $1.25 per share for the second quarter, or 16% ahead of the second quarter of last year. 
As a result of the better-than-expected second quarter performance, combined with our outlook that leasing conditions over the rest of the year will support continued solid rent growth and strong occupancy, we raised the expectation for core FFO for the full year. As discussed on our first quarter call, it's important to keep in mind the record level of occupancy that was captured in the back half of last year, particularly in the third quarter, that will serve as this year's comparative benchmark. But to be clear, we anticipate that current strong occupancy and pricing trends will continue. 
For the full year, we continue to believe that we will capture average physical occupancy at 96.2%, slightly ahead of last year's record performance at 96.1%, while also driving solid rent growth that supports the year-over-year gains in revenue, leading to our increased expectations for same-store NOI growth. Al will walk you through the more detailed assumptions in his comments, covering our revised and increased guidance for both same-store NOI and core FFO.
Same-store operating metrics remain strong, with resident turnover in the second quarter down 4.6% as compared to the second quarter of last year. Daily physical occupancy averaged 96.2% throughout the quarter, matching last year's strong performance. Effective rent increase -- effective rent per unit increased 4.4% over the second quarter of last year and was up 1.4% on a sequential basis, with all of our markets registering both positive year-over-year and sequential rent growth, with the exception of Houston, which was down slightly by 0.2%. 
Tom will give you some additional insights on the operating trends we're seeing as well as outline performance differences across our markets, but overall, we are encouraged with the continued levels of growing demand that is clearly keeping pace with new supply delivery across our diversified portfolio and balanced submarket strategy.
We continue to work through a very robust acquisition pipeline, with deal flow running well ahead of last year. As outlined in our earnings release, we were successful in the second quarter with the acquisition of a new property and its initial lease-up in the Phoenix, Arizona, MSA. This particular acquisition is a good example of the sort of opportunities we target involving a new lease-up development with a local developer and motivated capital that enables both our operating and transaction execution capabilities to capture a high-quality opportunity at a price that we believe will add to future value per share. 
We expect to capture a stabilized NOI yield in the 6% range on this high-end new property once we complete the lease-up and execute on the other opportunities associated with on-site operations and revenue management practices. As new supply continues to come online in a number of our markets, we're optimistic that additional opportunities will be captured later this year.
So in summary, we like the market trends we're seeing, and the MAA team has the operating platform executing well. The balance sheet is in terrific shape. And our transaction pipeline is very busy. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom."
332358,369177993,1019577,"Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone.

Our second quarter NOI performance of 5.7% was driven by revenue growth of 4.4% over the prior year and 1.2% sequentially.
We have good momentum in rents, as all in-place effective rents increased 4.4% from the prior year. In the second quarter, new rents and renewal rents executed during the quarter increased 5% on a blended lease-over-lease basis. We also matched the strong average occupancy of the prior year.
Overall, same-store expenses remained in line, up just 2.3%. Expense discipline has been a hallmark of our operation for years. Our industry-leading initiatives, such as our vendor-owned shop-stocking program and our interactive marketing strategy, have allowed us to keep the expense line consistently in check.
Third quarter trends continue the positive momentum. Average daily physical occupancy of 96.2% is in line with July of last year. Our 60-day exposure, which is current vacancy plus all notices for a 60-day period, is just 7%, below our prior year by 50 basis points. New and renewal rents have built on the strong trends of the second quarter. On a blended lease-over-lease basis, our July rents increased 4.3%, and early indications are that August will increase to 5%.
On the market front, vibrant job growth in the large markets is driving strong revenue results. They were led by Orlando, Fort Worth, Phoenix and Atlanta. The secondary markets continued to close the effective rent growth gap with the large markets. Since the third quarter of 2015, the rent growth gap between large and secondary markets has narrowed 60 basis points. Revenue growth in Jacksonville, Greenville and Charleston stood out.
As mentioned, momentum is strong across our markets, with occupancy, rent and exposure all showing positive trends. Our only market worry bead is Houston, which represents just 3.4% of our portfolio. We will continue to monitor closely and protect occupancy in this market. As we approach the end of July, our Houston market's daily occupancy is 95.2%, and 60-day exposure is just 6.6%.
Moveouts for the portfolio were down for the quarter by 4.6% on a prior -- over the prior year, and turnover remained low at 51.5% on a rolling 12-month basis. Moveouts to home buying were down 1%. Moveouts to home rental, which represents just over 7% of our total moveouts, were down 5%. Our focus on minimizing the time between occupancy again paid off, and we were able to reduce by 1 day the average vacancy between occupants, which helped drive the second quarter average physical occupancy to 96.2%.
During the quarter, we completed over 1,800 interior unit upgrades, bringing our total units redeveloped this year to just over 3,200. We expect to redevelop over 5,000 units this year. Our redevelopment pipeline of 15,000 to 20,000 units remains robust. 
As a reminder, on average, we're spending $4,500 per unit and receiving an average rent increase of approximately $100 over a comparable non-renovated unit, generating a year 1 cash return of well over 20%.
Our lease-up communities are performing well. Station Square at Cosner's Corner II closed the quarter at 99% occupancy. Cityscape at Market Center II is leasing well. They're currently 95.6% occupied and expected to stabilize on schedule in the third quarter of this year. River's Walk II in Charleston is 71% leased, and Colonial Grand at Randal Lakes in Orlando is 18% leased. Both are on schedule.
Our second quarter acquisition, Residences at Fountainhead in Phoenix, Arizona, is currently 78% occupied. At the midpoint of our summer season, we are on track and the portfolio is performing very well. Al?"

I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's second quarter earnings performance and balance sheet activity and then finally, on the revised earnings guidance for the full year.
Core FFO for the quarter was $1.49 per share, which represents a 10% increase over the prior year. The performance was $0.05 per share above the midpoint of our previous guidance. About 2/3 or $0.03 per share of this outperformance was related to favorable property operating results, primarily due to operating expenses, as both personnel and marketing costs were better than expected for the quarter. 
The remaining $0.02 per share was primarily related to gains on casualty income claim -- insurance claims sold during the quarter, as shown in the reported income statement. Strong rental pricing and continued high occupancy levels carried through the quarter as expected, supporting earnings performance.
As Eric mentioned, we acquired 1 new community during the second quarter, Residences at Fountainhead located in Phoenix, for a total investment of $69.5 million. The community was in lease-up on acquire and was 75.8% occupied at quarter end. And as Tom mentioned, lease-up continues to progress well, and we expect the community to complete its initial lease-up early next year.
During the second quarter, we sold 3 parcels of commercial land and a remaining commercial JV property originally acquired in the Colonial merger, for total proceeds of about $4.5 million, producing a small gains on sale of non-depreciable and depreciable assets reflected on the income statement for the quarter. 
We had 4 communities, all Phase II expansions of current properties, remaining under construction at the end of the quarter. We funded $16.1 million toward completion during the second quarter, and we have an additional $48 million on the $97 million total projected cost remaining to be funded.
We continue to expect stabilizing NOI deals of 7% to 7.5% on average for these communities once completed and stabilized. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. At quarter end, our leverage, defined as net debt to gross assets, was 40.7%, 70 basis points below the prior year, while our net debt was only 5.7x recurring EBITDA.
At quarter end, 92% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates at an average effective interest rate of only 3.8%, with well-laddered maturities averaging 4.7 years. At quarter end, we had almost $600 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity under our unsecured credit facility, providing both strength and flexibility for growth. And given our current expectations for acquisitions and dispositions over the remainder of the year, along with our projections for excess cash of $90 million to $95 million, representing FAD less all dividends, we do not expect new equity this year, and we expect to end this year with our leverage slightly below current levels.
Finally, as Eric mentioned, we are again increasing our earnings guidance for 2016 due to the stronger-than-projected performance. We're increasing our core FFO projection by $0.04 per share at the midpoint to reflect both the $0.05 per share second quarter outperformance and our revised expectations for real estate taxes for the year, now expected to cost us an additional $0.01 per share over the remainder of the year, as valuations, mainly in Texas, came in a bit higher than expected.
Our forecast generally continues to be based on current strong occupancy levels carrying through the year, with the toughest comps in the third quarter, combined with the pricing performance continuing in the 4% to 4.5% range. Core FFO is now projected to be $5.77 to $5.93 per share or $5.85 at the midpoint based on average shares and units outstanding of 79.6 million.
Core AFFO is now projected to be $5.07 to $5.23 per share or $5.15 at the midpoint, which produces a strong 64% AFFO payout ratio for the year. We also increased our same-store NOI guidance to an expected range of 4.75% to 5.25% for the full year based on higher revenue growth increased the range to 4% to 4.5%, and lower operating expense growth decreased the range to 2.5% to 3.5%, which includes impact of the higher real estate taxes, now projected to grow 5.5% to 6.5% compared to the prior year.
The other major components, including transaction and financing assumptions, remain similar to our previous guidance. So that's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Leo, we'll turn the call back over to you for questions."

But it is largely -- we'll have a property that has a little bit of pressure from a single asset going up across the street and then it will abate. And honestly, we've seen sort of similar things in Dallas as well. But I think overall, the front-of-line [ph] situation of strong job growth is continuing, and it's allowing us to work through those deliveries."

An asset that's 10 years old and they build right next to it the latest and greatest and charge $500 more, we can pop out the nice formica countertops and put in granite and charge $200 or something like that. It gives us an opportunity to grow that program."

We saw the employment markets really take a beating. In those kind of environments, a recessionary environment where job loss is really driving sort of the economic landscape, that tends to be where the secondary markets hold up a lot better, and you can actually get to a point where the secondary markets are outperforming the large markets, both in terms of occupancy and our ability to hold rents. So I think -- I mean, they're there really more for that purpose, for sort of severe economic or economic downturn conditions. I think that what you're going to see is that as we have continued to cycle capital out of some of the older investments that we've had, as you point out, a lot given the sort of base origination of the company and where we sort of came from, a lot of the older assets happen to be in some of the more tertiary markets of the portfolio, and that's where we cycled out a lot of. We exited close to 20 properties over the last several years, selling over 13,000 apartments. I think as we go forward, you'll see us continue with a primary focus on cycling out of some of the older assets where the CapEx requirements are growing and the after CapEx NOI is likely to show more moderation, and that will continue to, as an example, the 7 properties that we have under contract right now, 3 of them are in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. One of them is in Greensboro. One of them is in Huntsville. And so I think that -- but, having said that, you'll see us continue to look at opportunities in places like Charleston, Kansas City, Fredericksburg, clearly, other secondary markets, but we think -- and newer assets where we think the return on capital will be better over the next several years versus what we're selling."

But I would tell you, if you're trying to get at what's going to change the chemistry, what's going to change the dynamic, leasing dynamic in a material way and put us into a scenario where we're having the same kind of pressures that some of these portfolios in San Francisco and New York are having, from my perspective, the only thing that really materially weakens the chemistry for us is that we see a material weakening on the demand side of the equation. We see some sort of economic recession take place in a material way that causes job loss to come back into the equation and jobs to really start to pull back. And absent some sort of major disruption on the demand side of the equation, right now, it's hard to see anything that's going to cause a material disruption in the positive leasing chemistry that continues to allow us to deliver, we think, pretty above long-term trend performance. It's moderated from what it was a couple years ago as a consequence, really, of a little supply, but honestly, just tougher comps.

So I think that's where the only pressure on expenses is, so we raised our guidance 1% at the midpoint on real estate tax guidance. Now we think it'll grow 5.5% to 6.5%.

So in other words, whatever premium we got to market when we initially did the deal, we track it to make sure that, that premium stays in place over the life of the investment that we make, and there's -- we have classifications on -- by unit, where we can charge premiums for views. We can charge premiums for this upgrade. We can charge premiums for whatever -- we got a lot of different premium levers in. When we throw those levers, they stay there.

And as a consequence of that, they're just more inclined to want to rent their housing as opposed to making the obligations surrounding buying a home. And it's hard for me to see how that's going to materially change. I think people are more motivated to make a decision to buy versus rent for lifestyle reasons.

As outlined in yesterday's earnings release, second quarter results were ahead of expectations.
Solid rent growth, supported by occupancy that matched last year's strong results, generated same-store net operating income that was ahead of our forecast. Core FFO per share of $1.49 was at the top end of our guidance, with a favorable NOI performance driving the majority of the outperformance for the quarter. It's also worth noting that core AFFO was $1.25 per share for the second quarter, or 16% ahead of the second quarter of last year. 
As a result of the better-than-expected second quarter performance, combined with our outlook that leasing conditions over the rest of the year will support continued solid rent growth and strong occupancy, we raised the expectation for core FFO for the full year. As discussed on our first quarter call, it's important to keep in mind the record level of occupancy that was captured in the back half of last year, particularly in the third quarter, that will serve as this year's comparative benchmark. But to be clear, we anticipate that current strong occupancy and pricing trends will continue. 
For the full year, we continue to believe that we will capture average physical occupancy at 96.2%, slightly ahead of last year's record performance at 96.1%, while also driving solid rent growth that supports the year-over-year gains in revenue, leading to our increased expectations for same-store NOI growth. Al will walk you through the more detailed assumptions in his comments, covering our revised and increased guidance for both same-store NOI and core FFO.
Same-store operating metrics remain strong, with resident turnover in the second quarter down 4.6% as compared to the second quarter of last year. Daily physical occupancy averaged 96.2% throughout the quarter, matching last year's strong performance. Effective rent increase -- effective rent per unit increased 4.4% over the second quarter of last year and was up 1.4% on a sequential basis, with all of our markets registering both positive year-over-year and sequential rent growth, with the exception of Houston, which was down slightly by 0.2%. 
Tom will give you some additional insights on the operating trends we're seeing as well as outline performance differences across our markets, but overall, we are encouraged with the continued levels of growing demand that is clearly keeping pace with new supply delivery across our diversified portfolio and balanced submarket strategy.
We continue to work through a very robust acquisition pipeline, with deal flow running well ahead of last year. As outlined in our earnings release, we were successful in the second quarter with the acquisition of a new property and its initial lease-up in the Phoenix, Arizona, MSA. This particular acquisition is a good example of the sort of opportunities we target involving a new lease-up development with a local developer and motivated capital that enables both our operating and transaction execution capabilities to capture a high-quality opportunity at a price that we believe will add to future value per share. 
We expect to capture a stabilized NOI yield in the 6% range on this high-end new property once we complete the lease-up and execute on the other opportunities associated with on-site operations and revenue management practices. As new supply continues to come online in a number of our markets, we're optimistic that additional opportunities will be captured later this year.
So in summary, we like the market trends we're seeing, and the MAA team has the operating platform executing well. The balance sheet is in terrific shape. And our transaction pipeline is very busy. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Tom."
332358,369177993,1019906,"Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter NOI performance of 5.7% was driven by revenue growth of 4.4% over the prior year and 1.2% sequentially.We have good momentum in rents, as all in-place effective rents increased 4.4% from th",596,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter NOI performance of 5.7% was driven by revenue growth of 4.4% over the prior year and 1.2% sequentially.
We have good momentum in rents, as all in-place effective rents increased 4.4% from the prior year. In the second quarter, new rents and renewal rents executed during the quarter increased 5% on a blended lease-over-lease basis. We also matched the strong average occupancy of the prior year.
Overall, same-store expenses remained in line, up just 2.3%. Expense discipline has been a hallmark of our operation for years. Our industry-leading initiatives, such as our vendor-owned shop-stocking program and our interactive marketing strategy, have allowed us to keep the expense line consistently in check.
Third quarter trends continue the positive momentum. Average daily physical occupancy of 96.2% is in line with July of last year. Our 60-day exposure, which is current vacancy plus all notices for a 60-day period, is just 7%, below our prior year by 50 basis points. New and renewal rents have built on the strong trends of the second quarter. On a blended lease-over-lease basis, our July rents increased 4.3%, and early indications are that August will increase to 5%.
On the market front, vibrant job growth in the large markets is driving strong revenue results. They were led by Orlando, Fort Worth, Phoenix and Atlanta. The secondary markets continued to close the effective rent growth gap with the large markets. Since the third quarter of 2015, the rent growth gap between large and secondary markets has narrowed 60 basis points. Revenue growth in Jacksonville, Greenville and Charleston stood out.
As mentioned, momentum is strong across our markets, with occupancy, rent and exposure all showing positive trends. Our only market worry bead is Houston, which represents just 3.4% of our portfolio. We will continue to monitor closely and protect occupancy in this market. As we approach the end of July, our Houston market's daily occupancy is 95.2%, and 60-day exposure is just 6.6%.
Moveouts for the portfolio were down for the quarter by 4.6% on a prior -- over the prior year, and turnover remained low at 51.5% on a rolling 12-month basis. Moveouts to home buying were down 1%. Moveouts to home rental, which represents just over 7% of our total moveouts, were down 5%. Our focus on minimizing the time between occupancy again paid off, and we were able to reduce by 1 day the average vacancy between occupants, which helped drive the second quarter average physical occupancy to 96.2%.
During the quarter, we completed over 1,800 interior unit upgrades, bringing our total units redeveloped this year to just over 3,200. We expect to redevelop over 5,000 units this year. Our redevelopment pipeline of 15,000 to 20,000 units remains robust. 
As a reminder, on average, we're spending $4,500 per unit and receiving an average rent increase of approximately $100 over a comparable non-renovated unit, generating a year 1 cash return of well over 20%.
Our lease-up communities are performing well. Station Square at Cosner's Corner II closed the quarter at 99% occupancy. Cityscape at Market Center II is leasing well. They're currently 95.6% occupied and expected to stabilize on schedule in the third quarter of this year. River's Walk II in Charleston is 71% leased, and Colonial Grand at Randal Lakes in Orlando is 18% leased. Both are on schedule.
Our second quarter acquisition, Residences at Fountainhead in Phoenix, Arizona, is currently 78% occupied. At the midpoint of our summer season, we are on track and the portfolio is performing very well. Al?"

I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's second quarter earnings performance and balance sheet activity and then finally, on the revised earnings guidance for the full year.Core FFO for the qua",745,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's second quarter earnings performance and balance sheet activity and then finally, on the revised earnings guidance for the full year.
Core FFO for the quarter was $1.49 per share, which represents a 10% increase over the prior year. The performance was $0.05 per share above the midpoint of our previous guidance. About 2/3 or $0.03 per share of this outperformance was related to favorable property operating results, primarily due to operating expenses, as both personnel and marketing costs were better than expected for the quarter. 
The remaining $0.02 per share was primarily related to gains on casualty income claim -- insurance claims sold during the quarter, as shown in the reported income statement. Strong rental pricing and continued high occupancy levels carried through the quarter as expected, supporting earnings performance.
As Eric mentioned, we acquired 1 new community during the second quarter, Residences at Fountainhead located in Phoenix, for a total investment of $69.5 million. The community was in lease-up on acquire and was 75.8% occupied at quarter end. And as Tom mentioned, lease-up continues to progress well, and we expect the community to complete its initial lease-up early next year.
During the second quarter, we sold 3 parcels of commercial land and a remaining commercial JV property originally acquired in the Colonial merger, for total proceeds of about $4.5 million, producing a small gains on sale of non-depreciable and depreciable assets reflected on the income statement for the quarter. 
We had 4 communities, all Phase II expansions of current properties, remaining under construction at the end of the quarter. We funded $16.1 million toward completion during the second quarter, and we have an additional $48 million on the $97 million total projected cost remaining to be funded.
We continue to expect stabilizing NOI deals of 7% to 7.5% on average for these communities once completed and stabilized. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. At quarter end, our leverage, defined as net debt to gross assets, was 40.7%, 70 basis points below the prior year, while our net debt was only 5.7x recurring EBITDA.
At quarter end, 92% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates at an average effective interest rate of only 3.8%, with well-laddered maturities averaging 4.7 years. At quarter end, we had almost $600 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity under our unsecured credit facility, providing both strength and flexibility for growth. And given our current expectations for acquisitions and dispositions over the remainder of the year, along with our projections for excess cash of $90 million to $95 million, representing FAD less all dividends, we do not expect new equity this year, and we expect to end this year with our leverage slightly below current levels.
Finally, as Eric mentioned, we are again increasing our earnings guidance for 2016 due to the stronger-than-projected performance. We're increasing our core FFO projection by $0.04 per share at the midpoint to reflect both the $0.05 per share second quarter outperformance and our revised expectations for real estate taxes for the year, now expected to cost us an additional $0.01 per share over the remainder of the year, as valuations, mainly in Texas, came in a bit higher than expected.
Our forecast generally continues to be based on current strong occupancy levels carrying through the year, with the toughest comps in the third quarter, combined with the pricing performance continuing in the 4% to 4.5% range. Core FFO is now projected to be $5.77 to $5.93 per share or $5.85 at the midpoint based on average shares and units outstanding of 79.6 million.
Core AFFO is now projected to be $5.07 to $5.23 per share or $5.15 at the midpoint, which produces a strong 64% AFFO payout ratio for the year. We also increased our same-store NOI guidance to an expected range of 4.75% to 5.25% for the full year based on higher revenue growth increased the range to 4% to 4.5%, and lower operating expense growth decreased the range to 2.5% to 3.5%, which includes impact of the higher real estate taxes, now projected to grow 5.5% to 6.5% compared to the prior year.
The other major components, including transaction and financing assumptions, remain similar to our previous guidance. So that's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Leo, we'll turn the call back over to you for questions."

We saw the employment markets really take a beating. In those kind of environments, a recessionary environment where job loss is really driving sort of the economic landscape, that tends to be where the secondary markets hold up a lot better, and you can actually get to a point where the secondary markets are outperforming the large markets, both in terms of occupancy and our ability to hold rents. So I think -- I mean, they're there really more for that purpose, for sort of severe economic or economic downturn conditions. I think that what you're going to see is that as we have continued to cycle capital out of some of the older investments that we've had, as you point out, a lot given the sort of base origination of the company and where we sort of came from, a lot of the older assets happen to be in some of the more tertiary markets of the portfolio, and that's where we cycled out a lot of. We exited close to 20 properties over the last several years, selling over 13,000 apartments. I think as we go forward, you'll see us continue with a primary focus on cycling out of some of the older assets where the CapEx requirements are growing and the after CapEx NOI is likely to show more moderation, and that will continue to, as an example, the 7 properties that we have under contract right now, 3 of them are in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. One of them is in Greensboro. One of them is in Huntsville. And so I think that -- but, having said that, you'll see us continue to look at opportunities in places like Charleston, Kansas City, Fredericksburg, clearly, other secondary markets, but we think -- and newer assets where we think the return on capital will be better over the next several years versus what we're selling."

We see some sort of economic recession take place in a material way that causes job loss to come back into the equation and jobs to really start to pull back. And absent some sort of major disruption on the demand side of the equation, right now, it's hard to see anything that's going to cause a material disruption in the positive leasing chemistry that continues to allow us to deliver, we think, pretty above long-term trend performance. It's moderated from what it was a couple years ago as a consequence, really, of a little supply, but honestly, just tougher comps. And that's been -- that's where the pressure has been, but the strong trends, per se, are going to continue from what we see today."

I think, across the line, it's personnel, R&M, marketing for sure, very much under control. The one exception is real estate tax, as we talked about. We did get a majority of our valuations come out in the second quarter, which is typical. Beginning of the year, you're sort of guessing on that, just based on trends, and so it came out a little higher than we thought, particularly in Texas, as valuations in Dallas and Houston didn't soften like we had thought and hoped it would be. So I think that's where the only pressure on expenses is, so we raised our guidance 1% at the midpoint on real estate tax guidance. Now we think it'll grow 5.5% to 6.5%. That's 1/3 of your operating expenses. But even with that, we reduced -- were able to reduce the midpoint of our expense expectations for the year by about 25 basis points. So summary of all that is no, we expect to be well under control."

Of course, the other thing that's a strong underpinning to the demand component of our business is just all this sort of psychology surrounding homeownership versus renting their homes and all the demographic factors that are continuing to work in our favor. And so those powerful forces are there, and they're going to continue from everything that we see. What allows those powerful forces to really be unleashed, of course, is the good job employment scenario, where people can get the jobs. And from what we see, employment trends tend to generally -- in some of these particularly larger markets across the Southeast, tend to be at the high end relative to what we see elsewhere across the country.

We are just seeing more opportunity, and of course, where we focus on some of these lease-up opportunities, as you know, those are situations that are a little bit more difficult to finance, and only the strongest buyers can really take on some of the initial dilution associated with acquiring a non-stabilized asset. And our ability to execute on an all-cash basis from an acquisitions perspective really gets us a lot of opportunity versus a lot of the other competitors that we run into.

Third quarter results were at the top-end of our guidance, solid same-store results, which were captured against a record occupancy performance of last year, coupled with favorable trends in G&A and interest expense drove core FFO per share of $1.49 representing an 8% jump, as compared to Q3 of last year. As outlined in our earnings release, we have raised full year guidance for core FFO to a range of $5.86 to $5.96 per share. We continue to capture solid leasing trends across the portfolio. Average daily occupancy within the same-store portfolio in the third quarter was a very strong 96.4% compared to the likewise, very strong 96.5% occupancy in Q3 of last year. Effective rent per unit increased 4.2% with higher performances coming from Orlando, Tampa, Atlanta, Charlotte, and Fortworth.  
As noted in our release, we were successful in closing 2 acquisitions during Q3, 1 in Houston and 1 in Greenville, South Carolina, both transactions are newly constructed properties and represent compelling long-term investment opportunities for those 2 markets.
We are also successful in completing the disposition of 7 older properties in the third quarter, as part of our efforts to steadily recycle capital to protect and enhance MAA's long-term earnings profile. Additionally, we currently have 5 other properties under contract for disposition and expect to close on these transactions in the fourth quarter. 
Our merger with Post Properties is making good progress, both companies have shareholder meetings scheduled for November 10. And we anticipate a closing of the merger effective December 1. Processes associated with integration of the 2 companies are well underway with the go-forward organization structure and team members now in place. As outlined in our announcement of the merger, we anticipate that upon completion of integration activities by the end of 2017, we expect to capture overhead synergies of $20 million. Specific line items and decisions associated with capturing this opportunity have been identified and we remain very confident in achieving this performance benchmark. As we continue to engage in the more detailed tasks surrounding the integration of the 2 companies, we remain very enthused and confident about capturing the improved operating margins and NOI lift from the legacy post portfolio, that is important to the overall value proposition of the merger. 
Our work to date associated with inventorying and comparing the more detailed operating practices of the 2 platforms, further assessing opportunities surrounding our larger scale and enhanced market efficiencies and evaluating the redevelopment opportunities, all combined to have us also feeling very confident about this aspect of the value proposition.  We will begin to layout more details upon closing the merger, as part of providing our initial guidance for calendar year 2017. 
Before turning the call over to Tom, I want to express my appreciation and thanks to the associates working at both MAA and Post for their hard work and great support during the past few weeks, as we have worked through the difficult task of merging the organizational structures and preparing for consolidated operations, while also taking care of our residents and existing operations. Our newly combined company will have a number of strong attributes that position us well for the future. The professionalism and dedication that our combined team of associates demonstrate each day are key among these qualities. And now, I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom?"

Our second quarter NOI performance of 3.7% was driven by revenue growth of 3.6% over the prior year. Revenues were up 1.5% sequentially, which is 30 basis points higher than the sequential change last quarter. We had good momentum in rents, as all employees effective rents increased 4.2% from the prior year. In the third quarter, new rents and renewal rents executed during the quarter, increased 4.3% on a blended lease over lease basis. We achieved 96.4% average daily occupancy, which is strong on an absolute basis, but slightly lower than last year's record performance. Fourth quarter trends continue the positive momentum. October's average daily physical occupancy of 96.1 is in line with October of last year. Our 60-day exposure, which is current vacancy plus all notices for a 60-day period is just 6.6%, below the prior year about 55 basis points. New and renewal rents have built on the strong trends of the third quarter. On a blended lease-over-lease basis, October rents have increased a seasonally strong 3.3%. 
On the market front, the vibrant job growth in the large markets is driving strong revenue results, and they were led by Fortworth, Orlando and Atlanta. The secondary markets continue to close the effective rent gap with the large markets. Since the third quarter of 2015, the rent growth gap between large and secondary markets has narrowed 80 basis points. Revenue growth in Jacksonville, Charleston and Memphis all stood out. As mentioned, momentum is strong across our markets with occupancy rent growth and exposure all showing positive trends. Our only market worry beed is Houston, which represents just 4% of our current portfolio. It's worth noting that Houston will drop to less than 4% of NOI after the merger. We continue to closely monitor and protect occupancy in this market.  As we approach the end of October, Houston's average daily occupancy is 95.9% and 60-day exposure is just 6.1%.
Our customer base remained stable. Moveouts for the portfolio were down for the quarter by 1.4% over a prior year and turnover remained low at 51.3% on a rolling 12-month basis. Moveouts to home buying remaind at 20% of total moveouts. There's also a little change in moveouts to home rental, which represents just over 7% of moveouts. 
During the quarter, we completed over 2,400 interior unit upgrades, bringing our total units redeveloped this year to just over 5,400. Our premerger redevelopment pipeline of 15,000 to 20,000 units remained robust. As a reminder, on average, we're spending about $4,500 per unit and receiving average rent increases of approximately $100 over a comparable non-renovated unit, generating a year 1 cash return of well over 20%. 
Work is underway defining the scale and scope of the redevelopment opportunity for the Post portfolio. Indications are that it will be a significant value creation opportunity. We are excited about adding units from the Post portfolio to our redevelopment pipeline. Our lease-up communities are performing well. Station Square at  Cosner's Corner II and Cityscape at Market Center II both stabilized on schedule during the third quarter. Rivers Walk II will stabilize on schedule in the fourth quarter. Colonial Grand at Randal Lakes II in Orlando, is 30% leased, and on schedule to stabilize at the end of next year. Our 3 new acquisition communities in Tempe, Greenville and Houston are all on track. We are pleased with our progress thus far on the post-merger. 
The operating structure of the combined companies has been finalized and communicated. There is a high degree of overlap in both systems and markets. We have enjoyed meeting the Post on-site teams and believe that adding these solid teams as well as excellent product and locations to our operating platform will create value for all of our stakeholders. We're in good shape for the fourth quarter and set up well for 2017. Al?"

I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's third quarter earnings performance, balance sheet position and then finally, on the revised earnings guidance for the full year. 
Net income available for common shareholders was $1.12 per diluted common share for the quarter. Core FFO for the quarter was $1.49 per share, which represents an 8% increase over the prior year. This performance was $0.04 per share above the midpoint of our previous guidance. Our same-store performance continued to be solid, which was in line with our expectations. About half of the outperformance or $0.02 per share was related to the favorable impact from the timing of our planned bond deal, which we previously projected for the third quarter, which is then postponed to early next year due to our merger activity. And we'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment. An additional penny per share is related to the timing of our transaction activity during the quarter and the final penny per share is related to the favorable G&A expenses for the quarter. 
As Eric mentioned, we acquired 2 new communities during the third quarter. We invested a total of $133 million for these 2 new communities, bringing our total acquisition by year-to-date to $264 million. We also sold 7 communities averaging 22 years of age during the quarter for gross proceeds of $152 million, which represented a 6.3% cap rate. We also exited 2 additional secondary markets with the sale of Winston-Salem and Greensboro, North Carolina. Our plans for the year included selling an 5 additional communities, which are expected to close during the fourth quarter.
We completed 1 community during the quarter,  River's Walk phase II in Charleston, and we had 3 communities, all expansions of current properties remaining under construction at the end of the quarter. We funded $13 million of construction cost during the quarter and have an additional $33 million to be funded on the existing pipeline. We continue to expect average NOI yields of about 7.5% for these communities once completed and fully stabilized. 
During the quarter, we paid all $75 million of maturing public bonds, which we expect to refinance as part of a large public bond offering early next year. Also during the third quarter, Fitch upgraded our senior unsecured rating to BBB plus with a stable outlook, and S&P placed our credit ratings currently at BBB flat on positive credit watch to reflect the anticipated increased strength of the balance sheet from the announced Post transaction. Given the merger announcement and related activities, we have postponed our original plans for bond later this year in order to allow the merger to close, which we expect to provide support for financing early next year.
Our balance sheet remains in great shape at quarter end. Our leverage, defined as net debt to gross assets, was 39.7%, which is 100 basis points below the prior year. Our net debt was only 5.6x recurring EBITDA. At quarter end, 89% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates at an average effective interest rate of only 3.9% with well-laddered maturities averaging over 4 years. 
At quarter end, we had almost $570 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity under our unsecured credit facility, providing both strength and flexibility. Given our current expectations for acquisitions and disposition over the remainder of the year, along with our projection for excess cash, we do not expect any new equity needs other than the shares issued for the merger transaction this year. Also we expect our leverage to decline up on the closing of the merger with Post ending the year in the mid-30s as a percentage of gross asset value. 
Finally, as Eric mentioned, we are again increasing our earnings guidance for 2016, due to the stronger-than-projected performance. We're increasing our core FFO projection by $0.06 per share at the midpoint to reflect both the $0.04 per share third quarter outperformance and $0.02 per share for our revised expectations for the remainder of the year.
We expect interest expense for the fourth quarter to be about $0.03 per share favorable due to the late timing of the planned bond deal offset by about a penny per share of costs related to cleanup from Hurricane Matthew. We are very fortunate to have always significant damage from this recession on, but we will incur some cost during Q4 repairs and cleanup. 
Core FFO is now projected to be $586 to $596 per share. $591 is the midpoint based on average shares outstanding of 79.7 million. Core AFFO is now projected to be $516 to about $526 per share or $521 at the midpoint. The major components of our guidance including same-store growth, transactions and financing assumptions remain similar to our prior guidance with the 1 exception of the bonded timing as discussed.
As mentioned in our release, given the merger transaction is not yet approved, this guidance does not reflect anticipated impact of the transaction. That transaction closes as planned, we expect to end year within this current guidance range, although near lower and given the initial dilution expected from of the transaction. We expect to provide guidance for 2017 in more detail regarding the merger transaction with our fourth quarter press release. 
As discussed during our merger announcement call, we plan to capture synergies and earnings opportunities from the merger with Post and we'll recapture these initial dilution from the transaction over the first 12 to 18 months. What we've seen thus far continues to support this expectation. 
We plan to outline this further with our fourth quarter release. That's all we have, and we are prepared comments. David, so we'll now turn it over to you for questions."

And we think in our region of the country, high job growth region of the country, one of the best ways to create that for soccer profile, if you will, is maintaining a healthy allocation between both large and secondary markets, higher gross margins in secondary markets. As of today, we have about 65% waiting in large markets and 35% weighting in secondary markets. After the close of the merger, it will be more on the lines of 75%, 25%. Now you're right that got of the asset sales have taken place have come out of the secondary markets, but primarily that's a function of prioritizing disposition focused on older assets, where the after CapEx margins are starting to show signs of moderating, and we feel like we can pull money out of the specific properties and recycle into better margin, better growth opportunities. And so, given the history of our company, it just so happens a lot of the older assets were in some of the more secondary or tertiary markets. So just as a consequence of our overall recycling objective, we have seen the allocation between large and secondary and of course, the Post transaction is going to change it. I would tell you this going forward, you will probably see 75%, 25% revert back to closer to, call it a 60% 40% waiting, 65%, 35% waiting kind of where we are today. We are going to continue to look for opportunistic acquisitions as well as opportunistic development opportunities in both large and secondary markets, as exemplified by this quarter. We've bought 1 in Houston, 1 in Greensville. So we did one of the segment. So we remain committed to the whole strategy that really defined us for the last 20 years. And we will ebb and flow a little bit just as a consequence of recycling market opportunities, but fundamentally, we don't plan to change who we are."

In fact, this is the first community delivered in that submarket since 2008, which is saying something when you're talking about Houston. But we went in there very conservatively. We basically assume no rent growth for the next 2 years, 1.5% rent growth in the third year. I believe Houston will likely do better than that, but that's what we assumed.

But $25 million was on Colonial, $20 million on Post. But as far as the areas of opportunity and sort of the opportunity to recover earnings dilution, first of all, it's important to recognize that we're taking on the Post portfolio and what's going to happen is the dilution that we see will be frankly, at its highest point at the very first month or 2 and then it begins to taper off over the coming 12 to 18 months. And so, we think that by the time we get to the end of 2017 that the recovery associated with overhead synergy that $20 million number will be fully realized by the time we get to the end of 2017. Beyond that, there're really 3 others are the big areas of opportunity. First and foremost is the development pipeline Post Again we're taking that development pipeline on and frankly, it's most diluted point. And we will see, as these properties come online and the earnings contribution start to grow, that will really start to show up pretty towards the end of next year and really into 2018, as these construction projects finish. But that's going to be meaningful area of opportunity. Thirdly, is, what Tom was talking about a moment ago, the redevelopment, that's a 2 or 3-year process. We see tremendous opportunity there. These are terrific locations that we think are just absolutely right for our redevelopment program. And we think that, that potentially is going to be much more significant, frankly, than what we had contemplated going into this. And then finally, the fourth area is, we just refer to it generally as NOI lift, and it's a combination of bunch of things.
It ranges all the way from how we execute with LRO, yield manager practices, just I was saying earlier how we turn apartments, capturing the full benefits surrounding the scale that we have. And frankly, those benefits regarding same store and efficiencies, there is going to be some benefit accrued to existing legacy MAA portfolio as a consequence of this combination as well. So that particular opportunity is still being mapped out in detail, but we think that over the next 12 to 18 months, likewise, is a very significant opportunity. When you put it all together, when you look at sort of the lot of different ways to think about sort of the value proposition here, but certainly when you look at the pricing paid versus the upside that we think is going to be realized over the next couple of years or so, much in the same way we saw with Colonial. The thing this one with Post is going to be frankly, more upside than what we saw with Colonial."

Third quarter results were at the top-end of our guidance, solid same-store results, which were captured against a record occupancy performance of last year, coupled with favorable trends in G&A and interest expense drove core FFO per share of $1.49 representing an 8% jump, as compared to Q3 of last year. As outlined in our earnings release, we have raised full year guidance for core FFO to a range of $5.86 to $5.96 per share. We continue to capture solid leasing trends across the portfolio. Average daily occupancy within the same-store portfolio in the third quarter was a very strong 96.4% compared to the likewise, very strong 96.5% occupancy in Q3 of last year. Effective rent per unit increased 4.2% with higher performances coming from Orlando, Tampa, Atlanta, Charlotte, and Fort Worth.  
As noted in our release, we were successful in closing 2 acquisitions during Q3, 1 in Houston and 1 in Greenville, South Carolina, both transactions are newly constructed properties and represent compelling long-term investment opportunities for those 2 markets.
We are also successful in completing the disposition of 7 older properties in the third quarter, as part of our efforts to steadily recycle capital to protect and enhance MAA's long-term earnings profile. Additionally, we currently have 5 other properties under contract for disposition and expect to close on these transactions in the fourth quarter. 
Our merger with Post Properties is making good progress, both companies have shareholder meetings scheduled for November 10. And we anticipate a closing of the merger effective December 1. Processes associated with integration of the 2 companies are well underway with the go-forward organization structure and team members now in place. As outlined in our announcement of the merger, we anticipate that upon completion of integration activities by the end of 2017, we expect to capture overhead synergies of $20 million. Specific line items and decisions associated with capturing this opportunity have been identified and we remain very confident in achieving this performance benchmark. As we continue to engage in the more detailed tasks surrounding the integration of the 2 companies, we remain very enthused and confident about capturing the improved operating margins and NOI lift from the legacy post portfolio that is important to the overall value proposition of the merger. 
Our work to date associated with inventorying and comparing the more detailed operating practices of the 2 platforms, further assessing opportunities surrounding our larger scale and enhanced market efficiencies and evaluating the redevelopment opportunities, all combined to have us also feeling very confident about this aspect of the value proposition.  We will begin to layout more details upon closing the merger, as part of providing our initial guidance for calendar year 2017. 
Before turning the call over to Tom, I want to express my appreciation and thanks to the associates working at both MAA and Post for their hard work and great support during the past few weeks, as we have worked through the difficult task of merging the organizational structures and preparing for consolidated operations, while also taking care of our residents and existing operations. Our newly combined company will have a number of strong attributes that position us well for the future. The professionalism and dedication that our combined team of associates demonstrate each day are key among these qualities. And now, I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom?"

Our second quarter NOI performance of 3.7% was driven by revenue growth of 3.6% over the prior year. Revenues were up 1.5% sequentially, which is 30 basis points higher than the sequential change last quarter. We had good momentum in rents, as all employees' effective rents increased 4.2% from the prior year. In the third quarter, new rents and renewal rents executed during the quarter, increased 4.3% on a blended lease over lease basis. We achieved 96.4% average daily occupancy, which is strong on an absolute basis, but slightly lower than last year's record performance. Fourth quarter trends continue the positive momentum. October's average daily physical occupancy of 96.1 is in line with October of last year. Our 60-day exposure, which is current vacancy plus all notices for a 60-day period is just 6.6%, below the prior year about 55 basis points. New and renewal rents have built on the strong trends of the third quarter. On a blended lease-over-lease basis, October rents have increased a seasonally strong 3.3%. 
On the market front, the vibrant job growth in the large markets is driving strong revenue results, and they were led by Fort Worth, Orlando and Atlanta. The secondary markets continue to close the effective rent gap with the large markets. Since the third quarter of 2015, the rent growth gap between large and secondary markets has narrowed 80 basis points. Revenue growth in Jacksonville, Charleston and Memphis all stood out. As mentioned, momentum is strong across our markets with occupancy rent growth and exposure all showing positive trends. Our only market worry beed is Houston, which represents just 4% of our current portfolio. It's worth noting that Houston will drop to less than 4% of NOI after the merger. We continue to closely monitor and protect occupancy in this market.  As we approach the end of October, Houston's average daily occupancy is 95.9% and 60-day exposure is just 6.1%.
Our customer base remained stable. Move-outs for the portfolio were down for the quarter by 1.4% over a prior year and turnover remained low at 51.3% on a rolling 12-month basis. Move-outs to home buying remained at 20% of total move-outs. There's also a little change in move-outs to home rental, which represents just over 7% of move-outs. 
During the quarter, we completed over 2,400 interior unit upgrades, bringing our total units redeveloped this year to just over 5,400. Our premerger redevelopment pipeline of 15,000 to 20,000 units remained robust. As a reminder, on average, we're spending about $4,500 per unit and receiving average rent increases of approximately $100 over a comparable non-renovated unit, generating a year 1 cash return of well over 20%. 
Work is underway defining the scale and scope of the redevelopment opportunity for the Post portfolio. Indications are that it will be a significant value creation opportunity. We are excited about adding units from the Post portfolio to our redevelopment pipeline. Our lease-up communities are performing well. Station Square at  Cosner's Corner II and Cityscape at Market Center II both stabilized on schedule during the third quarter. Rivers Walk II will stabilize on schedule in the fourth quarter. Colonial Grand at Randal Lakes II in Orlando, is 30% leased, and on schedule to stabilize at the end of next year. Our 3 new acquisition communities in Tempe, Greenville and Houston are all on track. We are pleased with our progress thus far on the post-merger. 
The operating structure of the combined companies has been finalized and communicated. There is a high degree of overlap in both systems and markets. We have enjoyed meeting the Post on-site teams and believe that adding these solid teams as well as excellent product and locations to our operating platform will create value for all of our stakeholders. We're in good shape for the fourth quarter and set up well for 2017. Al?"

Net income available fo",971,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's third quarter earnings performance, balance sheet position and then finally, on the revised earnings guidance for the full year. 
Net income available for common shareholders was $1.12 per diluted common share for the quarter. Core FFO for the quarter was $1.49 per share, which represents an 8% increase over the prior year. This performance was $0.04 per share above the midpoint of our previous guidance. Our same-store performance continued to be solid, which was in line with our expectations. About half of the outperformance or $0.02 per share was related to the favorable impact from the timing of our planned bond deal, which we previously projected for the third quarter, which is then postponed to early next year due to our merger activity. And we'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment. An additional penny per share is related to the timing of our transaction activity during the quarter and the final penny per share is related to the favorable G&A expenses for the quarter. 
As Eric mentioned, we acquired 2 new communities during the third quarter. We invested a total of $133 million for these 2 new communities, bringing our total acquisition by year-to-date to $264 million. We also sold 7 communities averaging 22 years of age during the quarter for gross proceeds of $152 million, which represented a 6.3% cap rate. We also exited 2 additional secondary markets with the sale of Winston-Salem and Greensboro, North Carolina. Our plans for the year included selling an 5 additional communities, which are expected to close during the fourth quarter.
We completed 1 community during the quarter,  River's Walk phase II in Charleston, and we had 3 communities, all expansions of current properties remaining under construction at the end of the quarter. We funded $13 million of construction cost during the quarter and have an additional $33 million to be funded on the existing pipeline. We continue to expect average NOI yields of about 7.5% for these communities once completed and fully stabilized. 
During the quarter, we paid all $75 million of maturing public bonds, which we expect to refinance as part of a large public bond offering early next year. Also during the third quarter, Fitch upgraded our senior unsecured rating to BBB plus with a stable outlook, and S&P placed our credit ratings currently at BBB flat on positive credit watch to reflect the anticipated increased strength of the balance sheet from the announced Post transaction. Given the merger announcement and related activities, we have postponed our original plans for bond later this year in order to allow the merger to close, which we expect to provide support for financing early next year.
Our balance sheet remains in great shape at quarter end. Our leverage, defined as net debt to gross assets, was 39.7%, which is 100 basis points below the prior year. Our net debt was only 5.6x recurring EBITDA. At quarter end, 89% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates at an average effective interest rate of only 3.9% with well-laddered maturities averaging over 4 years. 
At quarter end, we had almost $570 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity under our unsecured credit facility, providing both strength and flexibility. Given our current expectations for acquisitions and disposition over the remainder of the year, along with our projection for excess cash, we do not expect any new equity needs other than the shares issued for the merger transaction this year. Also we expect our leverage to decline up on the closing of the merger with Post ending the year in the mid-30s as a percentage of gross asset value. 
Finally, as Eric mentioned, we are again increasing our earnings guidance for 2016, due to the stronger-than-projected performance. We're increasing our core FFO projection by $0.06 per share at the midpoint to reflect both the $0.04 per share third quarter outperformance and $0.02 per share for our revised expectations for the remainder of the year.
We expect interest expense for the fourth quarter to be about $0.03 per share favorable due to the late timing of the planned bond deal offset by about a penny per share of costs relating to cleanup from Hurricane Matthew. We are very fortunate to avoid significant damage from this recent storm, but we will incur some cost during Q4 for repairs and cleanup. 
Core FFO is now projected to be $586 to $596 per share or $591 at the midpoint based on average shares and units outstanding of 79.7 million. Core AFFO is now projected to be $516 to $526 per share or $521 at the midpoint. The major components of our guidance including same-store growth, transactions and financing assumptions remain similar to our prior guidance with 1 exception of the bond deal timing as discussed.
As mentioned in our release, given the merger transaction is not yet approved, this guidance does not reflect anticipated impact of the transaction. If the transaction closes as planned, we expect to end the year within this current guidance range, although near the lower end given the initial dilution expected from the merger transaction. We expect to provide guidance for 2017 in more detail regarding the merger transaction with our fourth quarter press release. 
As discussed during our merger announcement call, we plan to capture synergies and additional earnings opportunities from the merger with Post that will recapture this initial dilution from the transaction over the first 12 to 18 months.

Do you turn using the Post platform and do development in some of these secondary markets to maintain the exposure, as this cycle gets late in the 2, because that's typically been where your stability has been during down cycles. Is it just a factor of post Post? You're going to be much more large markets. I mean, how should we be thinking about that, as the Med-America platform moves forward in terms of market distribution?"

And we think in our region of the country, high job growth region of the country, one of the best ways",350,"So Rob, I would tell you, we remain very committed to the overreaching objective of keeping a diversified and balanced attribute to our earnings stream. And we think in our region of the country, high job growth region of the country, one of the best ways to create that full cycle profile, if you will, is maintaining a healthy allocation between both large and secondary markets, higher gross margins in secondary markets. As of today, we have about 65% waiting in large markets and 35% waiting in secondary markets. After the close of the merger, it will be more along the lines of 75%, 25%. Now you're right in that a lot of the asset sales have taken place have come out of the secondary markets, but primarily that's a function of prioritizing disposition focused on older assets, where the after CapEx margins are starting to show signs of moderating, and we feel like we can pull money out of those specific properties and recycle into better margin, better growth opportunities. And so, given the history of our company, it just so happens a lot of the older assets were in some of the more secondary or tertiary markets. So just as a consequence of our overall recycling objective, we have seen the allocation between large and secondary and of course, the Post transaction is going to change it. I would tell you this going forward, you will probably see the 75%, 25% revert back to closer to, call it a 60% 40% waiting, 65%, 35% waiting kind of where we are today. We are going to continue to look for opportunistic acquisitions as well as opportunistic development opportunities in both large and secondary markets, as exemplified by this quarter. We've bought 1 in Houston, 1 in Greensville. So we did one in each segment. So we remain very committed to the whole strategy that really defined us for the last 20 years. And we will ebb and flow a little bit just as a consequence of recycling market opportunities, but fundamentally, we don't plan to change who we are."

And we will see, as these properties come online and the earnings contribution starts to grow, that will start to really show up really towards the end of next year and really into 2018, as these construction projects finish. But that's going to be a meaningful area of opportunity. Thirdly, is, what Tom was talking about a moment ago, the redevelopment, that's a 2 or 3-year process. We see tremendous opportunity there. These are terrific locations that we think are just absolutely right for our redevelopment program. And we think that, that potentially is going to be much more significant, frankly, than what we had contemplated going into this. And then finally, the fourth area is, we just refer to it generally as NOI lift, and it's a combination of bunch of things.
It ranges all the way from how we execute with LRO, yield management practices, just I was saying earlier how we turn apartments, capturing the full benefits surrounding the scale that we have. And frankly, those benefits regarding scale and efficiencies, there is going to be some benefit accrued to the existing legacy MAA portfolio as a consequence of this combination as well. So that particular opportunity is still being mapped out in detail, but we think that over the next 12 to 18 months, that it likewise, is a very significant opportunity. When you pull it all together, when you look at sort of the -- there is a lot of different ways to think about the sort of the value proposition here, but certainly when you look at the pricing paid versus the upside that we think is going to be realized over the next couple of years or so, much in the same way we saw with Colonial. We think this one here with Post was going to be frankly, more upside than what we saw with Colonial."

I think the story for the third quarter is that last year in third quarter, we got a lot of information and some favorable appeals that were very favorable and really helped us in our expansion. So we are really facing a tough comp this year in the third quarter, but our trajectory for the whole year is much more stable this year. Every bit of information we've gotten seems to support our initial expectation, and so we feel good about the 5.5% to 6.5% pressure coming from the same places we talked about in Texas and Georgia, as they aggressively chase values in some of those areas and have a lot of transactions to support it.

Third quarter results were at the top-end of our guidance, solid same-store results, which were captured against a record occupancy performance of last year, coupled with favorable trends in G&A and interest expense drove core FFO per share of $1.49 representing an 8% jump, as compared to Q3 of last year. As outlined in our earnings release, we have raised full year guidance for core FFO to a range of $5.86 to $5.96 per share. We continue to capture solid leasing trends across the portfolio. Average daily occupancy within the same-store portfolio in the third quarter was a very strong 96.4% compared to the likewise, very strong 96.5% occupancy in Q3 of last year. Effective rent per unit increased 4.2% with higher performances coming from Orlando, Tampa, Atlanta, Charlotte, and Fort Worth.  
As noted in our release, we were successful in closing 2 acquisitions during Q3, 1 in Houston and 1 in Greenville, South Carolina, both transactions are newly constructed properties and represent compelling long-term investment opportunities for those 2 markets.
We are also successful in completing the disposition of 7 older properties in the third quarter, as part of our efforts to steadily recycle capital to protect and enhance MAA's long-term earnings profile. Additionally, we currently have 5 other properties under contract for disposition and expect to close on these transactions in the fourth quarter. 
Our merger with Post Properties is making good progress, both companies have shareholder meetings scheduled for November 10. And we anticipate a closing of the merger effective December 1. Processes associated with integration of the 2 companies are well underway with the go-forward organization structure and team members now in place. As outlined in our announcement of the merger, we anticipate that upon completion of integration activities by the end of 2017, we expect to capture overhead synergies of $20 million. Specific line items and decisions associated with capturing this opportunity have been identified and we remain very confident in achieving this performance benchmark. As we continue to engage in the more detailed tasks surrounding the integration of the 2 companies, we remain very enthused and confident about capturing the improved operating margins and NOI lift from the legacy post portfolio that is important to the overall value proposition of the merger. 
Our work to date associated with inventorying and comparing the more detailed operating practices of the 2 platforms, further assessing opportunities surrounding our larger scale and enhanced market efficiencies and evaluating the redevelopment opportunities, all combined to have us also feeling very confident about this aspect of the value proposition.  We will begin to layout more details upon closing the merger, as part of providing our initial guidance for calendar year 2017. 
Before turning the call over to Tom, I want to express my appreciation and thanks to the associates working at both MAA and Post for their hard work and great support during the past few weeks, as we have worked through the difficult task of merging the organizational structures and preparing for consolidated operations, while also taking care of our residents and existing operations. Our newly combined company will have a number of strong attributes that position us well for the future. The professionalism and dedication that our combined team of associates demonstrate each day are key among these qualities. And now, I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom?"

Our second quarter NOI performance of 3.7% was driven by revenue growth of 3.6% over the prior year. Revenues were up 1.5% sequentially, which is 30 basis points higher than the sequential change last quarter. We had good momentum in rents, as all in place effective rents increased 4.2% from the prior year. In the third quarter, new rents and renewal rents executed during the quarter, increased 4.3% on a blended lease over lease basis. We achieved 96.4% average daily occupancy, which is strong on an absolute basis, but slightly lower than last year's record performance. Fourth quarter trends continue the positive momentum. October's average daily physical occupancy of 96.1 is in line with October of last year. Our 60-day exposure, which is current vacancy plus all notices for a 60-day period is just 6.6%, below the prior year about 55 basis points. New and renewal rents have built on the strong trends of the third quarter. On a blended lease-over-lease basis, October rents have increased a seasonally strong 3.3%. 
On the market front, the vibrant job growth in the large markets is driving strong revenue results, and they were led by Fort Worth, Orlando and Atlanta. The secondary markets continue to close the effective rent gap with the large markets. Since the third quarter of 2015, the rent growth gap between large and secondary markets has narrowed 80 basis points. Revenue growth in Jacksonville, Charleston and Memphis all stood out. As mentioned, momentum is strong across our markets with occupancy and rent growth and exposure all showing positive trends. Our only market worry bead is Houston, which represents just 4% of our current portfolio. It's worth noting that Houston will drop to less than 4% of NOI after the merger. We continue to closely monitor and protect occupancy in this market.  As we approach the end of October, Houston's average daily occupancy is 95.9% and 60-day exposure is just 6.1%.
Our customer base remained stable. Move outs for the portfolio were down for the quarter by 1.4% over a prior year and turnover remained low at 51.3% on a rolling 12-month basis. Move outs to home buying remained at 20% of total move outs. There's also a little change in move outs to home rental, which represents just over 7% of move outs. 
During the quarter, we completed over 2,400 interior unit upgrades, bringing our total units redeveloped this year to just over 5,400. Our premerger redevelopment pipeline of 15,000 to 20,000 units remained robust. As a reminder, on average, we're spending about $4,500 per unit and receiving average rent increases of approximately $100 over a comparable non-renovated unit, generating a year 1 cash return of well over 20%. 
Work is underway defining the scale and scope of the redevelopment opportunity for the Post portfolio. Indications are that it will be a significant value creation opportunity. We are excited about adding units from the Post portfolio to our redevelopment pipeline. Our lease-up communities are performing well. Station Square at  Cosner's Corner II and Cityscape at Market Center II both stabilized on schedule during the third quarter. Rivers Walk II will stabilize on schedule in the fourth quarter. Colonial Grand at Randal Lakes II in Orlando, is 30% leased, and on schedule to stabilize at the end of next year. Our 3 new acquisition communities in Tempe, Greenville and Houston are all on track. We are pleased with our progress thus far on the post merger. 
The operating structure of the combined companies has been finalized and communicated. There is a high degree of overlap in both systems and markets. We have enjoyed meeting the Post on-site teams and believe that adding these solid teams as well as excellent product and locations to our operating platform will create value for all of our stakeholders. We're in good shape for the fourth quarter and set up well for 2017. Al?"

I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's third quarter earnings performance, balance sheet position and then finally, on the revised earnings guidance for the full year. 
Net income available for common shareholders was $1.12 per diluted common share for the quarter. Core FFO for the quarter was $1.49 per share, which represents an 8% increase over the prior year. This performance was $0.04 per share above the midpoint of our previous guidance. Our same-store performance continued to be solid, which was in line with our expectations. About half of the outperformance or $0.02 per share was related to the favorable impact from the timing of our planned bond deal, which we previously projected for the third quarter, which is then postponed to early next year due to our merger activity. And we'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment. An additional penny per share is related to the timing of our transaction activity during the quarter and the final penny per share is related to the favorable G&A expenses for the quarter. 
As Eric mentioned, we acquired 2 new communities during the third quarter. We invested a total of $133 million for these 2 new communities, bringing our total acquisition by year-to-date to $264 million. We also sold 7 communities averaging 22 years of [ph] during the quarter for gross proceeds of $152 million, which represented a 6.3% cap rate. We also exited 2 additional secondary markets with the sale of Winston Salem and Greensboro, North Carolina. Our plans for the year included selling an 5 additional communities, which are expected to close during the fourth quarter.
We completed 1 community during the quarter,  River's Walk phase II in Charleston, and we had 3 communities, all expansions of current properties remaining under construction at the end of the quarter. We funded $13 million of construction cost during the quarter and have an additional $33 million to be funded on the existing pipeline. We continue to expect average NOI yields of about 7.5% for these communities once completed and fully stabilized. 
During the quarter, we paid all $75 million of maturing public bonds, which we expect to refinance as part of a large public bond offering early next year. Also during the third quarter, Fitch upgraded our senior unsecured rating to BBB plus with a stable outlook, and S&P placed our credit ratings currently at BBB flat on positive credit watch to reflect the anticipated increased strength of the balance sheet from the announced post transaction. Given the merger announcement and related activities, we have postponed our original plans for bond later this year in order to allow the merger to close, which we expect to provide support for financing early next year.
Our balance sheet remains in great shape at quarter end. Our leverage, defined as net debt to gross assets, was 39.7%, which is 100 basis points below the prior year. Our net debt was only 5.6x recurring EBITDA. At quarter end, 89% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates at an average effective interest rate of only 3.9% with well laddered maturities averaging over 4 years. 
At quarter end, we had almost $570 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity under our unsecured credit facility, providing both strength and flexibility. Given our current expectations for acquisitions and disposition over the remainder of the year, along with our projection for excess cash, we do not expect any new equity needs other than the shares issued for the merger transaction this year. Also we expect our leverage to decline up on the closing of the merger with Post ending the year in the mid-30s as a percentage of gross asset value. 
Finally, as Eric mentioned, we are again increasing our earnings guidance for 2016, due to the stronger than projected performance. We're increasing our core FFO projection by $0.06 per share at the midpoint to reflect both the $0.04 per share third quarter outperformance and $0.02 per share for our revised expectations for the remainder of the year.
We expect interest expense for the fourth quarter to be about $0.03 per share favorable due to the late timing of the planned bond deal offset by about a penny per share of costs relating to cleanup from Hurricane Matthew. We are very fortunate to avoid significant damage from this recent storm, but we will incur some cost during Q4 for repairs and cleanup. 
Core FFO is now projected to be $586 to $596 per share or $591 at the midpoint based on average shares and units outstanding of 79.7 million. Core AFFO is now projected to be $516 to $526 per share or $521 at the midpoint. The major components of our guidance including same-store growth, transactions and financing assumptions remain similar to our prior guidance with 1 exception of the bond deal timing as discussed.
As mentioned in our release, given the merger transaction is not yet approved, this guidance does not reflect the anticipated impact of the transaction. If the transaction closes as planned, we expect to end the year within this current guidance range, although near the lower end given the initial dilution expected from the merger transaction. We expect to provide guidance for 2017 in more detail regarding the merger transaction with our fourth quarter press release. 
As discussed during our merger announcement call, we plan to capture synergies and additional earnings opportunities from the merger with Post that will recapture this initial dilution from the transaction over the first 12 to 18 months. And what we've seen thus far continues to support this expectation. 
We plan to outline this further with our fourth quarter release. That's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. David, so we'll now turn it over to you for questions."

Do you turn using the Post platform and do development in some of these secondary markets to maintain the exposure, as this cycle gets late in the 2, because that's typically been where your stability has been during down cycles. Is it just a factor of post Post? You're going to be much more large markets. I mean, how should we be thinking about that, as the Mid-America platform moves forward in terms of market distribution?"

And we think in our region of the country, high job growth region of the country, one of the best ways to create that full cycle profile, if you will, is maintaining a healthy allocation between both large and secondary markets, higher growth large and secondary markets. As of today, we have about 65% waiting in large markets and 35% waiting in secondary markets. After the close of the merger, it will be more along the lines of 75%, 25%. Now you're right in that a lot of the asset sales have taken place have come out of the secondary markets, but primarily that's a function of prioritizing disposition focused on older assets, where the after CapEx margins are starting to show signs of moderating, and we feel like we can pull money out of those specific properties and recycle into better margin, better growth opportunities. And so, given the history of our company, it just so happens a lot of the older assets were in some of the more secondary or tertiary markets. So just as a consequence of our overall recycling objective, we have seen the allocation between large and secondary and of course, the Post transaction is going to change it. I would tell you this going forward, you will probably see the 75%, 25% revert back to closer to, call it a 60% 40% waiting, 65%, 35% waiting kind of where we are today. We are going to continue to look for opportunistic acquisitions as well as opportunistic development opportunities in both large and secondary markets, as exemplified by this quarter. We've bought 1 in Houston, 1 in Greenville. So we did one in each segment. So we remain very committed to the whole strategy that really defined us for the last 20 years. And we will ebb and flow a little bit just as a consequence of recycling in market opportunities, but fundamentally, we don't plan to change who we are."

We basically assume no rent growth for the next 2 years, 1.5% rent growth in the third year. I believe Houston will likely do better than that, but that's what we assumed.

So I think what you're seeing, we're going to take a look at that and most likely what we're going to do going forward next year is focus more on NAREIT FFO and discuss the transaction merger integration cost. So that means that the fair market value adjustable will be included in that instead of pulling it out as part of core FFO, I think, meaning our peers do include that, we're going to go ahead and do that and line that up within NAREIT FFO. Having said that, I think the numbers around $35 million or something like that in total that we've talked about and we will get more details on that, when we give guidance for 2017."

But $25 million was on Colonial, $20 million on Post. But as far as the areas of opportunity and sort of the opportunity to recover earnings dilution, first of all, it's important to recognize that we're taking on the Post portfolio and what's going to happen is the dilution that we see will be frankly, at its highest point at the very first month or 2 and then it begins to taper off over the coming 12 to 18 months. And so, we think that by the time we get to the end of 2017 that the recovery associated with overhead synergy that $20 million number will be fully realized by the time we get to the end of 2017. Beyond that, there are really 3 other sort of big areas of opportunity. First and foremost is the development pipeline that Post has. Again, we're taking that development pipeline on at frankly, it's most dilutive point. And we will see, as these properties come online and the earnings contribution starts to grow, that will start to really show up really towards the end of next year and really into 2018, as these construction projects finish. But that's going to be a meaningful area of opportunity. Thirdly, is, what Tom was talking about a moment ago, the redevelopment, that's a 2 or 3-year process. We see tremendous opportunity there. These are terrific locations that we think are just absolutely right for our redevelopment program. And we think that, that potentially is going to be much more significant, frankly, than what we had contemplated going into this. And then finally, the fourth area is, we just refer to it generally as NOI lift, and it's a combination of a bunch of things.
It ranges all the way from how we execute with LRO, yield management practices, just I was saying earlier how we turn apartments, capturing the full benefits surrounding the scale that we have. And frankly, those benefits regarding scale and efficiencies, there is going to be some benefit accrued to the existing legacy MAA portfolio as a consequence of this combination as well. So that particular opportunity is still being mapped out in detail, but we think that over the next 12 to 18 months, that it likewise, is a very significant opportunity. When you pull it all together, when you look at sort of the -- there is a lot of different ways to think about the sort of the value proposition here, but certainly when you look at the pricing paid versus the upside that we think is going to be realized over the next couple of years or so, much in the same way we saw with Colonial. We think this one here with Post was going to be frankly, more upside than what we saw with Colonial."

I think the story for the third quarter is that last year in third quarter, we got a lot of information and some favorable appeals that were very favorable and really helped us in our expansion. So we are really facing a tough comp this year in the third quarter, but our trajectory for the whole year is much more stable this year. Every bit of information we've gotten seems to support our initial expectation, and so we feel good about the 5.5% to 6.5% pressure coming from the same places we talked about in Texas and Georgia, as they aggressively chase values in some of those areas and have a lot of transactions to support it.

Third quarter results were at the top-end of our guidance, solid same-store results, which were captured against a record occupancy performance of last year, coupled with favorable trends in G&A and interest expense drove core FFO per share of $1.49 representing an 8% jump, as compared to Q3 of last year. As outlined in our earnings release, we have raised full year guidance for core FFO to a range of $5.86 to $5.96 per share. We continue to capture solid leasing trends across the portfolio. Average daily occupancy within the same-store portfolio in the third quarter was a very strong 96.4% compared to the likewise, very strong 96.5% occupancy in Q3 of last year. Effective rent per unit increased 4.2% with higher performances coming from Orlando, Tampa, Atlanta, Charlotte, and Fort Worth.  
As noted in our release, we were successful in closing 2 acquisitions during Q3, 1 in Houston and 1 in Greenville, South Carolina, both transactions are newly constructed properties and represent compelling long-term investment opportunities for those 2 markets.
We are also successful in completing the disposition of 7 older properties in the third quarter, as part of our efforts to steadily recycle capital to protect and enhance MAA's long-term earnings profile. Additionally, we currently have 5 other properties under contract for disposition and expect to close on these transactions in the fourth quarter. 
Our merger with Post Properties is making good progress, both companies have shareholder meetings scheduled for November 10. And we anticipate a closing of the merger effective December 1. Processes associated with integration of the 2 companies are well underway with the go-forward organization structure and team members now in place. As outlined in our announcement of the merger, we anticipate that upon completion of integration activities by the end of 2017, we expect to capture overhead synergies of $20 million. Specific line items and decisions associated with capturing this opportunity have been identified and we remain very confident in achieving this performance benchmark. As we continue to engage in the more detailed tasks surrounding the integration of the 2 companies, we remain very enthused and confident about capturing the improved operating margins and NOI lift from the legacy post portfolio that is important to the overall value proposition of the merger. 
Our work to date associated with inventorying and comparing the more detailed operating practices of the 2 platforms, further assessing opportunities surrounding our larger scale and enhanced market efficiencies and evaluating the redevelopment opportunities, all combined to have us also feeling very confident about this aspect of the value proposition.  We will begin to lay out more details upon closing the merger, as part of providing our initial guidance for calendar year 2017. 
Before turning the call over to Tom, I want to express my appreciation and thanks to the associates working at both MAA and Post for their hard work and great support during the past few weeks, as we have worked through the difficult task of merging the organizational structures and preparing for consolidated operations, while also taking care of our residents and existing operations. Our newly combined company will have a number of strong attributes that position us well for the future. The professionalism and dedication that our combined team of associates demonstrate each day are key among these qualities. And now, I'll turn it over to Tom. Tom?"
332358,403646992,1066660,"Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2016",2016-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter NOI performance of 3.7% was driven by revenue growth of 3.6% over the prior year. Revenues were up 1.5% sequentially, which is 30 basis points higher than the sequential change last quarter.",651,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter NOI performance of 3.7% was driven by revenue growth of 3.6% over the prior year. Revenues were up 1.5% sequentially, which is 30 basis points higher than the sequential change last quarter. We had good momentum in rents, as all in place effective rents increased 4.2% from the prior year. In the third quarter, new rents and renewal rents executed during the quarter, increased 4.3% on a blended lease over lease basis. We achieved 96.4% average daily occupancy, which is strong on an absolute basis, but slightly lower than last year's record performance. Fourth quarter trends continue the positive momentum. October's average daily physical occupancy of 96.1 is in line with October of last year. Our 60-day exposure, which is current vacancy plus all notices for a 60-day period is just 6.6%, below the prior year about 55 basis points. New and renewal rents have built on the strong trends of the third quarter. On a blended lease-over-lease basis, October rents have increased a seasonally strong 3.3%. 
On the market front, the vibrant job growth in the large markets is driving strong revenue results, and they were led by Fort Worth, Orlando and Atlanta. The secondary markets continue to close the effective rent gap with the large markets. Since the third quarter of 2015, the rent growth gap between large and secondary markets has narrowed 80 basis points. Revenue growth in Jacksonville, Charleston and Memphis all stood out. As mentioned, momentum is strong across our markets with occupancy and rent growth and exposure all showing positive trends. Our only market worry bead is Houston, which represents just 4% of our current portfolio. It's worth noting that Houston will drop to less than 4% of NOI after the merger. We continue to closely monitor and protect occupancy in this market.  As we approach the end of October, Houston's average daily occupancy is 95.9% and 60-day exposure is just 6.1%.
Our customer base remained stable. Moveouts for the portfolio were down for the quarter by 1.4% over a prior year and turnover remained low at 51.3% on a rolling 12-month basis. Moveouts to home buying remained at 20% of total moveouts. There's also a little change in moveouts to home rental, which represents just over 7% of moveouts. 
During the quarter, we completed over 2,400 interior unit upgrades, bringing our total units redeveloped this year to just over 5,400. Our premerger redevelopment pipeline of 15,000 to 20,000 units remained robust. As a reminder, on average, we're spending about $4,500 per unit and receiving average rent increases of approximately $100 over a comparable non-renovated unit, generating a year 1 cash return of well over 20%. 
Work is underway defining the scale and scope of the redevelopment opportunity for the Post portfolio. Indications are that it will be a significant value creation opportunity. We are excited about adding units from the Post portfolio to our redevelopment pipeline. Our lease-up communities are performing well. Station Square at  Cosner's Corner II and Cityscape at Market Center II both stabilized on schedule during the third quarter. Rivers Walk II will stabilize on schedule in the fourth quarter. Colonial Grand at Randal Lakes II in Orlando, is 30% leased, and on schedule to stabilize at the end of next year. Our 3 new acquisition communities in Tempe, Greenville and Houston are all on track. We are pleased with our progress thus far on the post merger. 
The operating structure of the combined companies has been finalized and communicated. There is a high degree of overlap in both systems and markets. We have enjoyed meeting the Post on-site teams and believe that adding these solid teams as well as excellent product and locations to our operating platform will create value for all of our stakeholders. We're in good shape for the fourth quarter and set up well for 2017. Al?"
332358,403646992,1066660,"Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2016",2016-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's third quarter earnings performance, balance sheet position and then finally, on the revised earnings guidance for the full year. Net income available fo",976,"Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional commentary on the company's third quarter earnings performance, balance sheet position and then finally, on the revised earnings guidance for the full year. 
Net income available for common shareholders was $1.12 per diluted common share for the quarter. Core FFO for the quarter was $1.49 per share, which represents an 8% increase over the prior year. This performance was $0.04 per share above the midpoint of our previous guidance. Our same-store performance continued to be solid, which was in line with our expectations. About half of the outperformance or $0.02 per share was related to the favorable impact from the timing of our planned bond deal, which we previously projected for the third quarter, which is then postponed to early next year due to our merger activity. And we'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment. An additional penny per share is related to the timing of our transaction activity during the quarter and the final penny per share is related to the favorable G&A expenses for the quarter. 
As Eric mentioned, we acquired 2 new communities during the third quarter. We invested a total of $133 million for these 2 new communities, bringing our total acquisition by year-to-date to $264 million. We also sold 7 communities averaging 22 years of [ph] during the quarter for gross proceeds of $152 million, which represented a 6.3% cap rate. We also exited 2 additional secondary markets with the sale of Winston Salem and Greensboro, North Carolina. Our plans for the year included selling an 5 additional communities, which are expected to close during the fourth quarter.
We completed 1 community during the quarter,  River's Walk phase II in Charleston, and we had 3 communities, all expansions of current properties remaining under construction at the end of the quarter. We funded $13 million of construction cost during the quarter and have an additional $33 million to be funded on the existing pipeline. We continue to expect average NOI yields of about 7.5% for these communities once completed and fully stabilized. 
During the quarter, we paid all $75 million of maturing public bonds, which we expect to refinance as part of a large public bond offering early next year. Also during the third quarter, Fitch upgraded our senior unsecured rating to BBB plus with a stable outlook, and S&P placed our credit ratings currently at BBB flat on positive credit watch to reflect the anticipated increased strength of the balance sheet from the announced post transaction. Given the merger announcement and related activities, we have postponed our original plans for bond later this year in order to allow the merger to close, which we expect to provide support for financing early next year.
Our balance sheet remains in great shape at quarter end. Our leverage, defined as net debt to gross assets, was 39.7%, which is 100 basis points below the prior year. Our net debt was only 5.6x recurring EBITDA. At quarter end, 89% of our debt was fixed or hedged against rising interest rates at an average effective interest rate of only 3.9% with well laddered maturities averaging over 4 years. 
At quarter end, we had almost $570 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity under our unsecured credit facility, providing both strength and flexibility. Given our current expectations for acquisitions and disposition over the remainder of the year, along with our projection for excess cash, we do not expect any new equity needs other than the shares issued for the merger transaction this year. Also we expect our leverage to decline up on the closing of the merger with Post ending the year in the mid-30s as a percentage of gross asset value. 
Finally, as Eric mentioned, we are again increasing our earnings guidance for 2016, due to the stronger than projected performance. We're increasing our core FFO projection by $0.06 per share at the midpoint to reflect both the $0.04 per share third quarter outperformance and $0.02 per share for our revised expectations for the remainder of the year.
We expect interest expense for the fourth quarter to be about $0.03 per share favorable due to the late timing of the planned bond deal offset by about a penny per share of costs relating to cleanup from Hurricane Matthew. We are very fortunate to avoid significant damage from this recent storm, but we will incur some cost during Q4 for repairs and cleanup. 
Core FFO is now projected to be $586 to $596 per share or $591 at the midpoint based on average shares and units outstanding of 79.7 million. Core AFFO is now projected to be $516 to $526 per share or $521 at the midpoint. The major components of our guidance including same-store growth, transactions and financing assumptions remain similar to our prior guidance with 1 exception of the bond deal timing as discussed.
As mentioned in our release, given the merger transaction is not yet approved, this guidance does not reflect the anticipated impact of the transaction. If the transaction closes as planned, we expect to end the year within this current guidance range, although near the lower end given the initial dilution expected from the merger transaction. We expect to provide guidance for 2017 in more detail regarding the merger transaction with our fourth quarter press release. 
As discussed during our merger announcement call, we plan to capture synergies and additional earnings opportunities from the merger with Post that will recapture this initial dilution from the transaction over the first 12 to 18 months. And what we've seen thus far continues to support this expectation. 
We plan to outline this further with our fourth quarter release. That's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. David, so we'll now turn it over to you for questions."

Do you turn using the Post platform and do development in some of these secondary markets to maintain the exposure, as this cycle gets late in the 2, because that's typically been where your stability has been during down cycles. Is it just a factor of post Post? You're going to be much more large markets.

And we think in our region of the country, high job growth region of the country, one of the best ways to create that full cycle profile, if you will, is maintaining a healthy allocation between both large and secondary markets, higher growth large and secondary markets. As of today, we have about 65% waiting in large markets and 35% waiting in secondary markets. After the close of the merger, it will be more along the lines of 75%, 25%. Now you're right in that a lot of the asset sales have taken place have come out of the secondary markets, but primarily that's a function of prioritizing disposition focused on older assets, where the after CapEx margins are starting to show signs of moderating, and we feel like we can pull money out of those specific properties and recycle into better margin, better growth opportunities. And so, given the history of our company, it just so happens a lot of the older assets were in some of the more secondary or tertiary markets. So just as a consequence of our overall recycling objective, we have seen the allocation between large and secondary and of course, the Post transaction is going to change it. I would tell you this going forward, you will probably see the 75%, 25% revert back to closer to, call it a 60% 40% waiting, 65%, 35% waiting kind of where we are today. We are going to continue to look for opportunistic acquisitions as well as opportunistic development opportunities in both large and secondary markets, as exemplified by this quarter. We've bought 1 in Houston, 1 in Greenville. So we did one in each segment. So we remain very committed to the whole strategy that really defined us for the last 20 years. And we will ebb and flow a little bit just as a consequence of recycling in market opportunities, but fundamentally, we don't plan to change who we are."

So I think Houston, we're going to continue to keep an eye on that market and like it long-term, but I think that it's probably too early to suggest that this transaction is indicative of anything really turning there in terms of transaction activity."

But $25 million was on Colonial, $20 million on Post. But as far as the areas of opportunity and sort of the opportunity to recover earnings dilution, first of all, it's important to recognize that we're taking on the Post portfolio and what's going to happen is the dilution that we see will be frankly, at its highest point at the very first month or 2 and then it begins to taper off over the coming 12 to 18 months. And so, we think that by the time we get to the end of 2017 that the recovery associated with overhead synergy that $20 million number will be fully realized by the time we get to the end of 2017. Beyond that, there are really 3 other sort of big areas of opportunity. First and foremost is the development pipeline that Post has. Again, we're taking that development pipeline on at frankly, it's most dilutive point. And we will see, as these properties come online and the earnings contribution starts to grow, that will start to really show up really towards the end of next year and really into 2018, as these construction projects finish. But that's going to be a meaningful area of opportunity. Thirdly, is, what Tom was talking about a moment ago, the redevelopment, that's a 2 or 3-year process. We see tremendous opportunity there. These are terrific locations that we think are just absolutely right for our redevelopment program. And we think that, that potentially is going to be much more significant, frankly, than what we had contemplated going into this. And then finally, the fourth area is, we just refer to it generally as NOI lift, and it's a combination of a bunch of things.
It ranges all the way from how we execute with LRO, yield management practices, just I was saying earlier how we turn apartments, capturing the full benefits surrounding the scale that we have. And frankly, those benefits regarding scale and efficiencies, there is going to be some benefit accrued to the existing legacy MAA portfolio as a consequence of this combination as well. So that particular opportunity is still being mapped out in detail, but we think that over the next 12 to 18 months, that it likewise, is a very significant opportunity. When you pull it all together, when you look at sort of the -- there is a lot of different ways to think about the sort of the value proposition here, but certainly when you look at the pricing paid versus the upside that we think is going to be realized over the next couple of years or so, much in the same way we saw with Colonial. We think this one here with Post was going to be frankly, more upside than what we saw with Colonial."

Taxes, you get a lot of volatility sometimes in quarterly comparisons because there is a couple of things that happen and you get -- timing of getting your information during the year can change from year to year -- and the timing of you getting appeals successful or not successful can change year to year. I think the story for the third quarter is that last year in third quarter, we got a lot of information and some favorable appeals that were very favorable and really helped us in our expansion. So we are really facing a tough comp this year in the third quarter, but our trajectory for the whole year is much more stable this year. Every bit of information we've gotten seems to support our initial expectation, and so we feel good about the 5.5% to 6.5% pressure coming from the same places we talked about in Texas and Georgia, as they aggressively chase values in some of those areas and have a lot of transactions to support it.
