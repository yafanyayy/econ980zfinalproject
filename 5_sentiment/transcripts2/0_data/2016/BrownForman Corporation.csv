I'll cover 2 topics today, which should leave plenty of time for questions after our prepared remarks. First, I'll review our year-to-date results and then I'll discuss our revised outlook for fiscal 2016.
So let me start by reviewing our recent results. Against the backdrop of deteriorating economic conditions and foreign exchange moves that negatively impacted our reported results, we delivered solid underlying net sales growth of 4% in the third quarter. 
These results reflected 2 different economic realities. On the one hand, we delivered strong and consistent growth in the developed world where underlying net sales were up 6% year-to-date. On the other hand, we experienced decelerating results in the emerging markets and continued weakness in our global travel retail channel. Third quarter results put our year-to-date underlying net sales growth to 5%.
Top line results in the United States maintained their healthy momentum, growing 7% in the third quarter and in line with the 7% we delivered in the first half of the fiscal year. This great performance was led by the leading portfolio of authentic American whiskeys, including the Jack Daniel's family of brands, up 7% and Old Forester and Woodford Reserve both gaining share in the rapidly growing bourbon category. 
Our tequila brand delivered strong growth in the United States, with Herradura and el Jimador up in the teens. Developed markets outside the United States grew underlying net sales 5% during the first 9 months of our fiscal year. Improving results in Australia were more than offset by Germany's third quarter declines, where our business was negatively impacted by seasonal trading patterns that we expect to reverse in the fourth quarter. Excluding this timing issue in Germany, our non-developed U.S. markets -- our non-U.S. developed markets are up 6%, in line with first half growth of 6%. The United Kingdom, France, Canada and Spain each delivered solid rates of growth while Japan was flat.
trends in the developed world also remained strong and in some cases, even better than our underlying depletion trends. 3-month blended takeaway for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey in the United States is steady at around 3% and is currently lapping its toughest comparisons from last year. In the United Kingdom and France, takeaway is up almost 10%. Germany's takeaway is up over 10% and Australia is showing slight growth. These solid takeaway trends for Jack Daniel's give us optimism about our business outlook in the developed markets. 
Moving now to the emerging world, where for the first time in several years, our emerging markets business underperformed the developed world with year-to-date growth of 5%. Historically, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey has been growing in the mid-high teens in the emerging markets fueled by strong market share gain. But the deteriorating economic condition and worsening spirits trend have temporarily slowed Jack Daniel's underlying net sales growth into the high single digits. This deceleration equates to removing 1 point of incremental net sales growth from our underlying results.
While we don't have large exposure to any one particular emerging economy, the slowdown has improved across most markets and could persist over the near term until economic and geopolitical pressures lessen. In the meantime, however, we continue to lay the groundwork, saving these markets so that when economic growth accelerates, we will be well positioned. And in 2 emerging markets where we have visibility on takeaway trends, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey is up midteens in Poland and almost 30% in Mexico.
In addition to the slowdown in emerging markets, our Global Travel Retail business remained under pressure in the quarter, resulting in a 13% year-to-date decline. So while our travel retail business is still relatively small, this has reduced the company's net sales growth by about 0.5 point. In the aggregate, the slowing emerging markets and declines in the travel retail channel pulled 1.5 points of growth off of our year-to-date underlying net sales growth of 5%.
Looking at our results through the brand lens, the Jack Daniel's family of brands led the way with underlying net sales growth of 7%. Core Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey grew 4% in the first 9 months, and brands such as Tennessee Fire, Tennessee Honey and Gentleman Jack all helped drive even higher growth for the family. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire contributed over 1 point of year-to-date underlying net sales growth and depleted over 400,000 9-liter [ph] cases in its first 12 months despite the backdrop of intense competition in flavors.
This growth has come from bringing in many new-to-whiskey consumers, a group that overindexes to millennial women and Latinos. Our brands -- other brands with standout underlying net sales growth include Woodford Reserve, up 29%, and Old Forester, which grew over 50%. el Jimador and Herradura tequila both delivered impressive global results, and Sonoma-Cutrer and Champagne have grown underlying net sales by mid-single-digits so far this year. 
Underlying net sales growth was dragged down by declines in Southern Comfort, Finlandia and Canadian Mist. As you know, we closed on the sale of Southern Comfort in Tuaca yesterday, and I'll discuss that in more detail in a few minutes. Finlandia sales declined due to challenging conditions in 2 of its largest markets, Poland and Russia. And Canadian Mist results were hurt by competitive price pressures and the transition to new price packaging.
Let's move now to a reconciliation of reported to underlying results. The U.S. dollar has continued to appreciate against most currencies, which is weighing heavily on our reported results. Year-to-date, foreign exchange has negatively affected our net sales growth by 8 points. Price/mix was up 4 points year-to-date, driven largely by better mix. And effects of fast growth in our American whiskey portfolio and declining sales of lower-priced brands have resulted in this favorable mix, helping drive a 40 basis point improvement in gross margins. 
Underlying A&P spend increased 1% while underlying SG&A grew 4%. Both line items were a few points lower on a reported basis as foreign exchange helped our non-U.S. dollar-denominated costs. Putting this all together, we delivered 7% year-to-date growth in underlying operating income. Foreign exchange headwinds hurt our operating income line by 5 points, resulting in reported operating income growth of 2%. 
For the first 9 months of the year, earnings per share came in at $2.65, up 4% over last year. EPS was helped by a slightly lower tax rate and lower share count. Foreign exchange was a $0.14 drag on reported EPS. So excluding netbacks, year-over-year growth in EPS would have been approximately 10%.
Moving now to my second and final topic, an update on our full year outlook for fiscal 2016. Excluding the estimated gain on the sale of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, we revised our full year outlook down today to incorporate the emerging markets slowdown, continued weakness in the global travel retail channel as well as the impact from adverse foreign exchange. 
While we typically discuss foreign exchange moves and its impact on our reported results, foreign exchange also negatively impacted our underlying growth. We see this manifest itself in a number of ways, including the decline in the purchasing power of our consumers, most notably in emerging market economies as well as the negative impact of purchasing pattern of our trade partners. 
We now expect our underlying net sales to grow approximately 5% in fiscal 2016, slightly below last year's 6% rate of growth but well ahead of the 2% growth that we estimate of our peer group. While we are disappointed that our growth has moderated slightly due to the deteriorating economic conditions throughout the emerging economies of the world, our view remains unchanged that these economies will become increasingly important growth drivers for the company over the coming years. We believe that we are in the early stages of realizing their long-term growth potential, given our low market share today.
We expect modest gross margin expansion for the year, which helps position us for solid operating income growth as we look to continue to leverage some of the investments we have been making over the last few years to build our brand. These investments go far beyond the A&P line and include the people we have added into the marketplace such as the France, Germany and Brazil route-to-market changes, our investments in packaging as well as the significant capital we have been investing in our production operations. 
In summary, we expect 7% to 9% underlying growth in operating income for fiscal 2016. This 1-point reduction in operating income growth equates to roughly $0.03 less of earnings per share. Foreign exchange is now anticipated to be approximately $0.06 worse than our expectations were at the time of our second quarter earnings call. 
And as you know, we closed on the sale of Southern Comfort and Tuaca yesterday. The absence of these brands from our results in March and April will pull an additional $0.04 off of our full year expectations. These negative items are partially offset by $0.05 due to a lower tax rate and lower share count. Taking all these puts and takes into consideration equates to an $0.08 lowering of our EPS range in fiscal 2016, which we also tightened to $3.32 to $3.42.
This range excludes the estimated $483 million gain from the sale of Southern Comfort and Tuaca. Including this gain, we adjust our earnings per share range to $4.97 to $5.07 in fiscal 2016. Given the continued volatility in foreign exchange and assuming foreign currency cash flow exposure collectively move 10% in either direction, our EPS over the balance of the year would be impacted by roughly $0.04.
Just to add a little color on our fourth quarter. This full year outlook incorporates the challenging top line comparisons we expect in the fourth quarter, given last year's launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire in the United States. Fourth quarter growth should be helped somewhat by normal trading patterns in Germany as well as expanding Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire in the United Kingdom and Australia, where the brand has been performing well in its limited test phase. We are currently evaluating opportunities for additional expansion beyond these markets.
This year's fourth quarter results should also benefit from favorable comparisons on our tax rate and other operating expense items that pulled down last year's fourth quarter earnings.
Now before I pass the call over to Paul for some brief comments, I thought it would be helpful to discuss our thought process behind selling Southern Comfort. We acquired Southern Comfort for $90 million in 1979. Despite encountering some cycles over the last 37 years, Southern Comfort has enjoyed a dominant position in the flavored spirits category, given limited direct competition, generating substantial cash flow and return on its investment to the company over that time. 
But as you know, the competitive landscape in flavored whiskey has heated up over the last few years, including some of our own brand introductions such as Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire and Honey. And this competition has been eroding Southern Comfort's leading share, resulting in persistent sales declines since 2008. 
So over the last few years, we have allocated additional time, focus and dollars toward reinvigorating the brand with limited success and reached the conclusion that we should sell the brand and rededicate resources to brands that we believe have greater long-term growth prospects and can create more value for our shareholders. 
So after a thorough sales process, we agreed to sell Southern Comfort and Tuaca for approximately $542 million. In addition to the increased focus that we will be dedicating to our remaining brands and expectations for faster portfolio growth once we move past the current economic malaise, the proceeds from this sale strengthen an already great balance sheet. Our balance sheet flexibility in turn allows us to invest in our organic growth, consider acquisitions that meet our strategic criteria and be opportunistic at reducing our share count, including the $1 billion buyback authorization that we announced in late January that commences on April 1, 2016.
As a point of reference, in fiscal 2015, Southern Comfort and Tuaca generated $70 million in operating income and $0.24 of EPS. And our year-to-date underlying net sales growth would have been 6% excluding these brands. This portfolio management has been an ongoing exercise over the past 2 decades as we focus Brown-Forman's portfolio on high-margin high-return spirits brands with improved long-term growth prospects. Our portfolio strategies in sales not just the best in brands such as Southern Comfort and Tuaca but also taking the long-term perspective to invest in developing the brands that have the potential to drive the next few decades of growth. This was the case behind launching Woodford Reserve in the depths of the bourbon declines in the 1990s, acquiring Southern Comfort in 1999 and Casa Herradura in 2007. Introducing Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey in 2011 and the reason why we are investing in slain Irish whiskey today. 
So in closing, we continue to deliver industry-leading underlying growth in net sales and operating income. We attribute this top line outperformance to our portfolio focus on Jack Daniel's and our American whiskeys against an excellent global opportunity for them. Our SKU to premium price point allows us to deliver high margins and with single point production efficiencies, we have been able to generate great returns on our investments and strong cash flow. 
We have maintained a consistent long-range perspective to investing this cash flow, focusing first and foremost on investing in our organic growth opportunities. We are doing so today through distillery expansions, adding barrel-making capacity and making homeplace investments. 
We have used our growing cash flow to consistently increase the dividend over the last 32 years, making Brown-Forman a member of the prestigious dividend aristocrat. We maintain an active approach to portfolio management, and we generate substantial free cash flows, which allows us to continue returning cash to our shareholders. And so with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Paul for some of his comments. Paul?"

As a summary, I thought Q3 was a pretty solid underlying quarter for us, given that during the November through January time period, we witnessed the terrorist attacks in Paris, the continued difficulty for emerging market economies and currencies and a very rough start for the calendar year 2016 equity markets in January. 
By contributing to a halo of uncertainty, these forces play a role in moderating the consumer and trade's willingness to purchase in the short term. As a result and despite Brown-Forman's favorable geographic diversification, we were not immune to these factors as they weighed somewhat on the quarter's underlying sales growth rate, which was still a very nice 4%. 
Our year-to-date underlying growth in sales and operating income now stand at 5% and 7%, respectively, and our 12-month return on invested capital remain very strong at 22%. This growth in return metrics remain ahead of our industry competitive set. As in past quarters and consistent with other U.S.-based companies, these very nice organic year-to-date results are being offset by a strengthening dollar, and this continued to weigh on reported results. In our case, it had the effect of reducing our year-to-date underlying operating income growth from 7% to 2%.
With these factors present as current headwinds, you might be wondering if we're altering our course in any way. Let me touch on that briefly. Looking back on other challenging macroeconomic environments we've encountered, I feel that we've been very well served by prioritizing 3 things: first, keeping our long-term perspective; second, intensifying and narrowing our focus on the very best growth opportunities we perceive for the company; and third, bringing new ideas that can capitalize on those opportunities. Here are a few examples.
Despite recent emerging market challenges, it is estimated that these countries as a whole still have 4% real GDP growth in 2015, and despite Jack Daniel's excellent progress over the last 20 years in these advancing economies, the brand still has a very low market share. As a result, we remain very bullish on the opportunity that exists for the company across this very large number of countries where most of the world's population resides. So as these markets grapple with their current local challenges, we intend to be patient by leveraging our company's long-term view.
While we do this, we will simultaneously intensify our focus on growing our American whiskey brand priorities in parts of the world that are a bit more conducive to growth just now. To be clear, this does not imply some radical reallocation of resources or exiting of investment positions in emerging markets. It's a more subtle shift than the expectations we will have where we are likely to drive our growth in the short term. 
For example, we are likely to expect more from the U.S. and developed international markets where premium American whiskeys are enjoying excellent momentum and consumer appeal. Or as another example, we will also strive to accomplish more on our premium tequila brands at a time when tailwinds are strong for them, particularly outside of their home country. In doing this, we will be leveraging the benefit of our excellent geographic diversification. 
This strengthening of our focus will be partially enabled by our recent sale of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, not unlike the focus that was previously enabled by the dispositions of our consumer durables and popular price businesses. This most recent disposition will permit us to allocate more of our creative time and energy to Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, Gentleman Jack, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Tennessee Fire, Woodford Reserve, Old Forester, Herradura and Sonoma-Cutrer, some of our most attractive and immediate growth opportunities. 
And with this sharpened focus, I expect that we will generate new ideas that can be impactful to the top and bottom line over time. This will be most evident through smart line extensions like Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Tennessee Fire but as well an example would be our forthcoming Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Rye which represents the distillery's first significant effort to date within the exciting U.S. rye category. 
New product development like our slain Irish whiskey project, improved packaging like our recent success with el Jimador and forthcoming enhancements on both Woodford Reserve and Finlandia, the strong appeal of the liquid we put in the bottle like Old Forester Birthday Bourbon and Herradura Ultra. 
We'll be emphasizing new formats that might better meet consumer needs like our successful Jack Daniel's and el Jimador RTD businesses. We'll be looking at enhanced marketing communications like Jack Daniel's 150th anniversary and our investment in the Old Forester homeplace; and well-timed route-to-market investments similar to what the France example from a couple of years ago and many others before it. 
I really do feel that this sharpening of our focus and the ideas that will come from it, along with keeping a proper long-term perspective about the business, will serve us well as it has before. That concludes our prepared remarks for the morning, and we're now happy to take any questions you have."

And we don't -- that part of the world, we don't have a lot of visibility into the trade environment. We do believe that is one of the drivers of the slowdown that you saw and we felt in the emerging markets. Obviously, it's been driven though by the economic malaise that's going on there and the foreign exchange devaluation. So we expect more to come. I don't know that I can predict that right now either. I think there are some markets that have held up pretty well for us. Brazil, Turkey, places like that are continuing to do very well, Mexico.

I mean, we do think it's a blend of both consumer and trade impact, particularly on the short term, the reason it's important, of course, is the trade impact can be onetime, it can rebuild depending upon what the circumstances are in those countries. I do think it's always -- I'm always reminded of the impact that's unique to either our industry but in this case, our company where you have single point production because it's the inventory adjustments that occur happen over a little bit longer period of time. Because you have time on the water, you have time going from -- because we don't sell as our company in a lot of these countries direct to retail. You go to importers, you go to agents who sometimes wholesalers. And so the trail of inventory can be longer for a single point producer who has a multiple tiered distribution system. And so that complicates it even more. I suspect some of this, if I think about weakening emerging market economies, I mean, in some level, if you look at the real GDP growth going back, I mean, they were growing at more like 8% go back 4, 5 years ago and now down to 4%, so I suspect some of it has been making its way into our results over time. And then when you have these devaluations of the currency that really impact it, you see it a little bit more dramatically. So those are qualitative comments to a quantitative question I know you asked, but we don't have great visibility into it."

So that just to get that clarity out, first and foremost. The second thing you were asking about was our share repurchase that we announced, the $1 billion, new $1 billion one as of January. I just want to take a moment and step back and talk about how we think about share repurchases in the first place. We've considered these really opportunistic investments. If you look over the past history, sometimes, we announced these things, we don't always complete them, so we remain flexible with these generally open market purchases that allows us to flexibility to start different things. And the reason why explaining that to you is because other things come up, it will, of course, invest heavily behind our organic growth of our business today, the distillery expansion, cooperage expansion, homeplace investments that we talked about. And of course, our dividends have been increasing for a number of 70 [ph] -- for 32 years, and we've given them for 70 years. So we've done all that side but we've also been want to make sure there's acquisitions that come about that meet our strategic criteria, we have that flexibility to start and stop things as we go. And then of course, if we decided to do returning the cash to shareholders, we can do that too. So we've got that out there. Just wanted to note we aren't -- will now do a calculation even if we were to complete it all, it does not offset the dilution from Southern Comfort."

Yes, and I just -- here's a way that you let these insight in how I think about it. Let me give you an example of how the sale of Southern Comfort that we announced yesterday, I can think of at least 3 pretty direct ways that it will benefit Jack Daniel's. The first is going forward is the absence of drag on the corporation's growth rate that disproportionately, Jack Daniel's over these past few years, would have to cover. So that absence of drag is a benefit to Brown-Forman Corporation also very much takes some pressure off Jack Daniel's to grow that base of operating income. The second is with the absence of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, our ability to take the time that we were devoting to those brand-building activities and rededicate them to our highest priorities. I made the example in my opening comments, let's just say in this example, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey will benefit by us to being able to redirect some of our time and attention, creative energies to that particular brand. That becomes, in fact, a multimillion dollar investment behind the Jack Daniel's business. And then the third is a little more subtle, is that the proceeds from Southern Comfort, which we had a nice gain on the sale, to the extent that you attribute that we would be going and using some of those proceeds to do some of the share repurchasing that is available to us, in effect, the way I like to think about that is for a non-selling shareholder, shareholder does not sell into a share repurchase and remain. What ends up happening in effect for them is that they, through Brown-Forman's activities, have sold Southern Comfort and made a reinvestment in Jack Daniel's for them. So I actually feel like this ends up being a multidimensional benefit for the -- for our long-term shareholder, people who are very interested in Brown-Forman's progress over generations or 5- and 10-year period. And in doing so, we've done this several times before with portfolio reshaping. And not always it had this other dimension of repurchasing shares and the remaining shareholders owning a little bit more of Brown-Forman as a result of it. But in this case, I actually think it's a wonderful use of proceeds or reallocation of our time that benefits that particular brand and the shareholders. So it's a way that you might connect a couple of the dollars that are in our news today."

So can you just give us some sense of obviously, perhaps there's a reinvestment component that you're looking at to kind of drive more of an acceleration. But just broadly speaking, your view of where kind of Jack is today and the incremental contribution that you're getting from Fire, and how much of that you think will sort of be still an incremental to the bourbon franchise."

I mean, you give a very nice summary of some of the prevailing influences. Here's just a way that you might think about it. I think in the end, if I were to summarize this to say that just because your question specifically about the United States,",712,"Sure. I mean, you give a very nice summary of some of the prevailing influences. Here's just a way that you might think about it. I think in the end, if I were to summarize this to say that just because your question specifically about the United States, a lot of this comes down to what you foresee as possible for the brand development and what are the best ways to achieve it. And I'd start with that thinking about the full trademark Jack Daniel's because of course, these line extensions do play a role in it. And I want to say something about that as well. But here's something you might think as it relates to Brown-Forman and this American whiskey momentum that exists. And I actually feel we have a difficulty, even inside our own companies trade system, to get our mentality just right on our expectations. And so let me just use this example. Jack Daniel's is roughly 5 million cases in the United States. When it advances in a year, typically say, 3% on volume, it generates 150,000 cases of incremental growth in the United States. I'll use the example of a 500,000-case brand, which is a pretty sizable brand in the U.S. market, and we've got a couple of them just short of that actually, I mean, Woodford Reserve and Gentleman Jack. And in Woodford Reserve's example, it's growing about 30% so it's growing 150,000 cases in the U.S. market. And then use the example, one that's been most resurgent here and just to show you the scale of us getting what we'd consider to be our proportionate growth in this market, even Old Forester, which would get more headlines today, relative to even Jack Daniel's because it's growing at 40%, but it's also the 100,000 case base, which gives you about a 40,000 case growth for you so just scale of magnitude. Now think about Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire. In its first full year this year, we're anticipating it'll be something like around 400,000 cases. So I mean, if you start to add these up, I really -- I mean, it is so hard when you're the leader as Jack Daniel's Black Label, Tennessee Whiskey and Brown-Forman is to expect to grow at 25% or 18% or some of these really superb growth rates that get quoted out there, particularly around some of the upstart brands. But I can -- in my own math give the examples I gave you, see that if Jack Daniel's grows 3% to 4% in the United States, it gets 150,000 to 200,000 cases of growth, which is about the same amount that our high-flying Woodford Reserve and Old Forester contributing. So those are ways we think about it. We use a lot of different metrics, not just Brown-Forman's share or Jack Daniel's share of the market. And I think we have realistic expectations about it. You've heard us talk in the past about how to think about these flavors. I think one of the hardest things for the supplier-owner to do is to get the right attitude about these. And it's my view that we will do fewer flavors on Jack Daniel's but try to sell them in more places, so think of global expansion. I think that it's a more unique opportunity for Jack Daniel's than it is many of these other trademarks that are participating in flavored whiskey. And having said that, we are going to set ambitions for ourselves that don't just launch and then let sit a new flavor. We intend to treat them as brands and which they are. I mean, Tennessee Honey today is roughly a 1.4 million case brand, has global average price of about $25 or higher. And that is a very rare accomplishment for any brand in our industry. And so internally we have to think about it as a very valuable brand and not just sort of a flavored extension from Jack Daniel's. And so it's our intent with the marketing mixes and the investments we make behind those flavors to treat them in the same way you would expect us to treat Woodford Reserve or some freestanding brand. [indiscernible] a little more color on it. Thanks for the question."

Can you give us some sense today about how you're thinking about the budgeting for fiscal '17? And by that, I mean, you've had a pretty steady trend of high single, even low double-digit operating income growth on an underlying basis. And you're seeing some issues from a growth perspective. Is it, in any way, reasonable in your mind to think of fiscal '17 as kind of an investment year or transition year or a year where you do need to slow down that rate of organic operating income growth for the sake of organic revenue growth longer term? Or is that not necessary in your mind?"

But when we look at the IRI data and back out Honey and Fire and look at the total Brown-Forman portfolio, volumetric year-on-year trends in those track to markets, we see a slowdown in those -- in that large portfolio ex these 2 extensions, which seems like a bit disconcerting if I'm in your shoes. But it could have a silver lining in the sense that you've been so focused on these innovations that there's opportunity there to simply refocus on these other brands.

And we start to move pieces in you get different insights. But I mean also could do the same thing a little bit on if we just focus on Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, our growth rates",648,"Yes, I think -- I mean, your insights on that, I think, are correct. And we start to move pieces in you get different insights. But I mean also could do the same thing a little bit on if we just focus on Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, our growth rates should be exceptional. And I think this whole concept of portfolio management is one that any company that decides to sell more than one brand has to wrestle with. I think a way I would answer yours is the think that would be dragging down our top line in IRI, you couldn't be more correct there, brands are of lower priority to us say than the new things. But what is it reflecting what's happening on the bottom line. And I actually think that it's important for people to know that even if you get a drag on a Southern Comfort or a Canadian Mist, for example, using the U.S. as an example, its impact to the bottom line would be far less significant than the focus -- the increased focus you might provide to a very high gross profit per case item like a Tennessee Fire or a Woodford Reserve. Related to your -- but nonetheless, you want to reduce drag wherever you can, either through the improved performance or on the example of Southern Comfort and Tuaca through literally the disposition of the business. I mean, so in those cases, you reduce drag. Stuff we keep, I mean, we absolutely have to put our best foot forward and so you can expect us to try to do that. I don't think it would be in the best interest of Brown-Forman's long-term value creation to take our eye off of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey and pursue try to improve Early Times, for example. They're both great brands and they're [indiscernible] but Jack Daniel's is decidedly more important at Brown-Forman. And it's so it's something that we would continue to prioritize. I do think on the Honey -- Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Tennessee Fire comments that you opened with there, I do think it's important for you to know that the Tennessee Fire, yes, it has had some both wholesale which inventory build, which will be reflected in our earnings per share and retail during its first full year, but it's also had very nice consumer velocity as well. It hasn't just been a pipeline shove on just sort of sitting out there. I mean, the data we're looking at tells it's a very successful brand in its own right because our only internal benchmark at times were against Tennessee Honey or our most competitive people in the company were actually aiming at Fireball. So depending upon what your frame of reference is, you might be a little more disappointed than others. But brands that achieve in first full year of national distribution, 400,000 cases are sort of runaway successes. And to do it with limited cannibalization, bringing in new consumers, very premium price points and having both defensive and offensive properties, it's a very big success for us. Now that we've gotten out of the marketplace, the big challenge for all of us, our sales and marketing teams particularly, is how do we grow it in the United States. We know we can expand it geographically because there's more call for it today than we supplied. So that'll be something that will be interesting for us to explain to you as we get out into June and update you on our expansion plan. But a big thing just as it was for Honey in its second and third years were how is it going to grow in the United States? What levers do we pull to ensure that it continues to be treated like the regular strong consumer brand that we think it should be?"

So those will be some contributing. I also think silly for us not to say a little bit of cannibalization that can contribute to Tennessee Honey from Fire's launch, and that could be a little bit consumer. It could also just be focus and attention or sharing displays and some of these other things that go on when you are selling things from the same family. But it still presents the same question. How do we, in year 6 and beyond in the United States, continue to build the brand in a way that competes better versus what the competitive references are out there?

I'll cover 2 topics today, which should leave plenty of time for questions after our prepared remarks. First, I'll review our year-to-date results, and then I'll discuss our revised outlook for fiscal 2016.
So let me start by reviewing our recent results. Against the backdrop of deteriorating economic conditions and foreign exchange moves that negatively impacted our reported results, we delivered solid underlying net sales growth of 4% in the third quarter. 
These results reflect the 2 different economic realities: on the one hand, we delivered strong and consistent growth in the developed world, where underlying net sales were up 6% year-to-date; on the other hand, we experienced decelerating results in the emerging markets and continued weakness in our Global Travel Retail channel. Third quarter results put our year-to-date underlying net sales growth to 5%.
Top line results in the United States maintained their healthy momentum, growing 7% in the third quarter and in line with the 7% we delivered in the first half of the fiscal year. This great performance was led by the leading portfolio of authentic American whiskeys, including the Jack Daniel's family of brands, up 7%, and Old Forester and Woodford Reserve both gaining share in the rapidly growing bourbon category. 
Our tequila brands delivered strong growth in the United States, with Herradura and el Jimador up in the teens. 
Developed markets outside the United States grew underlying net sales 5% during the first 9 months of our fiscal year. Improving results in Australia were more than offset by Germany's third quarter declines, where our business was negatively impacted by seasonal trading patterns that we expect to reverse in the fourth quarter. Excluding this timing issue in Germany, our nondeveloped U.S. markets -- our non-U.S. developed markets are up 6%, in line with first half growth of 6%. The United Kingdom, France, Canada and Spain each delivered solid rates of growth, while Japan was flat.
Takeaway trends in the developed world also remained strong and in some cases, even better than our underlying depletion trends. 3-month blended takeaway for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey in the United States is steady at around 3% and is currently lapping its toughest comparison from last year. In the United Kingdom and France, takeaway is up almost 10%. Germany's takeaway is up over 10%, and Australia is showing slight growth. These solid takeaway trends for Jack Daniel's give us optimism about our business outlook in the developed markets. 
Moving now to the emerging world, where, for the first time in several years, our emerging markets business underperformed the developed world with year-to-date growth of 5%. Historically, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey has been growing in the mid-high teens in the emerging markets fueled by strong market share gain. But the deteriorating economic conditions and worsening spirits trends have temporarily slowed Jack Daniel's underlying net sales growth into the high single digits. This deceleration equates to removing 1 point of incremental net sales growth from our underlying results.
While we don't have a large exposure to any one particular emerging economy, the slowdown has been pervasive across most markets and could persist over the near term until economic and geopolitical pressures lessen. In the meantime, however, we continue to lay the groundwork, saving these markets so that when economic growth accelerates, we will be well positioned. And in 2 emerging markets where we have visibility on takeaway trends, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey is up mid-teens in Poland and almost 30% in Mexico.
In addition to the slowdown in emerging markets, our Global Travel Retail business remained under pressure in the quarter, resulting in a 13% year-to-date decline. So while our Travel Retail business is still relatively small, this has reduced the company's net sales growth by about 0.5 point. In the aggregate, the slowing emerging markets and declines in the Travel Retail channel pulled 1.5 points of growth off of our year-to-date underlying net sales growth of 5%.
Looking at our results through the brand lens, the Jack Daniel's family of brands led the way with underlying net sales growth of 7%. Core Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey grew 4% in the first 9 months, and brands such as Tennessee Fire, Tennessee Honey and Gentleman Jack all helped drive even higher growth for the family. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire contributed over 1 point of year-to-date underlying net sales growth and depleted over 400,000 9-liter cases in its first 12 months despite the backdrop of intense competition in flavors. This growth has come from bringing in many new-to-whiskey consumers, a group that overindexes to millennial women and Latinos. 
Our brands -- other brands with standout underlying net sales growth include Woodford Reserve, up 29%; and Old Forester, which grew over 50%. el Jimador and Herradura tequila both delivered impressive global results. And Sonoma-Cutrer and Korbel champagne have grown underlying net sales by mid-single digits so far this year. 
Underlying net sales growth was dragged down by declines in Southern Comfort, Finlandia and Canadian Mist. As you know, we closed on the sale of Southern Comfort and Tuaca yesterday, and I'll discuss that in more detail in a few minutes. Finlandia sales declined due to challenging conditions in 2 of its largest markets, Poland and Russia. And Canadian Mist results were hurt by competitive price pressures and the transition to new price packaging.
Let's move now to a reconciliation of reported to underlying results. The U.S. dollar has continued to appreciate against most currencies, which is weighing heavily on our reported results. Year-to-date, foreign exchange has negatively affected our net sales growth by 8 points. Price/mix was up 4 points year-to-date, driven largely by better mix. The -- and effects of fast growth in our American whiskey portfolio and declining sales of lower-priced brands have resulted in this favorable mix, helping drive a 40 basis point improvement in gross margins. 
Underlying A&P spend increased 1%, while underlying SG&A grew 4%. Both line items were a few points lower on a reported basis as foreign exchange helped our non-U.S. dollar-denominated cost. Putting this all together, we delivered 7% year-to-date growth in underlying operating income. Foreign exchange headwinds hurt our operating income line by 5 points, resulted in reported operating income growth of 2%. 
For the first 9 months of the year, earnings per share came in at $2.65, up 4% over last year. EPS was helped by a slightly lower tax rate and lower share count. Foreign exchange was a $0.14 drag on reported EPS. So excluding netbacks, year-over-year growth in EPS would have been approximately 10%.
Moving now to my second and final topic, an update on our full year outlook for fiscal 2016. Excluding the estimated gain on the sale of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, we revised our full year outlook down today to incorporate the emerging market slowdown, continued weakness in the Global Travel Retail channel as well as the impact from adverse foreign exchange. While we typically discuss foreign exchange moves and its impact on our reported results, foreign exchange also negatively impacted our underlying growth. We see this manifest itself in a number of ways, including the decline in the purchasing power of our consumers, most notably in emerging market economies, as well as the negative impact of purchasing pattern of our trade partners. 
We now expect our underlying net sales to grow approximately 5% in fiscal 2016, slightly below last year's 6% rate of growth but well ahead of the 2% growth that we estimate of our peer group. While we are disappointed that our growth has moderated slightly due to the deteriorating economic conditions throughout the emerging economies of the world, our view remains unchanged that these economies will become increasingly important growth drivers for the company over the coming years. We believe that we are in the early stages of realizing their long-term growth potential given our low market share today.
We expect modest gross margin expansion for the year, which helps position us for solid operating income growth as we look to continue to leverage some of the investments we have been making over the last few years to build our brand. These investments go far beyond the A&P line and include the people we have added into the marketplace such as the France, Germany and Brazil route-to-market changes, our investments in packaging as well as the significant capital we have been investing in our production operations. 
In summary, we expect 7% to 9% underlying growth in operating income for fiscal 2016. This 1 point reduction in operating income growth equates to roughly $0.03 less of earnings per share. Foreign exchange is now anticipated to be approximately $0.06 worse than our expectations were at the time of our second quarter earnings call. 
And as you know, we closed on the sale of Southern Comfort and Tuaca yesterday. The absence of these brands from our results in March and April will pull an additional $0.04 off of our full year expectations. These negative items are partially offset by $0.05 due to a lower tax rate and lower share count. Taking all these puts and takes into consideration equates to an $0.08 lowering of our EPS range in fiscal 2016, which we also tightened to $3.32 to $3.42. This range excludes the estimated $483 million gain from the sale of Southern Comfort and Tuaca. Including this gain, we'd adjust our earnings per share range to $4.97 to $5.07 in fiscal 2016. 
Given the continued volatility in foreign exchange and assuming foreign currency cash flow exposure collectively move 10% in either direction, our EPS over the balance of the year will be impacted by roughly $0.04.
Just to add a little color on our fourth quarter. This full year outlook incorporates the challenging top line comparisons we expect in the fourth quarter, given last year's launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire in the United States. Fourth quarter growth should be helped somewhat by normal trading patterns in Germany as well as expanding Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire in the United Kingdom and Australia, where the brand has been performing well in its limited test phase. We are currently evaluating opportunities for additional expansion beyond these markets.
This year's fourth quarter results should also benefit from favorable comparisons on our tax rate and other operating expense items that pulled down last year's fourth quarter earnings.
Now before I pass the call over to Paul for some brief comments, I thought it would be helpful to discuss our thought process behind selling Southern Comfort. We acquired Southern Comfort for $90 million in 1979. Despite encountering some cycles over the last 37 years, Southern Comfort has enjoyed a dominant position in the flavored spirits category, given limited direct competition, generating substantial cash flow and return on its investment to the company over that time. But as you know, the competitive landscape in flavored whiskey has heated up over the last few years, including some of our own brand introductions such as Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire and Honey. And this competition has been eroding Southern Comfort's leading share, resulting in persistent sales declines since 2008. 
So over the last few years, we have allocated additional time, focus and dollars toward reinvigorating the brand with limited success and reached the conclusion that we should sell the brand and rededicate resources to brands that we believe have greater long-term growth prospects and can create more value for our shareholders. 
So after a thorough sales process, we agreed to sell Southern Comfort and Tuaca for approximately $542 million. In addition to the increased focus that we will be dedicating to our remaining brands and expectations for faster portfolio growth once we move past the current economic malaise, the proceeds from this sale strengthen an already great balance sheet. Our balance sheet flexibility in turn allows us to invest in our organic growth; consider acquisitions that meet our strategic criteria; and be opportunistic at reducing our share count, including the $1 billion buyback authorization that we announced in late January that commences on April 1, 2016.
As a point of reference, in fiscal 2015, Southern Comfort and Tuaca generated $70 million in operating income and $0.24 of EPS. And our year-to-date underlying net sales growth would have been 6%, excluding these brands. This portfolio management has been an ongoing exercise over the past 2 decades as we focus Brown-Forman's portfolio on high-margin, high-return spirits brands with improved long-term growth prospects. Our portfolio of strategy entails not just divesting brands such as Southern Comfort and Tuaca, but also taking the long-term perspective to invest in developing the brands that have the potential to drive the next few decades of growth. This was the case behind launching Woodford Reserve in the depth of the bourbon declines in the 1990s, acquiring Southern Comfort in 1999 and Casa Herradura in 2007, introducing Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey in 2011 and the reason why we are investing in Slane Irish whiskey today. 
So in closing, we continue to deliver industry-leading underlying growth in net sales and operating income. We attribute this top line outperformance to our portfolio focus on Jack Daniel's and our American whiskeys against an excellent global opportunity for them. Our SKU to premium price points allows us to deliver high margins. And with single-point production efficiencies, we have been able to generate great returns on our investments and strong cash flow. We have maintained a consistent long-range perspective to investing this cash flow, focusing first and foremost on investing in our organic growth opportunities. We are doing so today through distillery expansions, adding barrel-making capacity and making homeplace investments. 
We have used our growing cash flow to consistently increase the dividend over the last 32 years, making Brown-Forman a member of the prestigious dividend aristocrat. We maintain an active approach to portfolio management, and we generate substantial free cash flows, which allows us to continue returning cash to our shareholders. 
And so with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Paul for some of his comments. Paul?"

As a summary, I thought Q3 was a pretty solid underlying quarter for us, given that during the November through January time period, we witnessed the terrorist attacks in Paris, the continued difficulty for em",851,"Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everybody. As a summary, I thought Q3 was a pretty solid underlying quarter for us, given that during the November through January time period, we witnessed the terrorist attacks in Paris, the continued difficulty for emerging market economies and currencies and a very rough start for the calendar year 2016 equity markets in January. 
By contributing to a halo of uncertainty, these forces play a role in moderating the consumer and trade's willingness to purchase in the short term. As a result and despite Brown-Forman's favorable geographic diversification, we were not immune to these factors as they weighed somewhat on the quarter's underlying sales growth rate, which was still a very nice 4%. 
Our year-to-date underlying growth in sales and operating income now stand at 5% and 7%, respectively, and our 12-month return on invested capital remained very strong at 22%. These growth and return metrics remain ahead of our industry competitive set. 
As in past quarters and consistent with other U.S.-based companies, these very nice organic year-to-date results are being offset by a strengthening dollar, and this continued to weigh on reported results. In our case, it had the effect of reducing our year-to-date underlying operating income growth from 7% to 2%.
With these factors present as current headwinds, you might be wondering if we're altering our course in any way. Let me touch on that briefly. Looking back on other challenging macroeconomic environments we've encountered, I feel that we've been very well served by prioritizing 3 things: first, keeping our long-term perspective; second, intensifying and narrowing our focus on the very best growth opportunities we perceive for the company; and third, bringing new ideas that can capitalize on those opportunities. Here are a few examples.
Despite recent emerging market challenges, it is estimated that these countries as a whole still have 4% real GDP growth in 2015. And despite Jack Daniel's excellent progress over the last 20 years in these advancing economies, the brand still has a very low market share. As a result, we remain very bullish on the opportunity that exists for the company across this very large number of countries, where most of the world's population resides. So as these markets grapple with their current local challenges, we intend to be patient by leveraging our company's long-term view. While we do this, we will simultaneously intensify our focus on growing our American whiskey brand priorities in parts of the world that are a bit more conducive to growth just now. To be clear, this does not imply some radical reallocation of resources or exiting of investment positions in emerging markets. It's a more subtle shift in the expectations we will have for where we are likely to drive our growth in the short term. 
For example, we are likely to expect more from the U.S. and developed international markets, where premium American whiskeys are enjoying excellent momentum and consumer appeal. Or as another example, we will also strive to accomplish more on our premium tequila brands at a time when tailwinds are strong for them, particularly outside of their home country. In doing this, we will be leveraging the benefit of our excellent geographic diversification. 
This strengthening of our focus will be partially enabled by our recent sale of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, not unlike the focus that was previously enabled by the dispositions of our consumer durables and popular-priced wine businesses. This most recent disposition will permit us to allocate more of our creative time and energy to Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, Gentleman Jack, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Tennessee Fire, Woodford Reserve, Old Forester, Herradura and Sonoma-Cutrer, some of our most attractive and immediate growth opportunities. And with this sharpened focus, I expect that we will generate new ideas that can be impactful to the top and bottom line over time. This will be most evident through smart line extensions like Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Tennessee Fire, but as well an example would be our forthcoming Jack Daniel's Single Barrel rye, which represents the distillery's first significant effort to date within the exciting U.S. rye category; new product development like our Slane Irish whiskey project; improved packaging like our recent success with el Jimador and forthcoming enhancements on both Woodford Reserve and Finlandia; the strong appeal of the liquid we put in the bottle like Old Forester Birthday Bourbon and Herradura Ultra. 
We'll be emphasizing new formats that might better meet consumer needs like our successful Jack Daniel's and el Jimador RTD businesses. We'll be looking at enhanced marketing communications like Jack Daniel's 150th anniversary and our investment in the Old Forester homeplace; and well-timed route-to-market investments similar to the France example from a couple of years ago and many others before it. I really do feel that this sharpening of our focus and the ideas that will come from it, along with keeping a proper long-term perspective about the business, will serve us well as it has before. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for the morning, and we're now happy to take any questions you have."

And we don't -- that part of the world, we don't have a lot of visibility into the trade environment. We do believe that is a -- one of the drivers of the slowdown that you saw and we felt in the emerging markets. Obviously, it's been driven, though, by the economic malaise that's going on there and the foreign exchange devaluation. So we expect more to come. I don't know that I can predict that right now either. I think there are some markets that are -- have held up pretty well for us. Brazil, Turkey, places like that are continuing to do very well, Mexico. And we quoted some takeaway numbers in Poland and Mexico on Jack, and they're very strong at this point."

I mean, I think the only point I'd add, I mean, it's just so hard for us to get a single metric that can help us, first of all, and then help you all understand what might be underlying the results. I mean, we do think it's a blend of both consumer and trade impact, particularly on the short term. And the reason it's important, of course, is that the trade impact can be onetime and can rebuild with -- depending upon what the circumstances are in those countries. I do think it's always -- I'm always reminded of the impact that's unique to either our industry and -- but in this case, our company, where you have single-point production because it's -- the inventory adjustments that occur happen over a little bit longer period of time. As -- because you have time on the water, you have time going from -- because we don't sell as our company in a lot of these countries direct to retail. You go to importers who go to agents who sometimes go to subwholesalers. And so the trail of inventory can be longer for a single-point producer, who has a multiple-tiered distribution system. And so that complicates it even more. I suspect some of this, if I think about weakening emerging market economies, I mean, in some level, if you look at the real GDP growth going back, I mean, they were growing at more like 8% go back 4 or 5 years ago, and now down to 4%. So I suspect some of it has been making its way into our results over time. And then when you have these devaluations of the currency that really impact it, you see it a little bit more dramatically. So those are qualitative comments to a quantitative question I know you asked, but we don't have great visibility into it."

But back in the FY '12, '13 and even a little bit into '14, in a lot of these emerging markets, we took pretty significant price increases mostly for price positioning and premiumization. We've -- there's not as many big global brands in a lot of these countries. That's like places like Africa. Even in a country like Mexico, we felt at the time there was an opportunity to go up. But we found that we -- it was better for us to do that with sort of large increases versus a bunch of small ones at the time. So in some of these places, we went up 10% or 12%. And so -- and those will soften your volumes a little bit. They'll have that impact.

The second thing you were asking about was our share repurchase that we announced, the $1 billion -- new $1 billion one as of January. I just want to take a moment and step back and talk about how we think about share repurchases in the first place. We've considered these really opportunistic investments. If you look over the past history, sometimes, we announce these things. We don't always complete them. So we remain flexible with these. We generally do them through open market purchases that allows us the flexibility to start and stop different things. And the reason why I'm explaining that to you is because if other things come up, it will, of course, invest heavily behind our organic growth of our business today, the distillery expansion, cooperage expansion, homeplace investments, as we talked about. And of course, our dividends have been increasing for a number of 70 -- for 32 years. And we've given them for 70 years. So -- and we've done all that side, but we also have been -- want to make sure if there's acquisitions that come about that meet our strategic criteria, we have that flexibility to start and stop things as we go. And then, of course, if we decided to do returning cash to shareholders, we can do that, too. So we've got that out there. Just wanted you to know, we aren't forecasting -- will not do a calculation. Even if we were to complete it all, it does not offset the dilution from Southern Comfort."

Let me give you an example of how the sale of Southern Comfort that we announced yesterday, I can think of at least 3 pretty direct ways that it will benefit Jack Daniel's: the first is -- going forward is the absence of drag on the corporation's growth rate that, disproportionately, Jack Daniel's over these past few years would have to cover. So that absence of drag is a benefit to Brown-Forman Corporation. It very -- would also very much take some pressure off Jack Daniel's to grow that base of operating income. The second is with the absence of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, our ability to take the time that we were devoting to those brand-building activities and rededicate them to our highest priorities. I'd made the example in my opening comment. But let's just say, in this example, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey will benefit by us to being able to redirect some of our time and attention and creative energies to that particular brand. That becomes, in fact, a multimillion dollar investment behind the Jack Daniel's business. And then the third is, a little more subtle, is that the proceeds from Southern Comfort, which we had a nice gain on the sale, to the extent that you attribute that we would be going and using some of those proceeds to do some of the share repurchasing that is available to us -- in effect, the way I like to think about that is for a nonselling shareholder, a shareholder who does not sell into a share repurchase and remain, what ends up happening in effect for them is that they, through Brown-Forman's activities, have sold Southern Comfort and made a reinvestment in Jack Daniel's for them. So I actually feel like this ends up being a multidimensional benefit for the -- for our long-term shareholders, people who are very interested in Brown-Forman's progress over generations or 5- and 10-year period. And in doing so -- we've done this several times before with portfolio reshaping. And not always that it had this other dimension of repurchasing shares and the remaining shareholders owning a little bit more of Brown-Forman as a result of it. But in this case, I actually think it's a wonderful use of proceeds or reallocation of our time that benefits that particular brand and the shareholders. So it's a way to, as you might, connect the couple of the dots that are in our news today."

I mean, you did -- gave a very nice summary of some of the prevailing influences. Here's just a way that you might think about it. I think in the end, with -- if I were to summarize this to say that -- because your question was specifically about the United States, a lot of this comes down to what do you foresee as possible for the brand development and what are the best ways to achieve it. And I'd start with that thinking about the full trademark Jack Daniel's because, of course, these line extensions do play a role in it. And I want to say something about that as well. But here's something you might think about as it relates to Brown-Forman and this American whiskey momentum that exists. And I actually feel like we have a difficulty, even inside our own company or through our trade system, to get our mentality just right on our expectations. And so let me just use this example. Jack Daniel's is roughly 5 million cases in the United States. When it advances in a year, typically, say, 3% on volume, it generates 150,000 cases of incremental growth in the United States. I'll use the example of a 500,000-case brand, which is a pretty sizable brand in the U.S. market. And we've got a couple of them -- or short of that, actually, I mean, Woodford Reserve and Gentleman Jack. And in Woodford Reserve's example, it's growing about 30%. So it's growing 150,000 cases in the U.S. market. And then to use the example -- I mean, one that's been most resurgent here, and just to show you the scale of us getting what we've considered to be our proportionate growth in this market, even Old Forester, which would get more headlines today, relative to even Jack Daniel's because it's growing at 40%. But it's also a 100,000-case base, which gives you about a 40,000-case growth per year. So I just used these for scale of magnitude. Now think about Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire. In its first full year this year, we're anticipating it'll be something like around 400,000 cases. So I mean, if you start to add these up, I really -- I mean, it is so hard when you're the leader as Jack Daniel's, Black Label, Tennessee Whiskey and Brown-Forman is to expect to grow at 25% or 18% or some of these really superb growth rates that get quoted out there, particularly around some of the upstart brands. But I can, in my own math there, and with the examples I gave you, see that if Jack Daniel's grows 3% to 4% in the United States, it gets 150,000 to 200,000 cases of growth, which is about the same amount that our high-flying Woodford Reserve and Old Forester are contributing. So those are ways we think about it. We use a lot of different metrics, not just Brown-Forman's share or Jack Daniel's share of the market. And I think we have realistic expectations about it. You've heard us talk in the past about how to think about these flavors. I think one of the hardest things for the supplier-owner to do is to get the right attitude about these. And it's my view that we will do fewer flavors on Jack Daniel's but try to sell them in more places, so think of global expansion. I think that is a more unique opportunity for Jack Daniel's than it is many of these other trademarks that are participating in flavored whiskey. And having said that, we are going to set ambitions for ourselves that don't just launch and then let sit a new flavor. We intend to treat them as brands and -- which they are. I mean, Tennessee Honey today is a 1 -- roughly a 1.4 million case brand, global average price of about $25 or higher. And that is a very rare accomplishment for any brand in our industry. And so internally, we have to think about it as a very valuable brand and not just sort of a flavored extension from Jack Daniel's. And so it's our intent with the marketing mixes and the investments we make behind those flavors to treat them in the same way you would expect us to treat Woodford Reserve or some freestanding brand, okay? Did that help you get a little more color on it? Thanks for the question."

And when you start to move pieces in and out, you get different insights. But I mean, I also could do the same thing a little bit on. If we just focus on Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, our growth rates should be exceptional. And I think this whole concept of portfolio management is one that any company that decides to sell more than one brand has to wrestle with. I think a way I would answer yours is the things that would be dragging down our top line in IRI, you couldn't be more correct there, brands are of lower priority to us, say, than the new things. But what -- isn't reflecting what's happening at the bottom line. And I actually think that it's important for people to know that even if you get a drag on a Southern Comfort or a Canadian Mist, for example, using the U.S. as an example, its impact at the bottom line will be far less significant than the focus -- the increased focus you might provide to a very high gross profit per case item like a Tennessee Fire or a Woodford Reserve. Related to your -- but nonetheless, you want to reduce drag wherever you can, either through the improved performance or on the example to Southern Comfort and Tuaca through literally the disposition of the business. I mean, so in those cases, you reduce drag. The stuff we keep, I mean, we absolutely have to put our best foot forward, and so you can expect us to try to do that. I don't think it would be in the best interest of Brown-Forman's long-term value creation to take our eye off of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey and pursue to trying to improve Early Times, for example. They're both great brands and they're unripe, but Jack Daniel's is decidedly more important at Brown-Forman. And so it's something that we would continue to prioritize. I do think on the Honey -- the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Tennessee Fire comments that you opened with there, I do think it's important for you to know that the Tennessee Fire, yes, it has had some both wholesale, which would -- inventory build, which would be reflected in our earnings per share and retail during its first full year, but it's also had very nice consumer velocity as well. It hasn't just been a pipeline shove on -- and it's just sort of sitting out there. I mean, the data we're looking at tells us it's a very successful brand in its own right because our own internal benchmarks at times were against Tennessee Honey or our most competitive people in the company were actually aiming at Fireball. So depending upon what your frame of reference is, you might be a little more disappointed than others. But brands that achieve in the first full year of national distribution 400,000 cases are sort of runaway successes. And to do it with limited cannibalization, bringing in new consumers, very premium price points and having both defensive and offensive properties, it's a very big success for us. Now that we've got it out in the marketplace, the big challenge for all of us, our sales and marketing teams particularly, is how do we grow it in the United States. We know we can expand it geographically because there's more call for it today than we supplied. So that will be something that will be interesting for us to explain to you as we get out into June and update you on our expansion plans. But a big thing, just as it was for Honey in its second and third years, is how is it going to grow in the United States? What levers do we pull to ensure that it continues to be treated like the regular strong consumer brand that we think it should be?"

And I would attribute -- I mean, if I were diagnosing, and I don't have the component pieces here, I'd say the contributing factors would be the big halo of competition. And some of that from -- within the honey flavor segment within flavored whiskey, there's been an increase of honey competition, but then also just within flavored whiskey, as particularly this apple category took off here in the last year. So those would be some contributing things. I also think that -- I mean, it would be silly for us not to say, there had been a little bit of cannibalization that can contribute to Tennessee Honey from Fire's launch, and that could be a little bit consumer. It could also just be focus and attention or sharing displays and some of these other things that go on when you are selling things from the same family. But it still presents the same question. How do we, in year 6 and beyond, in the United States continue to build the brand in a way that competes better versus what the competitive references are out there? So it's the -- for our Brown-Forman employees who are listening, that's the question we're focused on. And yes, it really is. I mean, it's very true. And the same things are going to be true with the ensuing. We're already looking at sort of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire. Remember, it had some test markets that go back more than 1 year so you can start to learn a little bit more from those markets as well. And with the passage of time, all, I think, new brand entries have this sort of challenge. And I think in my view, the answer is to go put 5 more flavors out in the market. It's to really focus on building these brands."

I'll cover 2 topics today, which should leave plenty of time for questions after our prepared remarks. First, I'll review our year-to-date results, and then I'll discuss our revised outlook for fiscal 2016.
So let me start by reviewing our recent results. Against a backdrop of deteriorating economic conditions and foreign exchange moves that negatively impacted our reported results, we delivered solid underlying net sales growth of 4% in the third quarter. 
These results reflected 2 different economic realities: on the one hand, we delivered strong and consistent growth in the developed world, where underlying net sales were up 6% year-to-date. On the other hand, we experienced decelerating results in the emerging markets and continued weakness in our Global Travel Retail channel. Third quarter results pulled our year-to-date underlying net sales growth to 5%.
Top line results in the United States maintained their healthy momentum, growing 7% in the third quarter and in line with the 7% we delivered in the first half of the fiscal year. This great performance was led by the leading portfolio of authentic American whiskeys, including the Jack Daniel's family of brands, up 7%, and Old Forester and Woodford Reserve both gaining share in the rapidly growing bourbon category. 
Our tequila brands delivered strong growth in the United States, with Herradura and el Jimador up in the teens. 
Developed markets outside the United States grew underlying net sales 5% during the first 9 months of our fiscal year. Improving results in Australia were more than offset by Germany's third quarter declines, where our business was negatively impacted by seasonal trading patterns that we expect to reverse in the fourth quarter. Excluding this timing issue in Germany, our nondeveloped U.S. markets -- our non-U.S. developed markets are up 6%, in line with first half growth of 6%. The United Kingdom, France, Canada and Spain each delivered solid rates of growth, while Japan was flat.
Takeaway trends in the developed world also remained strong and in some cases, even better than our underlying depletion trends. 3-month blended takeaway for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey in the United States is steady at around 3% and is currently lapping its toughest comparison from last year. In the United Kingdom and France, takeaway is up almost 10%. Germany's takeaway is up over 10%, and Australia is showing slight growth. These solid takeaway trends for Jack Daniel's give us optimism about our business outlook in the developed markets. 
Moving now to the emerging world, where for the first time in several years our emerging markets business underperformed the developed world with year-to-date growth of 5%. Historically, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey has been growing in the mid to high teens in the emerging markets, fueled by strong market share gains. But the deteriorating economic conditions and worsening spirits trends have temporarily slowed Jack Daniel's underlying net sales growth into the high single digits. This deceleration equates to removing 1 point of incremental net sales growth from our underlying results.
While we don't have large exposure to any one particular emerging economy, the slowdown has been pervasive across most markets and could persist over the near term until economic and geopolitical pressures lessen. In the meantime, however, we continue to lay the groundwork, seeding these markets so that when economic growth accelerates, we will be well positioned. And in 2 emerging markets where we have visibility on takeaway trends, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey is up mid-teens in Poland and almost 30% in Mexico.
In addition to the slowdown in emerging markets, our Global Travel Retail business remained under pressure in the quarter, resulting in a 13% year-to-date decline. So while our Travel Retail business is still relatively small, this has reduced the company's net sales growth by about 0.5 point. In the aggregate, the slowing emerging markets and declines in the Travel Retail channel pulled 1.5 points of growth off of our year-to-date underlying net sales growth of 5%.
Looking at our results through the brand lens, the Jack Daniel's family of brands led the way with underlying net sales growth of 7%. Core Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey grew 4% in the first 9 months, and brands such as Tennessee Fire, Tennessee Honey and Gentleman Jack all helped drive even higher growth for the family. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire contributed over 1 point of year-to-date underlying net sales growth and depleted over 400,000 9-liter cases in its first 12 months, despite the backdrop of intense competition in flavors. This growth has come from bringing in many new-to-whiskey consumers, a group that overindexes to millennial women and Latinos. 
Our brands -- other brands with standout underlying net sales growth include Woodford Reserve, up 29%; and Old Forester, which grew over 50%. el Jimador and Herradura tequila both delivered impressive global results. And Sonoma-Cutrer and Korbel champagne have grown underlying net sales by mid-single digits so far this year. 
Underlying net sales growth was dragged down by declines in Southern Comfort, Finlandia and Canadian Mist. As you know, we closed on the sale of Southern Comfort and Tuaca yesterday, and I'll discuss that in more detail in a few minutes. Finlandia sales declined due to challenging conditions in 2 of its largest markets, Poland and Russia. And Canadian Mist results were hurt by competitive price pressures and the transition to new price packaging.
Let's move now to a reconciliation of reported to underlying results. The U.S. dollar has continued to appreciate against most currencies, which is weighing heavily on our reported results. Year-to-date, foreign exchange has negatively affected our net sales growth by 8 points. Price/mix was up 4 points year-to-date, driven largely by better mix. The cap -- and effects of fast growth in our American whiskey portfolio and declining sales of lower-priced brands have resulted in this favorable mix, helping drive a 40 basis point improvement in gross margins. 
Underlying A&P spend increased 1%, while underlying SG&A grew 4%. Both line items were a few points lower on a reported basis as foreign exchange helped our non-U.S. dollar-denominated costs. Putting this all together, we delivered 7% year-to-date growth in underlying operating income. Foreign exchange headwinds hurt our operating income line by 5 points, resulting in reported operating income growth of 2%. 
For the first 9 months of the year, earnings per share came in at $2.65, up 4% over last year. EPS was helped by a slightly lower tax rate and lower share count. Foreign exchange was a $0.14 drag on reported EPS. So excluding netbacks, year-over-year growth in EPS would have been approximately 10%.
Moving now to my second and final topic, an update on our full year outlook for fiscal 2016. Excluding the estimated gain on the sale of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, we revised our full year outlook down today to incorporate the emerging market slowdown, continued weakness in the Global Travel Retail channel as well as the impact from adverse foreign exchange. While we typically discuss foreign exchange moves and its impact on our reported results, foreign exchange also negatively impacted our underlying growth. We see this manifest itself in a number of ways, including the decline in the purchasing power of our consumers, most notably in emerging market economies, as well as the negative impact of purchasing patterns of our trade partners. 
We now expect our underlying net sales to grow approximately 5% in fiscal 2016, slightly below last year's 6% rate of growth but well ahead of the 2% growth that we estimate of our peer group. While we are disappointed that our growth has moderated slightly due to the deteriorating economic conditions throughout the emerging economies of the world, our view remains unchanged that these economies will become increasingly important growth drivers for the company over the coming years. We believe that we are in the early stages of realizing their long-term growth potential given our low market share today.
We expect modest gross margin expansion for the year, which helps position us for solid operating income growth as we look to continue to leverage some of the investments we have been making over the last few years to build our brands. These investments go far beyond the A&P line and include the people we have added into the marketplace such as the France, Germany and Brazil route-to-market changes, our investments in packaging as well as the significant capital we have been investing in our production operations. 
In summary, we expect 7% to 9% underlying growth in operating income for fiscal 2016. This 1 point reduction in operating income growth equates to roughly $0.03 less of earnings per share. Foreign exchange is now anticipated to be approximately $0.06 worse than our expectations were at the time of our second quarter earnings call. 
And as you know, we closed on the sale of Southern Comfort and Tuaca yesterday. The absence of these brands from our results in March and April will pull an additional $0.04 off of our full year expectations. These negative items are partially offset by $0.05 due to a lower tax rate and lower share count. Taking all these puts and takes into consideration equates to an $0.08 lowering of our EPS range in fiscal 2016, which we also tightened to $3.32 to $3.42. This range excludes the estimated $483 million gain from the sale of Southern Comfort and Tuaca. Including this gain would adjust our earnings per share range to $4.97 to $5.07 in fiscal 2016. 
Given the continued volatility in foreign exchange and assuming foreign currency cash flow exposure collectively move 10% in either direction, our EPS over the balance of the year would be impacted by roughly $0.04.
Just to add a little color on our fourth quarter. This full year outlook incorporates the challenging top line comparisons we expect in the fourth quarter, given last year's launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire in the United States. Fourth quarter growth should be helped somewhat by normal trading patterns in Germany as well as expanding Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire in the United Kingdom and Australia, where the brand has been performing well in its limited test phase. We are currently evaluating opportunities for additional expansion beyond these markets.
This year's fourth quarter results should also benefit from favorable comparisons on our tax rate and other operating expense items that pulled down last year's fourth quarter earnings.
Now before I pass the call over to Paul for some brief comments, I thought it would be helpful to discuss our thought process behind selling Southern Comfort. We acquired Southern Comfort for $90 million in 1979. Despite encountering some cycles over the last 37 years, Southern Comfort has enjoyed a dominant position in the flavored spirits category, given limited direct competition, generating substantial cash flow and return on its investment to the company over that time. But as you know, the competitive landscape in flavored whiskey has heated up over the last few years, including some of our own brand introductions such as Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire and Honey. And this competition has been eroding Southern Comfort's leading share, resulting in persistent sales declines since 2008. 
So over the last few years, we have allocated additional time, focus and dollars toward reinvigorating the brand, with limited success, and reached the conclusion that we should sell the brand and rededicate resources to brands that we believe have greater long-term growth prospects and can create more value for our shareholders. 
So after a thorough sales process, we agreed to sell Southern Comfort and Tuaca for approximately $542 million. In addition to the increased focus that we will be dedicating to our remaining brands and expectations for faster portfolio growth once we move past the current economic malaise, the proceeds from this sale strengthen an already great balance sheet. Our balance sheet flexibility in turn allows us to invest in our organic growth; consider acquisitions that meet our strategic criteria; and be opportunistic at reducing our share count, including the $1 billion buyback authorization that we announced in late January that commences on April 1, 2016.
As a point of reference, in fiscal 2015, Southern Comfort and Tuaca generated $70 million in operating income and $0.24 of EPS. And our year-to-date underlying net sales growth would have been 6% excluding these brands. This portfolio management has been an ongoing exercise over the past 2 decades as we focus Brown-Forman's portfolio on high-margin, high-return spirits brands with improved long-term growth prospects. Our portfolio of strategies entails not just divesting brands such as Southern Comfort and Tuaca, but also taking the long-term perspective to invest in developing the brands that have the potential to drive the next few decades of growth. This was the case behind launching Woodford Reserve in the depths of the bourbon declines in the 1990s, acquiring Southern Comfort in 1999 and Casa Herradura in 2007, introducing Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey in 2011 and the reason why we are investing in Slane Irish whiskey today. 
So in closing, we continue to deliver industry-leading underlying growth in net sales and operating income. We attribute this top line outperformance to our portfolio focus on Jack Daniel's and our American whiskeys against an excellent global opportunity for them. Our SKU to premium price points allows us to deliver high margins, and with single-point production efficiencies, we have been able to generate great returns on our investments and strong cash flow. We have maintained a consistent long-range perspective to investing this cash flow, focusing first and foremost on investing in our organic growth opportunities. We are doing so today through distillery expansions, adding barrel-making capacity and making homeplace investments. 
We have used our growing cash flow to consistently increase the dividend over the last 32 years, making Brown-Forman a member of the prestigious dividend aristocrats. We maintain an active approach to portfolio management, and we generate substantial free cash flow, which allows us to continue returning cash to our shareholders. 
And so with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Paul for some of his comments. Paul?"

As a summary, I thought Q3 was a pretty solid underlying quarter for us, given that during the November through January time period, we witnessed the terrorist attacks in Paris, the continued difficulty for emerging market economies and currencies and a very rough start for the calendar year 2016 equity markets in January. 
By contributing to a halo of uncertainty, these forces play a role in moderating the consumer and trade's willingness to purchase in the short term. As a result and despite Brown-Forman's favorable geographic diversification, we were not immune to these factors as they weighed somewhat on the quarter's underlying sales growth rate, which was still a very nice 4%. 
Our year-to-date underlying growth in sales and operating income now stand at 5% and 7%, respectively, and our 12-month return on invested capital remained very strong at 22%. These growth and return metrics remain ahead of our industry competitive set. 
As in past quarters and consistent with other U.S.-based companies, these very nice organic year-to-date results are being offset by a strengthening dollar, and this continued to weigh on reported results. In our case, it had the effect of reducing our year-to-date underlying operating income growth from 7% to 2%.
With these factors present as current headwinds, you might be wondering if we are altering our course in any way. Let me touch on that briefly. Looking back on other challenging macroeconomic environments we've encountered, I feel that we've been very well served by prioritizing 3 things: first, keeping our long-term perspective; second, intensifying and narrowing our focus on the very best growth opportunities we perceive for the company; and third, bringing new ideas that can capitalize on those opportunities. Here are a few examples.
Despite recent emerging market challenges, it is estimated that these countries as a whole still had 4% real GDP growth in 2015. And despite Jack Daniel's excellent progress over the last 20 years in these advancing economies, the brand still has a very low market share. As a result, we remain very bullish on the opportunity that exists for the company across this very large number of countries, where most of the world's population resides. So as these markets grapple with their current local challenges, we intend to be patient by leveraging our company's long-term view. While we do this, we will simultaneously intensify our focus on growing our American whiskey brand priorities in parts of the world that are a bit more conducive to growth just now. To be clear, this does not imply some radical reallocation of resources or exiting of investment positions in emerging markets. It's a more subtle shift in the expectations we will have for where we are likely to derive our growth in the short term. 
For example, we are likely to expect more from the U.S. and developed international markets, where premium American whiskeys are enjoying excellent momentum and consumer appeal. Or as another example, we will also strive to accomplish more on our premium tequila brands at a time when tailwinds are strong for them, particularly outside of their home country. In doing this, we will be leveraging the benefit of our excellent geographic diversification. 
This strengthening of our focus will be partially enabled by our recent sale of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, not unlike the focus that was previously enabled by the dispositions of our consumer durables and popular-priced wine businesses. This most recent disposition will permit us to allocate more of our creative time and energy to Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, Gentleman Jack, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Tennessee Fire, Woodford Reserve, Old Forester, Herradura and Sonoma-Cutrer, some of our most attractive and immediate growth opportunities. And with this sharpened focus, I expect that we will generate new ideas that can be impactful to the top and bottom line over time. This will be most evident through smart line extensions like Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Tennessee Fire, but as well as an example would be our forthcoming Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Rye, which represents the distillery's first significant effort to date within the exciting U.S. rye category; new product development like our Slane Irish whiskey project; improved packaging like our recent success with el Jimador and forthcoming enhancements on both Woodford Reserve and Finlandia; the strong appeal of the liquid we put in the bottle, like Old Forester Birthday Bourbon and Herradura Ultra. 
We'll be emphasizing new formats that might better meet consumer needs like our successful Jack Daniel's and el Jimador RTD businesses. We'll be looking at enhanced marketing communications like Jack Daniel's 150th anniversary and our investment in the Old Forester homeplace; and well-timed route-to-market investments similar to what -- the France example from a couple of years ago and many others before it. I really do feel that this sharpening of our focus and the ideas that will come from it, along with keeping a proper long-term perspective about the business, will serve us well as it has before. 
That concludes our prepared remarks for the morning, and we're now happy to take any questions you have."

We actually had this conversation yesterday as it related to our inventory levels in the emerging markets. And we do feel like, and we alluded to this, that foreign exchange has definitely impacted our trade partners' buying patterns and likewise, probably has reduced some of their inventory levels. And we don't -- in that part of the world, we don't have a lot of visibility into the trade environment. We do believe that is a -- one of the drivers of the slowdown that you saw and we felt in the emerging markets. Obviously, it's been driven, though, by the economic malaise that's going on there and the foreign exchange devaluation. So we expect more to come. I don't know that I can predict that right now either. I think there are some markets that are -- have held up pretty well for us. Brazil, Turkey, places like that are continuing to do very well, Mexico. And we quoted some takeaway numbers in Poland and Mexico on Jack, and they're very strong at this point."

I mean, I think the only point I'd add, I mean, it's just so hard for us to get a single metric that can help us, first of all, and then help you all understand what might be underlying the results. I mean, we do think it's a blend of both consumer and trade impact, particularly on the short term. And the reason it's important, of course, is that the trade impact can be onetime and can rebuild with -- depending upon what the circumstances are in those countries. I do think it's always -- I'm always reminded of the impact that's unique to either our industry and -- but in this case, our company, where you have single-point production because it's -- the inventory adjustments that occur happen over a little bit longer period of time. I suspect because you have time on the water, you have time going from -- because we don't sell as our company in a lot of these countries direct to retail. You go to importers who go to agents who sometimes go to subwholesalers. And so the trail of inventory can be longer for a single-point producer, who has a multiple-tiered distribution system. And so that complicates it even more. I suspect some of this, if I think about weakening emerging market economies, I mean, in some level, if you look at the real GDP growth going back, I mean, they were growing at more like 8% going back 4 or 5 years ago, and now down to 4%. So I suspect some of it has been making its way into our results over time. And then when you have these devaluations of the currency that really impact it, you see it a little bit more dramatically. So those are qualitative comments to a quantitative question I know you asked, but we don't have great visibility into it."

So again, our product, Jack Daniel's, was already pretty highly priced for the consumer down there to start off with. And so with the devaluations of these currencies significantly, of course, it makes, as we were talking about in the earlier question, the affordability of our products a little bit out of -- less so than it has been.

But back in the FY '12, '13 and even a little bit into '14, in a lot of these emerging markets, we took pretty significant price increases mostly for price positioning and premiumization. We've -- there's not as many big global brands in a lot of these countries. I'd cite places like Africa. Even in a country like Mexico, we felt at the time there was an opportunity to go up. But we found that we -- it was better for us to do that with sort of large increases versus a bunch of small ones at the time. So in some of these places, we went up 10% or 12%. And so -- and those will soften your volumes a little bit. They'll have that impact.

There's some interplay going on there, too. We know the Global Travel Retail travelers, if you will, come from -- the high spenders come from Russia. We know what's going on in Europe overall, and so that definitely continued. Paul alluded to in his talk the Paris attacks. So all that activity going on, the confidence going down, I think it just continued to hit the Global Travel Retail business.

The second thing you were asking about was our share repurchase that we announced, the $1 billion -- new $1 billion one as of January. I just want to take a moment and step back and talk about how we think about share repurchases in the first place. We've considered these really opportunistic investments. If you look over the past history, sometimes we announce these things, we don't always complete them. So we remain flexible with these. We generally do them through open market purchases that allows us the flexibility to start and stop different things. And the reason why I'm explaining that to you is because if other things come up, we'll, of course, invest them heavily behind our organic growth of our business today via distillery expansion, cooperage expansion, homeplace investments, as we've talked about. And of course, our dividends have been increasing for a number of 70 -- for 32 years. And we've given them for 70 years. So -- and we've done all that side, but we also then want to make sure if there's acquisitions that come about that meet our strategic criteria, we have that flexibility to start and stop things as we go. And then, of course, if we decide to do other returning the cash to shareholders, we can do that, too. So we've got that out there. Just wanted you to know, we aren't forecasting -- it will not -- as you do a calculation, even if we were to complete it all, it does not offset the dilution from Southern Comfort."

Let me give you an example of how the sale of Southern Comfort that we announced yesterday, I can think of at least 3 pretty direct ways that it will benefit Jack Daniel's. The first is, going forward, is the absence of drag on the corporation's growth rate that, disproportionately, Jack Daniel's over these past few years would have to cover. So that absence of drag is a benefit to Brown-Forman Corporation. It also very much takes some pressure off Jack Daniel's to grow that base of operating income. The second is with the absence of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, our ability to take the time that we were devoting to those brand-building activities and rededicate them to our highest priorities. I made the example in my opening comments, but let's just say in this example, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey will benefit by us being able to redirect some of our time and attention and creative energies to that particular brand. That becomes, in fact, a multimillion dollar investment behind the Jack Daniel's business. And then the third is, a little more subtle, is that the proceeds from Southern Comfort, which we had a nice gain on the sale, to the extent that you attribute that we would be going and using some of those proceeds to do some of the share repurchasing that is available to us, in effect, the way I like to think about that is for a nonselling shareholder, a shareholder who does not sell into a share repurchase and remains, what ends up happening in effect for them is that they, through Brown-Forman's activities, have sold Southern Comfort and made a reinvestment in Jack Daniel's for them. So I actually feel like this ends up being a multidimensional benefit for the -- for our long-term shareholders, people who are very interested in Brown-Forman's progress over generations or a 5- and 10-year period. And in doing so -- we've done this several times before with portfolio reshaping. And not always has it had this other dimension of repurchasing shares and the remaining shareholders owning a little bit more of Brown-Forman as a result of it. But in this case, I actually think it's a wonderful use of proceeds or reallocation of our time that benefits that particular brand and the shareholders. So it's a way that you might connect a couple of the dots that are in our news today."

I mean, you did -- you gave a very nice summary of some of the prevailing influences. Here's just a way that you might think about it. I think in the end, with -- if I were to summarize this to say that -- because your question was specifically about the United States, a lot of this comes down to what do you foresee as possible for the brand development and what are the best ways to achieve it. And I'd start with that thinking about the full trademark Jack Daniel's because, of course, these line extensions do play a role in it. And I want to say something about that as well. But here's something you might think about as it relates to Brown-Forman and this American whiskey momentum that exists. And I actually feel like, because we have a difficulty, even inside our own company or through our trade system, to get our mentality just right on our expectations. And so let me just use this example. Jack Daniel's is roughly 5 million cases in the United States. When it advances in a year, typically, say, 3% on volume, it generates 150,000 cases of incremental growth in the United States. I'll use the example of a 500,000-case brand, which is a pretty sizable brand in the U.S. market. And we've got a couple of them -- or just short of that, actually, I mean, Woodford Reserve and Gentleman Jack. And in Woodford Reserve's example, it's growing about 30%. So it's growing 150,000 cases in the U.S. market. And then you'd use the example -- I mean, the one that's been the most resurgent here, and just to show you the scale of us getting what we've considered to be our proportionate growth in this market, even Old Forester, which would get more headlines today, relative to even Jack Daniel's because it's growing at 40%. But it's also off a 100,000-case base, which gives you about a 40,000-case growth per year. So I just used these for scale of magnitude. Now think about Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire. In its first full year this year, we're anticipating it'll be something like around 400,000 cases. So I mean, if you start to add these up, I really -- I mean, it is so hard when you're the leader as Jack Daniel's Black Label Tennessee Whiskey is and Brown-Forman is to expect to grow at 25% or 18% or some of these really superb growth rates that get quoted out there, particularly around some of the upstart brands. But I can, in my own math there, with the examples I gave you, see that if Jack Daniel's grows 3% to 4% in the United States, it gets 150,000 to 200,000 cases of growth, which is about the same amount that our high-flying Woodford Reserve and Old Forester are contributing. So those are ways we think about it. We use a lot of different metrics, not just Brown-Forman's share or Jack Daniel's share of the market. And I think we have realistic expectations about it. You've heard us talk in the past about how to think about these flavors. I think one of the hardest things for the supplier-owner to do is to get the right attitude about these. And it's my view that we will do fewer flavors on Jack Daniel's but try to sell them in more places, so think of global expansion. I think that is a more unique opportunity for Jack Daniel's than it is many of these other trademarks that are participating in flavored whiskey. And having said that, we are going to set ambitions for ourselves that don't just launch and then let sit a new flavor. We intend to treat them as brands and -- which they are. I mean, Tennessee Honey today is a one -- roughly a 1.4 million case brand, global average price of about $25 or higher. And that is a very rare accomplishment for any brand in our industry. And so internally, we have to think about it as a very valuable brand and not just sort of a flavor extension from Jack Daniel's. And so it's our intent with the marketing mixes and the investments we make behind those flavors to treat them in the same way you would expect us to treat a Woodford Reserve or some freestanding brand, okay? Did that help you get a little more color on it? Thanks for the question."

And when you start to move pieces in and out, you get different insights. But I mean, I also could do the same thing a little bit on, if we just focused on Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, our growth rates would be exceptional. And I think this whole concept of portfolio management is one that any company that decides to sell more than one brand has to wrestle with. I think a way I would answer yours is the things that would be dragging down our top line in IRI, you couldn't be more correct there, is brands that are of lower priority to us, say, than the new things. But what it isn't reflecting is what's happening at the bottom line. And I actually think that it's important for people to know that even if you get a drag on a Southern Comfort or a Canadian Mist, for example, using the U.S. as an example, its impact at the bottom line will be far less significant than the focus -- the increased focus you might provide to a very high gross profit per case item like a Tennessee Fire or a Woodford Reserve. Related to your -- but nonetheless, you want to reduce drag wherever you can, it's either through the improved performance or on the example of Southern Comfort and Tuaca through literally the disposition of the business. I mean, so in those cases, you reduce drag. The stuff we keep, I mean, we absolutely have to put our best foot forward, and so you can expect us to try to do that. I don't think it would be in the best interest of Brown-Forman's long-term value creation to take our eye off of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey in pursuit of trying to improve Early Times, for example. They're both great brands in their own right, but Jack Daniel's is decidedly more important at Brown-Forman. And so it's something that we would continue to prioritize. I do think on the Honey -- the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Tennessee Fire comments that you opened with there, I do think it's important for you to know that the Tennessee Fire, yes, it has had some both wholesale, which would -- inventory build, which would be reflected in our earnings per share and retail during its first full year, but it's also had very nice consumer velocity as well. It hasn't just been a pipeline shove on -- and it's just sort of sitting out there. I mean, the data we're looking at tells us it's a very successful brand in its own right because our own internal benchmarks at times were against Tennessee Honey or our most competitive people in the company were actually aiming at Fireball. So depending upon what your frame of reference is, you might be a little more disappointed than others. But brands that achieve in the first full year of national distribution 400,000 cases are sort of runaway successes. And to do it with limited cannibalization, bringing in new consumers, very premium price points and having both defensive and offensive properties, it's a very big success for us. Now that we've got it out in the marketplace, the big challenge for all of us, our sales and marketing teams particularly, is how do we grow it in the United States. We know we can expand it geographically because there's more call for it today than we've supplied. So that will be something that will be interesting for us to explain to you as we get out into June and update you on our expansion plans. But a big thing, just as it was for Honey in its second and third years, are how is it going to grow in the United States? What levers do we pull to ensure that it continues to be treated like the regular strong consumer brand that we think it should be?"

So those would be some contributing things. I also think that -- I mean, it would be silly for us not to say there hadn't been a little bit of cannibalization that can contribute to Tennessee Honey from Fire's launch, and that could be a little bit consumer. It could also just be focus and attention or sharing displays and some of these other things that go on when you are selling things from the same family. But it still presents the same question. How do we, in year 6 and beyond, in the United States continue to build the brand in a way that competes better versus what the competitive references are out there? So it's the -- for our Brown-Forman employees who are listening, that's the question we're focused on. And yes, it really is. I mean, it's very true. And the same things are going to be true with the ensuing -- we're already looking at sort of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire. Remember, it had some test markets that go back more than 1 year so you can start to learn a little bit more from those markets as well. And with the passage of time, all, I think, new brand entries have this sort of challenge. And I think in my view, the answer isn't to go put 5 more flavors out in the market.

I plan on covering 3 topics today, which should leave plenty of time for questions after our prepared remarks. First, I'll review our full year results, including a brief overview of the fourth quarter. Second, I'll discuss our earnings outlook for fiscal 2017. And finally, I'll share some additional color on the changes we have made to our portfolio over the past year, including the BenRiach acquisition. 
So let me start by reviewing our results. Despite a very challenging comparison against last year's fourth quarter 2% increase in underlying net sales, which you will recall, benefited from the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire in the United States, we delivered solid 4% growth and underlying net sales during this year's fourth quarter. Underlying A&P spend increased 8% while a 3% reduction in underlying SG&A pursued our underlying operating income growth to 15% for the quarter. 
For the full year, underlying net sales grew 5% and underlying income increased 8%, in line with the guidance we shared with you on our third quarter call and well ahead of our estimate for the industry's rate of growth. Our net sales growth in the year was driven by volume gains from our premium price brands, driving 4 points of mixed benefit and 10 basis points of gross margin expansion. 
Looking at our business results by geography. The developed world delivered growth consistent with last year, helping offset a slowdown in emerging markets and declines in our travel retail channels. We grew underlying sales in each of the top 10 markets with the exception of Russia and believe that our balanced geographic approach in building our portfolio is one of the reasons why we consistently deliver top-tier results. 
The United States grew underlying net sales by 6% led by the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands. Our remarkable achievement for a trademark that is celebrating 150 years in the market. The U.S. launch objecting Tennessee Fire contributed almost 1 point of underlying net sales growth to our corporate results in fiscal 2016. Combined, Tennessee Honey and Tennessee Fire depleted over 1 million cases in the United States in fiscal 2016, strengthening the brand equity of the Jack Daniel's family by appealing to new consumers and accelerating the brand's reach across ethnicity and gender. 
We believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from consumer interest in premium American whiskey. Our leadership position in this category is of course, driven by the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands, but is operated by our bourbon brands such as Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, both of which enjoyed rapid rates of growth in fiscal 2016. And we believe that our whiskey expertise, including our vertically integrated supply chain from barrels to homeplace experiences position us well to grow our brand in the coming years. 
Woodford's Family of Brands reached 500,000 cases in fiscal 2016. While this impressive milestone might seem like an overnight sensation, it required a strategy both on patience and consistent investment behind the creation of a new brand in the mid-1990s that leveraged heritage and our whiskey-making expertise. We are replicating this proven business model with slain Irish whiskey, which we believe can become the next Woodford lag driver of our company's results as we see the next 20 years of growth. 
Developed markets outside the United States also delivered solid underlying net sales growth, up 6%. This rate of growth marks a 2-point acceleration from fiscal 2015 with particularly strong results in Western Europe, up high single digits, as well as solid gains in Canada and New Zealand. Australia, Japan and Spain each returned to growth during the year while results in Italy declined. The Jack Daniel's trademark is continuing to gain share from blended Scotch among other categories, and our market shares remain low compared to what we have achieved in the United States. So we are optimistic that the best is yet to come as the Jack Daniel's benefit from its brand positioning around confidence and independence, strong heritage and authenticity, not to mention its prominent and pop culture. 
Moving now to our emerging markets business. Underlying net sales grew 4% in the year. A marked deceleration from what we have delivered over the last decade. Mexico and Poland, our largest -- 2 largest emerging markets, grew underlying net sales by 6% and 1%, respectively. Turkey grew 17% while Russia declined 17%. Brazil, South Africa and Ukraine, each grew underlying net sales double-digits but this growth was offset by the slowdown in many of our other small emerging markets, including South East Asia or regulatory changes in Indonesia led to significant disruption in the beginning of fiscal 2016. 
Our business has not been immune to the weaker economic condition and currency devaluation that have negatively impacted consumer demand. In our other markets, which represented 15% of total sales from the table in our earnings release this morning, underlying net sales growth accelerated from 11% in fiscal 2015 to flat in 2016, effectively removing 1.5 points from top line growth. As we look ahead, we think the challenges in many emerging markets will persist in the short-term. But that does not diminish our long-term expectations for emerging markets, given how early we are in developing our brand outside of the United States. 
Travel retail had a challenging start to fiscal 2016 with underlying net sales declines of almost 20%. The rate of decline has moderated over the last 3 quarters. So while business fundamentals remain soft compared to this historic levels of growth, we believe the worst is behind us. Travel retail, 12% underlying net sales declined in the year removed about 0.5. from fiscal 2016 net sales growth rate. 
Let's move now to a reconciliation of reported to underlying results. In appreciating U.S. dollar negatively impacted our reported net sales in fiscal 2016 by 6 percentage points. While inventories were roughly flat year-over-year, reported sales were also hit by 1 percentage point due to the 2 months absence of Southern Comfort and Tuaca revenue while under disposition during the fourth quarter. Our underlying operating costs increased nearly 3% in the year but declined approximately 3% on a reported basis. 
Tight cost management help us deliver SG&A growth of only 2% and we remain focused on leveraging prior SG&A investments. It's worth noting that, excluding Southern Comfort and Tuaca, our A&P increased over 5% for the portfolio of brands we have today, in line with our underlying sales growth. Putting this altogether, we delivered 8% growth in underlying operating income for the fourth year. Reported operating income increased 49%, including the impact of the sale of Southern Comfort and Tuaca and 3%, excluding. Earnings per share increased 63% to $5.22, excluding the $1.76 impact as a result of the sale, our earnings per share would have been roughly $3.46, an increase of 8% from the prior year. 
So now turning to my second topic for today, our outlook for fiscal 2017. Not withstanding the emerging market slowdown we experienced during fiscal 2016, we expect our portfolio SKU to premium American whiskey will allow us to capitalize on favorable trends as consumers continue to shift from white to brand spirits, driven by a desire for heritage, authenticity and craftsmanship. In fiscal 2017, we will be activating a global campaign to celebrate Jack Daniel's 150th anniversary as America's oldest registered distillery. This activation consists of a focused campaign here in the United States called Jack Attack, including additional media spend and programming behind the trademark that we believe will accelerate our growth in the United States. It also entails large scale events in Lynchburg and pop up distillery experiences in several major Metro markets. And we'll introduce special edition products, including an '86 [ph] proof Jack Daniel's 150th anniversary bottle. 
This intense consumer campaign extends far beyond the United States, including a global Jack Daniel's barrel hunts in over 50 countries and incremental media support. Our global teams and partners will focus on the premiumization of this trademark through additional support behind Gentleman Jack as well as the continued growth and rollout of Tennessee Honey and Tennessee Fire outside the United States. In fiscal 2017, we expect underlying net sales growth of 4% to 6%, driven by sustained growth of our portfolio of brands in the developed world. We intend to launch Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire in a few markets outside the United States, including the United Kingdom, France and Germany. We are innovating with high-quality expression, including rolling out Woodford Reserve Rye and Jack Daniel's single Barrel Rye as well as introducing Coopers craft, our first new bourbon in 2 decades. 
Furthermore, underlying net sales should benefit from global consumer demand from our premium bourbon and tequila brands. We expect to benefit from both the easier comparison and travel retail this coming year, as well as the absence of the 15 basis point drag that Southern Comfort had on last years results. On the negative front, we anticipate moderate pricing per use barrels as the global slowdown in blended scotch is negatively impacting barrel demand. Fiscal 2017 should be another year of volume gains and improved mix but with minimal pricing beyond a few select markets given the overall economic environment, this should result in flat gross margins compared to fiscal 2016. 
We are investing behind our brands growth and development, and are reallocating our human capital in dollars towards the brand market combination that we believe have the greatest opportunities to create value. We are forecasting another year of low single-digit growth in SG&A. And so while we are tightly controlling our core SG&A growth, we will invest where the opportunities exist, such as plans to switch to own distribution in Spain next summer, which will result in some modest cost later this fiscal year. 
In total, we anticipate underlying operating income growth of 7% to 9%. At today's spot rates, we expect the stronger dollar will negatively impact reported earnings per share by $0.07. The benefits from a lower share count will be offset somewhat by reductions in distributors inventories. The expected tax rate will be in the 29% to 30% range. In aggregate, we expect earnings per share of $3.42 to $3.62 [ph]. This represents 5% to 11% growth from our fiscal 2016 baseline EPS of $3.26, which excludes $0.26 -- $0.20 of earnings contribution from Southern Comfort and Tuaca in fiscal 2016. You'll find additional details in a table in our earnings release that we released this morning.
As the sensitivity on FX, a 10% move in the dollar in either direction would impact our full-year EPS by approximately $0.16. Just a quick comment on seasonality. We expect our first quarter to be the most challenging comparison against 7% underlying growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, which was also helped by the U.S. launch of Tennessee Fire. Regarding our capital spending programs. CapEx came in at $108 million for the year, well below our original estimate, driven largely by timing as our long-term capital expansion plan remain unchanged. Timing of spend for Slane Castle and the Old Forester's distillery and homeplace for example, will be weighted more to fiscal 2017 than we expected at this time, last year. We were over halfway through our set of investments to increase total capacity and continue to deliver an industry-leading 23% return on invested capital after adjusting for the gain on the sale of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, the highest ROIC in a decade for our company.
Now let me move now to my final topic, an update in portfolio changes, including the acquisition of BenRiach distillery company. We made some important changes to our portfolio of brands in the last few months, including the disposition of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, as well as our reentry into the single malt scotch category with the BenRiach distillery acquisition. This portfolio changes mark the continuation of a decade of evolution at Brown-Forman, following the sale of China and Hartmann luggage, the acquisition of tequila portfolio and the sale of our mid price wine in. In addition to this M&A activity, we have introduced significant immunization into the marketplace, including the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Fire, Woodford Reserve Double Oak and Rye, and our entry into Irish whiskey with. 
So let me share a bit more color on our rationale for our most recent addition to our portfolio, the acquisitions of the BenRiach distillery company and 3 great single malt scotch brands GlenDronach, BenRiach and Glenglassaugh. The single malt scotch category is one of the fastest-growing categories along with American whiskey and Irish whiskey. Outside of the 4 largest single malt brand, GlenDronach, BenRiach and Glenglassaugh represents the largest collective production capacity in the industry, giving us a great plan platform from which to build on over time. We believe that our whiskey-making knowledge, barrel technology know-how and long-term perspective will continue to serve us well. Combined, these single malt scotch brands are relatively small today, it's under 100,000 cases in calendar 2015. But be believe they have significant global potential as the primary markets today are focused on the United States, Duty Free, U.K., France, Taiwan and Germany. There is also a small blended scotch business today. 
Given our purchase price of just over USD 400 million, we paid a similar multiple on trailing EBITDA to where Brown-Forman trades today. We believe that we acquired high-quality brands and assets, including the current home places, distilleries, warehouses and the bottling facility not to mention valuable inventory. Equally important is the potential for these brands in a rapidly growing category. So we are hard at work at developing the long-term business plan of how we can maximize the value of these brands. 
As is typical with any acquisition, we expect some transition and integration costs this year somewhere in the $5 million to $10 million range. But even after, including these costs, we expect the acquisition to be roughly neutral to earnings in fiscal 2017, given only 11 months of ownership and then we'll be accretive in the following years.
Let me remind you that our last acquisition outside was when we acquired Casa Herradura in 2007. After several years of methodical investment, these brands have enjoyed solid growth over the last few years as we believe they have reached an inflection point in consumer awareness. Herradura's underlying net sales jumped 3% globally in fiscal 2016, while Herradura U.S. underlying net sales increased 19% and New Mix, our Mexican RTD business experienced a 23% jump. So all in all, a stellar year for our tequila brands, but one that was years in the making. We expect that these single malt scotch brands will also receive time required -- time and patience to best position them to help fuel our growth over the long-term. 
So in summary, fiscal 2016 was another great year for Brown-Forman. We delivered solid top and bottom line growth notwithstanding foreign exchange pressure from on appreciate the U.S. dollar. We invested significantly in the long-term opportunities that we believe will fuel our growth over the coming decades including our entry into Irish whiskey with Slain and the launch of Coopers craft. We made several enhancements to our portfolio of brand, including our disposal of Southern Comfort and Tuaca and the acquisition of BenRiach. And we invested over $100 million in capital investments behind our organic growth prospects.
We did all of this while returning a record $1.4 billion of capital to our shareholders in fiscal 2016. Steady dividend growth is a hallmark of Brown-Forman and we increased ours by 8% this past year. We repurchased over 11 million shares, bringing our diluted share count to half to where it was in the mid-1980s, and we recently proposed a 2-for-1 stock split, or 7-split in 35 years. Our ability to simultaneously grow our business, invest in the future and return capital are reasons why we believe we can continue to generate top-tier returns for our shareholders. 
Our TSRs have outperformed the competitive, the consumer and index and the S&P 500 over the past 3, 5, 10-year periods by healthy margin. We believe that we will remain an industry leader through thoughtful allocation of resources and categories focused on our core competency whiskey. We operate in a business with aged products in multi generational brands, and we benefit from having a long-term focus and engaged shareholders base through family control. And with our strong cash flow generation and inherent capital efficiency, we will continue to pursue a well-balanced capital agreement strategy, aimed at perpetuating Brown-Forman's strength and independence. So with that, let me turn the call over to Paul for his comments."
256839,341844338,996356,"Brown-Forman Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 08, 2016",2016-06-08,"Earnings Calls","Brown-Forman Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone.

My take on FY '16 and our guidance for FY '17 is that they are both illustrative to Brown-Forman's strong and continuing organic growth story, once you consider the effect of last year's dispositions and account for the impact of FX and inventory, which we customarily do. Something a little less customary is the disproportionate amount of work we've been doing of late to position Brown-Forman for enduring growth in the distant years ahead. And for sake of defining distant years ahead, I mean 2020 at the earliest and more like 2025 and beyond. While we always strive to take a long view of our business, somewhat by necessity given the aging for most of our products, this last 18 months in my view, has been even more exemplary of Brown-Forman's long-term orientation. The current time reminds me in some ways of similarly strategic times in our recent history when we made changes to benefit our long-term future. Examples would be, the early 1990s when we began a more aggressive geographic expansion, which included our initial work in emerging markets and our first experiences with international distribution ventures. The mid-2000s when we followed our disposal of Flanagan Hartman with the acquisition Casa Herradura and Sean 4. And more recently in 2011 when we sold the vast majority of our wine business to enable us to better focus on our premium American whiskey trademarks at a time when consumer interest in the category had begun to surge. 
In the last 5 years, this shift of focus alongside further investments in our organization and global route-to-market, contributed to successes such as: Jack Daniel's Black Label assent to one of the industry's most valuable brands; the creation of both Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, 2 of the company's most successful line extension ever; the accelerated development for super premium brands Woodford Reserve and Gentleman Jack, as both brands achieved the difficult superpremium volume metric milestone of 500,000 cases; and the resurgence of Brown-Forman's founding brand, Old Forester. 
So now in mid 2016, we have our recent portfolio changes and capital deployment action as examples of significant actions and investment from which we believe shareholders are likely to benefit in the years ahead. The investments we've made in scotch and Irish whiskey over the last year, had intended to give us brand and production platforms for what I would like to call Woodford Reserve-like brand development over the next generation and exciting premium whiskey categories adjacent to the American whiskey category that we know so well. Our patient brand building success on Woodford is certainly a source of confidence as we begin our work behind brands like Medtronic and Slain. And our initial investment behind Coopers Craft Bourbon will enable us to tell our story of our Coopers, the people who make our whiskey barrels, and in doing so, convey the importance of wood and barrels in crafting the highest quality bourbons. The brand will leverage our distinctive know-how and is very old and truly unique trait of barrel making. We will undoubtedly seek to apply some of this cooperage expertise to our new endeavors in both Ireland and Scotland. 
For these new trademarks and products define commercial success, they need to focus for an organization that has the skill, the scale and the time to develop them. Brown-Forman's global route-to-market platform is a strong asset in this regard and with the sale of Southern Comfort and Tuaca in FY '16, we have enabled our sales team to shift their focus to existing brands with greater growth prospects as well as the newer brands that I've just mentioned. Since we are not reducing overhead cost dollar for dollar to cover the loss profitability from the brands we recently disposed, I consider this an incremental organizational investment against big ideas like Jack Daniel's 150th distillery anniversary this year and Coopers craft and BenRiach in the years ahead. 
We made a similar type of hidden investment behind our American whiskeys after the sale of our wine brands in 2011 and have served them very well in the years that ensued. Beyond these portfolio and organizational investments, quality capital deployment, long and hallmark at Brown-Forman will continue to be important in the next 10 years and beyond. We are fortunate to have a very capital-efficient business model as evidenced by the 23% return on invested capital that Jane mentioned in her comments as well as excellent financial flexibility. Beyond the acquisitions I've mentioned, we are continuing to make significant investments in production expansion and homeplace marketing at Jack Daniel's Woodford Reserve, Old Forester and Slain in the years -- and in the years ahead, we will incur depreciation costs associated with this additional capacity. These investments are intended to enable us to grow going forward in a manner similar to our last 10 years. Considering the margins, returns, track record of growth and the potential we see ahead, I believe these capital expenditures are excellent investments by the company. 
And finally, through our more ambitious share repurchase program of late, shareholders are essentially given the options of liquidity for those who choose to sell their shares or a slightly increased percentage ownership of Brown-Forman for those to choose to hold their shares. For nonselling shareholders, your decision means the repurchase program therefore, represents a long-term investment the company makes on your behalf in the future of Brown-Forman. And that is something that we believe then, and I hope today's results and next year's outlook as well as our discussion of the investments we are making to enable our continued success give you a similar belief in the company's prospects for continued value creation. 
That concludes our remarks. Thank you for listening and we're now happy to take any questions you have."

One, we're cycling against the Fire launch in the United States. So that -- what happened if you recall last year's fourth quarter, so we didn't repeat that big buy-in. It sold all the way through to the retailers last year's fourth quarter and that's one of the things that's driving it. The second thing is we continue to have declines in Finlandia. It's a low priced brand, so a little margin brand. So it really hit your top line not so much your bottom line. It continues to be heard in markets like Russia and the CIS, so some of the markets where the economic conditions have just continue to be very, very poor. And so, you can -- we saw some acceleration in the back half of the year in that brand and then again, the other piece being the absence of the launch in the U.S. on the Fire. So you did see a slowdown because of those 2 factors, if you will. They netted again -- the gains that we had on the rest of the portfolio the continue to grow nicely our -- premium bourbon brands continue to grow nicely our tequila and Jack Daniel's a bit as well. In terms of -- as we look to next year, we're expecting really, very little if any pricing just in a few select markets. So it'll be more mix. But what's coming along next year is what Paul alluded to this a little bit. We've been making investments for a number of years -- last several years behind our production facilities sustained capacities. So we can reap demand that we think we'll be there in the not so distant future. So we're going to have some a bit of higher cost than our price. Price will come through so that higher costs will also offset the mix benefit that we saw this year. So most of it will be coming from price/mix -- excuse me, volumes next year most of our growth."

I think part of it was the early part of the slowdown. So much of it was associated for some of the competition in China where we just our presence is relative on a percentage basis smaller than many of our competitors. So maybe that -- specifically by the cognac players, they were impacted by that going back a few years. I think more recently for us, we've seen that in places, a lot -- Jack Daniel's is so geographically diversified and spread. And for many, many years, it has been developing its business and for example, in the emerging markets, we never singularly focused on BRIC. We looked to all kinds of smaller markets that were also emerging and we just felt that those were I think more appropriate developmental efforts on behalf of the brand, even going back 10 years ago. So like for example, in Eastern Europe, has slowed down in some markets. Some of the smaller markets, those related to oil, it is their economies and currencies have been so difficult. And so it just -- this round of emerging market difficulty because there's always seems to me, that there's some markets going up and down and that's why we like the geographic diversification that we have, this particular year with emphasis on Russia and then some of the smaller markets, other markets tied to -- particularly tied to oil, seem to hit us in more than they had in the past years. So it doesn't really take away over a longer period of time, our viewpoint that these will be important markets for Brown-Forman. It's just that you have to be patient while those economies wrestle with what's happening locally."

The one thing I would say just to add on to what Paul said, he talked about the oil and obviously, that added big impact on currency. And so we found this currency hit us in many different ways in the emerging markets. So whether it was the consumer, the price and the valuation of the currency had gone down so much making our products so much higher, and so maybe the purchasing power in the situation called that to happen in some of our trade partners, margins were screwed. It was pretty widespread and I would say, a lot of the currency stuff hit like a coding in last summer when the big devaluation businesses in the Brazil real and some of those other currency and kept going everywhere and so."

And in this particular year, in year 2, objecting that Tennessee Fire, reminds me of some ways in the prior years where there was such interest in the prior year on the launch of something where there was pent-up demand, which I felt last year, when the spring particularly after we've done that stage rollout. And there was a huge surge and interest in trial associated with this product. And as you can imagine, I mean, I just feel like and its just composition as a product, it's not going to be for every straight whiskey drinker because it's in fact, a flavored whiskey.

And Finlandia has been very important to particularly Jack Daniel's' development in Eastern Europe over the last decade and Finlandia has been, on its own merit, a very successful brand in that part of the world.

When you look at any short-term period whether it's a month or a quarter, there could be all kinds of explanations for why they might be showing big gains or big losses. I think we have the number of entries that are going in there. I know and we sort of explained for our business, we're currently on the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, up against some, I think some significant introductory promotion and trial from last year. So for us, that would be the case. I can't speak for every single competitor, but I suspect -- remember this category is still relatively new. So there's a lot of new introductions just in the last 2 years. I mean, I remember, thinking about it, I guess as we turn the calendar year this year, how much did it change as we began with the launch of Tennessee Honey, and sort of methodically testing Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire and how rapidly the category kind of changed just from the test markets on Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire to the national launch. So it's the nature of these categories that rapidly develop. We think we're smart to be in it in the way that we're in it. It's been very, very nice business success for us to date, but it also plays just as we're referencing on the roles brands can play a very strategic role in some ways defensively, but also very offensively as it relates to giving people the opportunity to try whiskey in a way that they might not have before. The straight whiskey can be an acquired taste. And we find that this category, particularly for our brands has been bringing in new consumers and it generates an interest in other whiskeys, most notably Jack Daniel's Black Label. And it can play a strategic role as well, as well as being a bona fide business in some rights."

But I think the category will continue to grow. But then within the category, you'll see trademarks and certain flavors be more volatile than you would see a normal bourbon or buy category, just because the category is so dynamic right now. As it relates to Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, I think once we cycle through some of these comparisons, the impact won't be as large. But I still expect -- I really do feel like that first year with particularly a brand that's participating in a category where the flavor is cinnamon, I really do expect that they are in the first sort of half of its national launch, there  were absolutely -- just think of it this way, there were -- I know there were a bunch of Jack Daniel's drinkers who were straight whiskey drinkers that were not participants for say, in the cinnamon whiskey business, who tried it and just decided it wasn't for them, right? I mean, they prefer straight whiskey. I think there were also a fair amount of fireball, which was the -- obviously, the large volume, lower priced brand. They tried it and maybe didn't see fit that they could afford it on every single occasion when they were consuming cinnamon-flavored whiskey. And so I think those things, they end up being what I call trial influences in those early days of a brands existence in the marketplace that just don't get repeated. So till you work through some of that, and then also begin the marketing and selling process to introduce the brands to new consumers, which the most encouraging thing we're seeing in our numbers that don't really reported a lot in our syndicated data are the results on the on premise, which kind of started okay, I felt. I thought it was going along pretty well. But with the expanded distribution and the momentum that sort of happened out in the marketplace, the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire brand is doing very, very well, right now, on the on premise which might surprise you because the off premise is not doing as well against that introductory launch. So in any event, the thing that gives us encouragement and that they'll as we can either continue to sell it and market it and promote it in a way that can make it the choice for more consumer locations. I mean, it just comes down to that I mean, knowing full well that is going to be a competitive environment in which you are attempting to do that."

So it -- but also think, you'll just see more Jack Daniel's Black Label on displays and because of the event itself, that we sometimes call this a gift from the calendar that we've lasted this long.

I plan on covering 3 topics today, which should leave plenty of time for questions after our prepared remarks. First, I'll review our full year results, including a brief overview of the fourth quarter. Second, I'll discuss our earnings outlook for fiscal 2017. And finally, I'll share some additional color on the changes we have made to our portfolio over the past year, including the BenRiach acquisition.
So let me start by reviewing our results. Despite a very challenging comparison against last year's fourth quarter 10% increase in underlying net sales, which you will recall, benefited from the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire in the United States, we delivered solid 4% growth and underlying net sales during this year's fourth quarter. Underlying A&P spend increased 8% while a 3% reduction in underlying SG&A boosted our underlying operating income growth to 15% for the quarter.
For the full year, underlying net sales grew 5% and underlying income increased 8%, in line with the guidance we shared with you on our third quarter call and well ahead of our estimate for the industry's rate of growth. Our net sales growth in the year was driven by volume gains from our premium price brands, driving 4 points of mixed benefit and 10 basis points of gross margin expansion.
Looking at our business results by geography. The developed world delivered growth consistent with last year, helping offset a slowdown in emerging markets and declines in our travel retail channels. We grew underlying sales in each of the top 10 markets with the exception of Russia and believe that our balanced geographic approach in building our portfolio is one of the reasons why we consistently deliver top-tier results.
The United States grew underlying net sales by 6%, led by the Jack Daniel's family of brands, a remarkable achievement for a trademark that is celebrating 150 years in the market. The U.S. launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire contributed almost 1 point of underlying net sales growth to our corporate results in fiscal 2016. Combined, Tennessee Honey and Tennessee Fire depleted over 1 million cases in the United States in fiscal 2016, strengthening the brand equity of the Jack Daniel's family by appealing to new consumers and accelerating the brand's reach across ethnicity and gender.
We believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from consumer interest in premium American whiskey. Our leadership position in this category is, of course, driven by the Jack Daniel's family of brands but is also aided by our bourbon brands such as Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, both of which enjoyed rapid rates of growth in fiscal 2016. And we believe that our whiskey expertise, including our vertically integrated supply chain from barrels to homeplace experiences position us well to grow our brand in the coming years.
Woodford's family of brands reached 500,000 cases in fiscal 2016. While this impressive milestone might seem like an overnight sensation, it required a strategy built on patience and consistent investment behind the creation of a new brand in the mid-1990s that leveraged heritage and our whiskey-making expertise. We are replicating this proven business model with Slane Irish whiskey, which we believe can become the next Woodford-like driver of our company's result as we see the next 20 years of growth.
Developed markets outside the United States also delivered solid underlying net sales growth, up 6%. This rate of growth marks a 2-point acceleration from fiscal 2015 with particularly strong results in Western Europe, up high single digits, as well as solid gains in Canada and New Zealand. Australia, Japan and Spain each returned to growth during the year while results in Italy declined.
The Jack Daniel's trademark is continuing to gain share from blended Scotch among other categories, and our market shares remain low compared to what we have achieved in the United States. So we are optimistic that the best is yet to come as the Jack Daniel's benefit from its brand positioning around confidence and independence, strong heritage and authenticity, not to mention its prominent and pop culture.
Moving now to our emerging markets business. Underlying net sales grew 4% in the year, a marked [ph] deceleration from what we have delivered over the last decade. Mexico and Poland, our largest -- 2 largest emerging markets, grew underlying net sales by 6% and 1%, respectively. Turkey grew 17% while Russia declined 17%. Brazil, South Africa and Ukraine each grew underlying net sales double digits, but this growth was offset by the slowdown in many of our other small emerging markets, including Southeast Asia, where regulatory changes in Indonesia led to significant disruption in the beginning of fiscal 2016.
Our business has not been immune to the weaker economic condition and currency devaluations that have negatively impacted consumer demand. In our other markets, which represented 15% of total sales per the table in our earnings release this morning, underlying net sales growth accelerated from 11% in fiscal 2015 to flat in 2016, effectively removing 1.5 points from top line growth. As we look ahead, we think the challenges in many emerging markets will persist in the short term. But that does not diminish our long-term expectations for emerging markets, given how early we are in developing our brand outside of the United States.
Travel retail had a challenging start to fiscal 2016 with underlying net sales declines of almost 20%. The rate of decline has moderated over the last 3 quarters. So while business fundamentals remain soft compared to this historic levels of growth, we believe the worst is behind us. Travel retail's 12% underlying net sales decline in the year removed about 0.5 point from fiscal 2016 net sales growth rate.
Let's move now to a reconciliation of reported to underlying results. An appreciating U.S. dollar negatively impacted our reported net sales in fiscal 2016 by 6 percentage points. While inventories were roughly flat year-over-year, reported sales were also hit by 1 percentage point due to the 2 months' absence of Southern Comfort and Tuaca revenue while under disposition during the fourth quarter. Our underlying operating costs increased nearly 3% in the year but declined approximately 3% on a reported basis.
Tight cost management helped us deliver SG&A growth of only 2%, and we remain focused on leveraging prior SG&A investments. It's worth noting that excluding Southern Comfort and Tuaca, our A&P increased over 5% for the portfolio of brands we have today, in line with our underlying sales growth. Putting this all together, we delivered 8% growth in underlying operating income for the fourth year. Reported operating income increased 49%, including the impact of the sale of Southern Comfort and Tuaca and 3% excluding. Earnings per share increased 63% to $5.22. Excluding the $1.76 impact as a result of the sale, our earnings per share would have been roughly $3.46, an increase of 8% from the prior year.
So now turning to my second topic for today, our outlook for fiscal 2017. Notwithstanding the emerging market slowdown we experienced during fiscal 2016, we expect our portfolio SKU to premium American whiskey will allow us to capitalize on favorable trends as consumers continue to shift from white to brand spirits, driven by a desire for heritage, authenticity and craftsmanship.
In fiscal 2017, we will be activating a global campaign to celebrate Jack Daniel's 150th anniversary as America's oldest registered distillery. This activation consists of a focused campaign here in the United States called Jack Attack, including additional media spend and programming behind the trademark that we believe will accelerate our growth in the United States. It also entails large-scale events in Lynchburg and pop-up distillery experiences in several major metro markets. And we'll introduce special edition products, including an 86-proof Jack Daniel's 150th anniversary bottle.
This intense consumer campaign extends far beyond the United States, including a global Jack Daniel's barrel hunt in over 50 countries and incremental media support. Our global teams and partners will focus on the premiumization of this trademark through additional support behind Gentleman Jack as well as the continued growth and rollout of Tennessee Honey and Tennessee Fire outside the United States.
In fiscal 2017, we expect underlying net sales growth of 4% to 6%, driven by sustained growth of our portfolio of brands in the developed world. We intend to launch Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire in a few markets outside the United States, including the United Kingdom, France and Germany. We are innovating with high-quality expression, including rolling out Woodford Reserve Rye and Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Rye as well as introducing Coopers' Craft, our first new bourbon in 2 decades.
Furthermore, underlying net sales should benefit from global consumer demand from our premium bourbon and tequila brands. We expect to benefit from both the easier comparison and travel retail this coming year as well as the absence of the 15 basis point drag that Southern Comfort had on last year's results.
On the negative front, we anticipate moderate pricing for used barrels as the global slowdown in blended Scotch is negatively impacting barrel demand. Fiscal 2017 should be another year of volume gains and improved mix but with minimal pricing beyond a few select markets given the overall economic environment. This should result in flat gross margins compared to fiscal 2016.
We are investing behind our brands' growth and development and are reallocating our human capital in dollars towards the brand market combination that we believe have the greatest opportunities to create value. We are forecasting another year of low single-digit growth in SG&A. And so while we are tightly controlling our core SG&A growth, we will invest where the opportunities exist such as plan to switch to own distribution in Spain next summer, which will result in some modest cost later this fiscal year.
In total, we anticipate underlying operating income growth of 7% to 9%. At today's spot rates, we expect the stronger dollar will negatively impact reported earnings per share by $0.07. The benefits from a lower share count will be offset somewhat by reductions in distributor inventories. The effective tax rate will be in the 29% to 30% range.
In aggregate, we expect earnings per share of $3.42 to $3.62. This represents 5% to 11% growth from our fiscal 2016 baseline EPS of $3.26, which excludes $0.26 -- $0.20 of earnings contribution from Southern Comfort and Tuaca in fiscal 2016. You'll find additional details in a table in our earnings release that we released this morning. As with sensitivity on FX, a 10% move in the dollar in either direction would impact our full year EPS by approximately $0.15.
Just a quick comment on seasonality. We expect our first quarter to be the most challenging comparison against 7% underlying growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, which was also helped by the U.S. launch of Tennessee Fire. Regarding our capital spending programs, CapEx came in at $108 million for the year, well below our original estimate, driven largely by timing as our long-term capital expansion plan remain unchanged. Timing of spend for Slane Castle and the Old Forester distillery in homeplace, for example, will be weighted more to fiscal 2017 than we expected at this time last year. We are over halfway through our stepped up investments to increase total capacity and continue to deliver an industry-leading 23% return on invested capital after adjusting for the gain on the sale of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, the highest ROIC in a decade for our company.
Now let me move now to my final topic, an update on portfolio changes, including the acquisition of the BenRiach Distillery Company. We made some important changes to our portfolio of brands over the last 12 months, including the disposition of Southern Comfort and Tuaca as well as our reentry into the single malt Scotch category with the BenRiach acquisition.
These portfolio changes mark the continuation of a decade of portfolio evolution at Brown-Forman, following the sale of Lenox China and Hartmann luggage, the acquisition of Casa Herradura tequila portfolio and the sale of our mid-priced wines, Fetzer and Bonterra. In addition to this M&A activity, we have introduced significant innovation into the marketplace, including the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Fire, Woodford Reserve Double Oaked and Rye and our entry into Irish whiskey with Slane.
So let me share a bit more color on our rationale for our most recent addition to our portfolio, the acquisitions of the BenRiach distillery company and 3 great single malt Scotch brands GlenDronach, BenRiach and Glenglassaugh. The single malt Scotch category is one of the fastest-growing categories, along with American whiskey and Irish whiskey. Outside of the 4 largest single malt brands, GlenDronach, BenRiach and Glenglassaugh represent the largest collective production capacity in the industry, giving us a great plan -- platform for which to build our -- over time.
We believe that our whiskey-making knowledge, barrel technology know-how and long-term perspective will continue to serve us well. Combined, these single malt Scotch brands are relatively small today at under 100,000 cases in calendar 2015. But we believe they have significant global potential as our primary markets today are focused on the United States, Duty Free, U.K., France, Taiwan and Germany. There is also a small blended Scotch business today.
Given the purchase price of just over USD 400 million, we paid a similar multiple on trailing EBITDA to where Brown-Forman trades today. We believe that we acquired high-quality brands and assets, including the current homeplaces, distilleries, warehouses and the bottling facility, not to mention valuable inventory. Equally important is the potential for these brands in a rapidly growing category. So we are hard at work at developing the long-term business plan of how we can maximize the value of these brands.
As is typical with any acquisition, we expect some transition and integration costs this year somewhere in the $5 million to $10 million range. But even after including these costs, we expect the acquisition to be roughly neutral to earnings in fiscal 2017, given only 11 months of ownership, and then will be accretive in the following years.
Let me remind you that our last acquisition of size was when we acquired Casa Herradura in 2007. After several years of methodical investment, these brands have enjoyed solid growth over the last few years as we believe they have reached an inflection point in consumer awareness. Herradura's underlying net sales jumped 13% globally in fiscal 2016, while Herradura's U.S. underlying net sales increased 19%. And New Mix, our Mexican RTD business, experienced a 23% jump. So all in all, a stellar year for our tequila brands, but one that was years in the making. We expect that these single malt Scotch brands will also receive time -- require time and patience to best position them to help fuel our growth over the long term.
So in summary, fiscal 2016 was another great year for Brown-Forman. We delivered solid top and bottom line growth, notwithstanding foreign exchange pressure from an appreciating U.S. dollar. We invested significantly in the long-term opportunities that we believe will fuel our growth over the coming decades, including our entry into Irish whiskey with Slane and the launch of Coopers' Craft. We made several enhancements to our portfolio of brands, including the disposal of Southern Comfort and Tuaca and the acquisition of BenRiach, and we invested over $100 million in capital investments behind our organic growth prospects.
We did all of this while returning a record $1.4 billion of capital to our shareholders in fiscal 2016. Steady dividend growth is a hallmark of Brown-Forman, and we increased ours by 8% this past year. We repurchased over 11 million shares, bringing our diluted share count to half of where it was in the mid-1980s, and we recently proposed a 2-for-1 stock split, our seventh split in 35 years. Our ability to simultaneously grow our business, invest in the future and return capital are reasons why we believe we can continue to generate top-tier returns for our shareholders.
Our TSRs have outperformed the competitive fit, [ph] the Consumer Staples Index and the S&P 500 over the past 3-, 5-, 10-year periods by a healthy margin. We believe that we will remain an industry leader through thoughtful allocation of resources and categories focused on our core competency, whiskey. We operate in a business with aged products in multi-generational brands, and we benefit from having a long-term focus and engaged shareholder base through family control. And with our strong cash flow generation and inherent capital efficiency, we will continue to pursue a well-balanced capital [indiscernible] strategy aimed at perpetuating Brown-Forman's strength and independence.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Paul for his comments."
256839,341844338,996577,"Brown-Forman Corporation, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Jun 08, 2016",2016-06-08,"Earnings Calls","Brown-Forman Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. My take on FY '16 and our guidance for FY '17 is that they are both illustrative to Brown-Forman's strong and continuing organic growth story once you consider the effect of last year's dispositions and account",978,"Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. My take on FY '16 and our guidance for FY '17 is that they are both illustrative to Brown-Forman's strong and continuing organic growth story once you consider the effect of last year's dispositions and account for the impact of FX and inventory, which we customarily do. Something a little less customary is the disproportionate amount of work we've been doing of late to position Brown-Forman for enduring growth in the distant years ahead. And for sake of defining distant years ahead, I mean 2020 at the earliest and more like 2025 and beyond.
While we always strive to take a long view of our business, somewhat by necessity, given the aging horizons for most of our products, this last 18 months, in my view, has been even more exemplary of Brown-Forman's long-term orientation. The current time reminds me in some ways of similarly strategic times in our recent history when we made changes to benefit our long-term future. Examples would be the early 1990s when we began a more aggressive geographic expansion, which included our initial work in emerging markets and our first experiences with international distribution ventures; the mid-2000s when we followed our disposal of Lenox and Hartmann with the acquisitions of Casa Herradura and Chambord; and more recently, in 2011 when we sold the vast majority of our wine business to enable us to better focus on our premium American whiskey trademarks at a time when consumer interest in the category had begun to surge.
In the last 5 years, this shift of focus, alongside further investments in our organization and global route-to-market, contributed to successes such as: Jack Daniel's Black Label's ascent to one of the industry's most valuable brands; the creation of both Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, 2 of the company's most successful line extensions ever; the accelerated development for super premium brands, Woodford Reserve and Gentleman Jack, as both brands achieved the difficult super premium volumetric milestone of 500,000 cases; and the resurgence of Brown-Forman's founding brand, Old Forester.
So now in mid-2016, we have our recent portfolio changes and capital deployment actions as examples of significant actions and investments from which we believe shareholders are likely to benefit in the years ahead. The investments we've made in Scotch and Irish whiskey over the last year are intended to give us brand and production platforms for what I'd like to call Woodford Reserve-like brand development over the next generation and exciting premium whiskey categories adjacent to the American whiskey category that we know so well.
Our patient brand building success on Woodford is certainly a source of confidence as we begin our work behind brands like GlenDronach and Slane. And our initial investment behind Coopers' Craft bourbon will enable us to tell our story of our coopers, the people who make our whiskey barrels and in doing so, convey the importance of wood and barrels in crafting the highest quality bourbons. The brand will leverage our distinctive know-how in its very old and truly unique trade of barrel making. We will undoubtedly seek to apply some of this cooperage expertise to our new endeavors in both Ireland and Scotland.
For these new trademarks and products to find commercial success, they need the focus of an organization that has the skill, the scale and the time to develop them. Brown-Forman's global route to market platform is a strong asset in this regard, and with the sale of Southern Comfort and Tuaca in FY '16, we have enabled our sales team to shift their focus to existing brands with greater growth prospects as well as the newer brands that I've just mentioned.
Since we are not reducing overhead cost dollar for dollar to cover the lost profitability of the brands we recently disposed, I consider this an incremental organizational investment against big ideas like Jack Daniel's 150th distillery anniversary this year and Coopers' Craft and BenRiach in the years ahead. We made a similar type of hidden investment behind our American whiskeys after the sale of our wine brands in 2011 and has served them very well in the years that ensued.
Beyond these portfolio and organizational investments, quality capital deployment, long a hallmark at Brown-Forman, will continue to be important to the next 10 years and beyond. We are fortunate to have a very capital-efficient business model as evidenced by the 23% return on invested capital that Jane mentioned in her comments as well as excellent financial flexibility.
Beyond the acquisitions I've mentioned, we are continuing to make significant investments in production expansion and homeplace marketing at Jack Daniel's, Woodford Reserve, Old Forester and Slane. In the years -- and in the years ahead, we will incur depreciation costs associated with this additional capacity. These investments are intended to enable us to grow going forward in a manner similar to our last 10 years. Considering the margins, returns, track record of growth and the potential we see ahead, I believe these capital expenditures are excellent investments by the company.
And finally, through our more ambitious share repurchase program of late, shareholders are essentially given the options of liquidity for those who choose to sell their shares or a slightly increased percentage ownership of Brown-Forman for those to choose to hold their shares. For nonselling shareholders, your decision means the repurchase program, therefore, represents a long-term investment the company makes on your behalf in the future of Brown-Forman. And that is something that we believe in, and I hope today's results and next year's outlook as well as our discussion of the investments we are making to enable our continued success give you a similar belief in the company's prospects for continued value creation.
That concludes our remarks. Thank you for listening. And we're now happy to take any questions you have."

One, we're cycling against the Fire launch in the United States. So that -- what happened -- if you recall last year's fourth quarter, so we didn't repeat that big buy-in. It sold all the way through to the retailers, last year's fourth quarter. And probably, I think, that's one of the things that's driving it. The second thing is we continue to have declines in Finlandia. It's a low-priced brand, so a little margin brand. So it really hit your top line, not so much your bottom line. It continues to be heard in markets like Russia and the CIS, so some of the markets where the economic conditions have just continued to be very, very poor. And so you can -- we saw some acceleration in the back half of the year on that brand and then again, the other piece being the absence of the launch in the U.S. on the Fire. So you did see a slowdown because of those 2 factors, if you will. They netted again -- the gains that we had on the rest of the portfolio that continue to grow nicely. Our premium bourbon brands continue to grow nicely, our tequilas did and Jack Daniel's did as well. In terms of -- as we look to next year, we're expecting really, very little, if any, pricing just in a few select markets, so it'll be more mix. But what's coming along next year is -- Paul alluded to this a little bit. We've been making investments for a number of years -- last several years behind our production facilities' sustained capacities, so we can meet demand that we think we'll be there in the not-so-distant future. So we're going to have some a bit higher cost than our price. Price will come through so that higher costs will also offset the mix benefit that we've been -- that saw this year. So most of it will be coming from pricing -- excuse me, volumes next year, most of our growth."

I think part of it was the early part of the slowdown. So much of it was associated for some of our competition in China where we -- just our presence is relative on a percentage basis smaller than many of our competitors. So maybe that and particularly the cognac players, they were impacted by that going back a few years. I think more recently for us, we've seen that in places -- a lot is -- Jack Daniel's is so geographically diversified and spread. And for many, many years, it has been developing its business and for example, in the emerging markets, we never singularly focused on BRIC. We looked to all kinds of smaller markets that were also emerging and we just felt that those were, I think, more appropriate developmental efforts on behalf of the brand, even going back 10 years ago. So like in -- for example, Eastern Europe has slowed down in some markets. Some of the smaller markets, those related to oil, it is -- their economies and their currencies have been so difficult. And so it just -- this round of emerging market difficulty because there's always -- it seems to me that there's some markets going up and down, and that's why we like the geographic diversification we have this particular year, with emphasis on Russia and then some of the smaller markets, other markets tied to -- particularly tied to oil, seem to hit us in more than they had in past years. And it doesn't really take away over a longer period of time our viewpoint that these will be important markets for Brown-Forman.

And in this particular year, in year 2 of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, reminds me in some ways of prior years where there was such interest in the prior year on the launch of something where there was pent-up demand, which I felt last year, when -- in spring particularly after we've done that stage rollout. And there was a huge surge and interest in trial associated with this product.

When you look at any short-term period, whether it's a month or a quarter, there could be all kinds of explanations for why they might be showing big gains or big losses. I think we have the number of entries that are going in there. I know and as we sort of explained for our business, we're currently, on the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, up against some, I think, some significant introductory promotion and trial from last year. So for us, that would be the case. I can't speak to every single competitor, but I suspect that -- remember, this category is still relatively new. So there's been a lot of new introductions just in the last 2 years. I mean, I remember, thinking about it, I guess, as we turn the calendar year, this year, how much did it change, just even since we began with the launch of Tennessee Honey and then how we had sort of methodically been testing Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire and how rapidly the category kind of changed just from the test markets on Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire to the national launch. And so it's the nature of these categories that rapidly develop. We think we're smart to be in it in the way that we're in it. It's been very, very nice business success for us to date but also plays, just as we were referencing on the roles brands can play in portfolio, it plays a very strategic role in some ways defensively but also very offensively as it relates to giving people an opportunity to try whiskey in a way that they might not have before. The straight whiskey can be an acquired taste. And we find that this category, particularly for our brands, has been bringing in new consumers, and it generates an interest in our other whiskeys, most notably Jack Daniel's Black Label. And so it plays -- it can play a strategic role as well as being a bona fide business in some right."

But I think the category will continue to grow. But then within the category, you'll see trademarks and certain flavors be more volatile than you would say a normal bourbon or gin or vodka category, but just because the category is so dynamic right now. As it relates to Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, I think once we cycle through some of these comparisons, the impact won't be as large. But I still expect  that it will -- I really do feel like that first year with particularly a brand that's participating in a category where the flavor is cinnamon, I really do expect that they're in the first sort of half of its national launch. There were absolutely -- just think of it this way. There were -- I know there were a bunch of Jack Daniel's drinkers who were straight whiskey drinkers and were not participants for say, in the cinnamon whiskey business, who tried it and just decided it wasn't for them, right? I mean, they prefer straight whiskey. I think there were also a fair amount of fireball, which was the -- obviously, the large volume, lower priced brand. They tried it and then maybe didn't see fit that they could afford it on every single occasion when they were consuming cinnamon-flavored whiskey. And so I think those things, they end up being what I call trial influences in those early days of a brand's existence in a marketplace that just don't get repeated. So until [ph] you work through some of that and then also begin the marketing and selling process to introduce the brands to new consumers, which -- the most encouraging thing we're seeing in our numbers which don't really reported a lot in the syndicated data is the -- are the results to the on premise, which kind of started okay, I felt. I thought it was going along pretty well. But with the expanded distribution and the momentum that sort of happened out in the marketplace, the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire brand is doing very, very well right now in the on premise, which -- it might surprise you because the off premise is not doing as well against that introductory launch. So in any event, the thing that gives us encouragement and tells us we can either continue to sell it and market it and promote it in a way that can make it the choice for more consumer locations. I mean, it just comes down to that and in knowing it full well that it's going to be a competitive environment in which you are attempting to do that."

I plan on covering 3 topics today, which should leave plenty of time for questions after our prepared remarks. First, I'll review our full year results, including a brief overview of the fourth quarter. Second, I'll discuss our earnings outlook for fiscal 2017. And finally, I'll share some additional color on the changes we have made to our portfolio over the past year, including the BenRiach acquisition.
So let me start by reviewing our results. Despite a very challenging comparison against last year's fourth quarter 10% increase in underlying net sales, which you will recall, benefited from the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire in the United States, we delivered solid 4% growth and underlying net sales during this year's fourth quarter. Underlying A&P spend increased 8% while a 3% reduction in underlying SG&A boosted our underlying operating income growth to 15% for the quarter.
For the full year, underlying net sales grew 5% and underlying income increased 8%, in line with the guidance we shared with you on our third quarter call and well ahead of our estimate for the industry's rate of growth. Our net sales growth in the year was driven by volume gains from our premium price brands, driving 4 points of mixed benefit and 10 basis points of gross margin expansion.
Looking at our business results by geography. The developed world delivered growth consistent with last year, helping offset a slowdown in emerging markets and declines in our travel retail channels. We grew underlying sales in each of the top 10 markets with the exception of Russia and believe that our balanced geographic approach in building our portfolio is one of the reasons why we consistently deliver top-tier results.
The United States grew underlying net sales by 6%, led by the Jack Daniel's family of brands, a remarkable achievement for a trademark that is celebrating 150 years in the market. The U.S. launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire contributed almost 1 point of underlying net sales growth to our corporate results in fiscal 2016. Combined, Tennessee Honey and Tennessee Fire depleted over 1 million cases in the United States in fiscal 2016, strengthening the brand equity of the Jack Daniel's family by appealing to new consumers and accelerating the brand's reach across ethnicity and gender.
We believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from consumer interest in premium American whiskey. Our leadership position in this category is, of course, driven by the Jack Daniel's family of brands but is also aided by our bourbon brands such as Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, both of which enjoyed rapid rates of growth in fiscal 2016. And we believe that our whiskey expertise, including our vertically integrated supply chain from barrels to homeplace experiences position us well to grow our brand in the coming years.
Woodford's family of brands reached 500,000 cases in fiscal 2016. While this impressive milestone might seem like an overnight sensation, it required a strategy built on patience and consistent investment behind the creation of a new brand in the mid-1990s that leveraged heritage and our whiskey-making expertise. We are replicating this proven business model with Slane Irish whiskey, which we believe can become the next Woodford-like driver of our company's result as we see the next 20 years of growth.
Developed markets outside the United States also delivered solid underlying net sales growth, up 6%. This rate of growth marks a 2-point acceleration from fiscal 2015 with particularly strong results in Western Europe, up high single digits, as well as solid gains in Canada and New Zealand. Australia, Japan and Spain each returned to growth during the year while results in Italy declined.
The Jack Daniel's trademark is continuing to gain share from blended Scotch among other categories, and our market shares remain low compared to what we have achieved in the United States. So we are optimistic that the best is yet to come as the Jack Daniel's benefit from its brand positioning around confidence and independence, strong heritage and authenticity, not to mention its prominent and pop culture.
Moving now to our emerging markets business. Underlying net sales grew 4% in the year, a marked [ph] deceleration from what we have delivered over the last decade. Mexico and Poland, our largest -- 2 largest emerging markets, grew underlying net sales by 6% and 1%, respectively. Turkey grew 17% while Russia declined 17%. Brazil, South Africa and Ukraine each grew underlying net sales double digits, but this growth was offset by the slowdown in many of our other small emerging markets, including Southeast Asia, where regulatory changes in Indonesia led to significant disruption in the beginning of fiscal 2016.
Our business has not been immune to the weaker economic condition and currency devaluations that have negatively impacted consumer demand. In our other markets, which represented 15% of total sales per the table in our earnings release this morning, underlying net sales growth accelerated from 11% in fiscal 2015 to flat in 2016, effectively removing 1.5 points from top line growth. As we look ahead, we think the challenges in many emerging markets will persist in the short term. But that does not diminish our long-term expectations for emerging markets, given how early we are in developing our brand outside of the United States.
Travel retail had a challenging start to fiscal 2016 with underlying net sales declines of almost 20%. The rate of decline has moderated over the last 3 quarters. So while business fundamentals remain soft compared to this historic levels of growth, we believe the worst is behind us. Travel retail's 12% underlying net sales decline in the year removed about 0.5 point from fiscal 2016 net sales growth rate.
Let's move now to a reconciliation of reported to underlying results. An appreciating U.S. dollar negatively impacted our reported net sales in fiscal 2016 by 6 percentage points. While inventories were roughly flat year-over-year, reported sales were also hit by 1 percentage point due to the 2 months' absence of Southern Comfort and Tuaca revenue while under disposition during the fourth quarter. Our underlying operating costs increased nearly 3% in the year but declined approximately 3% on a reported basis.
Tight cost management helped us deliver SG&A growth of only 2%, and we remain focused on leveraging prior SG&A investments. It's worth noting that excluding Southern Comfort and Tuaca, our A&P increased over 5% for the portfolio of brands we have today, in line with our underlying sales growth. Putting this all together, we delivered 8% growth in underlying operating income for the fourth year. Reported operating income increased 49%, including the impact of the sale of Southern Comfort and Tuaca and 3% excluding. Earnings per share increased 63% to $5.22. Excluding the $1.76 impact as a result of the sale, our earnings per share would have been roughly $3.46, an increase of 8% from the prior year.
So now turning to my second topic for today, our outlook for fiscal 2017. Notwithstanding the emerging market slowdown we experienced during fiscal 2016, we expect our portfolio SKU to premium American whiskey will allow us to capitalize on favorable trends as consumers continue to shift from white to brand spirits, driven by a desire for heritage, authenticity and craftsmanship.
In fiscal 2017, we will be activating a global campaign to celebrate Jack Daniel's 150th anniversary as America's oldest registered distillery. This activation consists of a focused campaign here in the United States called Jack Attack, including additional media spend and programming behind the trademark that we believe will accelerate our growth in the United States. It also entails large-scale events in Lynchburg and pop-up distillery experiences in several major metro markets. And we'll introduce special edition products, including an 86-proof Jack Daniel's 150th anniversary bottle.
This intense consumer campaign extends far beyond the United States, including a global Jack Daniel's barrel hunt in over 50 countries and incremental media support. Our global teams and partners will focus on the premiumization of this trademark through additional support behind Gentleman Jack as well as the continued growth and rollout of Tennessee Honey and Tennessee Fire outside the United States.
In fiscal 2017, we expect underlying net sales growth of 4% to 6%, driven by sustained growth of our portfolio of brands in the developed world. We intend to launch Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire in a few markets outside the United States, including the United Kingdom, France and Germany. We are innovating with high-quality expression, including rolling out Woodford Reserve Rye and Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Rye as well as introducing Coopers' Craft, our first new bourbon in 2 decades.
Furthermore, underlying net sales should benefit from global consumer demand from our premium bourbon and tequila brands. We expect to benefit from both the easier comparison and travel retail this coming year as well as the absence of the 15 basis point drag that Southern Comfort had on last year's results.
On the negative front, we anticipate moderate pricing for used barrels as the global slowdown in blended Scotch is negatively impacting barrel demand. Fiscal 2017 should be another year of volume gains and improved mix but with minimal pricing beyond a few select markets given the overall economic environment. This should result in flat gross margins compared to fiscal 2016.
We are investing behind our brands' growth and development and are reallocating our human capital in dollars towards the brand market combination that we believe have the greatest opportunities to create value. We are forecasting another year of low single-digit growth in SG&A. And so while we are tightly controlling our core SG&A growth, we will invest where the opportunities exist such as plan to switch to own distribution in Spain next summer, which will result in some modest cost later this fiscal year.
In total, we anticipate underlying operating income growth of 7% to 9%. At today's spot rates, we expect the stronger dollar will negatively impact reported earnings per share by $0.07. The benefits from a lower share count will be offset somewhat by reductions in distributor inventories. The effective tax rate will be in the 29% to 30% range.
In aggregate, we expect earnings per share of $3.42 to $3.62. This represents 5% to 11% growth from our fiscal 2016 baseline EPS of $3.26, which excludes $0.26 -- $0.20 of earnings contribution from Southern Comfort and Tuaca in fiscal 2016. You'll find additional details in a table in our earnings release that we released this morning. As with sensitivity on FX, a 10% move in the dollar in either direction would impact our full year EPS by approximately $0.15.
Just a quick comment on seasonality. We expect our first quarter to be the most challenging comparison against 7% underlying growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, which was also helped by the U.S. launch of Tennessee Fire. Regarding our capital spending programs, CapEx came in at $108 million for the year, well below our original estimate, driven largely by timing as our long-term capital expansion plan remain unchanged. Timing of spend for Slane Castle and the Old Forester distillery in homeplace, for example, will be weighted more to fiscal 2017 than we expected at this time last year. We are over halfway through our stepped up investments to increase total capacity and continue to deliver an industry-leading 23% return on invested capital after adjusting for the gain on the sale of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, the highest ROIC in a decade for our company.
Now let me move now to my final topic, an update on portfolio changes, including the acquisition of the BenRiach Distillery Company. We made some important changes to our portfolio of brands over the last 12 months, including the disposition of Southern Comfort and Tuaca as well as our reentry into the single malt Scotch category with the BenRiach acquisition.
These portfolio changes mark the continuation of a decade of portfolio evolution at Brown-Forman, following the sale of Lenox China and Hartmann luggage, the acquisition of Casa Herradura tequila portfolio and the sale of our mid-priced wines, Fetzer and Bonterra. In addition to this M&A activity, we have introduced significant innovation into the marketplace, including the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Fire, Woodford Reserve Double Oaked and Rye and our entry into Irish whiskey with Slane.
So let me share a bit more color on our rationale for our most recent addition to our portfolio, the acquisitions of the BenRiach distillery company and 3 great single malt Scotch brands GlenDronach, BenRiach and Glenglassaugh. The single malt Scotch category is one of the fastest-growing categories, along with American whiskey and Irish whiskey. Outside of the 4 largest single malt brands, GlenDronach, BenRiach and Glenglassaugh represent the largest collective production capacity in the industry, giving us a great plan -- platform for which to build our -- over time.
We believe that our whiskey-making knowledge, barrel technology know-how and long-term perspective will continue to serve us well. Combined, these single malt Scotch brands are relatively small today under 100,000 cases in calendar 2015. But we believe they have significant global potential as our primary markets today are focused on the United States, Duty Free, U.K., France, Taiwan and Germany. There is also a small blended Scotch business today.
Given the purchase price of just over USD 400 million, we paid a similar multiple on trailing EBITDA to where Brown-Forman trades today. We believe that we acquired high-quality brands and assets, including the current homeplaces, distilleries, warehouses and the bottling facility, not to mention valuable inventory. Equally important is the potential for these brands in a rapidly growing category. So we are hard at work at developing the long-term business plan of how we can maximize the value of these brands.
As is typical with any acquisition, we expect some transition and integration costs this year somewhere in the $5 million to $10 million range. But even after including these costs, we expect the acquisition to be roughly neutral to earnings in fiscal 2017, given only 11 months of ownership, and then will be accretive in the following years.
Let me remind you that our last acquisition of size was when we acquired Casa Herradura in 2007. After several years of methodical investment, these brands have enjoyed solid growth over the last few years as we believe they have reached an inflection point in consumer awareness. Herradura's underlying net sales jumped 13% globally in fiscal 2016, while Herradura's U.S. underlying net sales increased 19%. And New Mix, our Mexican RTD business, experienced a 23% jump. So all in all, a stellar year for our tequila brands, but one that was years in the making. We expect that these single malt Scotch brands will also receive time -- require time and patience to best position them to help fuel our growth over the long term.
So in summary, fiscal 2016 was another great year for Brown-Forman. We delivered solid top and bottom line growth, notwithstanding foreign exchange pressure from an appreciating U.S. dollar. We invested significantly in the long-term opportunities that we believe will fuel our growth over the coming decades, including our entry into Irish whiskey with Slane and the launch of Coopers' Craft. We made several enhancements to our portfolio of brands, including the disposal of Southern Comfort and Tuaca and the acquisition of BenRiach, and we invested over $100 million in capital investments behind our organic growth prospects.
We did all of this while returning a record $1.4 billion of capital to our shareholders in fiscal 2016. Steady dividend growth is a hallmark of Brown-Forman, and we increased ours by 8% this past year. We repurchased over 11 million shares, bringing our diluted share count to half of where it was in the mid-1980s, and we recently proposed a 2-for-1 stock split, our seventh split in 35 years. Our ability to simultaneously grow our business, invest in the future and return capital are reasons why we believe we can continue to generate top-tier returns for our shareholders.
Our TSRs have outperformed the competitive fit, [ph] the Consumer Staples Index and the S&P 500 over the past 3-, 5-, 10-year periods by a healthy margin. We believe that we will remain an industry leader through thoughtful allocation of resources and categories focused on our core competency, whiskey. We operate in a business with aged products in multi-generational brands, and we benefit from having a long-term focus and engaged shareholder base through family control. And with our strong cash flow generation and inherent capital efficiency, we will continue to pursue a well-balanced capital agreement strategy aimed at perpetuating Brown-Forman's strength and independence.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Paul for his comments."

My take on FY '16 and our guidance for FY '17 is that they are both illustrative to Brown-Forman's strong and continuing organic growth story once you consider the effect of last year's dispositions and account",978,"Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. My take on FY '16 and our guidance for FY '17 is that they are both illustrative to Brown-Forman's strong and continuing organic growth story once you consider the effect of last year's dispositions and account for the impact of FX and inventory, which we customarily do. Something a little less customary is the disproportionate amount of work we've been doing of late to position Brown-Forman for enduring growth in the distant years ahead. And for sake of defining distant years ahead, I mean 2020 at the earliest and more like 2025 and beyond.
While we always strive to take a long view of our business, somewhat by necessity, given the aging horizons for most of our products, this last 18 months, in my view, has been even more exemplary of Brown-Forman's long-term orientation. The current time reminds me in some ways of similarly strategic times in our recent history when we made changes to benefit our long-term future. Examples would be the early 1990s when we began a more aggressive geographic expansion, which included our initial work in emerging markets and our first experiences with international distribution ventures; the mid-2000s when we followed our disposal of Lenox and Hartmann with the acquisitions of Casa Herradura and Chambord; and more recently, in 2011 when we sold the vast majority of our wine business to enable us to better focus on our premium American whiskey trademarks at a time when consumer interest in the category had begun to surge.
In the last 5 years, this shift of focus, alongside further investments in our organization and global route-to-market, contributed to successes such as: Jack Daniel's Black Label's ascent to one of the industry's most valuable brands; the creation of both Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, 2 of the company's most successful line extensions ever; the accelerated development for super premium brands, Woodford Reserve and Gentleman Jack, as both brands achieved the difficult super premium volumetric milestone of 500,000 cases; and the resurgence of Brown-Forman's founding brand, Old Forester.
So now in mid-2016, we have our recent portfolio changes and capital deployment actions as examples of significant actions and investments from which we believe shareholders are likely to benefit in the years ahead. The investments we've made in Scotch and Irish whiskey over the last year are intended to give us brand and production platforms for what I'd like to call Woodford Reserve-like brand development over the next generation and exciting premium whiskey categories adjacent to the American whiskey category that we know so well.
Our patient brand building success on Woodford is certainly a source of confidence as we begin our work behind brands like GlenDronach and Slane. And our initial investment behind Coopers' Craft bourbon will enable us to tell our story of our coopers, the people who make our whiskey barrels and in doing so, convey the importance of wood and barrels in crafting the highest quality bourbons. The brand will leverage our distinctive know-how in its very old and truly unique trade of barrel making. We will undoubtedly seek to apply some of this cooperage expertise to our new endeavors in both Ireland and Scotland.
For these new trademarks and products to find commercial success, they need the focus of an organization that has the skill, the scale and the time to develop them. Brown-Forman's global route to market platform is a strong asset in this regard, and with the sale of Southern Comfort and Tuaca in FY '16, we have enabled our sales team to shift their focus to existing brands with greater growth prospects as well as the newer brands that I've just mentioned.
Since we are not reducing overhead cost dollar for dollar to cover the lost profitability of the brands we recently disposed, I consider this an incremental organizational investment against big ideas like Jack Daniel's 150th distillery anniversary this year and Coopers' Craft and BenRiach in the years ahead. We made a similar type of hidden investment behind our American whiskeys after the sale of our wine brands in 2011 and has served them very well in the years that ensued.
Beyond these portfolio and organizational investments, quality capital deployment, long a hallmark at Brown-Forman, will continue to be important to the next 10 years and beyond. We are fortunate to have a very capital-efficient business model as evidenced by the 23% return on invested capital that Jane mentioned in her comments as well as excellent financial flexibility.
Beyond the acquisitions I've mentioned, we are continuing to make significant investments in production expansion and homeplace marketing at Jack Daniel's, Woodford Reserve, Old Forester and Slane. In the years -- and in the years ahead, we will incur depreciation costs associated with this additional capacity. These investments are intended to enable us to grow going forward in a manner similar to our last 10 years. Considering the margins, returns, track record of growth and the potential we see ahead, I believe these capital expenditures are excellent investments by the company.
And finally, through our more ambitious share repurchase program of late, shareholders are essentially given the options of liquidity for those who choose to sell their shares or a slightly increased percentage ownership of Brown-Forman for those to choose to hold their shares. For nonselling shareholders, your decision means the repurchase program, therefore, represents a long-term investment the company makes on your behalf in the future of Brown-Forman. And that is something that we believe in, and I hope today's results and next year's outlook as well as our discussion of the investments we are making to enable our continued success give you a similar belief in the company's prospects for continued value creation.
That concludes our remarks. Thank you for listening. And we're now happy to take any questions you have."

One, we're cycling against the Fire launch in the United States. So that -- what happened -- if you recall last year's fourth quarter, so we didn't repeat that big buy-in. It sold all the way through to the retailers, last year's fourth quarter. And probably, I think, that's one of the things that's driving it. The second thing is we continue to have declines in Finlandia. It's a low-priced brand, so a little margin brand. So it really hit your top line, not so much your bottom line. It continues to be heard in markets like Russia and the CIS, so some of the markets where the economic conditions have just continued to be very, very poor. And so you can -- we saw some acceleration in the back half of the year on that brand and then again, the other piece being the absence of the launch in the U.S. on the Fire. So you did see a slowdown because of those 2 factors, if you will. They netted again -- the gains that we had on the rest of the portfolio that continue to grow nicely. Our premium bourbon brands continue to grow nicely, our tequilas did and Jack Daniel's did as well. In terms of -- as we look to next year, we're expecting really, very little, if any, pricing just in a few select markets, so it'll be more mix. But what's coming along next year is -- Paul alluded to this a little bit. We've been making investments for a number of years -- last several years behind our production facilities' sustained capacities, so we can meet demand that we think we'll be there in the not-so-distant future. So we're going to have some a bit higher cost than our price. Price will come through so that higher costs will also offset the mix benefit that we've been -- that saw this year. So most of it will be coming from pricing -- excuse me, volumes next year, most of our growth."

I think part of it was the early part of the slowdown. So much of it was associated for some of our competition in China where we -- just our presence is relative on a percentage basis smaller than many of our competitors. So maybe that and particularly the cognac players, they were impacted by that going back a few years. I think more recently for us, we've seen that in places -- a lot is -- Jack Daniel's is so geographically diversified and spread. And for many, many years, it has been developing its business and for example, in the emerging markets, we never singularly focused on BRIC. We looked to all kinds of smaller markets that were also emerging and we just felt that those were, I think, more appropriate developmental efforts on behalf of the brand, even going back 10 years ago. So like in -- for example, Eastern Europe has slowed down in some markets. Some of the smaller markets, those related to oil, it is -- their economies and their currencies have been so difficult. And so it just -- this round of emerging market difficulty because there's always -- it seems to me that there's some markets going up and down, and that's why we like the geographic diversification we have this particular year, with emphasis on Russia and then some of the smaller markets, other markets tied to -- particularly tied to oil, seem to hit us in more than they had in past years. And it doesn't really take away over a longer period of time our viewpoint that these will be important markets for Brown-Forman. It's just that you have to be patient while those economies wrestle with what's happening locally."

When you look at any short-term period, whether it's a month or a quarter, there could be all kinds of explanations for why they might be showing big gains or big losses. I think we have the number of entries that are going in there. I know and as we sort of explained for our business, we're currently, on the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, up against some, I think, some significant introductory promotion and trial from last year. So for us, that would be the case. I can't speak to every single competitor, but I suspect that -- remember, this category is still relatively new. So there's been a lot of new introductions just in the last 2 years. I mean, I remember, thinking about it, I guess, as we turn the calendar year, this year, how much did it change, just even since we began with the launch of Tennessee Honey and then how we had sort of methodically been testing Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire and how rapidly the category kind of changed just from the test markets on Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire to the national launch. And so it's the nature of these categories that rapidly develop. We think we're smart to be in it in the way that we're in it. It's been very, very nice business success for us to date but also plays, just as we were referencing on the roles brands can play in portfolio, it plays a very strategic role in some ways defensively but also very offensively as it relates to giving people an opportunity to try whiskey in a way that they might not have before. The straight whiskey can be an acquired taste. And we find that this category, particularly for our brands, has been bringing in new consumers, and it generates an interest in our other whiskeys, most notably Jack Daniel's Black Label. And so it plays -- it can play a strategic role as well as being a bona fide business in some right."

But I think the category will continue to grow. But then within the category, you'll see trademarks and certain flavors be more volatile than you would say a normal bourbon or gin or vodka category, but just because the category is so dynamic right now. As it relates to Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, I think once we cycle through some of these comparisons, the impact won't be as large. But I still expect  that it will -- I really do feel like that first year with particularly a brand that's participating in a category where the flavor is cinnamon, I really do expect that they're in the first sort of half of its national launch. There were absolutely -- just think of it this way. There were -- I know there were a bunch of Jack Daniel's drinkers who were straight whiskey drinkers and were not participants for say, in the cinnamon whiskey business, who tried it and just decided it wasn't for them, right? I mean, they prefer straight whiskey. I think there were also a fair amount of fireball, which was the -- obviously, the large volume, lower priced brand. They tried it and then maybe didn't see fit that they could afford it on every single occasion when they were consuming cinnamon-flavored whiskey. And so I think those things, they end up being what I call trial influences in those early days of a brand's existence in a marketplace that just don't get repeated. So until [ph] you work through some of that and then also begin the marketing and selling process to introduce the brands to new consumers, which -- the most encouraging thing we're seeing in our numbers which don't really reported a lot in the syndicated data is the -- are the results to the on premise, which kind of started okay, I felt. I thought it was going along pretty well. But with the expanded distribution and the momentum that sort of happened out in the marketplace, the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire brand is doing very, very well right now in the on premise, which -- it might surprise you because the off premise is not doing as well against that introductory launch. So in any event, the thing that gives us encouragement and tells us we can either continue to sell it and market it and promote it in a way that can make it the choice for more consumer locations. I mean, it just comes down to that and in knowing it full well that it's going to be a competitive environment in which you are attempting to do that."

I plan on covering 3 topics today, which should leave plenty of time for questions after our prepared remarks. First, I'll review our full year results, including a brief overview of the fourth quarter. Second, I'll discuss our earnings outlook for fiscal 2017. And finally, I'll share some additional color on the changes we have made to our portfolio over the past year, including the BenRiach acquisition.
So let me start by reviewing our results. Despite a very challenging comparison against last year's fourth quarter 10% increase in underlying net sales, which you will recall, benefited from the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire in the United States, we delivered solid 4% growth and underlying net sales during this year's fourth quarter. Underlying A&P spend increased 8% while a 3% reduction in underlying SG&A boosted our underlying operating income growth to 15% for the quarter.
For the full year, underlying net sales grew 5% and underlying income increased 8%, in line with the guidance we shared with you on our third quarter call and well ahead of our estimate for the industry's rate of growth. Our net sales growth in the year was driven by volume gains from our premium price brands, driving 4 points of mixed benefit and 10 basis points of gross margin expansion.
Looking at our business results by geography. The developed world delivered growth consistent with last year, helping offset a slowdown in emerging markets and declines in our travel retail channels. We grew underlying sales in each of the top 10 markets with the exception of Russia and believe that our balanced geographic approach in building our portfolio is one of the reasons why we consistently deliver top-tier results.
The United States grew underlying net sales by 6%, led by the Jack Daniel's family of brands, a remarkable achievement for a trademark that is celebrating 150 years in the market. The U.S. launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire contributed almost 1 point of underlying net sales growth to our corporate results in fiscal 2016. Combined, Tennessee Honey and Tennessee Fire depleted over 1 million cases in the United States in fiscal 2016, strengthening the brand equity of the Jack Daniel's family by appealing to new consumers and accelerating the brand's reach across ethnicity and gender.
We believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from consumer interest in premium American whiskey. Our leadership position in this category is, of course, driven by the Jack Daniel's family of brands but is also aided by our bourbon brands such as Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, both of which enjoyed rapid rates of growth in fiscal 2016. And we believe that our whiskey expertise, including our vertically integrated supply chain from barrels to homeplace experiences position us well to grow our brand in the coming years.
Woodford's family of brands reached 500,000 cases in fiscal 2016. While this impressive milestone might seem like an overnight sensation, it required a strategy built on patience and consistent investment behind the creation of a new brand in the mid-1990s that leveraged heritage and our whiskey-making expertise. We are replicating this proven business model with Slane Irish whiskey, which we believe can become the next Woodford-like driver of our company's result as we see the next 20 years of growth.
Developed markets outside the United States also delivered solid underlying net sales growth, up 6%. This rate of growth marks a 2-point acceleration from fiscal 2015 with particularly strong results in Western Europe, up high single digits, as well as solid gains in Canada and New Zealand. Australia, Japan and Spain each returned to growth during the year while results in Italy declined.
The Jack Daniel's trademark is continuing to gain share from blended Scotch among other categories, and our market shares remain low compared to what we have achieved in the United States. So we are optimistic that the best is yet to come as the Jack Daniel's benefit from its brand positioning around confidence and independence, strong heritage and authenticity, not to mention its prominent and pop culture.
Moving now to our emerging markets business. Underlying net sales grew 4% in the year, a marked [ph] deceleration from what we have delivered over the last decade. Mexico and Poland, our largest -- 2 largest emerging markets, grew underlying net sales by 6% and 1%, respectively. Turkey grew 17% while Russia declined 17%. Brazil, South Africa and Ukraine each grew underlying net sales double digits, but this growth was offset by the slowdown in many of our other small emerging markets, including Southeast Asia, where regulatory changes in Indonesia led to significant disruption in the beginning of fiscal 2016.
Our business has not been immune to the weaker economic condition and currency devaluations that have negatively impacted consumer demand. In our other markets, which represented 15% of total sales per the table in our earnings release this morning, underlying net sales growth accelerated from 11% in fiscal 2015 to flat in 2016, effectively removing 1.5 points from top line growth. As we look ahead, we think the challenges in many emerging markets will persist in the short term. But that does not diminish our long-term expectations for emerging markets, given how early we are in developing our brand outside of the United States.
Travel retail had a challenging start to fiscal 2016 with underlying net sales declines of almost 20%. The rate of decline has moderated over the last 3 quarters. So while business fundamentals remain soft compared to this historic levels of growth, we believe the worst is behind us. Travel retail's 12% underlying net sales decline in the year removed about 0.5 point from fiscal 2016 net sales growth rate.
Let's move now to a reconciliation of reported to underlying results. An appreciating U.S. dollar negatively impacted our reported net sales in fiscal 2016 by 6 percentage points. While inventories were roughly flat year-over-year, reported sales were also hit by 1 percentage point due to the 2 months' absence of Southern Comfort and Tuaca revenue while under disposition during the fourth quarter. Our underlying operating costs increased nearly 3% in the year but declined approximately 3% on a reported basis.
Tight cost management helped us deliver SG&A growth of only 2%, and we remain focused on leveraging prior SG&A investments. It's worth noting that excluding Southern Comfort and Tuaca, our A&P increased over 5% for the portfolio of brands we have today, in line with our underlying sales growth. Putting this all together, we delivered 8% growth in underlying operating income for the fourth year. Reported operating income increased 49%, including the impact of the sale of Southern Comfort and Tuaca and 3% excluding. Earnings per share increased 63% to $5.22. Excluding the $1.76 impact as a result of the sale, our earnings per share would have been roughly $3.46, an increase of 8% from the prior year.
So now turning to my second topic for today, our outlook for fiscal 2017. Notwithstanding the emerging market slowdown we experienced during fiscal 2016, we expect our portfolio SKU to premium American whiskey will allow us to capitalize on favorable trends as consumers continue to shift from white to brand spirits, driven by a desire for heritage, authenticity and craftsmanship.
In fiscal 2017, we will be activating a global campaign to celebrate Jack Daniel's 150th anniversary as America's oldest registered distillery. This activation consists of a focused campaign here in the United States called Jack Attack, including additional media spend and programming behind the trademark that we believe will accelerate our growth in the United States. It also entails large-scale events in Lynchburg and pop-up distillery experiences in several major metro markets. And we'll introduce special edition products, including an 86-proof Jack Daniel's 150th anniversary bottle.
This intense consumer campaign extends far beyond the United States, including a global Jack Daniel's barrel hunt in over 50 countries and incremental media support. Our global teams and partners will focus on the premiumization of this trademark through additional support behind Gentleman Jack as well as the continued growth and rollout of Tennessee Honey and Tennessee Fire outside the United States.
In fiscal 2017, we expect underlying net sales growth of 4% to 6%, driven by sustained growth of our portfolio of brands in the developed world. We intend to launch Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire in a few markets outside the United States, including the United Kingdom, France and Germany. We are innovating with high-quality expression, including rolling out Woodford Reserve Rye and Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Rye as well as introducing Coopers' Craft, our first new bourbon in 2 decades.
Furthermore, underlying net sales should benefit from global consumer demand from our premium bourbon and tequila brands. We expect to benefit from both the easier comparison and travel retail this coming year as well as the absence of the 15 basis point drag that Southern Comfort had on last year's results.
On the negative front, we anticipate moderate pricing for used barrels as the global slowdown in blended Scotch is negatively impacting barrel demand. Fiscal 2017 should be another year of volume gains and improved mix but with minimal pricing beyond a few select markets given the overall economic environment. This should result in flat gross margins compared to fiscal 2016.
We are investing behind our brands' growth and development and are reallocating our human capital in dollars towards the brand market combination that we believe have the greatest opportunities to create value. We are forecasting another year of low single-digit growth in SG&A. And so while we are tightly controlling our core SG&A growth, we will invest where the opportunities exist such as plan to switch to own distribution in Spain next summer, which will result in some modest cost later this fiscal year.
In total, we anticipate underlying operating income growth of 7% to 9%. At today's spot rates, we expect the stronger dollar will negatively impact reported earnings per share by $0.07. The benefits from a lower share count will be offset somewhat by reductions in distributor inventories. The effective tax rate will be in the 29% to 30% range.
In aggregate, we expect earnings per share of $3.42 to $3.62. This represents 5% to 11% growth from our fiscal 2016 baseline EPS of $3.26, which excludes $0.26 -- $0.20 of earnings contribution from Southern Comfort and Tuaca in fiscal 2016. You'll find additional details in a table in our earnings release that we released this morning. As with sensitivity on FX, a 10% move in the dollar in either direction would impact our full year EPS by approximately $0.15.
Just a quick comment on seasonality. We expect our first quarter to be the most challenging comparison against 7% underlying growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, which was also helped by the U.S. launch of Tennessee Fire. Regarding our capital spending programs, CapEx came in at $108 million for the year, well below our original estimate, driven largely by timing as our long-term capital expansion plan remain unchanged. Timing of spend for Slane Castle and the Old Forester distillery in homeplace, for example, will be weighted more to fiscal 2017 than we expected at this time last year. We are over halfway through our stepped up investments to increase total capacity and continue to deliver an industry-leading 23% return on invested capital after adjusting for the gain on the sale of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, the highest ROIC in a decade for our company.
Now let me move now to my final topic, an update on portfolio changes, including the acquisition of the BenRiach Distillery Company. We made some important changes to our portfolio of brands over the last 12 months, including the disposition of Southern Comfort and Tuaca as well as our reentry into the single malt Scotch category with the BenRiach acquisition.
These portfolio changes mark the continuation of a decade of portfolio evolution at Brown-Forman, following the sale of Lenox China and Hartmann luggage, the acquisition of Casa Herradura tequila portfolio and the sale of our mid-priced wines, Fetzer and Bonterra. In addition to this M&A activity, we have introduced significant innovation into the marketplace, including the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Fire, Woodford Reserve Double Oaked and Rye and our entry into Irish whiskey with Slane.
So let me share a bit more color on our rationale for our most recent addition to our portfolio, the acquisitions of the BenRiach distillery company and 3 great single malt Scotch brands GlenDronach, BenRiach and Glenglassaugh. The single malt Scotch category is one of the fastest-growing categories, along with American whiskey and Irish whiskey. Outside of the 4 largest single malt brands, GlenDronach, BenRiach and Glenglassaugh represent the largest collective production capacity in the industry, giving us a great plan -- platform for which to build our -- over time.
We believe that our whiskey-making knowledge, barrel technology know-how and long-term perspective will continue to serve us well. Combined, these single malt Scotch brands are relatively small today under 100,000 cases in calendar 2015. But we believe they have significant global potential as our primary markets today are focused on the United States, Duty Free, U.K., France, Taiwan and Germany. There is also a small blended Scotch business today.
Given the purchase price of just over USD 400 million, we paid a similar multiple on trailing EBITDA to where Brown-Forman trades today. We believe that we acquired high-quality brands and assets, including the current homeplaces, distilleries, warehouses and the bottling facility, not to mention valuable inventory. Equally important is the potential for these brands in a rapidly growing category. So we are hard at work at developing the long-term business plan of how we can maximize the value of these brands.
As is typical with any acquisition, we expect some transition and integration costs this year somewhere in the $5 million to $10 million range. But even after including these costs, we expect the acquisition to be roughly neutral to earnings in fiscal 2017, given only 11 months of ownership, and then will be accretive in the following years.
Let me remind you that our last acquisition of size was when we acquired Casa Herradura in 2007. After several years of methodical investment, these brands have enjoyed solid growth over the last few years as we believe they have reached an inflection point in consumer awareness. Herradura's underlying net sales jumped 13% globally in fiscal 2016, while Herradura's U.S. underlying net sales increased 19%. And New Mix, our Mexican RTD business, experienced a 23% jump. So all in all, a stellar year for our tequila brands, but one that was years in the making. We expect that these single malt Scotch brands will also receive time -- require time and patience to best position them to help fuel our growth over the long term.
So in summary, fiscal 2016 was another great year for Brown-Forman. We delivered solid top and bottom line growth, notwithstanding foreign exchange pressure from an appreciating U.S. dollar. We invested significantly in the long-term opportunities that we believe will fuel our growth over the coming decades, including our entry into Irish whiskey with Slane and the launch of Coopers' Craft. We made several enhancements to our portfolio of brands, including the disposal of Southern Comfort and Tuaca and the acquisition of BenRiach, and we invested over $100 million in capital investments behind our organic growth prospects.
We did all of this while returning a record $1.4 billion of capital to our shareholders in fiscal 2016. Steady dividend growth is a hallmark of Brown-Forman, and we increased ours by 8% this past year. We repurchased over 11 million shares, bringing our diluted share count to half of where it was in the mid-1980s, and we recently proposed a 2-for-1 stock split, our seventh split in 35 years. Our ability to simultaneously grow our business, invest in the future and return capital are reasons why we believe we can continue to generate top-tier returns for our shareholders.
Our TSRs have outperformed the competitive fit, [ph] the Consumer Staples Index and the S&P 500 over the past 3-, 5-, 10-year periods by a healthy margin. We believe that we will remain an industry leader through thoughtful allocation of resources and categories focused on our core competency, whiskey. We operate in a business with aged products in multi-generational brands, and we benefit from having a long-term focus and engaged shareholder base through family control. And with our strong cash flow generation and inherent capital efficiency, we will continue to pursue a well-balanced capital agreement strategy aimed at perpetuating Brown-Forman's strength and independence.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Paul for his comments."

My take on FY '16 and our guidance for FY '17 is that they are both illustrative to Brown-Forman's strong and continuing organic growth story once you consider the effect of last year's dispositions and account",978,"Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. My take on FY '16 and our guidance for FY '17 is that they are both illustrative to Brown-Forman's strong and continuing organic growth story once you consider the effect of last year's dispositions and account for the impact of FX and inventory, which we customarily do. Something a little less customary is the disproportionate amount of work we've been doing of late to position Brown-Forman for enduring growth in the distant years ahead. And for sake of defining distant years ahead, I mean 2020 at the earliest and more like 2025 and beyond.
While we always strive to take a long view of our business, somewhat by necessity, given the aging horizons for most of our products, this last 18 months, in my view, has been even more exemplary of Brown-Forman's long-term orientation. The current time reminds me in some ways of similarly strategic times in our recent history when we made changes to benefit our long-term future. Examples would be the early 1990s when we began a more aggressive geographic expansion, which included our initial work in emerging markets and our first experiences with international distribution ventures; the mid-2000s when we followed our disposal of Lenox and Hartmann with the acquisitions of Casa Herradura and Chambord; and more recently, in 2011 when we sold the vast majority of our wine business to enable us to better focus on our premium American whiskey trademarks at a time when consumer interest in the category had begun to surge.
In the last 5 years, this shift of focus, alongside further investments in our organization and global route-to-market, contributed to successes such as: Jack Daniel's Black Label's ascent to one of the industry's most valuable brands; the creation of both Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey and Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, 2 of the company's most successful line extensions ever; the accelerated development for super premium brands, Woodford Reserve and Gentleman Jack, as both brands achieved the difficult super premium volumetric milestone of 500,000 cases; and the resurgence of Brown-Forman's founding brand, Old Forester.
So now in mid-2016, we have our recent portfolio changes and capital deployment actions as examples of significant actions and investments from which we believe shareholders are likely to benefit in the years ahead. The investments we've made in Scotch and Irish whiskey over the last year are intended to give us brand and production platforms for what I'd like to call Woodford Reserve-like brand development over the next generation and exciting premium whiskey categories adjacent to the American whiskey category that we know so well.
Our patient brand building success on Woodford is certainly a source of confidence as we begin our work behind brands like GlenDronach and Slane. And our initial investment behind Coopers' Craft bourbon will enable us to tell our story of our coopers, the people who make our whiskey barrels and in doing so, convey the importance of wood and barrels in crafting the highest quality bourbons. The brand will leverage our distinctive know-how in its very old and truly unique trade of barrel making. We will undoubtedly seek to apply some of this cooperage expertise to our new endeavors in both Ireland and Scotland.
For these new trademarks and products to find commercial success, they need the focus of an organization that has the skill, the scale and the time to develop them. Brown-Forman's global route to market platform is a strong asset in this regard, and with the sale of Southern Comfort and Tuaca in FY '16, we have enabled our sales team to shift their focus to existing brands with greater growth prospects as well as the newer brands that I've just mentioned.
Since we are not reducing overhead cost dollar for dollar to cover the lost profitability of the brands we recently disposed, I consider this an incremental organizational investment against big ideas like Jack Daniel's 150th distillery anniversary this year and Coopers' Craft and BenRiach in the years ahead. We made a similar type of hidden investment behind our American whiskeys after the sale of our wine brands in 2011 and has served them very well in the years that ensued.
Beyond these portfolio and organizational investments, quality capital deployment, long a hallmark at Brown-Forman, will continue to be important to the next 10 years and beyond. We are fortunate to have a very capital-efficient business model as evidenced by the 23% return on invested capital that Jane mentioned in her comments as well as excellent financial flexibility.
Beyond the acquisitions I've mentioned, we are continuing to make significant investments in production expansion and homeplace marketing at Jack Daniel's, Woodford Reserve, Old Forester and Slane. In the years -- and in the years ahead, we will incur depreciation costs associated with this additional capacity. These investments are intended to enable us to grow going forward in a manner similar to our last 10 years. Considering the margins, returns, track record of growth and the potential we see ahead, I believe these capital expenditures are excellent investments by the company.
And finally, through our more ambitious share repurchase program of late, shareholders are essentially given the options of liquidity for those who choose to sell their shares or a slightly increased percentage ownership of Brown-Forman for those to choose to hold their shares. For nonselling shareholders, your decision means the repurchase program, therefore, represents a long-term investment the company makes on your behalf in the future of Brown-Forman. And that is something that we believe in, and I hope today's results and next year's outlook as well as our discussion of the investments we are making to enable our continued success give you a similar belief in the company's prospects for continued value creation.
That concludes our remarks. Thank you for listening. And we're now happy to take any questions you have."

One, we're cycling against the Fire launch in the United States. So that -- what happened -- if you recall last year's fourth quarter, so we didn't repeat that big buy-in. It sold all the way through to the retailers, last year's fourth quarter. And probably, I think, that's one of the things that's driving it. The second thing is we continue to have declines in Finlandia. It's a low-priced brand, so a little margin brand. So it really hit your top line, not so much your bottom line. It continues to be heard in markets like Russia and the CIS, so some of the markets where the economic conditions have just continued to be very, very poor. And so you can -- we saw some acceleration in the back half of the year on that brand and then again, the other piece being the absence of the launch in the U.S. on the Fire. So you did see a slowdown because of those 2 factors, if you will. They netted again -- the gains that we had on the rest of the portfolio that continue to grow nicely. Our premium bourbon brands continue to grow nicely, our tequilas did and Jack Daniel's did as well. In terms of -- as we look to next year, we're expecting really, very little, if any, pricing just in a few select markets, so it'll be more mix. But what's coming along next year is -- Paul alluded to this a little bit. We've been making investments for a number of years -- last several years behind our production facilities' sustained capacities, so we can meet demand that we think we'll be there in the not-so-distant future. So we're going to have some a bit higher cost than our price. Price will come through so that higher costs will also offset the mix benefit that we've been -- that saw this year. So most of it will be coming from pricing -- excuse me, volumes next year, most of our growth."

I think part of it was the early part of the slowdown. So much of it was associated for some of our competition in China where we -- just our presence is relative on a percentage basis smaller than many of our competitors. So maybe that and particularly the cognac players, they were impacted by that going back a few years. I think more recently for us, we've seen that in places -- a lot is -- Jack Daniel's is so geographically diversified and spread. And for many, many years, it has been developing its business and for example, in the emerging markets, we never singularly focused on BRIC. We looked to all kinds of smaller markets that were also emerging and we just felt that those were, I think, more appropriate developmental efforts on behalf of the brand, even going back 10 years ago. So like in -- for example, Eastern Europe has slowed down in some markets. Some of the smaller markets, those related to oil, it is -- their economies and their currencies have been so difficult. And so it just -- this round of emerging market difficulty because there's always -- it seems to me that there's some markets going up and down, and that's why we like the geographic diversification we have this particular year, with emphasis on Russia and then some of the smaller markets, other markets tied to -- particularly tied to oil, seem to hit us in more than they had in past years. And it doesn't really take away over a longer period of time our viewpoint that these will be important markets for Brown-Forman. It's just that you have to be patient while those economies wrestle with what's happening locally."

And are there other strategic considerations as you think about brand like Finlandia where given its size and the Russian market, that you kind of need a sizable brand like this if you are going to be in that market?"

I think there are always strategic considerations. But we don't have the largest portfolio by any means. And so as a general bias, we are brand builders versus brand sellers. And I really do feel like that almost any brand in our portfolio, we're going to try to do the best job we can with it and oftentimes, they do play strategic roles. And Finlandia has been very important to particularly Jack Daniel's' development in Eastern Europe over the last decade. And Finlandia has been, on its own merit, a very successful brand in that part of the world. It's just a very difficult time for the vodka segments in those Eastern European countries right now. And we've seen this before with categories where they go through some rough times, but it doesn't mean we don't put our best foot forward. And actually, we're -- right now, we've continued to work on Finlandia. We've got -- I don't know if it will hit this year, but it -- maybe into the next fiscal year as it takes a lot to make those changes. But we're sort of enthusiastic about some packaging changes there. And this -- we have the latitude of being patient here because it's really -- in the grand scheme of things, the brands you mentioned are not that significant a drag on Brown-Forman. I mean, they're relatively small when you get down to the bottom line as it relates to their -- the degree of their impact on our performance. I mean, yes, they might pull you up a quarter or 2 on the sales line or even on the operating income line, a little bit from time to time. But I mean, the story of our company, because of the -- just development that I mentioned over the last decade or more around Jack Daniel's and our American whiskeys is really where we're placing our emphasis today. But having said that, it doesn't mean that we're not going to develop brands in the tequila space, which we're very excited about what's been going on within the last 18 months or so, but also do the best job we can to shore up brands that are having difficult performances like Finlandia and Canadian Mist."

When you look at any short-term period, whether it's a month or a quarter, there could be all kinds of explanations for why they might be showing big gains or big losses. I think we have the number of entries that are going in there. I know and as we sort of explained for our business, we're currently, on the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, up against some, I think, some significant introductory promotion and trial from last year. So for us, that would be the case. I can't speak to every single competitor, but I suspect that -- remember, this category is still relatively new. So there's been a lot of new introductions just in the last 2 years. I mean, I remember, thinking about it, I guess, as we turn the calendar year, this year, how much did it change, just even since we began with the launch of Tennessee Honey and then how we had sort of methodically been testing Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire and how rapidly the category kind of changed just from the test markets on Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire to the national launch. And so it's the nature of these categories that rapidly develop. We think we're smart to be in it in the way that we're in it. It's been very, very nice business success for us to date but also plays, just as we were referencing on the roles brands can play in portfolio, it plays a very strategic role in some ways defensively but also very offensively as it relates to giving people an opportunity to try whiskey in a way that they might not have before. The straight whiskey can be an acquired taste. And we find that this category, particularly for our brands, has been bringing in new consumers, and it generates an interest in our other whiskeys, most notably Jack Daniel's Black Label. And so it plays -- it can play a strategic role as well as being a bona fide business in some right."

But I think the category will continue to grow. But then within the category, you'll see trademarks and certain flavors be more volatile than you would say a normal bourbon or gin or vodka category, but just because the category is so dynamic right now. As it relates to Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, I think once we cycle through some of these comparisons, the impact won't be as large. But I still expect that it will -- I really do feel like that first year with particularly a brand that's participating in a category where the flavor is cinnamon, I really do expect that they're in the first sort of half of its national launch. There were absolutely -- just think of it this way. There were -- I know there were a bunch of Jack Daniel's drinkers who were straight whiskey drinkers and were not participants for say, in the cinnamon whiskey business, who tried it and just decided it wasn't for them, right? I mean, they prefer straight whiskey. I think there were also a fair amount of fireball, which was the -- obviously, the large volume, lower priced brand. They tried it and then maybe didn't see fit that they could afford it on every single occasion when they were consuming cinnamon-flavored whiskey. And so I think those things, they end up being what I call trial influences in those early days of a brand's existence in a marketplace that just don't get repeated. So until [ph] you work through some of that and then also begin the marketing and selling process to introduce the brands to new consumers, which -- the most encouraging thing we're seeing in our numbers which don't really reported a lot in the syndicated data is the -- are the results to the on premise, which kind of started okay, I felt. I thought it was going along pretty well. But with the expanded distribution and the momentum that sort of happened out in the marketplace, the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire brand is doing very, very well right now in the on premise, which -- it might surprise you because the off premise is not doing as well against that introductory launch. So in any event, the thing that gives us encouragement and tells us we can either continue to sell it and market it and promote it in a way that can make it the choice for more consumer locations. I mean, it just comes down to that and in knowing it full well that it's going to be a competitive environment in which you are attempting to do that."

I plan on discussing 2 topics on today's call: First, our first quarter results; and second, our latest outlook for 2017. And then Paul and I will address any questions you may have.
But before I jump into our first quarter results, I wanted to discuss the change we have made in how we present our reported and underlying net sales. In the past, we have presented our net sales, including excise taxes. Beginning with this, our first quarter and going forward, we will present our net sales excluding excise taxes, which is consistent with the presentation used by our competitors. We believe this is a small change in the presentation of net sales and will reflect one of several metrics we, as a management team, look at our business. We will continue to present excise taxes in our income statement, so the amount of information we disclose is really unchanged. It's simply the geography in our P&L and the comparability of the net sales metrics that we will discuss and [indiscernible] going forward.
So with that housekeeping item taken care of, let me now review our results for the first 3 months of fiscal 2017. Our underlying net sales using our new presentation of excluding excise taxes were 2% in the first quarter. As expected, this rate of growth is less than what we expect to deliver for the full year as the first quarter of last year was our strongest quarter, up 9% on a comparable basis, meaning excluding the divestiture of Southern Comfort in Tuaca, and up 11% over the 2 years. Remember that last year's first quarter was fueled by the U.S. launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire as well as a strong start to the year in both our developed markets outside the United States and our emerging markets. And in the first quarter of this year, we stopped distributing some agency brands as we continued to focus in our portfolio. This negatively impacted top line growth, but had little impact on the bottom line. 
The trends in our first quarter were similar to those of the second half of fiscal 2016. While our developed markets delivered strong growth, global results were way down by disappointing performance in the emerging markets. In the United States, we delivered solid gains with underlying net sales growth of 5% despite cycling against 11% comp in the same prior year period. Growth was led by the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands, including Tennessee Whiskey, Tennessee Honey and Gentleman Jack. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey grew mid-single digits as it entered its sixth year in the U.S. marketplace, while Tennessee Fire experienced double-digit declines. After accounting for last year's pipeline spill and activation [ph] behind Tennessee Fire, we estimate that the brand is performing better than those results would indicate, including growth in --strong growth in the on-premise.
Result in the United States were helped by our premium bourbon brands, including Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, as well as the summer launch of Cooper’s Craft as consumers continue to gravitate toward brands with authenticity. El Jimador and Herradura also continued to growth trajectory with both brands registering double-digit growth in the quarter. In addition, Korbel champagne and Sonoma-Cutrer grew aggregate underlying net sales by 10% in the United States.
Our developed markets outside of the United States also delivered a 5% increase in underlying net sales against last year's first quarter growth of 9%. This growth was broad-based with every developed markets in our top 20 markets growing in the quarter, including the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany, Canada, Japan, Spain, New Zealand and Italy. Our teams are doing a great job at growing our value share in these major markets, and they continue to see a long runway ahead.
Let me now move to our emerging markets where we were disappointed with the results in the quarter. Our business in the emerging markets continued to slow, resulting in a 5% decline in underlying net sales compared to an 8% growth in the same prior year period. Our 2 largest emerging markets, Mexico and Poland, continued to expand in the first quarter, delivering solid rates of growth, while several other emerging markets were down double digits for the quarter. This included declines in Turkey and Brazil, 2 significant contributors to our growth over the last few years. Other soft markets in the emerging world included Russia, China, Thailand, Ukraine and emerging Africa, but we believe some of this softness was timing related.  We believe the majority of the slowdown in emerging markets have been driven by factors outside of our control, including political instability, challenging economic backdrop and significant foreign exchange volatility, and we are carefully monitoring the trends in our emerging markets. 
Travel retail underlying net sales increased 12% in the quarter, driven by easy comparisons against the prior year period where net sales declined 15%. We are hopeful that the business has stabilized and the distribution gains will help us to begin to grow again from the lower levels, but we aren't expecting a meaningful growth contribution from this channel for the year. 
Regarding barrel sales, I mentioned in our last call that we expected moderating prices for our used barrels as global demand have softened significantly over the last 12 months, reflecting weaker demand from blended Scotch industry buyers. This, combined with some lumpiness in order timing, drove a large reduction in barrel revenue in our first quarter.
Moving now to a reconciliation of reported to underlying growth. Reported net sales declined 5%. Reported results were pulled down by 2 points due to a strengthening U.S. dollar as well as a 2-point reduction in distributor inventory, which relates largely destocking in Russia following some inventory build there in the fourth quarter of 2016. The absence of Southern Comfort and Tuaca following last year's sale of these brands resulted in an additional 3-point hit to reported sales. Excluding these effects, underlying net sales grew 2%. 
Sales growth was split evenly between volume and price/mix and resulted in a 2% increase in underlying gross profit, as underlying gross margin were flattish. Reported gross margins were hit by a combined effect of last year's divestiture and adverse foreign exchange. 
Underlying A&P in the quarter declined 1% due in part to comparisons of last year's launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire in the United States. underlying SG&A declined 2% as we remained focused on controlling costs on leveraging prior route-to-market investments.
In the aggregate, underlying operating income grew 6%. On a reported basis, operating income declined 6% and earnings per share decreased 2% to a split-adjusted $0.36. 
This leads me to my second topic, our outlook for fiscal 2017.  Our results in the first quarter was a tale of 2 cities with the growth in the developed markets offset by disappointing performance in the emerging markets. Our developed markets business today represents over 80% of total revenues and has been sustainably growing underlying net sales by mid-single-digit rate of growth for several years. As you know, the first quarter is seasonally smallest of the year and can be disproportionately impacted by timing issues such as a barrel revenues, as they were this quarter, volatility in emerging markets such as Turkey's coup attempt and terror attacks, not to mention foreign exchange swings. But net-net, we delivered 11% underlying net sales growth on a 2-year stack, and we believe we remain on track to deliver 4% to 6% underlying net sales growth in fiscal 2017.
Takeaway trends in our non-U.S. developed markets remains strong, including high single-digit growth in Western Europe. In the United States, takeaway trends remain solid and the Jack Daniel's 150 birthday execution is well underway, which, when combined with incremental media and investments and the commemorative disc, should drive a moderate acceleration in the United States. And while we are carefully monitoring the challenging off-premise transfer Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire in the United States, we are encouraged to see Tennessee Honey growing again as we move fast last year's new flavored whiskey launches.
On the margin front, we expect cost increases to increase slightly more and offset the improvement to our price mix in the year, but SG&A cost-containment effort should allow us to deliver solid leverage to the operating income line in the year, resulting in 7% to 9% in underlying operating income. 
After accounting for our recent 2-for-1 stock split, we still anticipate earnings per share of $1.71 to $1.81, including a $0.03 headwind from adverse foreign exchange. Full year tax rate is expected to be between 29% and 30%. And as a reminder, a 10% move in the dollar in either direction would impact EPS over the balance of the year by approximately $0.05.
In summary, we continue to deliver solid rates of underlying growth year after year. This growth is being led by the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands as well as our other premium Bourbon and tequila brands. We have and will continue to take a measure approach to innovation that allows us to maximize our brand equity over the long term.
In addition to delivering solid underlying rates of growth today, we are continuing to invest in our long-term business prospects such as the build-out of Slane Irish whiskey facility, which is on track to launch in spring, as well as the integration of BenRiach.
In the quarter, we issued our first non-U.S. tranches of debt at very favorable rates, thanks to our balance sheet strength and track record of growth. We also returned over $0.25 billion in cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and ongoing share repurchase program, which in fact allow to invest in ourselves. We believe that our success at balancing the short-term and long-term is a major reason we have been able to deliver leading TSRs over long periods of time, and we are focused on continuing that legacy for all of our stakeholders.
So with that, unless Paul has any comments, we'll turn it over to the operator. You okay?"

So while we were down for the quarter as we noted, we were down 5%, and it was all a little bit more than we expected. should be noted that we had very tough comps versus last year",482,"Certainly. I'll take -- let me -- if we just talk about emerging markets . So while we were down for the quarter as we noted, we were down 5%, and it was all a little bit more than we expected. should be noted that we had very tough comps versus last year. And I'd like to step back and remind everybody of how much emerging markets makes up our total business. So it's around 20% of our total revenues. And so to really understand it, there's a lots of moving parts with it, and you have to peel back the onion, so to speak, to understand it. As I said in my script, our 2 largest markets are Poland and Mexico. They represent well in excess of 40% of our emerging markets, and they're growing quite nicely at 8% and 17%, respectively, and -- we expect them to continue to grow so we do not expect them to be a drag on our results. Then we talked about our 2 of our larger contributors of growth over the past couple of years, being Brazil and Turkey, being a drag on the quarter. And they very much were a drag on the quarter. And that's not surprising given the political instability, the economic woes, the terrorism, the huge excise tax increases in both countries, but primarily in Brazil last year. And so these really did have a significant drag on our results. We have other parts of emerging markets that are continuing to grow. And then we have some emerging markets that have what I would call, I think they are stabilizing. They're not necessarily getting better. And so as we looked on to the rest of the year, I think we don't expect, as you said and you're right, it's one of the key drivers, not the most important, but one of the key drivers to get to our 4 year [ph] forecast is that we won't have as big of a drag as we did in the quarter. You mentioned the timing issue. And you're right, the timing is -- was an issue. I would say it was about 1 point of timing issues. And I would say the rest of it was that we also expect significantly easier comps as we go throughout the year, particularly if you look at the last half of the year and most notably, the fourth quarter of the year were emerging markets were down. And that's where you'll start also see some of the things that we're talking about where I believe we could hit a bottom, if you will, so to speak in some of these markets that have been down so low. Russia would be an example of that where I think we were close to getting to the bottom on that. So I hope I've answered all your questions there."

I think going back to much of the interest in this category literally over the last as we received interest in questions about it, I mean, I feel like we're pretty much sticking to our plan as it relates to knowing first that recycling last year's launch, which of course had pipeline in it but a lot of investment that of course generated quite a bit of trial. And with any of these pent-up demand launches we've had over the years with the Jack Daniel's, we experienced there's particularly with premier prices like Jack Daniel's is, but there are triers who sometimes don't convert that to full monthly usage. so I suspect we're going against some of that. So as I think you inferred the on-premise is doing much, much better. It didn't ramp up as rapidly. So of course, it doesn't have the pipeline build the off-premise channel does. And I think importantly as we said is that versus introducing an additional flavored whiskey from Jack Daniel's or 2 or some of our competition has done, our main focus was on geographic expansion, so trying to take out in a thoughtful way into other countries. And of course, combination of the on-premise and the 2 markets we've introduced in this fiscal year outside the United States is having a nice and positive offsetting factor to that pipeline -- that we're working against in the United States.

So if you look at our full year, our guidance is unchanged. And what we need, what we are looking at as -- and the confidence we have and achieving that for the full year versus where we are today is, we do expect to continue to have leverage operating expense leverage via SG&A. You'll recall last year, we had very low growth levels of SG&A. We'll expect some more continued low growth this year, too. That's 2% underlying last year. And so we still expect that to happen. You're right, on an underlying basis, we had very small -- I guess, not -- we didn't have gross margin help, if you will, on an underlying basis. [indiscernible] we expect for the year, give or take a little bit. So no help there is really coming from operating expenses, particularly SG&A. But let's talk more about what's going to drive this. It's really your top line growth. And we talked about emerging markets and why we feel confident that the emerging markets will improve from both a comp perspective and a timing perspective. But also as we look out, we won't have the drag on our results from our first quarter. Fire in the U.S. launched last year. That drove [indiscernible] 12% [ph] this year in other words [ph] the pipeline. And we continue to expand internationally, so we're going to continue to get benefits there. And then the Jack Daniel's 150 activation is just underway. And so we talked to -- Paul talked a lot about this in our shareholders meeting in July as well as you've introduced this in June during our call. And so there's a lot of activation really going on now. And when we think about the United States, we are actually increasing our media spend as well. And you so you'll start to see that coming through in the second, third quarter. we've got a lot of incremental lift [ph] coming through to. And our whole sales force and trade partners are all focused on that. so we'll see some modest improvement, as I said, in Jack Daniel's as well. So those things combined give us that confidence. If you look at it advertising, it's probably worthwhile to step back and think about advertising a bit. What we said was we expected advertising to grow in line with our full year forecast top line. I think at this point, we would still say that. What was happening in the quarter, there were some comparability issues. I mentioned one of them of being that we had the launch of the Fire last year. And in fact in the U.S., we had a lot of promotional activities and so forth that we were doing. We had the absence of that level. We're still of course, we're advertising behind it this year, but not at the levels that we were doing last year. There's some timing things going on, too. And then I think it's also worthwhile to just pull out Southern Comfort and take back and look at what kind of investments we've actually been doing behind our business over the last couple of years. And so if you look at the F '15 and F '16 combined pulling out Southern Comfort, on a 2-year stack basis, it's up 13%. First quarter of last year, just to illustrate the comp in advertisement last year that had Tennessee Fire in it, it was up 6%. we also have all that going on. So I hope I've given you some color. I know I said a whole lot in there. So I'll stop and see if Paul wants to add that anything, or you can ask us further the clarifying questions."

Just a background because we've been doing this, we've been making our own barrels for a number of years. And what we do, as you know, is each Bourbon and Jack Daniel's whiskey age. When we get finished with those barrels, we sell them. And the market generally for the sale of these barrels have been the Scotch industry. So if you look at it over a long period of time, [indiscernible] years, it's a very cyclical business. So we can see when the production and sales of Scotch go up and down. So it impacts the sale of barrels. It impacts the supply and demand and it impacts pricing. And so as you know, there's been some softening in demand of Splenda [ph] Scotch. we started seeing some pricing pressures. And we noticed to that and we said that in our fourth quarter conference call. What that did is in the first quarter, we had a couple of things happen. We saw those pricing pressure. So each barrel we were selling on the outside market, once we've got [indiscernible] used barrels, we're making less on it than we were a year ago. We also had some lumpiness, as I was alluding to, to orders which would have been one of our surprises in the quarter, if you will. But it's going to abate over the course of the year, so that's not gone. [ph] That's a little background on how it flows through our P&L. It's simply we got less revenues from those sales of barrels this year than regard last year it comes through our revenue line and hits you all the way through your P&L. just basically revenue. very high-margin business, and so there's no brand expense, if you will. There's some people that sell it, but it's largely drops to the bottom line whatever you have in your revenues all the way to operating income."

This morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. And you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements, whether due to new information, future events or otherwise. 
This morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The release can be found at our website under the section titled Investor Relations. In the press release, we have listed a number of the risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K, Form 8-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
During this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures and the reasons management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operations are contained in the press release. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jane for her prepared remarks."

And then Paul and I will address any questions you may",1701,"Thanks, Jay. And thank you for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. I plan on discussing 2 topics on today's call: first, our first quarter results; and second, our latest outlook for 2017. And then Paul and I will address any questions you may have.
But before I jump into our first quarter results, I wanted to discuss the change we have made in how we present our reported and underlying net sales. In the past, we have presented our net sales, including excise taxes. Beginning with this, our first quarter, and going forward, we will present our net sales excluding excise taxes, which is consistent with the presentation used by our competitors. We believe this is a small change in the presentation of net sales and will reflect one of several metrics we, as a management team, look at our business. We will continue to present excise taxes in our income statement, so the amount of information we disclose is really unchanged. It's simply the geography in our P&L and the comparability of the net sales metrics that we will discuss and analyze going forward.
So with that housekeeping item taken care of, let me now review our results for the first 3 months of fiscal 2017. Our underlying net sales, using our new presentation of excluding excise taxes, grew 2% in the first quarter. As expected, this rate of growth is less than what we expect to deliver for the full year as the first quarter of last year was our strongest quarter, up 9% on a comparable basis, meaning, excluding the divestiture of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, and up 11% over the 2 years. Remember that last year's first quarter was fueled by the U.S. launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire as well as a strong start to the year in both our developed markets outside the United States and our emerging markets. And in the first quarter of this year, we stopped distributing some agency brands as we continued to focus on our portfolio. This negatively impacted top line growth, but had little impact on the bottom line. 
The trends in our first quarter were similar to those of the second half of fiscal 2016. While our developed markets delivered strong growth, global results were weighed down by disappointing performance in the emerging markets. In the United States, we delivered solid gains with underlying net sales growth of 5% despite cycling against 11% comp in the same prior year period. Growth was led by the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands, including Tennessee Whiskey, Tennessee Honey and Gentleman Jack. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey grew mid-single digits as it entered its sixth year in the U.S. marketplace, while Tennessee Fire experienced double-digit declines. After accounting for last year's pipeline fill and activation behind Tennessee Fire, we estimate that the brand is performing better than those what results would indicate, including growth in -- strong growth in the on-premise.
Result in the United States were helped by our premium bourbon brands, including Woodford Reserve and Old Forester as well as the summer launch of Coopers' Craft as consumers continue to gravitate toward brands with heritage and authenticity. el Jimador and Herradura also continued their growth trajectory, with both brands registering double-digit growth in the quarter. In addition, Korbel champagne and Sonoma-Cutrer grew aggregate underlying net sales by 10% in the United States.
Our developed markets outside of the United States also delivered a 5% increase in underlying net sales against last year's first quarter growth of 9%. This growth was broad based, with every developed markets in our top 20 markets growing in the quarter, including the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany, Canada, Japan, Spain, New Zealand and Italy. Our teams are doing a great job at growing our value share in these major markets, and they continue to see a long runway ahead.
Let me now move to our emerging markets, where we were disappointed with the results in the quarter. Our business in the emerging markets continued to slow, resulting in a 5% decline in underlying net sales compared to an 8% growth in the same prior year period. Our 2 largest emerging markets, Mexico and Poland, continued to expand in the first quarter, delivering solid rates of growth, while several other emerging markets were down double digits for the quarter. This included declines in Turkey and Brazil, 2 significant contributors to our growth over the last few years. Other soft markets in the emerging world included Russia, China, Thailand, Ukraine and Emerging Africa, but we believe some of this softness was timing related. We believe the majority of the slowdown in the emerging markets has been driven by factors outside of our control, including political instability, challenging economic backdrops and significant foreign exchange volatility, and we are carefully monitoring the trends in our emerging markets. 
Travel retail underlying net sales increased 12% in the quarter, driven by easy comparisons against the prior year period, where net sales declined 15%. We are hopeful that the business has stabilized and the distribution gains will help us to begin to grow again from the lower levels. So we aren't expecting a meaningful growth contribution from this channel for the year. 
Regarding barrel sales, I mentioned on our last call that we expected moderating prices for our used barrels as global demand has softened significantly over the last 12 months, reflecting weaker demand from blended Scotch industry buyers. This, combined with some lumpiness in order timing, drove a large reduction in barrel revenue in our first quarter.
Moving now to a reconciliation of reported to underlying growth. Reported net sales declined 5%. Reported results were pulled down by 2 points due to a strengthening U.S. dollar as well as a 2-point reduction in distributor inventories, which relates largely to destocking in Russia following some inventory build there in the fourth quarter of 2016. The absence of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, following last year's sale of these brands, resulted in an additional 3-point hit to reported sales. Excluding these effects, underlying net sales grew 2%. 
Sales growth was split evenly between volume and price/mix and resulted in a 2% increase in underlying gross profit, as underlying gross margins were flattish. Reported gross margins were hit by a combined effect of last year's divestiture and adverse foreign exchange. 
Underlying A&P spend in the quarter declined 1% due, in part, to the comparison of last year's launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire in the United States. And underlying SG&A declined 2% as we remained focused on controlling costs and leveraging prior route-to-market investments.
In the aggregate, underlying operating income grew 6%. On a reported basis, operating income declined 6% and earnings per share decreased 2% to a split-adjusted $0.36. 
This leads me to my second topic, our outlook for fiscal 2017. Our results in the first quarter was a tale of two cities, with growth in the developed markets offset by disappointing performance in the emerging markets. Our developed markets business today represents over 80% of total revenues and has been sustainably growing underlying net sales by a mid-single-digit rate of growth for several years. As you know, the first quarter is our seasonally smallest of the year and can be disproportionately impacted by timing issues, such as: barrel revenues, as they were this quarter; volatility in emerging markets, such as Turkey's unforeseen coup attempt and terror attacks, not to mention foreign exchange swings. But net-net, we delivered 11% underlying net sales growth on a 2-year stack, and we believe we remain on track to deliver 4% to 6% underlying net sales growth in fiscal 2017.
Takeaway trends in our non-U.S. developed markets remain strong, including high single-digit growth in Western Europe. In the United States, takeaway trends remain solid and the Jack Daniel's 150th birthday execution is well under way, which, when combined with incremental media investments and the commemorative gift, should drive a moderate acceleration in the United States. And while we are carefully monitoring the challenging off-premise trends for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire in the United States, we are encouraged to see Tennessee Honey growing again as we move past last year's new flavored whiskey launches.
On the margin front, we expect cost increases to slightly increase more and offset the improvement to our price/mix in the year, but SG&A cost-containment efforts should allow us to deliver solid leverage to the operating income line in the year, resulting in 7% to 9% in underlying operating income. 
After accounting for our recent 2-for-1 stock split, we still anticipate earnings per share of $1.71 to $1.81, including a $0.03 headwind from adverse foreign exchange. Full year tax rate is expected to be between 29% and 30%. And as a reminder, a 10% move in the dollar in either direction would impact EPS over the balance of the year by approximately $0.05.
In summary, we continue to deliver solid rates of underlying growth year-after-year. This growth is being led by the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands as well as our other premium bourbon and tequila brands. We have and will continue to take a measured approach to innovation that allows us to maximize our brand equity over the long term.
In addition to delivering solid underlying rates of growth today, we are continuing to invest in our long-term business prospects, such as the build-out of the Slane Irish whiskey distillery, which is on track to launch in spring as well as the integration of BenRiach.
In the quarter, we issued our first non-U.S. tranches of debt at very favorable rates, thanks to our balance sheet strength and track record of growth. We also returned over $0.25 billion in cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and ongoing share repurchase program which, in effect, allows us to invest in ourselves. We believe that our success at balancing the short term and long term is a major reason we have been able to deliver leading TSRs over long periods of time, and we are focused on continuing that legacy for all of our stakeholders.
So with that, unless Paul has any comments, we'll turn it over to the operator. You okay?"

So while we were down for the quarter, as we noted, we were down 5%, and it was a little bit more than we expected, it should be noted that we had very tough comps versus last year. And I'd like to step back and remind everybody how much emerging markets makes up our total business. So it's around 20% of our total revenues. And so to really understand it, there's a lot of moving parts within it, and you got to peel back the onion, so to speak, to understand it. As I said in my script, our 2 largest markets are Poland and Mexico. They represent well in excess of 40% of our emerging markets, and they're growing quite nicely at 8% and 17%, respectively. And that -- and we expect them to continue to grow, so we do not expect them to be a drag on our results. Then we talked about our -- 2 of our larger contributors of growth over the past couple of years, being Brazil and Turkey, and being a drag on the quarter. And they very much were a drag on the quarter. And that's not surprising, given the political instability, the economic woes, the terrorism, the huge excise tax increases in both countries, but primarily in Brazil last year. And so these really did have a significant drag on our results. We have other parts of emerging markets that are continuing to grow. And then we have some emerging markets that have, what I would call, I think they are stabilizing. They're not necessarily getting better. And so as we look on to the rest of the year, I think we don't expect, as you said and you're right, it's one of our key drivers, not the most important, but one of our key drivers to get to our full year forecast is that we won't have as big of a drag as we did in the quarter. You mentioned the timing issue. And you're right, timing is -- was an issue. I would say it was about 1 point of timing issues. And I would say the rest of it was that we also expect significantly easier comps as we go throughout the year, particularly if you look at the last half of the year. And most notably, the fourth quarter of the year, where emerging markets were down. And that's where you'll start to also see some of the things that we're talking about, where I believe we could -- a bottom, if you will, so to speak, in some of these markets that have been down for a while. Russia would be an example of that, where I think we're close to getting to the bottom on that. So I hope I've answered all your questions there."

I think going back to much of the interest in this category literally over the last -- as we received interesting questions about it, I mean, I feel like we're pretty much sticking to our plan as it relates to knowing first that we're cycling last year's launch, which of course had pipeline in it but a lot of investment, that of course generated quite a bit of trial. And with any of these pent-up demand launches we've had over the years with Jack Daniel's, we experienced that there's -- particularly at premium prices, like Jack Daniel's is, that there are triers who sometimes don't convert that to full monthly usage. So I suspect we're going against some of that. As I think you inferred, the on-premise is doing much, much better. It didn't ramp up as rapidly. So it, of course, doesn't have the pipeline build that the off-premise channel does. And then I think very importantly, as we said, is that versus introducing an additional flavored whiskey from Jack Daniel's or 2 or some of our competition has done, our main focus was on geographic expansion, so trying to take out in a thoughtful way into other countries. And of course, the combination of the on-premise and the few markets we've introduced this fiscal year outside the United States is having a nice and positive offsetting factor to that pipeline that we're working against in the United States.

And as I think you'd know this, that like for example, the drink price difference in the on-premise is much less than the bottle price in the off-premise for Fire and its main competitors. And so we think that might be one of the contributing factors, that the hurdle for an individual drink price in the on-premise isn't as great as the shelf price difference in the off-premise.

So if you look at our full year, our guidance is unchanged. And what we need, what we're looking at, as we -- and the confidence we have in achieving that for the full year versus where we are today, is we do expect to continue to have leverage, operating expense leverage via SG&A. You will recall last year, we had very low growth levels of SG&A. We expect some more continued low growth this year, too. It was 2% underlying last year. And so we still expect that to happen. You're right, on an underlying basis, we had very small -- I guess, not -- we didn't have a gross margin help, if you will, on an underlying basis. It's about what we expect for the year, give or take a little bit. So no help there. It's really coming from operating expenses, particularly SG&A. But let's talk more about what's going to drive this. It's really your top line growth. And we already talked about the emerging markets and why we feel confident that the emerging markets will improve from both a comp perspective and a timing perspective. But also, as we look out, we won't have the drag on our results from our first quarter Fire and the U.S. launch last year, that drove us down this year, in other words, the pipeline. And we continue to expand internationally, so we're going to continue to get benefits there. And then the Jack Daniel's 150 activation is just under way. And so we've talked -- Paul talked a lot about this in our Shareholders' Meeting in July as well as -- he's introduced this in June during our call. And so there's a lot of activation really going on now. And then when I think about the United States, we are actually increasing our media spend as well. And so you'll start to see that coming through in the second and third quarter. We've got a lot of incremental gift coming through to -- and our whole sales force and our trade partners are all focused on that. So we'll see some modest improvement, as I said, in Jack Daniel's as well. So those things combined give us that confidence. If you look at advertising, it's probably worthwhile to step back and think about advertising a bit. What we said was we expected advertising to grow in line with our full year forecast top line. I think at this point, we would still say that. What was happening in the quarter, there were some comparability issues. I mentioned one of them being that we had the launch of Fire last year. In effect, in the U.S., we had a lot of promotional activities and so forth that we were doing. We had the absence of that level. We're still -- of course, we're advertising behind it this year, but not at the levels we were doing last year. There are some timing things going on, too. And then I think it's also worthwhile to just pull out Southern Comfort and take back and look at what kind of investments we've actually been doing behind our business over the last couple of years. And so if you look at the F '15 and F '16 combined, pulling out Southern Comfort, on a 2-year stack basis, it's up 13%. First quarter of last year, just to illustrate, the comp in advertisement last year that had the Tennessee Fire in it, it was up 6%. So we also have all that going on. So I hope I've given you some color. I know I said a whole lot in there. So I'll stop and see if Paul wants to add anything, or you can ask us further the clarifying questions."

Of course, we're fully integrated, if you will, through the supply chain, so we make everything from start to finish. Essentially, we don't grow our corn, but we're making our barrels all the way to distilling them, and then out the door. So remember that we're one of the largest barrel-making operations in the world. And so just to give a little background, I think it's worthwhile to think about the background of just barrel sales in general, and then we'll talk about how it flows through our P&L. Just as background. So we've been doing this -- we've been making our own barrels for a number of years. And what we do, as you know, is each bourbon and Jack Daniel's whiskey will -- for a new barrel to put the whiskey in to age. When we get finished with those barrels, we sell them. And the market, generally, for the sale of these barrels, has been the Scotch industry. So if you look at it over a long period of time, look, let's say, 50 years, it's a very cyclical business. So we can see when the production and sales of Scotch go up and down. So it impacts the sale of barrels. It impacts supply and demand and it impacts pricing. And so as you know, there's been some softening in the demand of Splenda-Scotch. So we started seeing some pricing pressures, and we noticed that and we said that in our -- at our fourth quarter conference call. What that did is, in the first quarter, we had a couple of things happen. We saw those pricing pressures. So each barrel that we were selling on the outside market, once liquid got dumped, those used barrel, we were making less on it than we were a year ago. We also had some lumpiness, as I was alluding to, to orders which would have been one of our surprises in the quarter, if you will. But it's going to abate over the course of the year, because it's not gone. That's a little background, but how it flows through our P&L, is it's simply we got less revenues from those sales of barrels this year than we got last year. It comes through our revenue line and it hits you all the way through your P&L. It's just basically revenue. It's a very high-margin business, and so there's no brand expense, if you will. There's some people that sell it, but it largely drops to the bottom line, whatever you have in your revenues, all the way to operating income."

Not only have we been emptying more barrels to meet the bourbon supply -- or demand out there, there have been other bourbon barrels out there. So that influences the supply of those against the Scotch demand. So some of that is hitting us in this first quarter. And as Jane said, it is a nice margin business."

You heard Jane emphasize that Poland's one of our top 2 emerging markets.

And particularly at the prices where, even though they're what we would consider to be premium for the vodka category, there's a lot of competition in them. So -- and I -- like I've mentioned early on, I think it's an encouraging sign that we've had a good quarter in Poland, but it's been a tough couple of years.

I plan on discussing 2 topics on today's call: first, our first quarter results; and second, our latest outlook for 2017. And then Paul and I will address any questions you may have.
But before I jump into our first quarter results, I wanted to discuss a change we have made in how we present our reported and underlying net sales. In the past, we have presented our net sales, including excise taxes. Beginning with this, our first quarter, and going forward, we will present our net sales excluding excise taxes, which is consistent with the presentation used by our competitors. We believe this is a small change in the presentation of net sales and reflects one of several metrics we, as a management team, look at our business. We will continue to present excise taxes in our income statement, so the amount of information we disclose is really unchanged. It's simply the geography in our P&L and the comparability of the net sales metrics that we will discuss and analyze going forward.
So with that housekeeping item taken care of, let me now review our results for the first 3 months of fiscal 2017. Our underlying net sales, using our new presentation of excluding excise taxes, grew 2% in the first quarter. As expected, this rate of growth is less than what we expect to deliver for the full year as the first quarter of last year was our strongest quarter, up 9% on a comparable basis, meaning, excluding the divestiture of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, and up 11% over the 2 years. Remember that last year's first quarter was fueled by the U.S. launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire as well as a strong start to the year in both our developed markets outside the United States and our emerging markets. And in the first quarter of this year, we stopped distributing some agency brands as we continued to focus on our portfolio. This negatively impacted top line growth, but has little impact on the bottom line. 
The trends in our first quarter were similar to those of the second half of fiscal 2016. While our developed markets delivered strong growth, global results were weighed down by disappointing performance in the emerging markets. In the United States, we delivered solid gains with underlying net sales growth of 5% despite cycling against 11% comp in the same prior-year period. Growth was led by the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands, including Tennessee Whiskey, Tennessee Honey and Gentleman Jack. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey grew mid-single digits as it entered its sixth year in the U.S. marketplace, while Tennessee Fire experienced double-digit declines. After accounting for last year's pipeline fill and activation behind Tennessee Fire, we estimate that the brand is performing better than those results would indicate, including growth in -- strong growth in the on-premise.
Result in the United States were helped by our premium bourbon brands, including Woodford Reserve and Old Forester as well as the summer launch of Coopers' Craft as consumers continue to gravitate toward brands with heritage and authenticity. el Jimador and Herradura also continued to have growth trajectory, with both brands registering double-digit growth in the quarter. In addition, Korbel champagne and Sonoma-Cutrer grew aggregate underlying net sales by 10% in the United States.
Our developed markets outside of the United States also delivered a 5% increase in underlying net sales against last year's first quarter growth of 9%. This growth was broad based, with every developed markets in our top 20 markets growing in the quarter, including the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany, Canada, Japan, Spain, New Zealand and Italy. Our teams are doing a great job at growing our value share in these major markets, and they continue to see a long runway ahead.
Let me now move to our emerging markets, where we were disappointed with the results in the quarter. Our business in the emerging markets continued to slow, resulting in a 5% decline in underlying net sales compared to an 8% growth in the same prior year period. Our 2 largest emerging markets, Mexico and Poland, continued to expand in the first quarter, delivering solid rates of growth, while several other emerging markets were down double digits for the quarter. This included declines in Turkey and Brazil, 2 significant contributors to our growth over the last few years. Other soft markets in the emerging world included Russia, China, Thailand, Ukraine and Emerging Africa, but we believe some of this softness was timing related. We believe the majority of the slowdown in the emerging markets has been driven by factors outside of our control, including political instability, challenging economic backdrops and significant foreign exchange volatility, and we are carefully monitoring the trends in our emerging markets. 
Travel retail underlying net sales increased 12% in the quarter, driven by easy comparisons against the prior year period, where net sales declined 15%. We are hopeful that the business has stabilized and the distribution gains will help us to begin to grow again from the lower levels. So we aren't expecting a meaningful growth contribution from this channel for the year. 
Regarding barrel sales, I mentioned on our last call that we expected moderating prices for our used barrels as global demand has softened significantly over the last 12 months, reflecting weaker demand from blended Scotch industry buyers. This, combined with some lumpiness in order timing, drove a large reduction in barrel revenue in our first quarter.
Moving now to a reconciliation of reported to underlying growth. Reported net sales declined 5%. Reported results were pulled down by 2 points due to a strengthening U.S. dollar as well as a 2-point reduction in distributor inventories, which relates largely to destocking in Russia following some inventory build there in the fourth quarter of 2016. The absence of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, following last year's sale of these brands, resulted in an additional 3-point hit to reported sales. Excluding these effects, underlying net sales grew 2%. 
Sales growth was split evenly between volume and price/mix and resulted in a 2% increase in underlying gross profit, as underlying gross margins were flattish. Reported gross margins were hit by combined effects of last year's divestiture and adverse foreign exchange. 
Underlying A&P spend in the quarter declined 1% due, in part, to the comparison of last year's launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire in the United States. And underlying SG&A declined 2% as we remained focused on controlling costs and leveraging prior route-to-market investments.
In the aggregate, underlying operating income grew 6%. On a reported basis, operating income declined 6% and earnings per share decreased 2% to a split-adjusted $0.36. 
This leads me to my second topic, our outlook for fiscal 2017. Our results in the first quarter was a tale of two cities, with growth in the developed markets offset by disappointing performance in the emerging markets. Our developed markets business today represents over 80% of total revenues and has been sustainably growing underlying net sales by a mid-single-digit rate of growth for several years. As you know, the first quarter is our seasonally smallest of the year and can be disproportionately impacted by timing issues, such as: barrel revenues, as they were this quarter; volatility in emerging markets, such as Turkey's unforeseen coup attempt and terror attacks, not to mention foreign exchange swings. But net-net, we delivered 11% underlying net sales growth on a 2-year stack, and we believe we remain on track to deliver 4% to 6% underlying net sales growth in fiscal 2017.
Takeaway trends in our non-U.S. developed markets remain strong, including high single-digit growth in Western Europe. In the United States, takeaway trends remain solid and the Jack Daniel's 150th birthday execution is well under way, which, when combined with incremental media investments and a commemorative gift, should drive a moderate acceleration in the United States. And while we are carefully monitoring the challenging off-premise trends for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire in the United States, we are encouraged to see Tennessee Honey growing again as we move past last year's new flavored whiskey launches.
On the margin front, we expect cost increases to slightly increase more and offset the improvement to our price/mix in the year, but SG&A cost-containment efforts should allow us to deliver solid leverage to the operating income line in the year, resulting in 7% to 9% in underlying operating income. 
After accounting for our recent 2-for-1 stock split, we still anticipate earnings per share of $1.71 to $1.81, including a $0.03 headwind from adverse foreign exchange. Full year tax rate is expected to be between 29% and 30%. And as a reminder, a 10% move in the dollar in either direction would impact EPS over the balance of the year by approximately $0.05.
In summary, we continue to deliver solid rates of underlying growth year-after-year. This growth is being led by the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands as well as our other premium bourbon and tequila brands. We have and will continue to take a measured approach to innovation that allows us to maximize our brand equity over the long term.
In addition to delivering solid underlying rates of growth today, we are continuing to invest in our long-term business prospects, such as the build-out of the Slane Irish whiskey distillery, which is on track to launch in spring as well as the integration of BenRiach.
In the quarter, we issued our first non-U.S. tranches of debt at very favorable rates, thanks to our balance sheet strength and track record of growth. We also returned over $0.25 billion in cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and ongoing share repurchase program which, in effect, allows us to invest in ourselves. We believe that our success at balancing the short term and long term is a major reason we have been able to deliver leading TSRs over long periods of time, and we are focused on continuing that legacy for all of our stakeholders.
So with that, unless Paul has any comments, we'll turn it over to the operator. You okay?"

So while we were down for the quarter, as we noted, we were down 5%, and it was a little bit more than we expected, it should be noted that we had very tough comps versus last year. And I'd like to step back and remind everybody how much our emerging markets makes up of our total business. So it's around 20% of our total revenues. And so to really understand it, there's a lot of moving parts within it, and you got to peel back the onion, so to speak, to understand it. As I said in my script, our 2 largest markets are Poland and Mexico. They represent well in excess of 40% of our emerging markets, and they're growing quite nicely at 8% and 17%, respectively. And that -- and we expect them to continue to grow, so we do not expect them to be a drag on our results. Then we talked about our -- 2 of our larger contributors of growth over the past couple of years, being Brazil and Turkey, being a drag on the quarter. And they very much were a drag on the quarter. And that's not surprising, given the political instability, the economic woes, the terrorism, the huge excise tax increases in both countries, but primarily in Brazil last year. And so these really did have a significant drag on our results. We have other parts of emerging markets that are continuing to grow. And then we have some emerging markets that have what I would call, I think they are stabilizing. They're not necessarily getting better. And so as we look on to the rest of the year, I think we don't expect, as you said and you're right, it's one of our key drivers, not the most important, but one of our key drivers to get to our full year forecast is that we won't have as big of a drag as we did in the quarter. You mentioned the timing issue. And you're right, timing is -- was an issue. I would say it was about 1 point of timing issues. And I would say the rest of it was that we also expect significantly easier comps as we go throughout the year, particularly if you look at the last half of the year. And most notably, the fourth quarter of the year, where emerging markets were down. And that's where you'll start to also see some of the things that we're talking about, where I believe we could -- a bottom, if you will, so to speak, in some of these markets that have been down for a while. Russia would be an example of that, where I think we're close to getting to the bottom on that. So I hope I've answered all your questions there."

I think going back to much of the interest in this category literally over the last -- as we received interesting questions about it, I mean, I feel like we're pretty much sticking to our plan as it relates to knowing first that we're cycling last year's launch, which of course had pipeline in it but also a lot of investment, that of course generated quite a bit of trial. And with any of these pent-up demand launches we've had over the years with Jack Daniel's, we experienced that there's -- particularly at premium prices, like Jack Daniel's is, that there are triers who sometimes don't convert that to full monthly usage. So I suspect we're going against some of that. As I think you inferred, the on-premise is doing much, much better. It didn't ramp up as rapidly. So it, of course, doesn't have the pipeline build that the off-premise channel does. And then I think very importantly, as we said, is that versus introducing an additional flavored whiskey from Jack Daniel's or 2 or some of our competition has done, our main focus was on geographic expansion, so trying to take out in a thoughtful way into other countries. And of course, the combination of the on-premise and the few markets we've introduced this fiscal year outside the United States is having a nice and positive offsetting factor to that pipeline that we're working against in the United States.

I mean, oftentimes, one of the barriers for people converting to regular weekly or monthly usage is pricing. And as I think you'd know this, that like for example, the drink price difference in the on-premise is much less than the bottle price in the off-premise for Fire and its main competitors. And so we think that might be one of the contributing factors, that the hurdle for an individual drink price in the on-premise isn't as great as the shelf price difference in the off-premise. So I think our people are appropriately always dabbling with the right price-volume mix within our range in order to try to find the best way to create sales value."

So if you look at our full year, our guidance is unchanged. And what we need, what we're looking at, as we -- and the confidence we have in achieving that for the full year versus where we are today, is we do expect to continue to have leverage, operating expense leverage via SG&A. You will recall last year, we had very low growth levels of SG&A. We expect some more continued low growth this year, too. It was 2% underlying last year. And so we still expect that to happen. You're right, on an underlying basis, we had very small -- I guess, not -- we didn't have a gross margin help, if you will, on an underlying basis. It's about what we expect for the year, give or take a little bit. So no help there. It's really coming from operating expenses, particularly SG&A. But let's talk more about what's going to drive this. It's really your top line growth. And we already talked about the emerging markets and why we feel confident that the emerging markets will improve from both a comp perspective and a timing perspective. But also, as we look out, we won't have the drag on our results from our first quarter Fire and the U.S. launch last year that drove us down this year, in other words, the pipeline. And we continue to expand internationally, so we're going to continue to get benefits there. And then Jack Daniel's 150 activation is just under way. And so we've talked -- Paul talked a lot about this in our Shareholders' Meeting in July as well as -- he introduced this in June during our call. And so there's a lot of activation really going on now. And then when I think about the United States, we are actually increasing our media spend as well. And so you'll start to see that coming through in the second and third quarter. We've got a lot of incremental gift coming through to -- and our whole sales force and our trade partners are all focused on that. So we'll see some modest improvement, as I said, in Jack Daniel's as well. So those things combined give us that confidence. If you look at advertising, it's probably worthwhile to step back and think about advertising a bit. What we said was we expected advertising to grow in line with our full year forecast top line. I think at this point, we would still say that. What was happening in the quarter, there were some comparability issues. I mentioned one of them being that we had the launch of Fire last year. In effect, in the U.S., we had a lot of promotional activities and so forth that we were doing. We had the absence of that level. We're still -- of course, we're advertising behind it this year, but not at the levels we were doing last year. There are some timing things going on, too. And then I think it's also worthwhile to just pull out Southern Comfort and take back and look at what kind of investments we've actually been doing behind our business over the last couple of years. And so if you look at the F '15 and F '16 combined, pulling out Southern Comfort, on a 2-year stack basis, it's up 13%. First quarter of last year, just to illustrate, the comp in advertisement last year that had the Tennessee Fire in it, it was up 6%. So we also have all that going on. So I hope I've given you some color. I know I said a whole lot in there. So I'll stop and see if Paul wants to add anything, or you can ask us further clarifying questions."

Of course, we're fully integrated, if you will, through the supply chain, so we make everything from start to finish, essentially. We don't grow our own corn, but we're making our barrels all the way to distilling them, and then out the door. So remember that we're one of the largest barrel-making operations in the world. And so just to give a little background, I think it's worthwhile to think about the background of just barrel sales in general, and then we'll talk about how it flows through our P&L. Just the background. Because we've been doing this -- we've been making our own barrels for a number of years. And what we do, as you know, is each bourbon and Jack Daniel's whiskey require a new barrel to put the whiskey in to age. When we get finished with those barrels, we sell them. And the market, generally, for the sale of these barrels, has been the Scotch industry. So if you look at it over a long period of time, we'll just say 50 years, it's a very cyclical business. So we can see when the production and sales of Scotch go up and down. So it impacts the sale of barrels. It impacts supply and demand and it impacts pricing. And so as you know, there's been some softening in the demand of blended Scotch. So we started seeing some pricing pressures, and we noticed that and we said that in our -- at our fourth quarter conference call. What that did is, in the first quarter, we had a couple of things happen. We saw those pricing pressures. So each barrel that we were selling on the outside market, once liquid got dumped, those used barrel, we were making less on it than we were a year ago. We also had some lumpiness, as I was alluding to, to orders which would have been one of our surprises in the quarter, if you will. But it's going to abate over the course of the year, because it's not gone. That's a little background, but how it flows through our P&L is it's simply we got less revenues from those sales of barrels this year than we got last year. It comes through our revenue line and it hits you all the way through your P&L. It's just basically revenue. It's a very high-margin business, and so there's no brand expense, if you will. There's some people that sell it, but it largely drops to the bottom line, whatever you have in your revenues, all the way to operating income."

Not only have we been emptying more barrels to meet the bourbon supply -- or demand out there, there have been other bourbon barrels out there. So that influences the supply of those against the Scotch demand. So some of that is hitting us in this first quarter. And as Jane said, it is a nice margin business."

I plan on discussing 2 topics on today's call: first, our first quarter results; and second, our latest outlook for 2017. And then Paul and I will address any questions you may have.
But before I jump into our first quarter results, I wanted to discuss a change we have made in how we present our reported and underlying net sales. In the past, we have presented our net sales, including excise taxes. Beginning with this, our first quarter, and going forward, we will present our net sales excluding excise taxes, which is consistent with the presentation used by our competitors. We believe this is a small change in the presentation of net sales and reflects one of several metrics we, as a management team, look at our business. We will continue to present excise taxes in our income statement, so the amount of information we disclose is really unchanged. It's simply the geography in our P&L and the comparability of the net sales metrics that we will discuss and analyze going forward.
So with that housekeeping item taken care of, let me now review our results for the first 3 months of fiscal 2017. Our underlying net sales, using our new presentation of excluding excise taxes, grew 2% in the first quarter. As expected, this rate of growth is less than what we expect to deliver for the full year as the first quarter of last year was our strongest quarter, up 9% on a comparable basis, meaning, excluding the divestiture of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, and up 11% over the 2 years. Remember that last year's first quarter was fueled by the U.S. launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire as well as a strong start to the year in both our developed markets outside the United States and our emerging markets. And in the first quarter of this year, we stopped distributing some agency brands as we continued to focus on our portfolio. This negatively impacted top line growth, but has little impact on the bottom line. 
The trends in our first quarter were similar to those of the second half of fiscal 2016. While our developed markets delivered strong growth, global results were weighed down by disappointing performance in the emerging markets. In the United States, we delivered solid gains with underlying net sales growth of 5% despite cycling against 11% comp in the same prior-year period. Growth was led by the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands, including Tennessee Whiskey, Tennessee Honey and Gentleman Jack. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey grew mid-single digits as it entered its sixth year in the U.S. marketplace, while Tennessee Fire experienced double-digit declines. After accounting for last year's pipeline fill and activation behind Tennessee Fire, we estimate that the brand is performing better than those results would indicate, including growth in -- strong growth in the on-premise.
Result in the United States were helped by our premium bourbon brands, including Woodford Reserve and Old Forester as well as the summer launch of Coopers' Craft as consumers continue to gravitate toward brands with heritage and authenticity. el Jimador and Herradura also continued to have growth trajectory, with both brands registering double-digit growth in the quarter. In addition, Korbel champagne and Sonoma-Cutrer grew aggregate underlying net sales by 10% in the United States.
Our developed markets outside of the United States also delivered a 5% increase in underlying net sales against last year's first quarter growth of 9%. This growth was broad based, with every developed markets in our top 20 markets growing in the quarter, including the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany, Canada, Japan, Spain, New Zealand and Italy. Our teams are doing a great job at growing our value share in these major markets, and they continue to see a long runway ahead.
Let me now move to our emerging markets, where we were disappointed with the results in the quarter. Our business in the emerging markets continued to slow, resulting in a 5% decline in underlying net sales compared to an 8% growth in the same prior year period. Our 2 largest emerging markets, Mexico and Poland, continued to expand in the first quarter, delivering solid rates of growth, while several other emerging markets were down double digits for the quarter. This included declines in Turkey and Brazil, 2 significant contributors to our growth over the last few years. Other soft markets in the emerging world included Russia, China, Thailand, Ukraine and Emerging Africa, but we believe some of this softness was timing related. We believe the majority of the slowdown in the emerging markets has been driven by factors outside of our control, including political instability, challenging economic backdrops and significant foreign exchange volatility, and we are carefully monitoring the trends in our emerging markets. 
Travel retail underlying net sales increased 12% in the quarter, driven by easy comparisons against the prior year period, where net sales declined 15%. We are hopeful that the business has stabilized and the distribution gains will help us to begin to grow again from the lower levels. So we aren't expecting a meaningful growth contribution from this channel for the year. 
Regarding barrel sales, I mentioned on our last call that we expected moderating prices for our used barrels as global demand has softened significantly over the last 12 months, reflecting weaker demand from blended Scotch industry buyers. This, combined with some lumpiness in order timing, drove a large reduction in barrel revenue in our first quarter.
Moving now to a reconciliation of reported to underlying growth. Reported net sales declined 5%. Reported results were pulled down by 2 points due to a strengthening U.S. dollar as well as a 2-point reduction in distributor inventories, which relates largely to destocking in Russia following some inventory build there in the fourth quarter of 2016. The absence of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, following last year's sale of these brands, resulted in an additional 3-point hit to reported sales. Excluding these effects, underlying net sales grew 2%. 
Sales growth was split evenly between volume and price/mix and resulted in a 2% increase in underlying gross profit, as underlying gross margins were flattish. Reported gross margins were hit by combined effects of last year's divestiture and adverse foreign exchange. 
Underlying A&P spend in the quarter declined 1% due, in part, to the comparison of last year's launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire in the United States. And underlying SG&A declined 2% as we remained focused on controlling costs and leveraging prior route-to-market investments.
In the aggregate, underlying operating income grew 6%. On a reported basis, operating income declined 6% and earnings per share decreased 2% to a split-adjusted $0.36. 
This leads me to my second topic, our outlook for fiscal 2017. Our results in the first quarter was a tale of two cities, with growth in the developed markets offset by disappointing performance in the emerging markets. Our developed markets business today represents over 80% of total revenues and has been sustainably growing underlying net sales by a mid-single-digit rate of growth for several years. As you know, the first quarter is our seasonally smallest of the year and can be disproportionately impacted by timing issues, such as: barrel revenues, as they were this quarter; volatility in emerging markets, such as Turkey's unforeseen coup attempt and terror attacks, not to mention foreign exchange swings. But net-net, we delivered 11% underlying net sales growth on a 2-year stack, and we believe we remain on track to deliver 4% to 6% underlying net sales growth in fiscal 2017.
Takeaway trends in our non-U.S. developed markets remain strong, including high single-digit growth in Western Europe. In the United States, takeaway trends remain solid and the Jack Daniel's 150th birthday execution is well under way, which, when combined with incremental media investments and a commemorative gift, should drive a moderate acceleration in the United States. And while we are carefully monitoring the challenging off-premise trends for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire in the United States, we are encouraged to see Tennessee Honey growing again as we move past last year's new flavored whiskey launches.
On the margin front, we expect cost increases to slightly increase more and offset the improvement to our price/mix in the year, but SG&A cost-containment efforts should allow us to deliver solid leverage to the operating income line in the year, resulting in 7% to 9% in underlying operating income. 
After accounting for our recent 2-for-1 stock split, we still anticipate earnings per share of $1.71 to $1.81, including a $0.03 headwind from adverse foreign exchange. Full year tax rate is expected to be between 29% and 30%. And as a reminder, a 10% move in the dollar in either direction would impact EPS over the balance of the year by approximately $0.05.
In summary, we continue to deliver solid rates of underlying growth year-after-year. This growth is being led by the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands as well as our other premium bourbon and tequila brands. We have and will continue to take a measured approach to innovation that allows us to maximize our brand equity over the long term.
In addition to delivering solid underlying rates of growth today, we are continuing to invest in our long-term business prospects, such as the build-out of the Slane Irish whiskey distillery, which is on track to launch in spring as well as the integration of BenRiach.
In the quarter, we issued our first non-U.S. tranches of debt at very favorable rates, thanks to our balance sheet strength and track record of growth. We also returned over $0.25 billion in cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and ongoing share repurchase program which, in effect, allows us to invest in ourselves. We believe that our success at balancing the short term and long term is a major reason we have been able to deliver leading TSRs over long periods of time, and we are focused on continuing that legacy for all of our stakeholders.
So with that, unless Paul has any comments, we'll turn it over to the operator. You okay?"

So while we were down for the quarter, as we noted, we were down 5%, and it was a little bit more than we expected, it should be noted that we had very tough comps versus last year. And I'd like to step back and remind everybody how much our emerging markets makes up of our total business. So it's around 20% of our total revenues. And so to really understand it, there's a lot of moving parts within it, and you got to peel back the onion, so to speak, to understand it. As I said in my script, our 2 largest markets are Poland and Mexico. They represent well in excess of 40% of our emerging markets, and they're growing quite nicely at 8% and 17%, respectively. And that -- and we expect them to continue to grow, so we do not expect them to be a drag on our results. Then we talked about our -- 2 of our larger contributors of growth over the past couple of years, being Brazil and Turkey, being a drag on the quarter. And they very much were a drag on the quarter. And that's not surprising, given the political instability, the economic woes, the terrorism, the huge excise tax increases in both countries, but primarily in Brazil last year. And so these really did have a significant drag on our results. We have other parts of emerging markets that are continuing to grow. And then we have some emerging markets that have what I would call, I think they are stabilizing. They're not necessarily getting better. And so as we look on to the rest of the year, I think we don't expect, as you said and you're right, it's one of our key drivers, not the most important, but one of our key drivers to get to our full year forecast is that we won't have as big of a drag as we did in the quarter. You mentioned the timing issue. And you're right, timing is -- was an issue. I would say it was about 1 point of timing issues. And I would say the rest of it was that we also expect significantly easier comps as we go throughout the year, particularly if you look at the last half of the year. And most notably, the fourth quarter of the year, where emerging markets were down. And that's where you'll start to also see some of the things that we're talking about, where I believe we could -- a bottom, if you will, so to speak, in some of these markets that have been down for a while. Russia would be an example of that, where I think we're close to getting to the bottom on that. So I hope I've answered all your questions there."

I think going back to much of the interest in this category literally over the last -- as we received interesting questions about it, I mean, I feel like we're pretty much sticking to our plan as it relates to knowing first that we're cycling last year's launch, which of course had pipeline in it but also a lot of investment, that of course generated quite a bit of trial. And with any of these pent-up demand launches we've had over the years with Jack Daniel's, we experienced that there's -- particularly at premium prices, like Jack Daniel's is, that there are triers who sometimes don't convert that to full monthly usage. So I suspect we're going against some of that. As I think you inferred, the on-premise is doing much, much better. It didn't ramp up as rapidly. So it, of course, doesn't have the pipeline build that the off-premise channel does. And then I think very importantly, as we said, is that versus introducing an additional flavored whiskey from Jack Daniel's or 2 or some of our competition has done, our main focus was on geographic expansion, so trying to take out in a thoughtful way into other countries. And of course, the combination of the on-premise and the few markets we've introduced this fiscal year outside the United States is having a nice and positive offsetting factor to that pipeline that we're working against in the United States. And Jane, do you want to address the pricing thing?"

I mean, oftentimes, one of the barriers for people converting to regular weekly or monthly usage is pricing. And as I think you'd know this, that like for example, the drink price difference in the on-premise is much less than the bottle price in the off-premise for Fire and its main competitors. And so we think that might be one of the contributing factors, that the hurdle for an individual drink price in the on-premise isn't as great as the shelf price difference in the off-premise. So I think our people are appropriately always dabbling with the right price-volume mix within our range in order to try to find the best way to create sales value."

So if you look at our full year, our guidance is unchanged. And what we need, what we're looking at, as we -- and the confidence we have in achieving that for the full year versus where we are today, is we do expect to continue to have leverage, operating expense leverage via SG&A. You will recall last year, we had very low growth levels of SG&A. We expect some more continued low growth this year, too. It was 2% underlying last year. And so we still expect that to happen. You're right, on an underlying basis, we had very small -- I guess, not -- we didn't have a gross margin help, if you will, on an underlying basis. It's about what we expect for the year, give or take a little bit. So no help there. It's really coming from operating expenses, particularly SG&A. But let's talk more about what's going to drive this. It's really your top line growth. And we already talked about the emerging markets and why we feel confident that the emerging markets will improve from both a comp perspective and a timing perspective. But also, as we look out, we won't have the drag on our results from our first quarter Fire and the U.S. launch last year that drove us down this year, in other words, the pipeline. And we continue to expand internationally, so we're going to continue to get benefits there. And then Jack Daniel's 150 activation is just under way. And so we've talked -- Paul talked a lot about this in our Shareholders' Meeting in July as well as -- he introduced this in June during our call. And so there's a lot of activation really going on now. And then when I think about the United States, we are actually increasing our media spend as well. And so you'll start to see that coming through in the second and third quarter. We've got a lot of incremental gift coming through to -- and our whole sales force and our trade partners are all focused on that. So we'll see some modest improvement, as I said, in Jack Daniel's as well. So those things combined give us that confidence. If you look at advertising, it's probably worthwhile to step back and think about advertising a bit. What we said was we expected advertising to grow in line with our full year forecast top line. I think at this point, we would still say that. What was happening in the quarter, there were some comparability issues. I mentioned one of them being that we had the launch of Fire last year. In effect, in the U.S., we had a lot of promotional activities and so forth that we were doing. We had the absence of that level. We're still -- of course, we're advertising behind it this year, but not at the levels we were doing last year. There are some timing things going on, too. And then I think it's also worthwhile to just pull out Southern Comfort and take back and look at what kind of investments we've actually been doing behind our business over the last couple of years. And so if you look at the F '15 and F '16 combined, pulling out Southern Comfort, on a 2-year stack basis, it's up 13%. First quarter of last year, just to illustrate, the comp in advertisement last year that had the Tennessee Fire in it, it was up 6%. So we also have all that going on. So I hope I've given you some color. I know I said a whole lot in there. So I'll stop and see if Paul wants to add anything, or you can ask us further clarifying questions."

Of course, we're fully integrated, if you will, through the supply chain, so we make everything from start to finish, essentially. We don't grow our own corn, but we're making our barrels all the way to distilling them, and then out the door. So remember that we're one of the largest barrel-making operations in the world. And so just to give a little background, I think it's worthwhile to think about the background of just barrel sales in general, and then we'll talk about how it flows through our P&L. Just the background. Because we've been doing this -- we've been making our own barrels for a number of years. And what we do, as you know, is each bourbon and Jack Daniel's whiskey require a new barrel to put the whiskey in to age. When we get finished with those barrels, we sell them. And the market, generally, for the sale of these barrels, has been the Scotch industry. So if you look at it over a long period of time, we'll just say 50 years, it's a very cyclical business. So we can see when the production and sales of Scotch go up and down. So it impacts the sale of barrels. It impacts supply and demand and it impacts pricing. And so as you know, there's been some softening in the demand of blended Scotch. So we started seeing some pricing pressures, and we noticed that and we said that in our -- at our fourth quarter conference call. What that did is, in the first quarter, we had a couple of things happen. We saw those pricing pressures. So each barrel that we were selling on the outside market, once liquid got dumped, those used barrel, we were making less on it than we were a year ago. We also had some lumpiness, as I was alluding to, to orders which would have been one of our surprises in the quarter, if you will. But it's going to abate over the course of the year, because it's not gone. That's a little background, but how it flows through our P&L is it's simply we got less revenues from those sales of barrels this year than we got last year. It comes through our revenue line and it hits you all the way through your P&L. It's just basically revenue. It's a very high-margin business, and so there's no brand expense, if you will. There's some people that sell it, but it largely drops to the bottom line, whatever you have in your revenues, all the way to operating income."

Not only have we been emptying more barrels to meet the bourbon supply -- or demand out there, there have been other bourbon barrels out there. So that influences the supply of those against the Scotch demand. So some of that is hitting us in this first quarter. And as Jane said, it is a nice margin business."

As Jay mentioned, we posted slides to our website this morning that I will reference in my comments to help you walk through our 2 main areas of focus today, including first, our year-to-date results; and second, our full year outlook. After I complete my remarks, I'll turn the call over to Paul for his comments, and then we'll open it up for Q&A.
So let me start off by providing you with a brief summary of our highlights for our performance to date and outlook, which you will see on Slide 3, and then we'll dig into each of these areas in a bit more detail. First, as expected, our reported results through October continued to be negatively impacted by acquisitions and divestiture activity as well as FX headwinds. Second, we experienced a modest improvement in both our underlying top line and operating income results in the second quarter, although our top line growth was a bit less than we had expected. We'll walk you through some of the reasons for this in a moment.  Third, we continue to experience operating leverage, driven primarily by a reduction in SG&A expense. And finally, we reaffirmed our EPS guidance for the year at $1.71 to $1.81. Additionally, we lowered our outlook for underlying net sales and underlying operating income by roughly 1 point. We'll walk you through the reasons we believe our revised outlook is consistent with the trends in our business.
So with that, let me start by reviewing our recent results that are shown on Slide 4. Our second quarter underlying net sales growth of 3% accelerated modestly from the first quarter's 2% growth and resulted in first half underlying net sales growth of about 2.5%. Reported results in the first half declined 4% and were pulled down by 3 points due to the impact of acquired and divested brands, 2 points due to adverse foreign exchange and 1 point due to lower inventory levels. 
In the first half of this fiscal year, our underlying net sales growth was negatively impacted by 3 items: first, the timing of promotional activity in the United Kingdom as well as some customer buying patterns in Germany, which we expect will reverse over the balance of this fiscal year; second, the absence of discontinued agency brands in Mexico and Czech Republic, which were in our first half results last year and will no longer impact comparisons going forward; and third, the drag caused by lower used barrel sales, which we expect to moderate in the back half of this fiscal year. So without these 3 items, we estimate our normalized underlying net sales growth for the first 6 months of the year was approximately 4%.
So let's break down our net sales in a little bit more detail. Looking at it geographically, you can see on pages -- Slide 5 and 6 that the United States was the strongest contributor, delivering over 5% growth during the first 6 months. Second quarter underlying net sales growth in the United States accelerated almost 2 points from the first quarter's rate of growth. Jack Daniel's Family of Brands grew 4% in the United States, driven by 3% depletion growth for Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and continued growth from Gentleman Jack and Tennessee Honey. Jack Daniel's [indiscernible] in the on-premise helped the brand return to growth during the quarter after cycling against tough launch comparisons from the first quarter of last year. Our premium bourbon, including Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, are continuing to grow nicely despite a deceleration in volumes that we anticipated after taking some sizable price increases that were further enforced through high-end positioning. In our tequila brand, El Jimador and Herradura delivered another quarter of sustained double-digit growth in the United States.
Moving now to the emerging markets where second quarter underlying net sales growth of 3% improvement 8 percentage points over the first quarter's decrease, resulting in a 1% decline in the first half. Our 2 largest emerging markets, Mexico and Poland, delivered robust results with underlying net sales growth of 18% and 11%, respectively. Mexico's gains were broad-based, with strong growth for New Mix, Herradura and Jack Daniel's. El Jimador grew underlying net sales volume on fourth consecutive year of price increases as we continued to reposition the brand to drive better margins and returns. Poland's growth was driven by strong gains for Jack Daniel's and improved Finlandia results. Russia, Brazil and Turkey declined at double-digit rate through the first half, as did China and Southeast Asia. 
Sluggish performance in many emerging markets are symptomatic of challenging economic conditions, not to mention the ripple effects that result from widespread currency devaluation. This includes the direct impact to our reported results in U.S. dollars as well as decline in consumer and trade purchasing power. For example, foreign exchange can create customer issues through decreased ability to hold inventories, margin pressures and increased levels of parallel trade. 
In developed markets outside of the United States, underlying net sales grew 2% in the first half, but were flat in the quarter. Results in the United Kingdom were negatively impacted by the timing of some promotional activities for some large retailers from October into November and December. Germany's second quarter sales were negatively impacted by customer buying patterns. Year-to-date, underlying net sales growth of 2% would have been roughly 5% excluding these 2 items above and the removal of agency brands in the Czech Republic.  Importantly, we expect these items to reverse over the balance of fiscal year.  
Finally, Global Travel Retail grew net sales on an underlying basis by 4% in the first half, helped by distribution gains and soft comparisons to last year.
Moving now to some additional color on our brands shown on Slide 7. Globally, Jack Daniel's Family of Brands delivered growth of 2%, led by Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and helped by Tennessee Honey, Tennessee Fire, Gentleman Jack and RTD. The Jack Daniel's 150 campaign is well under way and we expect incremental benefits over the balance of the year, including the Taste of Lynchburg commemorative bottles at 86 and 100 proof that rode into retail stores for the November and December holiday selling season. 
Our Bourbon brands also continued on their growth trajectory. As consumers serach for high-quality spirits with heritage, we believe our leading Bourbon brands will increasingly stand out against the [indiscernible]. We have some of the highest quality Bourbons available in the market. And we believe the global potential for our Bourbons remain largely untapped as we increasingly leverage the significant investments we've made behind the growth of the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands, including route to consumer.
In our tequilas, the Herradura brand is enjoying the early stages of increasing consumer awareness , solid double-digit gains for the trademark in both Mexico and the United States. We believe that the brand is a growing gem in our portfolio and one that will become an increasingly important contributor to our business, given its high margins and significant opportunity to grow share. During the second quarter, we launched the brand's first ever global market marketing campaign called Luck is Earned, leveraging the brand's name as Herradura translates into [indiscernible]. This campaign illustrates the brand's history, heritage and leadership in tequila and brings it all to life through the consumer's story. 
El Jimador had a similarly strong quarter, driving first half net sales growth of 9%. We believe that the brand's health has never been better as we capitalized on our success in building awareness in the on-premise to fuel off-premise sales in the United States and as we repositioned the brand in Mexico at a more premium level. Finlandia declined 4% during the first 6 months, with mid-single-digit growth in Poland, offset by continued pressure in the premium vodka categories in Russia. Sonoma-Cutrer and Korbel champagne delivered mid-single-digit and low double-digit growth, respectively.
Now before I move down the income statement, let me spend a moment discussing our used barrel business, which has had a noteworthy impact on our first half results.  Over the long term, we have found being vertically integrated benefits our company through quality control, cost efficiency and supply stability for the new barrels we need to create our premium whiskey. Used barrels are the by-products for the organic growth of the North American whiskey business. So as we have grown our whiskey business, we have been emptying more barrels. This has led to a growing revenue stream that [indiscernible] around 2% in 2016. Over the last year, barrel prices have declined more than 10%, which when combined with lower volumes due to softness and demand for blended Scotch, has negatively impacted our year-to-date underlying sales growth rate by nearly 1 point. 
Our reported margin declined 200 basis points in the first half of fiscal 2017, as illustrated on Slide 8. This decline is primarily due to the impact of A&D activity, which negatively impacted first half reported gross margin by 140 basis points and 60 basis points from adverse foreign exchange. We have also experienced some gross margin pressure from higher content [ph] costs, due in part to higher wood prices.
Moving on to operating costs shown on Slide 9, underlying A&P increased 4% as we ramped up spend as we move into the all-important OND [ph] period. First half underlying A&P is up 1%, down 10% reported. We expect our brand investments and activation will drive momentum over the holiday and into calendar 2017. 
On the SG&A front, we remain committed to a disciplined approach to controlling our costs. This, coupled with the absence of onetime items from last year, has allowed us to drive down underlying SG&A year-to-date by 3%, or 4% on a reported basis. This decline in SG&A helped fuel the 7% growth in underlying operating income in the first half of this fiscal year against last year's 9% underlying operating income growth comparison over the same period. 
Underlying operating income growth improved from 6% in the first quarter to 8% in the second quarter. Year-to-date reported operating income declined 5%, largely due to the absence of divested brands and foreign exchange headwinds, which is illustrated on Slide 4.
In aggregate, we delivered reported earnings per share of $0.50 in the second quarter, up 3% over the prior year period, and $0.87 during the first 6 months of fiscal 2017, up 1%. Earnings per share was helped by a lower tax rate and lower share-based compensation.
So let me now move into my second topic and final topic for this morning: an update on our outlook for fiscal 2017, as shown on Slide 10.
So after all the puts and takes over the last 6 months, we estimated our portfolio delivered top line underlying growth on a normalized basis of approximately 4%. This is against strong 7% growth in the prior year's first half, equating to almost 10% 2-year stacked growth . Fiscal 2016 underlying net sales comparisons eased in the back half of our fiscal year to 3% to 4%, which implies we should be well on track to deliver 4% to 5% underlying net sales growth for the full year. For the details, we have provided and appendix in the back of the presentation that presents fiscal 2016 quarterly rates of growth, excluding the impact from A&D and net of excise taxes.
As we look at our revised full year outlook for fiscal 2017, we are encouraged by several other items. First, November depletions in Europe were double digits, rebuilding -- rebounding nicely from October declines and validating the timing items we called out. In fact, the United Kingdom had its best volumetric month ever for Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey. Second, consumer takeaway trends for Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey remained solid in most major markets, helped in part by our continued focus behind the JD 150 . Value takeaway is up double digits in Germany and Mexico and mid-single digits in France. The United Kingdom short-term trends have been impacted by previously mentioned timing of promotional activity. The 12-month value takeaway is up mid-single digits. And finally, as we analyze the impact from slowing emerging markets growth shown on Slide 12, we believe that these trends are improving at the same time that our comparisons are easing, particularly as we move into the fourth quarter.
We expect less reported gross margin erosion on a full year basis than what we have experienced the first half of this fiscal year, as the easing in margin pressures from A&D activity is anticipated to be offset somewhat by higher content costs. The global pricing environment remains challenging. And while we expect to see modest benefits from price/mix for the fiscal year, they will not be sufficient to fully offset somewhat higher content costs.
On our operating costs, we will continue to invest in our brand portfolio, but we will remain conservative until we see a more favorable near-term environment that warrants a more aggressive investment cost structure. We expect underlying SG&A to be roughly flat in the year and plan a modest increase in the back half. Operating leverage will help drive operating income growth of 6% to 8%.
Moving now to FX where assuming current spot rates, we expect adverse foreign exchange to be approximately $0.02 worse for the full year than we had anticipated on our first quarter call, equal to a $0.05 headwind in this year. When considering these expected FX headwinds, the underlying growth in our business and the benefit of the lower share-based compensation, our EPS outlook of $1.71 to $1.81 for the full year is unchanged, as we reaffirmed earlier today. As a sensitivity, assuming our foreign currency cash exposures collectively move 10% in either direction, EPS over the balance of the year would be impacted by roughly $0.04.
So in summary, our core brand portfolio continues to deliver healthy, sustain underlying rates of growth, with reported results under pressure from the combined effects of foreign exchange headwinds and our disposal of Southern Comfort and Tuaca last year. We believe that our revised underlying growth rates are both appropriate and achievable, given the business trends we have seen in the first half and what we expect in the second half of fiscal 2017. Given the macro deterioration and subsequent slowdown in our results in many emerging markets, we have been highly focused on cost discipline, which has largely offset the top line malaise and allowed us to continue delivering high single-digit growth in underlying operating income. Over the last year, we have made some portfolio enhancements that we believe better position Brown-Forman for the next decade of growth. Our portfolio is skewed to the fastest-growing categories with some of the best brands in spirits industry. And we are nearing completion of the major capital expansion we began almost 5 years ago to prepare for the next decade of global growth of our underpenetrated brands.
Simply put, we remain bullish on our long-term growth prospects. Our ability to protect and grow our cash flow over time, combined with our balance sheet flexibility, has allowed us to continue to return significant capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. So even with our elevated capital investments over the last 5 years, we have returned $4 million to our shareholders since 2012 as we aim to consistently deliver top-tier returns over the long term.
So let me call -- turn the call over to Paul for his comments. Paul?"

As a supplement to Jane's remarks, I believe we had a pretty good first half, particularly in light of a handful of items that worked against our reported earnings. Let me",1070,"Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for dialing in, as always. As a supplement to Jane's remarks, I believe we had a pretty good first half, particularly in light of a handful of items that worked against our reported earnings. Let me reiterate those briefly.
First and foremost is the absence of the sales and profits from the brands we sold late last fiscal year, and to a lesser extent, the loss of agency brands in a couple of countries that negatively impact the first half. Following this were continued foreign exchange headwinds. A third item was a difficult first half comparison we had against last year's Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire launch in the United States, and this challenging comp was most prominent in our first quarter this year. Further, the sluggish conditions in several emerging markets continued, though as Jane did note, we did see a nice improvement from Q1 to Q2. And finally, lower sales and profits this year from our used barrel business, and we believe the most significant portion of this impact has already occurred in our first half. 
Despite these items, our underlying sales were still up 2.5% in the first half, and underlying operating income was up a solid 7%. And as Jane just shared with you, when we take the step of normalizing our underlying sales, we estimate the first half to be more like 4%.
In the absence of some of these first half headwinds, we are planning for a noteworthy uptick in our second half underlying sales growth. This will position us for full year underlying sales in the 4% to 5% range and underlying operating income growth in the 6% to 8% range, very nice underlying operating underlying growth against the current backdrop, in my view. And when we account for little below-the-line help from interest expense, taxes and reduced share count from our repurchase program, it adds up to us reaffirming today our full year earnings guidance.
Another important aspect of our current fiscal year is the work that we are doing today to position Brown-Forman for growth in 2020 and beyond. Looking back over the last 20 years, we have periodically taken actions or made investments that tempered near-term earnings in favor of sustaining or accelerating the company's growth over the long term. In the early to mid-1990s, 2 good examples of this would be strong globalization push in the early '90s and the launch of the Woodford Reserve brand in distillery a couple of years later. In the mid-2000s, examples were the sale of our consumer durables business, followed by the acquisition of Chambord and Casa Herradura. And later in 2011, we chose to sell our popular wine business and shift our focus to the introduction of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, a trademark line extension that today is Brown-Forman's second most important brand. 
The reason that I referenced these earlier trade-offs is because we believe that we are amidst such a time period yet again. Let me cite a couple of examples from the last year or 2. First our strong capital investments of late are intended to expand production capacity or improve our brand home places, in some cases both, for Jack Daniel's, Woodford Reserve, Old Forester, Slane Irish whiskey and our [indiscernible] operations. The depreciation costs are just now starting to make their way into our product costs. And we believe this will be a highly acceptable trade-off for the benefit of having sufficient future products, supplies and an authentic foundation of our consumer and trade hospitality in the years ahead. 
Second, our recent disposition of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, paired with our acquisition of the [indiscernible], BenRiach brands and distilleries once again traded [ph] a larger pool of current sales and profitability, but with a declining sales trend for a currently smaller business, but one that we believe offers greater long-term growth potential, not unlike, say, the choice we made a decade ago to sell consumer durables and buy Casa Herradura. 
This fiscal year's reported results illustrate this trade-off visibly as the absence of Southern Comfort and Tuaca sales and profits are not offset by the profits of the smaller single malt brands, which are also temporarily depressed this year by the onetime costs of integrating them into Brown-Forman. I will also note that our decision not to reduce SG&A commensurate with the lost profitability of the disposed brands equates to a people investment we are making, as many of our front line sales and marketing employees redirect their attention to the balance of our portfolio. And we believe this will benefit our brand development in the years ahead. 
One of the best pieces of evidence I can provide to these type of short-term trade-offs are good decisions long term for Brown-Forman can be found in the example of Woodford Reserve, which celebrated its 20th anniversary as a brand this year. As a result of our strong investments over the years behind the brand's distillery, its home place, its packaging and its lifestyle marketing, Woodford Reserve has grown steadily to become one of the leaders of the exciting and fast-growing super-premium bourbon category. In fact, I believe the brand's development over the last 2 decades made a meaningful contribution to the bourbon category's resurgence as a whole. In my view, Woodford epitomizes the quality, authenticity, flavor, hospitality and down-to-earth personality that today's consumers see from their high-end bourbon experience. Having surpassed a recent milestone of 500,000 cases, the brand is poised for excellent growth in the years ahead. And alongside Gentleman Jack and Sonoma-Cutrer, it serves as a superb reference point for other premium brands in Brown-Forman's portfolio that might be new to our company or still in relatively early stages of seizing the large opportunity in front of them. We aspire for brands like Old Forester, Herradura, GlenDronach, Cooper's Craft and our forthcoming Slane Irish whiskey to follow a similar path as the one Woodford us has traveled over these last 20 years, and we are investing behind this aspiration accordingly. And at some point down the road, we will look forward to recalling this current time of investment as another important period for Brown-Forman that helped the company continue its historic combination of high margins, high returns on invested capital and strong and consistent growth.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now happy to take your question."

If we don't get it fully, just repeat it, if you will. I think we've recognized the realities of this competitive landscape, I think you're referring to the United States here, for some time. I mean, it's been our experience that the largest companies and brands in the United States across most categories have, obviously they're typically a higher basis of existing business and volume. But they have been generally losing share of the U.S. market for some time, as a lot of these upstart brands and a lot of the newer brands that are being introduced to the market have grown, in some cases, rapidly from these small bases. We, of course, have had some of those ourselves. Just a brand I just refer there, Woodford, would be such a nice example. But when you have brand leaders like in our case, like Jack Daniel's, you are absolutely exposed to that. And so I think in our case, for example, of the premium and ultra-premium bourbon business, we have not set an aspiration that Jack Daniel's would need to lead in terms of market share development of that category, just because it is far and away the largest brand and has. I mean, you would expect brands like Woodford Reserve and even our own Gentleman Jack, et cetera, to grow at rates above Jack Daniel's. having said that, we do strive, with the passage of time, to compete at typically the -- one of our internal reference points we look at a lot would be the growth of the brand at a net sales level that's consistent with the country's development overall. So we would look often at TDS [ph] or premium TDS in some instances. so we have a lot of different categorical reference points. But the point you make is particularly prominent in the United States as it relates to just this onslaught of competition that's been introduced to the marketplace the last 5 years. We're as we say, we're well aware of it. I feel pretty good that the brands that have been more established our portfolio has held up fairly well. Some of it has of course, from just category momentum. Of course, bourbon has been growing. We, too, have observed, I think you referenced that may be some of the more recent 3 and 6 months growth trends look a little softer than they were historically. We observed that as well but, they still remain from our experience well above historical. And actually in particularly in comparing them to some other countries around the world, they still seem very attractive."

I mean at this stage, we are very comfortable with portfolio we have for tequila, as -- we sometimes, of course, refer to it as Casa Herradura. Remember it includes predominantly, I mean in terms of our main focus, 2 trademarks, which is the Herradura tequila brand itself and then El Jimador. And then of course, I'll just remind everybody, within each of those brands, one of the -- it's actually one of the great balancing acts anybody who owns a tequila brand undertakes is that you've got typically 3 expressions under each of those. And they range from -- it's really interesting to watch how they get categorized by various followers of the category, our competitors. Because we have a clear product under both the Herradura and El Jimador brand that is both, in both cases, have experienced very rapid growth particularly in the United States. And then aged version is called Anejo, and then in between is Reposado. [ph] So they actually have different competitors sets in some ways, we find. of course, the clear expressions compete more with maybe the vodka category or clear goods, white goods. And then the aged expressions can actually find us a competitive reference sometimes more the whiskeys and brown goods. So you have to look at those individually. I mean, our -- we -- I think it's safe to say these last 12 months or so have been perhaps the best experience we've had in the tequila businesses in Casa Herradura. It's coming in a couple of different ways now, the brand development on both of the trademarks in the United States, but also their continued success down in Mexico. I think a really important aspect was the repositioning in terms of price for El Jimador down that market. As the business, at the low price points that it was at, was not as attractive for an owner like Brown-Forman. So we felt it was important to even with lower volumes to have higher prices. And we've been undertaken a program to do that now for several years. The Herradura business itself partially down there is a result of some innovation with the brand Herradura Ultra, has allowed brand to compete more effectively in Mexico. And then just its continued momentum in the U.S. market as I think super and ultra-premium tequilas continue to enjoy the same type of momentum that we've seen in super-premium bourbon. So as it relates to a forecasted -- any shortfalls in terms of supply, I haven't looked closely at that data in a while, but we don't currently have that impacting our business in any significant way."

And so that disproportionately hit our first half of our results. They didn't come in as we planned. What we've done now is we also, just for your information, we do annual negotiations in the [indiscernible] of the year where we meet our customers, and we know -- it's an annual negotiations, begins January 1 through December of next year. So we already know directionally what the numbers will be if you were volumetrically and pricing-wise. So we've taken that in consideration, and that's where a lot of our comments are coming from. I will say the business itself is very cyclical. It's a very dynamic market. It didn't come through in my script. the supply-demand dynamics are very, very -- I think for the rest of the year, we've got it pretty well honed in. But this is again a cyclical business, and we'll watch it as we go ahead into the future."

And as we get any kind of updated view related to the future years, we'll probably be doing more of that in our typical planning. And we'd provide that kind of update probably with our full year earnings back in I guess in the spring of 2017. So other question related to the flavors. And yes, I think you're -- your assumption was are these comps kind of easing. And I think the reality is, yes. We felt like particularly, first and foremost, we feel like Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey has been on a more regular pattern since its introduction. I mean it's been out there now 5 years plus. The Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire which had, in the United States, its national launch. At the tail end of FY '15 into the early part of FY '16, it created the most significant comparisons for us in our first quarter of this year. And so we definitely feel that they eased into the second quarter and will actually continue to ease as the year goes on. We're always building some form of distribution for these newer line extensions and products. But particularly for that one, it ramped up its distribution rather quick because there was some real pent-up demand for it. So we've been working against some of that initial distribution and trial in the earliest part of this fiscal year. Also I think that the brand's continuing to, in some ways, build distribution in the United States to the on-premise. I mean, it's made its way into more points of distribution in the U.S. on-premise. actually, its velocity looks pretty good from what we can tell. So I feel relatively good about the U.S. Jack Daniel's flavors a lot. The fact that we are not introducing another one and can focus our attention on these 2, particularly in the absence of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, which were also brands we were tending to in prior years, are nothing but a help in our ability to continue to grow those flavors. So I think we're implementing against, pretty much against the strategy would have outlined a year ago, which is to really focus on these 2 to develop them. In the case of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, start the process, but to be very disciplined about building its presence in international markets this year as well. we think that might give us a little bit of help in the second half of this year, too."

Sure, I think it's  maybe doing a little bit of both, the way you pose that question. I do think there's no doubt that the infusion of a lot of new bourbon brands, or I mean, you can see it across a bunch of categories. We're starting to see of course in gin. You can see it and tequila. I mean, it's long happened in vodka, of course, as whoever the latest upstart for the recent decade was, took its, in some cases, position from their previous leading brand. But in this case, I think it is. A lot of the entrepreneurs we're seeing is contributing to category interest. I think it most certainly contributes to category trial and some of the volumes. And is that a source of competition? Of course. I mean, there's no way that it can't be when there's more available entrants. And so the way that it makes a company like us think about that is, first and foremost, try to understand what it is about the category and the brands that are coming in that people are finding interesting. And to the extent that our brands also possess, or in some cases may even have better attributes along those lines, make sure we're emphasizing them. And so something that's been undertaken in Brown-Forman over these last couple of years is to really emphasize the credentials of our American whiskey brands, and it starts of course, with Jack Daniel's. And so if you're paying attention to everything from marketing communications to the quality with which we are preparing our home places, to packaging and messaging on packaging, all of that is intended to be contemporary to what people find interesting to be about American whiskey and in bourbon. For people who are prone to not wanting an established brand versus something that's new and are going to try it, I mean, there's not much we can do about being well known or having brand awareness. What we can do though is also offer some brands from Brown-Forman, as is the case with Cooper's Craft that are new to the world, and of course tell them that story of why Cooper's Craft is, in my view, a perfectly suited entrant into this craft of bourbon category today and how authentic the story is behind it as it pays contribute to the barrel making that is unique to Brown-Forman. And so we feel like we're trying to participate in a growing category in a variety of ways. And to date, I'd say we've been beneficiaries of all this than we have been on the losing end of it. And we can cross-reference a bunch of categories, both inside and outside the beverage alcohol business, where that hasn't been the case. So I think what we can do is put forward our best foot to meet actually the needs of what is creating this consumer interest, which is I think some of the elements I mentioned in my prepared remarks which things like authenticity and quality and maybe making sure the taste and flavor of your products meet their needs, hospitality is incredibly important in this equation. So we're just continuing to strengthen and emphasize those attributes. And so far, Coopers' Craft is doing pretty well. It's a very limited amount of the U.S. geography only. Our internal reception from our own people, first and foremost, was very strong. And now we are just getting it now, which you would -- recognize as a pretty competitive and crowded marketplace. But the fact that it comes from Brown-Forman and given our credibility in this category, gives us a leg up over many of these upstarts that are coming in from entrepreneurs."

And so it varies where -- where we will continue to invest is where the consumer is and we're receptive to it. we would just be more thoughtful. I wish to remind people, too, when we think the line item of advertising, or when you look at that, we think about our investments will be on that line item, including the SG&A line, which is people on the street that builds the brands as well as the cost of our packaging and the value-added packs, which we have several out there right now as it relates to 2 we are referring to from the Taste of Lynchburg for the JD 150 celebration. all that comes into play, too, just not focusing strictly on that one line item."

I mean, so in essence, it makes it more a hypothesis than a reality. Facing I think some of the more, I'd say systemic things that relate to particularly our business, which is not the food part, of course, as much as it is the drink part of the restaurant business, I think I haven't heard anything that makes me change that, which is this aspect of going back now several, several years were consumer started to subtly shift their consumption occasions to lower the off-premise more. As there seems to be more millenial thing, the ability particularly to use social media together people effectively starting your own small bar on an evening if you want because it's so efficient to do so. And the impact that, that then has on suppliers and brands as you try to navigate the marketplace where the off-premise is growing faster than the on-premise. And so what are those dynamics we actually think it'd be really adjusting to see, how particularly when one of the more recent developments that came out of this year's election cycle, which was continued momentum on the legalization of marijuana, that being an interesting development, of course, we've been monitoring. But what just -- this will be anecdotal thing, the fact that it tends to be more of an off-premise consumption occasion, actually and to the extent that there's cross-category usage between marijuana and beverage alcohol, what does that do in terms of its impact on a brand or a suppliers approach to the business. I mean, it'd be -- I think that development will if anything and even greater momentum to the off-premise sales versus the on-premise sales. So these are all things that are kind of speculative, quite honestly, their hypotheses that we are observing after. We're monitoring the. I do think our organization is that in a strong trying to cater to the off-premise occasion a bit more, whether it's through special packs, item such as the development of flavored whiskey category I think hits a sweet spot as it relates to convenience in terms of consumption. I think as it relates to price and volume trade-offs, I mean, certainly the off-premise environment is a more price-sensitive channels in the on-premise one and so there's a number of attributes of the channels that you have to pay attention to as you see subtle in these have not been wholesale and dramatic shifts, they're much more subtle but if you study them over may be a 3, 5 or 7 years, they become more important than they do in any 1 quarter. So that's about all we have observed as it relates to the questions you are asking. We'll be paying close attention to it though of course, as the months unfold and the realities of what's prognosticated actually come into play."

This morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements, whether due to new information, future events or otherwise. 
This morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Because of all of the moving parts in our recent results related to disposition activity and foreign exchange moves as well as last quarter's change in how we present sales, we have posted a presentation to our website that details the topics we will cover in our prepared remarks for the second quarter and year-to-date results. Both the release and the presentation can be found on our website under the section titled Investors, Events & Presentations. 
In the press release, we have listed a number of the risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K, Form 8-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
During this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures and the reasons management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operations are contained in the press release.

As Jay mentioned, we posted slides to our website this morning that I will reference in my comments to help you walk through our 2 main areas of focus today, including first, our year-to-date results; and second, our full year outlook. After I complete my remarks, I'll turn the call over to Paul for his comments, and then we'll open it up for Q&A.
So let me start off by providing you with a brief summary of our highlights for our performance to date and outlook, which you will see on Slide 3, and then we'll dig into each of these areas in a bit more detail. First, as expected, our reported results through October continued to be negatively impacted by acquisitions and divestiture activity as well as FX headwinds. Second, we experienced a modest improvement in both our underlying top line and operating income results in the second quarter, although our top line growth was a bit less than we had expected. We'll walk you through some of the reasons for this in a moment.  Third, we continue to experience operating leverage, driven primarily by a reduction in SG&A expense. And then finally, we reaffirmed our EPS guidance for the year at $1.71 to $1.81. Additionally, we lowered our outlook for underlying net sales and underlying operating income by roughly 1 point. We'll walk you through the reasons we believe our revised outlook is consistent with the trends in our business.
So with that, let me start by reviewing our recent results that are shown on Slide 4. Our second quarter underlying net sales growth of 3% accelerated modestly from the first quarter's 2% growth and resulted in first half underlying net sales growth of about 2.5%. Reported results in the first half declined 4% and were pulled down by 3 points due to the impact of acquired and divested brands, 2 points due to adverse foreign exchange and 1 point due to lower inventory levels. 
In the first half of this fiscal year, our underlying net sales growth was negatively impacted by 3 items: First, the timing of promotional activity in the United Kingdom as well as some customer buying patterns in Germany, which we expect will reverse over the balance of this fiscal year; second, the absence of discontinued agency brands in Mexico and the Czech Republic, which were in our first half results last year and will no longer impact comparisons going forward; and third, the drag caused by lower used barrel sales, which we expect to moderate in the back half of this fiscal year. So without these 3 items, we estimate our normalized underlying net sales growth for the first 6 months of the year was approximately 4%.
So let's break down our net sales in a little bit more detail. Looking at it geographically, you can see on pages -- Slide 5 and 6 that the United States was the strongest contributor, delivering over 5% growth during the first 6 months. Second quarter underlying net sales growth in the United States accelerated almost 2 points from the first quarter's rate of growth. Jack Daniel's Family of Brands grew 4% in the United States, driven by 3% depletion growth for Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and continued growth from Gentleman Jack and Tennessee Honey. Jack Daniel's fire strength [ph] in the on-premise helped the brand return to growth during the quarter after cycling against tough launch comparisons from the first quarter of last year. Our premium bourbon, including Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, are continuing to grow nicely despite this acceleration in volumes that we anticipated after taking some sizable price increases that were further enforced through high-end positioning. In our tequila brand, El Jimador and Herradura delivered another quarter of sustained double-digit growth in the United States.
Moving now to the emerging markets where second quarter underlying net sales growth of 3% improved 8 percentage points over the first quarter's decrease, resulting in a 1% decline in the first half. Our 2 largest emerging markets, Mexico and Poland, delivered robust results with underlying net sales growth of 18% and 11%, respectively. Mexico's gains were broad-based, with strong growth for New Mix, Herradura and Jack Daniel's. El Jimador grew underlying net sales volume with fourth consecutive year of price increases as we continued to reposition the brand to drive better margins and returns. Poland's growth was driven by strong gains for Jack Daniel's and improved Finlandia results. Russia, Brazil and Turkey declined at double-digit rate through the first half, as did China and Southeast Asia. 
Sluggish performance in many emerging markets are symptomatic of challenging economic conditions, not to mention the ripple effects that result from widespread currency devaluation. This includes the direct impact to our reported results in U.S. dollars as well as decline in consumer and trade purchasing power. For example, foreign exchange can create customer issues through decreased ability to hold inventories, margin pressures and increased levels of parallel trade. 
In developed markets outside the United States, underlying net sales grew 2% in the first half, but were flat in the quarter. Results in the United Kingdom were negatively impacted by the timing of some promotional activities for some large retailers from October into November and December. Germany's second quarter sales were negatively impacted by customer buying patterns. Year-to-date, underlying net sales growth of 2% would have been roughly 5% excluding these 2 items above and the removal of agency brands in the Czech Republic.  Importantly, we expect these items to reverse over the balance of fiscal year.  
Finally, Global Travel Retail grew net sales on an underlying basis by 4% in the first half, helped by distribution gains and soft comparisons to last year.
Moving now to some additional color on our brands shown on Slide 7. Globally, Jack Daniel's Family of Brands delivered growth of 2%, led by Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and helped by Tennessee Honey, Tennessee Fire, Gentleman Jack and RTD. The Jack Daniel's 150 campaign is well under way and we expect incremental benefits over the balance of the year, including the Taste of Lynchburg commemorative bottles at 86 and 100 proof that rode into retail stores for the November and December holiday selling season. 
Our Bourbon brands also continued on their growth trajectory. As consumers searched for high-quality spirits with heritage, we believe our leading Bourbon brands will increasingly stand out against the wave of crafted drinks. We have some of the highest quality Bourbons available in the market. And we believe the global potential for our Bourbons remain largely untapped as we increasingly leverage this significant investments we've made behind the global growth of the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands, including route to consumer.
In our tequilas, the Herradura brand is enjoying the early stages of increasing consumer awareness and trial. Drop in solid double-digit gains for the trademark in both Mexico and the United States. We believe that the brand is a growing gem in our portfolio and one that will become an increasingly important contributor to our business, given its high margins and significant opportunity to grow share. During the second quarter, we launched the brand's first ever global marketing campaign called Luck is Earned, leveraging the brand's name, as Herradura translates into horseshoe. This campaign illustrates the brand's history, heritage and leadership in tequila and brings it all to life through the consumer's stories. 
El Jimador had a similarly strong quarter, driving first half net sales growth of 9%. We believe that the brand's health has never been better as we capitalized on our success in building awareness in the on-premise to fuel off-premise sales in the United States and as we repositioned the brand in Mexico at a more premium level. Finlandia declined 4% during the first 6 months, with mid-single-digit growth in Poland, offset by continued pressure in the premium vodka categories in Russia. Sonoma-Cutrer and Korbel champagne delivered mid-single-digit and low double-digit growth, respectively.
Now before I move down the income statement, let me spend a moment discussing our used barrel business, which has had a noteworthy impact on our first half results.  Over the long term, we have found being vertically integrated benefits our company through quality control, cost efficiency and supply stability for the new barrels we need to create our premium whiskey. Used barrels are the by-products for the organic growth of the American whiskey business. So as we have grown our whiskey business, we have been emptying more barrels. This has led to a growing revenue stream that [indiscernible] around 2% in 2016. Over the last year, barrel prices have declined more than 10%, which when combined [ph] with lower volumes due to softness and demand for blended Scotch, has negatively impacted our year-to-date underlying sales growth rate by nearly 1 point. 
Our reported margin declined 200 basis points in the first half of fiscal 2017, as illustrated on Slide 8. This decline is primarily due to the impact of A&D activity, which negatively impacted first half reported gross margin by 140 basis points and 60 basis points from adverse foreign exchange. We have also experienced some gross margin pressure from higher content  costs, due in part to higher wood prices.
Moving on to operating costs shown on Slide 9, underlying A&P increased 4% as we ramped up spend as we moved into the all-important OND period. First half underlying A&P is up 1%, down 10% reported. We expect our brand investments and activation will drive momentum over the holiday and into calendar 2017. 
On the SG&A front, we remain committed to a disciplined approach to controlling our cost. This, coupled with the absence of onetime items from last year, has allowed us to drive down underlying SG&A year-to-date by 3%, or 4% on a reported basis. This decline in SG&A helped fuel the 7% growth in underlying operating income in the first half of this fiscal year against last year's 9% underlying operating income growth comparison over the same period. 
Underlying operating income growth improved from 6% in the first quarter to 8% in the second quarter. Year-to-date reported operating income declined 5%, largely due to an absence of divested brands and foreign exchange headwinds, which is illustrated on Slide 4.
In aggregate, we delivered reported earnings per share of $0.50 in the second quarter, up 30% [ph] over the prior year period, and $0.87 during the first 6 months of fiscal 2017, up 1%. Earnings per share was helped by a lower tax-rate and lower share-count.
So let me now move into my second topic and final topic for this morning: an update on our outlook for fiscal 2017, as shown on Slide 10.
So after all the puts and takes over the last 6 months, we estimated our portfolio delivered top line underlying growth on a normalized basis of approximately 4%. This is against strong 7% growth in the prior year's first half, equating to almost 10% 2-year stacked growth . Fiscal 2016 underlying net sales comparisons eased in the back half of our fiscal year to 3% to 4%, which implies we should be well on track to deliver 4% to 5% underlying net sales growth for the full year. For the details, we have provided an appendix in the back of the presentation that presents fiscal 2016 quarterly rates of growth, excluding the impact from A&D and net of excise taxes.
As we look at our revised full year outlook for fiscal 2017, we are encouraged by several other items. First, November depletions in Europe grew double digits, rebuilding -- rebounding nicely from October declines and validating the timing items we called out. In fact, the United Kingdom had its best volumetric month ever for Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey. Second, consumer takeaway trends for Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey remained solid in most major markets, helped in part by our continued focus behind the JD 150 plan. Value takeaway is up double digits in Germany and Mexico and mid-single digits in France. The United Kingdom short-term trends have been impacted by the previously mentioned timing of promotional activity. The 12-month value takeaway is up mid-single digits. And finally, as we analyze the impact from slowing emerging markets growth shown on Slide 12, we believe that trends are improving at the same time that our comparisons are easing, particularly as we move into the fourth quarter.
We expect less reported gross margin erosion on a full year basis than what we have experienced to the first half of this fiscal year, as the easing in margin pressures from A&D activity is anticipated to be offset somewhat by higher content costs. The global pricing environment remains challenging. And while we expect to see modest benefits from price/mix for the fiscal year, they will not be sufficient to fully offset somewhat higher content costs.
On our operating costs, we will continue to invest in our brand portfolio, but we will remain conservative until we see a more favorable near-term environment that warrants a more aggressive investment cost structure. We expect underlying SG&A to be roughly flat in the year and plan a modest increase in the back half. Operating leverage will help drive operating income growth of 6% to 8%.
Moving now to FX where assuming current spot rates, we expect adverse foreign exchange to be approximately $0.02 worse for the full year than we had anticipated on our first quarter call, equal to a $0.05 headwind in this year. When considering these expected FX headwinds, the underlying growth in our business and the benefit of a lower share-count, our EPS outlook of $1.71 to $1.81 for the full year is unchanged, as we reaffirmed earlier today. As a sensitivity, assuming our foreign currency cash exposures collectively move 10% in either direction, EPS over the balance of the year would be impacted by roughly $0.04.
So in summary, our core brand portfolio continues to deliver healthy, sustained underlying rates of growth, with reported results under pressure from the combined effects of foreign exchange headwinds and our disposal of Southern Comfort and Tuaca last year. We believe that our revised underlying growth rates are both appropriate and achievable, given the business trends we have seen in the first half and what we expect in the second half of fiscal 2017. Given the macro deterioration and subsequent slowdown in our results in many emerging markets, we have been highly focused on cost discipline, which has largely offset the top line malaise and allowed us to continue delivering high single-digit growth in underlying operating income. Over the last year, we have made some portfolio enhancements that we believe better position Brown-Forman for the next decade of growth. Our portfolio is skewed to the fastest-growing categories with some of the best brands in spirits industry. And we are nearing completion of the major capital expansion we began almost 5 years ago to prepare for the next decade of global growth of our underpenetrated brands.
Simply put, we remain bullish on our long-term growth prospects. Our ability to protect and grow our cash flow over time, combined with our balance sheet flexibility, has allowed us to continue to return significant capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends.

As a supplement to Jane's remarks, I believe we had a pretty good first half, particularly in light of a handful of items that worked against our reported earnings. Let me",1076,"Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for dialing in, as always. As a supplement to Jane's remarks, I believe we had a pretty good first half, particularly in light of a handful of items that worked against our reported earnings. Let me reiterate those briefly.
First and foremost is the absence of the sales and profits from the brands we sold late last fiscal year, and to a lesser extent, the loss of agency brands in a couple of countries that negatively impacted the first half. Following this were continued foreign exchange headwinds. A third item was the difficult first half comparison we had against last year's Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire launch in the United States, and this challenging comp was most prominent in our first quarter this year. Further, the sluggish conditions in several emerging markets continued, though as Jane did note, we did see a nice improvement from Q1 to Q2. And finally, lower sales and profits this year from our used barrel business, and we believe the most significant portion of this impact has already occurred in our first half. 
Despite these items, our underlying sales were still up 2.5% in the first half, and underlying operating income was up a solid 7%. And as Jane just shared with you, when we take the step of normalizing our underlying sales, we estimate the first half to be more like 4%.
In the absence of some of these first half headwinds, we are planning for a noteworthy uptick in our second half underlying sales growth. This will position us for full year underlying sales in the 4% to 5% range and underlying operating income growth in the 6% to 8% range, very nice underlying operating -- underlying growth against the current backdrop, in my view. And when we account for little below-the-line help from interest expense, taxes and reduced share count from our repurchase program, it adds up to us reaffirming today our full year earnings guidance.
Another important aspect of our current fiscal year is the work that we are doing today to position Brown-Forman for growth in 2020 and beyond. Looking back over the last 20 years, we have periodically taken actions or made investments that tempered near-term earnings in favor of sustaining or accelerating the company's growth over the long term. In the early to mid-1990s, 2 good examples of this would be strong our globalization push in the early '90s and the launch of the Woodford Reserve brand in distillery a couple of years later. In the mid-2000s, further examples were the sale of our consumer durables business, followed by the acquisition of Chambord and Casa Herradura. And later in 2011, we chose to sell our popular priced wine business and shift our focus to the introduction of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, a trademark line extension that today is Brown-Forman's second most important brand. 
The reason that I referenced these earlier trade-offs is because we believe that we are amidst such a time period yet again. Let me cite a couple of examples from the last year or 2. First our strong capital investments of late are intended to expand production capacity or improve our brand home places, in some cases both, for Jack Daniel's, Woodford Reserve, Old Forester, Slane Irish whiskey and our cooperage operations. The depreciation costs are just now starting to make their way into our product costs. And we believe this will be a highly acceptable trade-off for the benefit of having sufficient future products, supplies and an authentic foundation of our consumer and trade hospitality in the years ahead. 
Second, our recent disposition of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, paired with our acquisition of the GlenDronach, BenRiach and Glenglassaugh brands and distilleries once again traded [ph] a larger pool of current sales and profitability, but with a declining sales trend for a currently smaller business, but one that we believe offers greater long-term growth potential, not unlike, say, the choice we made a decade ago to sell consumer durables and buy Casa Herradura. 
This fiscal year's reported results illustrate this trade-off visibly as the absence of Southern Comfort and Tuaca sales and profits are not offset by the profits of the smaller single malt brands, which are also temporarily depressed this year by the onetime costs of integrating them into Brown-Forman. I will also note that our decision not to reduce SG&A commensurate with the lost profitability of the disposed brands equates to a people investment we are making, as many of our front line sales and marketing employees redirect their attention to the balance of our portfolio. And we believe this will benefit our brand development in the years ahead. 
One of the best pieces of evidence I can provide to these type of short-term trade-offs are good decisions long term for Brown-Forman can be found in the example of Woodford Reserve, which celebrated its 20th anniversary as a brand this year. As a result of our strong investments over the years behind the brand's distillery, its home place, its packaging and its lifestyle marketing, Woodford Reserve has grown steadily to become one of the leaders of the exciting and fast-growing super-premium bourbon category. In fact, I believe the brand's development over the last 2 decades made a meaningful contribution to the bourbon category's resurgence as a whole. In my view, Woodford epitomizes the quality, authenticity, flavor, hospitality and down-to-earth personality that today's consumers seek from their high-end bourbon experience. Having surpassed a recent milestone of 500,000 cases, the brand is poised for excellent growth in the years ahead. And alongside Gentleman Jack and Sonoma-Cutrer, it serves as a superb reference point for other premium brands in Brown-Forman's portfolio that might be new to our company or still in relatively early stages of seizing the large opportunity in front of them. We aspire for brands like Old Forester, Herradura, Glenn Johnny, Cooper's craft in our forthcoming Slane Irish whiskey to follow a similar path as the one Woodford has traveled over these last 20 years, and we are investing behind this aspiration accordingly. And at some point down the road, we will look forward to recalling this current time of investment as another important period for Brown-Forman that helped the company continue its historic combination of high margins, high returns on invested capital and strong and consistent growth.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now happy to take your question."

If we don't get it fully, just repeat it, if you will. I think we've recognized the realities of this competitive landscape, I think you're referring to the United States here, for some time. I mean, it's been our experience that the largest companies and brands in the United States across most categories have, obviously they're typically a higher basis of existing business and volume. But they have been generally losing share of the U.S. market for some time, as a lot of these upstart brands and a lot of the newer brands are being introduced to the market have grown, in some cases, rapidly from these small bases. We, of course, have had some of those ourselves. Just the brand I just referenced there, Woodford, would be such a nice example. But when you have brand leaders like in our case, like Jack Daniel's, you are absolutely exposed to that. And so I think in our case, for example, of the premium and ultra-premium bourbon business, we have not set an aspiration that Jack Daniel's would need to lead in terms of market share development of that category, just because it is far and away the largest brand and has. I mean, you would expect brands like Woodford Reserve and even our own Gentleman Jack, et cetera, to grow at rates above Jack Daniel's. having said that, we do strive, with the passage of time, to compete at typically the -- one of our internal reference points we look at a lot would be the growth of the brand at a net sales level that's consistent with the country's development overall. So look out for the TDS or premium TDS in some instances. So we have a lot of different categorical reference points. But the point you make is particularly prominent in the United States as it relates to just this onslaught of competition that's been introduced to the marketplace for the last 5 years. We're as we say, we're well aware of it. I feel pretty good that the brands that have been more established in our portfolio has held up fairly well. Some of it has of course, from just category momentum. Of course, the fact that bourbon has been growing. We, too, have observed, I think you referenced that may be some of the more recent 3 and 6 months growth trends look a little softer than they were historically. We observed that as well but, they still remain from our experience well above historical. And actually in particularly in comparing them to some other countries around the world, they still seem very attractive."

I mean at this stage, we are very comfortable with the portfolio we have in tequila, as -- we sometimes, of course, refer to it as Casa Herradura. Remember it includes predominantly, I mean in terms of our main focus, 2 trademarks, which is the Herradura tequila brand itself and then El Jimador. And then of course, I'll just remind everybody, within each of those brands, one of the -- it's actually one of the great balancing acts anybody who owns a tequila brand undertakes is that you've got typically 3 expressions under each of those. And they range from -- it's really interesting to watch how they get categorized by various followers of the category, our competitors. Because we have a clear product under both the Herradura and El Jimador brand that is both, in both cases, they have experienced very rapid growth particularly in the United States. And then aged version is called Anejo, and then in between is Reposado. So they actually have different competitors sets in some ways, we find. of course, the clear expressions compete more with maybe the vodka category or clear goods, white goods. And then the aged expressions can actually find us a competitive reference sometimes more the whiskeys and brown goods. So you have to look at those individually. I mean, our -- we -- I think it's safe to say these last 12 months or so have been perhaps the best experience we've had in the tequila business since we have owned Casa Herradura. It's really coming in a couple of different ways now and the brand development on both of the trademarks in the United States, but also their continued success down in Mexico. I think a really important aspect was the repositioning in terms of price for El Jimador down that market. As the business, at the low price points that it was at, it was not as attractive for an owner like Brown-Forman. So we felt it was important to even with lower volumes to have higher prices. And we've been undertaken a program to do that now for several years. The Herradura business itself partially down there is a result of some innovation with the brand Herradura Ultra, has allowed the brand to compete more effectively in Mexico. And then just its continued momentum in the U.S. market as I think super and ultra-premium tequilas continue to enjoy the same type of momentum that we've seen in super-premium bourbon. So as it relates to a forecasted -- any shortfalls in terms of supply, I haven't looked closely at that data in a while, but we don't currently have that impacting our business in any significant way."

So we already know directionally what the numbers will be if you were volumetrically and pricing-wise. So we've taken that in consideration, and that's where a lot of our comments are coming from. I will say the business itself is very cyclical. It's a very dynamic market. It didn't come through in my script.

And yes, I think you're -- your assumption was are these comps kind of easing. And I think the reality is, yes. We felt like particularly, first and foremost, we feel like Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey has been on a more regular pattern since its introduction. I mean it's been out there now 5 years plus. The Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire which had, in the United States, its national launch. At the tail end of FY '15 and into the early part of FY '16, it created the most significant comparisons for us in our first quarter of this year. And so we definitely feel that they eased into the second quarter and will actually continue to ease as the year goes on. We're always building some form of distribution for these newer line extensions and products. But particularly for that one, it ramped up its distribution rather quick because there was some real pent-up demand for it. So we've been working against some of that initial distribution and trial in the earliest part of this fiscal year. Also I think that the brand's continuing to, in some ways, build distribution in the United States to the on-premise. I mean, it's made its way into more points of distribution in the U.S. on-premise. Actually, its velocity looks pretty good from what we can tell. So I feel relatively good about the U.S. Jack Daniel's flavors we've got. The fact that we are not introducing another one and can focus our attention on these 2, particularly in the absence of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, which were also brands we were tending to in prior years, are nothing but a help in our ability to continue to grow those flavors. So I think we're implementing against, pretty much against the strategy we would have outlined a year ago, which is to really focus on these 2 to develop them. In the case of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, you start the process it would be very disciplined about building its presence in international markets this year as well. We think that might give us a little bit of help in the second half of this year, too."

Sure, I think it's  maybe doing a little bit of both, the way you pose that question. I do think there's no doubt that the infusion of a lot of new bourbon brands, or I mean, you can see it across a bunch of categories. We're starting to see of course in gin. You can see it in tequila. I mean, it's long happened in vodka, of course, as whoever the latest upstart for the recent decade was, took its, in some cases, position from the previous leading brand. But in this case, I think it is [indiscernible] . A lot of the entrepreneurs we're seeing is contributing to category interest. I think, it most certainly then contributes to category trial and some of the volumes. And is that a source of competition? Of course. I mean, there's no way that it can't be when there's more available entrants. And so the way that it makes a company like us think about that is, first and foremost, try to understand what it is about the category and the brands that are coming in that people are finding interesting. And to the extent that our brands also possess, or in some cases may even have better attributes along those lines, make sure we're emphasizing them. And so something that's been undertaken in Brown-Forman over these last couple of years is to really emphasize the credentials of our American whiskey brands, and it starts of course, with Jack Daniel's. And so if you're paying attention to everything from marketing communications to the quality with which we are preparing our home places, to packaging and messaging on packaging, all of that is intended to be contemporary to what people find interesting today about American whiskey and in bourbon. For people who are prone to not wanting an established brand versus something that's new and are just going to try it, I mean, there's not much we can do about being well known or having brand awareness. What we can do though is also offer some brands from Brown-Forman, as is the case with Cooper's Craft that are new to the world, and of course tell them that story of why Cooper's Craft is, in my view, a perfectly suited entrant into this craft bourbon category today and how authentic the story is behind it as it pays tribute to the barrel making that is unique to Brown-Forman. And so we feel like we're trying to participate in a growing category in a variety of ways. And to date, I'd say we've been net beneficiaries of all this than we have been on the losing end of it. And then we can cross-reference a bunch of categories, both inside and outside the beverage alcohol business, where that hasn't been the case. So I think what we can do is put forward our best foot to meet actually the needs of what is creating this consumer interest, which, I think, are some of the elements I mentioned in my prepared remarks, which things like authenticity and quality and making sure the taste and flavor of your products meet their needs, hospitality is incredibly important in this equation. So we're just continuing to strengthen and emphasize those attributes. And so far, Coopers' Craft is doing pretty well. It's in a very limited amount of the U.S. geography only. Our internal reception from our own people, first and foremost, was very strong. And now we are just getting it now into, which you would -- recognize as a pretty competitive and crowded marketplace. But the fact that it comes from Brown-Forman and given our credibility in this category, gives it a leg up over many of these upstarts that are coming in from entrepreneurs."

I mean, so in essence, it makes it more a hypothesis than a reality. Facing I think some of the more, I'd say systemic things that relate to particularly our business, which is not the food part, of course, as much as it is the drink part of the restaurant business, I think I haven't heard anything that makes me change that, which is this aspect of going back now several, several years were consumer started to subtly shift their consumption occasions toward the off-premise more. As there seems to be more millenial thing, the ability particularly to use social media to gather people effectively starting your own small bar on an evening if you want because it's so efficient to do so. And the impact that, that then has on suppliers and brands as you try to navigate the marketplace where the off-premise is growing faster than the on-premise. And so what are those dynamics we actually think it'd be really adjusting to see, how particularly when one of the more recent developments that came out of this year's election cycle, which was continued momentum on the legalization of marijuana, that being an interesting development, of course, we've been monitoring. But what just -- this will be an anecdotal thing, the fact that it tends to be more of an off-premise consumption occasion, actually into the extent that there's cross-category usage between marijuana and beverage alcohol, what does that do in terms of its impact on a brand or a supplier's approach to the business. I mean, it'd be -- I think that development will if anything and add even greater momentum to the off-premise sales versus the on-premise sales. So these are all things that are kind of speculative, quite honestly, their hypotheses that we are observing after. We're monitoring them. I do think our organization has done a nice job on trying to cater to the off-premise occasion a bit more, whether it's through special packs, item such as the development of flavored whiskey category I think hits a sweet spot as it relates to convenience in terms of consumption. I think as it relates to price and volume trade-offs, I think, certainly the off-premise environment is a more price-sensitive channel then the on-premise one and so there's a number of attributes of the channels that you have to pay attention to as you see subtle. These have not been wholesale and dramatic shifts, they're much more subtle but if you study them over may be  3 or 5 or 7 years, they become more important than they do in any 1 quarter. So that's about all we have observed as it relates to the questions you were asking. We'll be paying close attention to it, though of course, as the months unfold and the realities of what's prognosticated actually come into play."

Because of all of the moving parts in our recent results related to disposition activity and foreign exchange moves as well as last quarter's change in how we present sales, we have posted a presentation to our website that details the topics we will cover in our prepared remarks for the second quarter and year-to-date results. Both the release and the presentation can be found on our website under the section titled Investors, Events & Presentations. 
In the press release, we have listed a number of the risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K, Form 8-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
During this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures and the reasons management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operations are contained in the press release. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jane for her prepared remarks."

As Jay mentioned, we posted slides to our website this morning that I will reference in my comments to help you walk through our 2 main areas of focus today, including first, our year-to-date results; and second, our full year outlook. After I complete my remarks, I'll turn the call over to Paul for his comments, and then we'll open it up for Q&A.
So let me start off by providing you with a brief summary of our highlights for our performance to date and outlook, which you will see on Slide 3, and then we'll dig into each of these areas in a bit more detail. 
First, as expected, our reported results through October continued to be negatively impacted by acquisitions and divestiture activity as well as FX headwinds. 
Second, we experienced a modest improvement in both our underlying top line and operating income results in the second quarter, although our top line growth was a bit less than we had expected. We'll walk you through some of the reasons for this in a moment.  
Third, we continue to experience operating leverage, driven primarily by a reduction in SG&A expense. 
And then finally, we reaffirmed our EPS guidance for the year at $1.71 to $1.81. 
Additionally, we lowered our outlook for underlying net sales and underlying operating income by roughly 1 point. We'll walk you through the reasons we believe our revised outlook is consistent with the trends in our business.
So with that, let me start by reviewing our recent results that are shown on Slide 4. Our second quarter underlying net sales growth of 3% accelerated modestly from the first quarter's 2% growth and resulted in first half underlying net sales growth of about 2.5%. Reported results in the first half declined 4% and were pulled down by: 3 points due to the impact of acquired and divested brands; 2 points due to adverse foreign exchange; and 1 point due to lower inventory levels. 
In the first half of this fiscal year, our underlying net sales growth was negatively impacted by 3 items: First, the timing of promotional activity in the United Kingdom as well as some customer buying patterns in Germany, which we expect will reverse over the balance of this fiscal year; second, the absence of discontinued agency brands in Mexico and the Czech Republic, which were in our first half results last year and will no longer impact comparisons going forward; and third, the drag caused by lower used barrel sales, which we expect to moderate in the back half of this fiscal year. So without these 3 items, we estimate our normalized underlying net sales growth for the first 6 months of the year was approximately 4%.
So let's break down our net sales in a little bit more detail. Looking at it geographically, you can see on pages -- Slide 5 and 6 that the United States was the strongest contributor, delivering over 5% growth during the first 6 months. Second quarter underlying net sales growth in the United States accelerated almost 2 points from the first quarter's rate of growth. Jack Daniel's Family of Brands grew 4% in the United States, driven by 3% depletion growth for Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and continued growth from Gentleman Jack and Tennessee Honey. Jack Daniel's Fire in the on-premise helped the brand return to growth during the quarter after cycling against tough launch comparisons from the first quarter of last year. Our premium bourbon, including Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, are continuing to grow nicely despite its acceleration in volumes that we anticipated after taking some sizable price increases that were further enforced through high-end positioning. And our tequila brand, el Jimador and Herradura, delivered another quarter of sustained double-digit growth in the United States.
Moving now to the emerging markets where second quarter underlying net sales growth of 3% improved 8 percentage points over the first quarter's decrease, resulting in a 1% decline in the first half. Our 2 largest emerging markets, Mexico and Poland, delivered robust results with underlying net sales growth of 18% and 11%, respectively. Mexico's gains were broad-based, with strong growth for New Mix, Herradura and Jack Daniel's. El Jimador grew underlying net sales volume the fourth consecutive year of price increases as we continued to reposition the brand to drive better margins and returns. Poland's growth was driven by strong gains for Jack Daniel's and improved Finlandia results. Russia, Brazil and Turkey declined at double-digit rate through the first half, as did China and Southeast Asia. 
Sluggish performance in many emerging markets are symptomatic of challenging economic conditions, not to mention the ripple effects that result from widespread currency devaluation. This includes the direct impact to our reported results in U.S. dollars as well as decline in consumer and trade purchasing power. For example, foreign exchange can create customer issues through decreased ability to hold inventories, margin pressures and increased levels of parallel trade. 
In developed markets outside the United States, underlying net sales grew 2% in the first half, but were flat in the quarter. Results in the United Kingdom were negatively impacted by the timing of some promotional activities for some large retailers from October into November and December. Germany's second quarter sales were negatively impacted by customer buying patterns. Year-to-date, underlying net sales growth of 2% would have been roughly 5% excluding these 2 items above and the removal of agency brands in the Czech Republic. Importantly, we expect these items to reverse over the balance of fiscal year.  
Finally, Global Travel Retail grew net sales on an underlying basis by 4% in the first half, helped by distribution gains and soft comparisons to last year.
Moving now to some additional color on our brands shown on Slide 7. Globally, Jack Daniel's Family of Brands delivered growth of 2%, led by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey and helped by Tennessee Honey, Tennessee Fire, Gentleman Jack and RTD. The Jack Daniel's 150 campaign is well under way and we expect incremental benefits over the balance of the year, including the Taste of Lynchburg commemorative bottles at 86 and 100 proof that rode into retail stores for the November and December holiday selling season. 
Our bourbon brands also continued on their growth trajectory. As consumers searched for high-quality spirits with heritage, we believe our leading bourbon brands will increasingly stand out against the wave of crafted drinks. We have some of the highest quality bourbons available in the market. And we believe the global potential for our bourbons remain largely untapped as we increasingly leverage the significant investments we have made behind the global growth of the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands, including route to consumer.
In our tequilas, the Herradura brand is enjoying the early stages of increasing consumer awareness and trial, driving solid double-digit gains for the trademark in both Mexico and the United States. We believe that the brand is a growing gem in our portfolio and one that will become an increasingly important contributor to our business given its high margins and significant opportunity to grow share. During the second quarter, we launched the brand's first ever global marketing campaign called Luck is Earned, leveraging the brand's name, as Herradura translates into horseshoe. This campaign illustrates the brand's history, heritage and leadership in tequila and brings it all to life through the consumers' stories. 
El Jimador had a similarly strong quarter, driving first half net sales growth of 9%. We believe that the brand's health has never been better as we capitalized on our success in building awareness in the on-premise to fuel off-premise sales in the United States and as we repositioned the brand in Mexico at a more premium level. 
Finlandia declined 4% during the first 6 months, with mid-single-digit growth in Poland, offset by continued pressure in the premium vodka categories in Russia. Sonoma-Cutrer and Korbel champagne delivered mid-single-digit and low double-digit growth, respectively.
Now, before I move down the income statement, let me spend a moment discussing our used barrel business, which has had a noteworthy impact on our first half results. Over the long term, we have found being vertically integrated benefits our company through quality control, cost efficiencies and supply stability for the new barrels we need to create our premium whiskey. Used barrels are the by-product from the organic growth of the American whiskey business. So as we have grown our whiskey business, we have been emptying more barrels. This has led to a growing revenue stream that peaked around 2% in fiscal 2016. Over the last year, barrel prices have declined more than 10%, which when combined with lower volumes due to softness in demand for blended Scotch, has negatively impacted our year-to-date underlying sales growth rate by nearly a point. 
Our reported margin declined 200 basis points in the first half of fiscal 2017, as illustrated on Slide 8. This decline is primarily due to the impact of A&D activity, which negatively impacted first half reported gross margin by 140 basis points and 60 basis points from adverse foreign exchange. We have also experienced some gross margin pressure from higher content costs, due in part to higher wood prices.
Moving on to operating costs shown on Slide 9. Underlying A&P increased 4% as we ramped up spend as we moved into the all-important OND period. First half underlying A&P is up 1%, down 10% reported. We expect our brand investments and activation will drive momentum over the holiday and into calendar 2017. 
On the SG&A front, we remain committed to a disciplined approach to controlling our cost. This, coupled with the absence of onetime items from last year, has allowed us to drive down underlying SG&A year-to-date by 3%, or 4% on a reported basis. This decline in SG&A helped fuel the 7% growth in underlying operating income in the first half of this fiscal year against last year's 9% underlying operating income growth comparison over the same period. 
Underlying operating income growth improved from 6% in the first quarter to 8% in the second quarter. Year-to-date reported operating income declined 5%, largely due to an absence of divested brands and foreign exchange headwinds, which is illustrated on Slide 4.
In aggregate, we delivered reported earnings per share of $0.50 in the second quarter, up 3% over the prior-year period, and $0.87 during the first 6 months of fiscal 2017, up 1%. Earnings per share was helped by a lower tax rate and lower share count.
So let me now move into my second topic and final topic for this morning: an update on our outlook for fiscal 2017, as shown on Slide 10. So after all the puts and takes over the last 6 months, we estimate that our portfolio delivered top line underlying growth on a normalized basis of approximately 4%. This is against strong 7% growth in the prior-year's first half, equating to almost 10% 2-year stacked growth. Fiscal 2016 underlying net sales comparisons eased in the back half of our fiscal year to 3% to 4%, which implies that we should be well on track to deliver 4% to 5% underlying net sales growth for the full year. For the details, we have provided an appendix in the back of the presentation that presents fiscal 2016 quarterly rates of growth, excluding the impact from A&D and net of excise taxes.
As we look at our revised full year outlook for fiscal 2017, we are encouraged by several other items. First, November depletions in Europe grew double digits, rebuilding -- rebounding nicely from October declines and validating the timing items we called out. In fact, the United Kingdom had its best volumetric month ever for Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey. 
Second, consumer takeaway trends for Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey remained solid in most major markets, helped in part by our continued focus behind the JD 150 plan. Value takeaway is up double digits in Germany and Mexico and mid-single digits in France. The United Kingdom's short-term trends have been impacted by the previously mentioned timing and promotional activity. The 12-month value takeaway is up mid-single digits. 
And finally, as we analyze the impact from slowing emerging markets growth shown on Slide 12, we believe that trends are improving at the same time that our comparisons are easing, particularly as we move into the fourth quarter.
We expect less reported gross margin erosion on a full year basis than what we have experienced to the first half of this fiscal year, as the easing in margin pressures from A&D activity is anticipated to be offset somewhat by higher content cost. The global pricing environment remains challenging. And while we expect to see modest benefits from price/mix for the fiscal year, they will not be sufficient to fully offset somewhat higher content cost.
On our operating cost, we will continue to invest in our brand portfolio, but we remain conservative until we see a more favorable near-term environment that warrants a more aggressive investment cost structure. We expect underlying SG&A to be roughly flat in the year and plan a modest increase in the back half. Operating leverage will help drive operating income growth of 6% to 8%.
Moving now to FX where assuming current spot rates, we expect adverse foreign exchange to be approximately $0.02 worse for the full year than we had anticipated on our first quarter call, equal to a $0.05 headwind in this year. When considering these expected FX headwinds, the underlying growth in our business and the benefit of a lower share count, our EPS outlook of $1.71 to $1.81 for the full year is unchanged, as we reaffirmed earlier today. As a sensitivity, assuming our foreign currency cash exposures collectively move 10% in either direction, EPS over the balance of the year would be impacted by roughly $0.04.
So in summary, our core brand portfolio continues to deliver healthy, sustained underlying rates of growth, with reported results under pressure from the combined effects of foreign exchange headwinds and our disposal of Southern Comfort and Tuaca last year. We believe that our revised underlying growth rates are both appropriate and achievable, given the business trends we have seen in the first half and what we expect in the second half of fiscal 2017. 
Given the macro deterioration and subsequent slowdown in our results in many emerging markets, we have been highly focused on cost discipline, which has largely offset the top line malaise and allowed us to continue delivering high single-digit growth in underlying operating income. 
Over the last year, we have made some portfolio enhancements that we believe better position Brown-Forman for the next decade of growth. Our portfolio is skewed to the fastest-growing categories with some of the best brands in the spirits industry. And we are nearing completion of the major capital expansion we began almost 5 years ago to prepare for the next decade of global growth of our underpenetrated brands.
Simply put, we remain bullish on our long-term growth prospects. Our ability to protect and grow our cash flow over time, combined with our balance sheet flexibility, has allowed us to continue to return significant capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. So even with our elevated capital investments over the last 5 years, we have returned $4 million to our shareholders since 2012 as we aim to consistently deliver top-tier returns over the long term.
So let me call -- turn the call over to Paul for his comments. Paul?"
256839,410674086,1098926,"Brown-Forman Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 07, 2016",2016-12-07,"Earnings Calls","Brown-Forman Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for dialing in, as always. As a supplement to Jane's remarks, I believe we had a pretty good first half, particularly in light of a handful of items that worked against our reported earnings. Let me",1072,"Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for dialing in, as always. As a supplement to Jane's remarks, I believe we had a pretty good first half, particularly in light of a handful of items that worked against our reported earnings. Let me reiterate those briefly.
First and foremost is the absence of sales and profits from the brands we sold late last fiscal year and, to a lesser extent, the loss of agency brands in a couple of countries that negatively impacted the first half. Following this were continued foreign exchange headwinds. A third item was the difficult first half comparison we had against last year's Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire launch in the United States, and this challenging comp was most prominent in our first quarter this year. Further, the sluggish conditions in several emerging markets continued, though as Jane did note, we did see a nice improvement from Q1 to Q2. And finally, lower sales and profits this year from our used barrel business, and we believe the most significant portion of this impact has already occurred in our first half. 
Despite these items, our underlying sales were still up 2.5% in the first half, and underlying operating income was up a solid 7%. And as Jane just shared with you, when we take the step of normalizing our underlying sales, we estimate the first half to be more like 4%.
In the absence of some of these first half headwinds, we are planning for a noteworthy uptick in our second half underlying sales growth. This would position us for full year underlying sales in the 4% to 5% range and underlying operating income growth in the 6% to 8% range, very nice underlying operating -- underlying growth against the current backdrop, in my view. And when we account for a little below-the-line help from interest expense, taxes and a reduced share count from our repurchase program, it adds up to us reaffirming today our full year earnings guidance.
Another important aspect of our current fiscal year is the work that we are doing today to position Brown-Forman for growth in 2020 and beyond. Looking back over the last 20 years, we have periodically taken actions or made investments that tempered near-term earnings in favor of sustaining or accelerating the company's growth over the long term. In the early to mid-1990s, 2 good examples of this would be strong our globalization push in the early '90s and the launch of the Woodford Reserve brand in distillery a couple of years later. In the mid-2000s, further examples were the sale of our consumer durables business, followed by the acquisition of Chambord and Casa Herradura. And later in 2011, we chose to sell our popular priced wine business and shift our focus to the introduction of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, a trademark line extension that today is Brown-Forman's second most important brand. 
The reason that I referenced these earlier trade-offs is because we believe that we are amidst such a time period yet again. Let me cite a couple of examples from the last year or 2. First, our strong capital investments of late are intended to expand production capacity or improve our brand home places, in some cases both, for Jack Daniel's, Woodford Reserve, Old Forester, Slane Irish whiskey and our cooperage operations. The depreciation costs are just now starting to make their way into our product costs. And we believe this will be a highly acceptable trade-off for the benefit of having sufficient future product supplies and authentic foundations for consumer and trade hospitality in the years ahead. 
Second, our recent disposition of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, paired with our acquisition of the GlenDronach, BenRiach and Glenglassaugh brands and distilleries once again traded a larger pool of current sales and profitability but with a declining sales trend for a currently smaller business, but one that we believe offers greater long-term growth potential, not unlike, say, the choice we made a decade ago to sell consumer durables and buy Casa Herradura. 
This fiscal year's reported results illustrate this trade-off visibly as the absence of Southern Comfort and Tuaca sales and profits are not offset by the profits of the smaller single malt brands, which are also temporarily depressed this year by the onetime costs of integrating them into Brown-Forman. I will also note that our decision not to reduce SG&A commensurate with the lost profitability of the disposed brands equates to a people investment we are making, as many of our frontline sales and marketing employees redirect their attention to the balance of our portfolio. And we believe this will benefit our brand development in the years ahead. 
One of the best pieces of evidence I can provide to these type of short-term trade-offs are good decisions long term for Brown-Forman can be found in the example of Woodford Reserve, which celebrated its 20th anniversary as a brand this year. As a result of our strong investments over the years behind the brand's distillery, its home place, its packaging and its lifestyle marketing, Woodford Reserve has grown steadily to become one of the leaders of the exciting and fast-growing super-premium bourbon category. In fact, I believe the brand's development over the last 2 decades made a meaningful contribution to the bourbon category's resurgence as a whole. In my view, Woodford epitomizes the quality, authenticity, flavor, hospitality and down-to-earth personality that today's consumers seeks from their high-end bourbon experience. Having surpassed the recent milestone of 500,000 cases, the brand is poised for excellent growth in the years ahead. And alongside Gentleman Jack and Sonoma-Cutrer, it serves as a superb reference point for other premium brands in Brown-Forman's portfolio that might be new to our company or still in relatively early stages of seizing the large opportunity in front of them. 
We aspire for brands like Old Forester, Herradura, GlenDronach, Coopers' Craft and our forthcoming Slane Irish whiskey to follow a similar path as the one Woodford has traveled over these last 20 years, and we are investing behind this aspiration accordingly. And at some point down the road, we will look forward to recalling this current time of investment as another important period for Brown-Forman that helped the company continue its historic combination of high margins, high returns on invested capital and strong and consistent growth.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now happy to take your questions."

If we don't get it fully, just repeat it, if you will. I think we've recognized the realities of this competitive landscape, I think you're referring to the United States here, for some time. I mean, it's been our experience that the largest companies and brands in the United States across most categories have -- obviously, they're typically a higher basis of existing business and volume, but they have been generally losing share of the U.S. market for some time, as a lot of these upstart brands and a lot of the newer brands that are being introduced to the market have grown, in some cases, rapidly from these small bases. We, of course, have had some of those ourselves. Just the brand I just referenced there, Woodford, would be such a nice example. But when you have brand leaders like in our case, like Jack Daniel's, you are absolutely exposed to that. And so I think in our case, for example, of the premium and ultra-premium bourbon business, we have not set an aspiration that Jack Daniel's would need to lead in terms of market share development of that category, just because it is far and away the largest brand and has -- I mean, you would expect brands like Woodford Reserve and even our own Gentleman Jack, et cetera, to grow at rates above Jack Daniel's. Now, having said that, we do strive, with the passage of time, to compete at typically the -- one of our internal reference points we look at a lot would be the growth of the brand at a net sales level that's consistent with the country's development overall. So look out for the TDS or premium TDS in some instances. So we have a lot of different categorical reference points. But the point you make is particularly prominent in the United States as it relates to just this onslaught of competition that's been introduced to the marketplace for the last 5 years where, as we say, we're well aware of it. I feel pretty good that the brands that have been more established in our portfolio have held up fairly well. Some of it has, of course, from just category momentum. Of course, the fact that bourbon has been growing. We, too, have observed, I think you referenced that maybe some of the more recent 3 and 6 months growth trends look a little softer than they were historically. We observed that as well, but they still remain, from our experience, well above historical. And actually, particularly in comparing them to some other countries around the world, they still seem very attractive."

I mean at this stage, we are very comfortable with the portfolio we have in tequila, as -- we sometimes, of course, refer to it as Casa Herradura. But remember, it includes predominantly, I mean in terms of our main focus, 2 trademarks, which is the Herradura tequila brand itself and then El Jimador. And then, of course, I'll just remind everybody, within each of those brands, one of the -- this is actually one of the great balancing acts anybody who owns a tequila brand undertakes is that you've got typically 3 expressions under each of those. And they range from -- it's really interesting to watch how they get categorized by various followers of the category, our competitors. Because we have a clear product under both the Herradura and El Jimador brand that is both -- in both cases, they've experienced very rapid growth particularly in the United States. And then of the -- and then aged version is called Añejo, and then in between is Reposado. So they -- and they actually have different competitor sets in some ways, we find, that, of course, the clear expressions compete more with maybe the vodka category or clear goods, white goods. And then the aged expressions can actually find as a competitive reference sometimes more the whiskeys and brown goods. So you have to look at those individually. I mean, our -- we -- I think it's safe to say these last 12 months or so have been perhaps the best experience we've had in the tequila business since we have owned Casa Herradura. It's really come in a couple of different ways now and the brand development on both of the trademarks in the United States, but also, their continued success down in Mexico. I think a really important aspect was the repositioning in terms of price for El Jimador down in that market. As the business, at the low price points that it was at, was not as attractive for an owner like Brown-Forman. So we felt it was important to -- even with lower volumes, to have higher prices. And we've been undertaking a program to do that now for several years. The Herradura business itself, partially down there as a result of some innovation with the brand Herradura Ultra, has allowed the brand to compete more effectively in Mexico. And then just its continued momentum in the U.S. market as I think super and ultra-premium tequilas continue to enjoy the same type of momentum that we've seen in super-premium bourbon. So as it relates to a forecasted -- any shortfalls in terms of supply, I haven't looked closely at that data in a while, but we don't currently have that impacting our business in any significant way."

We knew going into the year that pricing on the barrels were going to be down. And so we were aware of that. We also -- what we didn't anticipate was some phasing on the timing of the volume. And so that disproportionately hit our first half of our results. They didn't come in as we planned. What we've done now is we also, just for your information, we do annual negotiations in the falls [ph] of the year where we meet with our customers, and we know -- it's an annual negotiation, it begins January 1 through December of next year. So we already know directionally what the numbers will be, if you will, both for volumetrically and pricing-wise. So we've taken that in consideration, and that's where a lot of our comments are coming from. I will say the business itself is very cyclical. It's a very dynamic market. It didn't come through in my script. And the supply-demand dynamics are very, very -- I think for the rest of the year, we've got it pretty well honed in. But this is again a cyclical business, and we'll watch it as we go ahead into the future."

And as we get any kind of updated view related to the future years, we'll probably be doing more of that during our typical planning. And we'd provide that kind of update probably with our full year earnings back, I guess, in the spring of 2017. So the other question related to the flavors. And yes, I think you're -- your assumption was that are these comps kind of easing. And I think the reality is, yes. We felt like particularly -- first and foremost, we feel like Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey has been on a more regular pattern since its introduction. I mean it's been out there now 5 years plus. The Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire which had, in the United States, its national launch, at the tail end of FY '15, into the early part of FY '16, it created the most significant comparisons for us in our first quarter of this year. And so we definitely feel that they eased into the second quarter and will actually continue to ease as the year goes on. You're always building some form of distribution for these newer line extensions and products. But particularly for that one, it ramped up its distribution rather quick because there was some real pent-up demand for it. So we've been working against some of that initial distribution in trial in the earliest part of this fiscal year. I also think that the brand's continuing to, in some ways, build distribution in the United States to the on-premise. I mean, it's made its way into more points of distribution in the U.S. on-premise. And actually, its velocity looks pretty good from what we can tell. So I feel relatively good about the U.S. Jack Daniel's flavors we've got. The fact that we are not introducing another one and can focus our attention on these 2, particularly in the absence of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, which were also brands we were tending to in prior years, are nothing but a help in our ability to continue to grow those flavors. So I think we're implementing against -- pretty much against the strategy we would have outlined a year ago, which is to really focus on these 2, develop them, in the case of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, start the process and to be very disciplined about building its presence in international markets this year as well. And we think that might give us a little bit of help in the second half of this year, too."

Sure, I think it's  maybe doing a little bit of both, the way you pose that question. I do think there's no doubt that the infusion of a lot of new bourbon brands, or, I mean, frankly, you can see it across a bunch of categories. We're starting to see it, of course, in gin. You can see it in tequila. I mean, it's long happened in vodka, of course, as whoever the latest upstart for the recent decade was, took its, in some cases, position from the previous leading brand. But in this case, I think it is contributing. A lot of the entrepreneurs we're seeing, it's contributing to category interest. I think it most certainly then contributes to category trial and some of the volumes. And is that a source of competition? Of course. I mean, there's no way that it can't be when there's more available entrants. And so the way that it makes a company like us think about that is, first and foremost, try to understand what it is about the category and the brands that are coming in that people are finding interesting. And to the extent that our brands also possess, or, in some cases, may even have better attributes along those lines, make sure we're emphasizing them. And so something that's been undertaken at Brown-Forman here these last couple of years is to really emphasize the credentials of our American whiskey brands, and it starts, of course, with Jack Daniel's. And so if you're paying attention to everything from marketing communications to the quality with which we are preparing our home places, to packaging and messaging on packaging, all of that is intended to be contemporary to what people find interesting today about American whiskey and in bourbon. For people who are prone to not wanting an established brand versus something that's new and are just going to try it, I mean, there's not much we can do about being well known or having brand awareness. What we can do though is also offer some brands from Brown-Forman, as is the case with Coopers' Craft that are new to the world and, of course, tell them that story of why Coopers' Craft is, in my view, a perfectly suited entrant into this craft bourbon category today and how authentic the story is behind it as it pays tribute to the barrel making that is unique to Brown-Forman. And so we feel like we're trying to participate in a growing category in a variety of ways. And to date, I'd say we've been net beneficiaries of all this than we have been on the losing end of it. I mean we can cross-reference a bunch of categories, both inside and outside the beverage alcohol business, where that hasn't been the case. And so I think what we can do is put forward our best foot to meet actually the needs of what is creating this consumer interest, which, I think, are some of the elements I mentioned in my prepared remarks, which are things like authenticity and quality and, I mean, making sure the taste and flavor of your products meet their needs, hospitality is incredibly important in this equation. So we're just continuing to strengthen and emphasize those attributes. And so far, Coopers' Craft is doing pretty well. It's in a very limited amount of the U.S. geography only. Our internal reception from our own people, first and foremost, was very strong. And now we're just now getting in out into, which you would -- you recognize as a pretty competitive and crowded marketplace. But the fact that it comes from Brown-Forman and given our credibility in this category, gives it a leg up over many of these upstarts that are coming in from entrepreneurs."

The -- we are seeing some improving trends, as I noted, in the emerging markets. All emerging markets aren't created equal. So there's certain markets where we're investing and those that we won't. That was what I was referring to, so some of those areas. The U.S., we are investing nicely in. So it varies where -- where we will continue to invest is where the consumer is and where they're receptive to it. We would just be more thoughtful. I always remind people to, when we think about the line item of advertising, or when you look at that, we think about our investments well beyond that line item, including the SG&A line, which is the people on the street that builds the brands as well as the cost of our packaging and the value-added packs, which we have several out there right now as it relates to the 2 we were referring to from the Taste of Lynchburg for the JD 150 celebration.

And those investments could come in the form of -- oftentimes it comes in the form of route-to-consumer investments because we've found that that can have a very direct impact on the brand development. Some of these markets don't permit, in the same way that we're used to here, traditional advertising in some ways. We have sometimes referred to them as dark markets, et cetera.

Again, it's a month in, but what are you hearing qualitatively about the prospect for foot traffic and spend levels per ticket, so to speak, in restaurants?"

I mean, so in essence, it makes it more a hypothesis than a reality. I think some of the more, I'd say systemic things that relate to particularly our business, which is not the food part, of course, as much as it is the drink part of the restaurant business, I think I haven't heard anything that makes me change that, which is this aspect of going back now several, several years where consumers started to subtly shift their consumption occasions toward the off-premise more. And there seems to be more a millennial thing, the ability particularly to use social media to gather people effectively starting your own small bar on an evening if you want because it's so efficient to do so and the impact that this then has on suppliers and brands as you try to navigate the marketplace where the off-premise is growing faster than the on-premise. And so what are those dynamics? I actually think it'll be really interesting to see how, particularly one of the more recent developments that came out of this year's election cycle, which was continued momentum on the legalization of marijuana, that being an interesting development. Of course, it's something we've been monitoring. But what it -- just this would be, again, an anecdotal thing, the fact that that tends to be more of an off-premise consumption occasion, actually and to the extent that there's cross-category usage between marijuana and beverage alcohol, what does that do in terms of its impact on a brand or a supplier's approach to the business. I mean, it'd be -- I think that development will, if anything, add even greater momentum to the off-premise sales versus the on-premise sales. So these are all things that are kind of speculative, quite honestly. They're hypotheses that we are observing out there. We are monitoring them. I do think our organization has done a nice job on trying to cater to the off-premise occasion a bit more, whether it's through special packs, items such as -- like the development of flavored whiskey category I think hits a sweet spot as it relates to convenience in terms of consumption. I think as it relates to price and volume trade-offs, I think certainly the off-premise environment is a more price-sensitive channel than the on-premise one. And so there's a number of attributes of the channels that you have to pay attention to as you see subtle. These have not been wholesale and dramatic shifts; they're much more subtle but if you study them over maybe 3 or 5 or 7 years, they become more important than they do in any 1 quarter. So that's about all we have observed as it relates to the questions you were asking. We'll be paying close attention to it, though of course, as the months unfold and the realities of what's prognosticated actually come into play."

This morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements, whether due to new information, future events or otherwise. 
This morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Because of all of the moving parts in our recent results related to disposition activity and foreign exchange moves as well as last quarter's change in how we present sales, we have posted a presentation to our website that details the topics we will cover in our prepared remarks for the second quarter and year-to-date results. Both the release and the presentation can be found on our website under the section titled Investors, Events & Presentations. 
In the press release, we have listed a number of the risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K, Form 8-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
During this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures and the reasons management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operations are contained in the press release. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jane for her prepared remarks."

As Jay mentioned, we posted slides to our website this morning that I will reference in my comments to help you walk through our 2 main areas of focus today, including first, our year-to-date results; and second, our full year outlook. After I complete my remarks, I'll turn the call over to Paul for his comments, and then we'll open it up for Q&A.
So let me start off by providing you with a brief summary of our highlights for our performance to date and outlook, which you will see on Slide 3, and then we'll dig into each of these areas in a bit more detail. 
First, as expected, our reported results through October continued to be negatively impacted by acquisitions and divestiture activity as well as FX headwinds. 
Second, we experienced a modest improvement in both our underlying top line and operating income results in the second quarter, although our top line growth was a bit less than we had expected. We'll walk you through some of the reasons for this in a moment.  
Third, we continue to experience operating leverage, driven primarily by a reduction in SG&A expense. 
And then finally, we reaffirmed our EPS guidance for the year at $1.71 to $1.81. 
Additionally, we lowered our outlook for underlying net sales and underlying operating income by roughly 1 point. We'll walk you through the reasons we believe our revised outlook is consistent with the trends in our business.
So with that, let me start by reviewing our recent results that are shown on Slide 4. Our second quarter underlying net sales growth of 3% accelerated modestly from the first quarter's 2% growth and resulted in first half underlying net sales growth of about 2.5%. Reported results in the first half declined 4% and were pulled down by: 3 points due to the impact of acquired and divested brands; 2 points due to adverse foreign exchange; and 1 point due to lower inventory levels. 
In the first half of this fiscal year, our underlying net sales growth was negatively impacted by 3 items: First, the timing of promotional activity in the United Kingdom as well as some customer buying patterns in Germany, which we expect will reverse over the balance of this fiscal year; second, the absence of discontinued agency brands in Mexico and the Czech Republic, which were in our first half results last year and will no longer impact comparisons going forward; and third, the drag caused by lower used barrel sales, which we expect to moderate in the back half of this fiscal year. So without these 3 items, we estimate our normalized underlying net sales growth for the first 6 months of the year was approximately 4%.
So let's break down our net sales in a little bit more detail. Looking at it geographically, you can see on pages -- Slide 5 and 6 that the United States was the strongest contributor, delivering over 5% growth during the first 6 months. Second quarter underlying net sales growth in the United States accelerated almost 2 points from the first quarter's rate of growth. Jack Daniel's Family of Brands grew 4% in the United States, driven by 3% depletion growth for Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and continued growth from Gentleman Jack and Tennessee Honey. Jack Daniel's Fire strength in the on-premise helped the brand return to growth during the quarter after cycling against tough launch comparisons from the first quarter of last year. Our premium bourbon, including Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, are continuing to grow nicely despite its acceleration in volumes that we anticipated after taking some sizable price increases that were further enforced through high-end positioning. And our tequila brand, el Jimador and Herradura, delivered another quarter of sustained double-digit growth in the United States.
Moving now to the emerging markets where second quarter underlying net sales growth of 3% improved 8 percentage points over the first quarter's decrease, resulting in a 1% decline in the first half. Our 2 largest emerging markets, Mexico and Poland, delivered robust results with underlying net sales growth of 18% and 11%, respectively. Mexico's gains were broad-based, with strong growth for New Mix, Herradura and Jack Daniel's. El Jimador grew underlying net sales volume the fourth consecutive year of price increases as we continued to reposition the brand to drive better margins and returns. Poland's growth was driven by strong gains for Jack Daniel's and improved Finlandia results. Russia, Brazil and Turkey declined at double-digit rate through the first half, as did China and Southeast Asia. 
Sluggish performance in many emerging markets are symptomatic of challenging economic conditions, not to mention the ripple effects that result from widespread currency devaluation. This includes the direct impact to our reported results in U.S. dollars as well as decline in consumer and trade purchasing power. For example, foreign exchange can create customer issues through decreased ability to hold inventories, margin pressures and increased levels of parallel trade. 
In developed markets outside the United States, underlying net sales grew 2% in the first half, but were flat in the quarter. Results in the United Kingdom were negatively impacted by the timing of some promotional activities for some large retailers from October into November and December. Germany's second quarter sales were negatively impacted by customer buying patterns. Year-to-date, underlying net sales growth of 2% would have been roughly 5% excluding these 2 items above and the removal of agency brands in the Czech Republic. Importantly, we expect these items to reverse over the balance of fiscal year.  
Finally, Global Travel Retail grew net sales on an underlying basis by 4% in the first half, helped by distribution gains and soft comparisons to last year.
Moving now to some additional color on our brands shown on Slide 7. Globally, Jack Daniel's Family of Brands delivered growth of 2%, led by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey and helped by Tennessee Honey, Tennessee Fire, Gentleman Jack and RTD. The Jack Daniel's 150 campaign is well under way and we expect incremental benefits over the balance of the year, including the Taste of Lynchburg commemorative bottles at 86 and 100 proof that rode into retail stores for the November and December holiday selling season. 
Our bourbon brands also continued on their growth trajectory. As consumers searched for high-quality spirits with heritage, we believe our leading bourbon brands will increasingly stand out against the wave of crafted drinks. We have some of the highest quality bourbons available in the market. And we believe the global potential for our bourbons remain largely untapped as we increasingly leverage the significant investments we have made behind the global growth of the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands, including route to consumer.
In our tequilas, the Herradura brand is enjoying the early stages of increasing consumer awareness and trial, driving solid double-digit gains for the trademark in both Mexico and the United States. We believe that the brand is a growing gem in our portfolio and one that will become an increasingly important contributor to our business given its high margins and significant opportunity to grow share. During the second quarter, we launched the brand's first ever global marketing campaign called Luck is Earned, leveraging the brand's name, as Herradura translates into horseshoe. This campaign illustrates the brand's history, heritage and leadership in tequila and brings it all to life through the consumers' stories. 
El Jimador had a similarly strong quarter, driving first half net sales growth of 9%. We believe that the brand's health has never been better as we capitalized on our success in building awareness in the on-premise to fuel off-premise sales in the United States and as we repositioned the brand in Mexico at a more premium level. 
Finlandia declined 4% during the first 6 months, with mid-single-digit growth in Poland, offset by continued pressure in the premium vodka categories in Russia. Sonoma-Cutrer and Korbel champagne delivered mid-single-digit and low double-digit growth, respectively.
Now, before I move down the income statement, let me spend a moment discussing our used barrel business, which has had a noteworthy impact on our first half results. Over the long term, we have found being vertically integrated benefits our company through quality control, cost efficiencies and supply stability for the new barrels we need to create our premium whiskey. Used barrels are the by-product from the organic growth of the American whiskey business. So as we have grown our whiskey business, we have been emptying more barrels. This has led to a growing revenue stream that peaked around 2% in fiscal 2016. Over the last year, barrel prices have declined more than 10%, which when combined with lower volumes due to softness in demand for blended Scotch, has negatively impacted our year-to-date underlying sales growth rate by nearly a point. 
Our reported margin declined 200 basis points in the first half of fiscal 2017, as illustrated on Slide 8. This decline is primarily due to the impact of A&D activity, which negatively impacted first half reported gross margin by 140 basis points and 60 basis points from adverse foreign exchange. We have also experienced some gross margin pressure from higher content costs, due in part to higher wood prices.
Moving on to operating costs shown on Slide 9. Underlying A&P increased 4% as we ramped up spend as we moved into the all-important OND period. First half underlying A&P is up 1%, down 10% reported. We expect our brand investments and activation will drive momentum over the holiday and into calendar 2017. 
On the SG&A front, we remain committed to a disciplined approach to controlling our cost. This, coupled with the absence of onetime items from last year, has allowed us to drive down underlying SG&A year-to-date by 3%, or 4% on a reported basis. This decline in SG&A helped fuel the 7% growth in underlying operating income in the first half of this fiscal year against last year's 9% underlying operating income growth comparison over the same period. 
Underlying operating income growth improved from 6% in the first quarter to 8% in the second quarter. Year-to-date reported operating income declined 5%, largely due to an absence of divested brands and foreign exchange headwinds, which is illustrated on Slide 4.
In aggregate, we delivered reported earnings per share of $0.50 in the second quarter, up 3% over the prior-year period, and $0.87 during the first 6 months of fiscal 2017, up 1%. Earnings per share was helped by a lower tax rate and lower share count.
So let me now move into my second topic and final topic for this morning: an update on our outlook for fiscal 2017, as shown on Slide 10. So after all the puts and takes over the last 6 months, we estimate that our portfolio delivered top line underlying growth on a normalized basis of approximately 4%. This is against strong 7% growth in the prior-year's first half, equating to almost 10% 2-year stacked growth. Fiscal 2016 underlying net sales comparisons eased in the back half of our fiscal year to 3% to 4%, which implies that we should be well on track to deliver 4% to 5% underlying net sales growth for the full year. For the details, we have provided an appendix in the back of the presentation that presents fiscal 2016 quarterly rates of growth, excluding the impact from A&D and net of excise taxes.
As we look at our revised full year outlook for fiscal 2017, we are encouraged by several other items. First, November depletions in Europe grew double digits, rebuilding -- rebounding nicely from October declines and validating the timing items we called out. In fact, the United Kingdom had its best volumetric month ever for Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey. 
Second, consumer takeaway trends for Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey remained solid in most major markets, helped in part by our continued focus behind the JD 150 plan. Value takeaway is up double digits in Germany and Mexico and mid-single digits in France. The United Kingdom's short-term trends have been impacted by the previously mentioned timing and promotional activity. The 12-month value takeaway is up mid-single digits. 
And finally, as we analyze the impact from slowing emerging markets growth shown on Slide 12, we believe that trends are improving at the same time that our comparisons are easing, particularly as we move into the fourth quarter.
We expect less reported gross margin erosion on a full year basis than what we have experienced to the first half of this fiscal year, as the easing in margin pressures from A&D activity is anticipated to be offset somewhat by higher content cost. The global pricing environment remains challenging. And while we expect to see modest benefits from price/mix for the fiscal year, they will not be sufficient to fully offset somewhat higher content cost.
On our operating cost, we will continue to invest in our brand portfolio, but we remain conservative until we see a more favorable near-term environment that warrants a more aggressive investment cost structure. We expect underlying SG&A to be roughly flat in the year and plan a modest increase in the back half. Operating leverage will help drive operating income growth of 6% to 8%.
Moving now to FX where assuming current spot rates, we expect adverse foreign exchange to be approximately $0.02 worse for the full year than we had anticipated on our first quarter call, equal to a $0.05 headwind in this year. When considering these expected FX headwinds, the underlying growth in our business and the benefit of a lower share count, our EPS outlook of $1.71 to $1.81 for the full year is unchanged, as we reaffirmed earlier today. As a sensitivity, assuming our foreign currency cash exposures collectively move 10% in either direction, EPS over the balance of the year would be impacted by roughly $0.04.
So in summary, our core brand portfolio continues to deliver healthy, sustained underlying rates of growth, with reported results under pressure from the combined effects of foreign exchange headwinds and our disposal of Southern Comfort and Tuaca last year. We believe that our revised underlying growth rates are both appropriate and achievable, given the business trends we have seen in the first half and what we expect in the second half of fiscal 2017. 
Given the macro deterioration and subsequent slowdown in our results in many emerging markets, we have been highly focused on cost discipline, which has largely offset the top line malaise and allowed us to continue delivering high single-digit growth in underlying operating income. 
Over the last year, we have made some portfolio enhancements that we believe better position Brown-Forman for the next decade of growth. Our portfolio is skewed to the fastest-growing categories with some of the best brands in the spirits industry. And we are nearing completion of the major capital expansion we began almost 5 years ago to prepare for the next decade of global growth of our underpenetrated brands.
Simply put, we remain bullish on our long-term growth prospects. Our ability to protect and grow our cash flow over time, combined with our balance sheet flexibility, has allowed us to continue to return significant capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. So even with our elevated capital investments over the last 5 years, we have returned $4 million to our shareholders since 2012 as we aim to consistently deliver top-tier returns over the long term.
So let me call -- turn the call over to Paul for his comments. Paul?"

First and foremost is the absence of sales and profits from the brands we sold late last fiscal year and, to a lesser extent, the loss of agency brands in a couple of countries that negatively impacted the first half. Following this were continued foreign exchange headwinds. A third item was the difficult first half comparison we had against last year's Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire launch in the United States, and this challenging comp was most prominent in our first quarter this year. Further, the sluggish conditions in several emerging markets continued, though as Jane did note, we did see a nice improvement from Q1 to Q2. And finally, lower sales and profits this year from our used barrel business, and we believe the most significant portion of this impact has already occurred in our first half. 
Despite these items, our underlying sales were still up 2.5% in the first half, and underlying operating income was up a solid 7%. And as Jane just shared with you, when we take the step of normalizing our underlying sales, we estimate the first half to be more like 4%.
In the absence of some of these first half headwinds, we are planning for a noteworthy uptick in our second half underlying sales growth. This would position us for full year underlying sales in the 4% to 5% range and underlying operating income growth in the 6% to 8% range, very nice underlying operating -- underlying growth against the current backdrop, in my view. And when we account for a little below-the-line help from interest expense, taxes and a reduced share count from our repurchase program, it adds up to us reaffirming today our full year earnings guidance.
Another important aspect of our current fiscal year is the work that we are doing today to position Brown-Forman for growth in 2020 and beyond. Looking back over the last 20 years, we have periodically taken actions or made investments that tempered near-term earnings in favor of sustaining or accelerating the company's growth over the long term. In the early to mid-1990s, 2 good examples of this would be strong our globalization push in the early '90s and the launch of the Woodford Reserve brand in distillery a couple of years later. In the mid-2000s, further examples were the sale of our consumer durables business, followed by the acquisition of Chambord and Casa Herradura. And later in 2011, we chose to sell our popular priced wine business and shift our focus to the introduction of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, a trademark line extension that today is Brown-Forman's second most important brand. 
The reason that I referenced these earlier trade-offs is because we believe that we are amidst such a time period yet again. Let me cite a couple of examples from the last year or 2. First, our strong capital investments of late are intended to expand production capacity or improve our brand home places, in some cases both, for Jack Daniel's, Woodford Reserve, Old Forester, Slane Irish whiskey and our cooperage operations. The depreciation costs are just now starting to make their way into our product costs. And we believe this will be a highly acceptable trade-off for the benefit of having sufficient future product supplies and authentic foundations for consumer and trade hospitality in the years ahead. 
Second, our recent disposition of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, paired with our acquisition of the GlenDronach, BenRiach and Glenglassaugh brands and distilleries once again traded a larger pool of current sales and profitability but with a declining sales trend for a currently smaller business, but one that we believe offers greater long-term growth potential, not unlike, say, the choice we made a decade ago to sell consumer durables and buy Casa Herradura. 
This fiscal year's reported results illustrate this trade-off visibly as the absence of Southern Comfort and Tuaca sales and profits are not offset by the profits of the smaller single malt brands, which are also temporarily depressed this year by the onetime costs of integrating them into Brown-Forman. I will also note that our decision not to reduce SG&A commensurate with the lost profitability of the disposed brands equates to a people investment we are making, as many of our frontline sales and marketing employees redirect their attention to the balance of our portfolio. And we believe this will benefit our brand development in the years ahead. 
One of the best pieces of evidence I can provide to these type of short-term trade-offs are good decisions long term for Brown-Forman can be found in the example of Woodford Reserve, which celebrated its 20th anniversary as a brand this year. As a result of our strong investments over the years behind the brand's distillery, its home place, its packaging and its lifestyle marketing, Woodford Reserve has grown steadily to become one of the leaders of the exciting and fast-growing super-premium bourbon category. In fact, I believe the brand's development over the last 2 decades made a meaningful contribution to the bourbon category's resurgence as a whole. In my view, Woodford epitomizes the quality, authenticity, flavor, hospitality and down-to-earth personality that today's consumers seeks from their high-end bourbon experience. Having surpassed the recent milestone of 500,000 cases, the brand is poised for excellent growth in the years ahead. And alongside Gentleman Jack and Sonoma-Cutrer, it serves as a superb reference point for other premium brands in Brown-Forman's portfolio that might be new to our company or still in relatively early stages of seizing the large opportunity in front of them. 
We aspire for brands like Old Forester, Herradura, GlenDronach, Coopers' Craft and our forthcoming Slane Irish whiskey to follow a similar path as the one Woodford has traveled over these last 20 years, and we are investing behind this aspiration accordingly. And at some point down the road, we will look forward to recalling this current time of investment as another important period for Brown-Forman that helped the company continue its historic combination of high margins, high returns on invested capital and strong and consistent growth.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now happy to take your questions."

If we don't get it fully, just repeat it, if you will. I think we've recognized the realities of this competitive landscape, I think you're referring to the United States here, for some time. I mean, it's been our experience that the largest companies and brands in the United States across most categories have -- obviously, they're typically a higher basis of existing business and volume, but they have been generally losing share of the U.S. market for some time, as a lot of these upstart brands and a lot of the newer brands that are being introduced to the market have grown, in some cases, rapidly from these small bases. We, of course, have had some of those ourselves. Just the brand I just referenced there, Woodford, would be such a nice example. But when you have brand leaders like in our case, like Jack Daniel's, you are absolutely exposed to that. And so I think in our case, for example, of the premium and ultra-premium bourbon business, we have not set an aspiration that Jack Daniel's would need to lead in terms of market share development of that category, just because it is far and away the largest brand and has -- I mean, you would expect brands like Woodford Reserve and even our own Gentleman Jack, et cetera, to grow at rates above Jack Daniel's. Now, having said that, we do strive, with the passage of time, to compete at typically the -- one of our internal reference points we look at a lot would be the growth of the brand at a net sales level that's consistent with the country's development overall. So look out for the TDS or premium TDS in some instances. So we have a lot of different categorical reference points. But the point you make is particularly prominent in the United States as it relates to just this onslaught of competition that's been introduced to the marketplace for the last 5 years where, as we say, we're well aware of it. I feel pretty good that the brands that have been more established in our portfolio have held up fairly well. Some of it has, of course, from just category momentum. Of course, the fact that bourbon has been growing. We, too, have observed, I think you referenced that maybe some of the more recent 3 and 6 months growth trends look a little softer than they were historically. We observed that as well, but they still remain, from our experience, well above historical. And actually, particularly in comparing them to some other countries around the world, they still seem very attractive."

I mean at this stage, we are very comfortable with the portfolio we have in tequila, as -- we sometimes, of course, refer to it as Casa Herradura. But remember, it includes predominantly, I mean in terms of our main focus, 2 trademarks, which is the Herradura tequila brand itself and then El Jimador. And then, of course, I'll just remind everybody, within each of those brands, one of the -- this is actually one of the great balancing acts anybody who owns a tequila brand undertakes is that you've got typically 3 expressions under each of those. And they range from -- it's really interesting to watch how they get categorized by various followers of the category, our competitors. Because we have a clear product under both the Herradura and El Jimador brand that is both -- in both cases, they've experienced very rapid growth particularly in the United States. And then of the -- and then aged version is called Añejo, and then in between is Reposado. So they -- and they actually have different competitor sets in some ways, we find, that, of course, the clear expressions compete more with maybe the vodka category or clear goods, white goods. And then the aged expressions can actually find as a competitive reference sometimes more the whiskeys and brown goods. So you have to look at those individually. I mean, our -- we -- I think it's safe to say these last 12 months or so have been perhaps the best experience we've had in the tequila business since we have owned Casa Herradura. It's really come in a couple of different ways now and the brand development on both of the trademarks in the United States, but also, their continued success down in Mexico. I think a really important aspect was the repositioning in terms of price for El Jimador down in that market. As the business, at the low price points that it was at, was not as attractive for an owner like Brown-Forman. So we felt it was important to -- even with lower volumes, to have higher prices. And we've been undertaking a program to do that now for several years. The Herradura business itself, partially down there as a result of some innovation with the brand Herradura Ultra, has allowed the brand to compete more effectively in Mexico. And then just its continued momentum in the U.S. market as I think super and ultra-premium tequilas continue to enjoy the same type of momentum that we've seen in super-premium bourbon. So as it relates to a forecasted -- any shortfalls in terms of supply, I haven't looked closely at that data in a while, but we don't currently have that impacting our business in any significant way."

What we've done now is we also, just for your information, we do annual negotiations in the falls [ph] of the year where we meet with our customers, and we know -- it's an annual negotiation, it begins January 1 through December of next year. So we already know directionally what the numbers will be, if you will, both for volumetrically and pricing-wise. So we've taken that in consideration, and that's where a lot of our comments are coming from. I will say the business itself is very cyclical. It's a very dynamic market.

And we'd provide that kind of update probably with our full year earnings back, I guess, in the spring of 2017. So the other question related to the flavors. And yes, I think you're -- your assumption was that are these comps kind of easing. And I think the reality is, yes. We felt like particularly -- first and foremost, we feel like Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey has been on a more regular pattern since its introduction. I mean it's been out there now 5 years plus. The Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire which had, in the United States, its national launch, at the tail end of FY '15, into the early part of FY '16, it created the most significant comparisons for us in our first quarter of this year. And so we definitely feel that they eased into the second quarter and will actually continue to ease as the year goes on. You're always building some form of distribution for these newer line extensions and products. But particularly for that one, it ramped up its distribution rather quick because there was some real pent-up demand for it. So we've been working against some of that initial distribution in trial in the earliest part of this fiscal year. I also think that the brand's continuing to, in some ways, build distribution in the United States to the on-premise. I mean, it's made its way into more points of distribution in the U.S. on-premise. And actually, its velocity looks pretty good from what we can tell. So I feel relatively good about the U.S. Jack Daniel's flavors we've got. The fact that we are not introducing another one and can focus our attention on these 2, particularly in the absence of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, which were also brands we were tending to in prior years, are nothing but a help in our ability to continue to grow those flavors. So I think we're implementing against -- pretty much against the strategy we would have outlined a year ago, which is to really focus on these 2, develop them, in the case of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, start the process and to be very disciplined about building its presence in international markets this year as well. And we think that might give us a little bit of help in the second half of this year, too."

Sure, I think it's  maybe doing a little bit of both, the way you pose that question. I do think there's no doubt that the infusion of a lot of new bourbon brands, or, I mean, frankly, you can see it across a bunch of categories. We're starting to see it, of course, in gin. You can see it in tequila. I mean, it's long happened in vodka, of course, as whoever the latest upstart for the recent decade was, took its, in some cases, position from the previous leading brand. But in this case, I think it is contributing. A lot of the entrepreneurs we're seeing, it's contributing to category interest. I think it most certainly then contributes to category trial and some of the volumes. And is that a source of competition? Of course. I mean, there's no way that it can't be when there's more available entrants. And so the way that it makes a company like us think about that is, first and foremost, try to understand what it is about the category and the brands that are coming in that people are finding interesting. And to the extent that our brands also possess, or, in some cases, may even have better attributes along those lines, make sure we're emphasizing them. And so something that's been undertaken at Brown-Forman here these last couple of years is to really emphasize the credentials of our American whiskey brands, and it starts, of course, with Jack Daniel's. And so if you're paying attention to everything from marketing communications to the quality with which we are preparing our home places, to packaging and messaging on packaging, all of that is intended to be contemporary to what people find interesting today about American whiskey and in bourbon. For people who are prone to not wanting an established brand versus something that's new and are just going to try it, I mean, there's not much we can do about being well known or having brand awareness. What we can do though is also offer some brands from Brown-Forman, as is the case with Coopers' Craft that are new to the world and, of course, tell them that story of why Coopers' Craft is, in my view, a perfectly suited entrant into this craft bourbon category today and how authentic the story is behind it as it pays tribute to the barrel making that is unique to Brown-Forman. And so we feel like we're trying to participate in a growing category in a variety of ways. And to date, I'd say we've been net beneficiaries of all this than we have been on the losing end of it. I mean we can cross-reference a bunch of categories, both inside and outside the beverage alcohol business, where that hasn't been the case. And so I think what we can do is put forward our best foot to meet actually the needs of what is creating this consumer interest, which, I think, are some of the elements I mentioned in my prepared remarks, which are things like authenticity and quality and, I mean, making sure the taste and flavor of your products meet their needs, hospitality is incredibly important in this equation. So we're just continuing to strengthen and emphasize those attributes. And so far, Coopers' Craft is doing pretty well. It's in a very limited amount of the U.S. geography only. Our internal reception from our own people, first and foremost, was very strong. And now we're just now getting in out into, which you would -- you recognize as a pretty competitive and crowded marketplace. But the fact that it comes from Brown-Forman and given our credibility in this category, gives it a leg up over many of these upstarts that are coming in from entrepreneurs."

So it varies where -- where we will continue to invest is where the consumer is and where they're receptive to it. We would just be more thoughtful.

And so I do feel like that part of Jane's comment referred to a slightly longer period of time as well in terms of the way we move A&P, SG&A, and even from time to time investments in things like packaging between brands and regions of the world."

What I -- as I looked over the balance of the second half of the year, some of that improvement is not necessarily that it's growing like it used to, if you will. It's really going against soft comps from a year ago. So some of that improvement we expect as we look out is some of that as opposed to just overall growth rates that we were experiencing in Russia's and the places like that Paul was referring to a moment ago. So some of that, it's all the dynamics that go into just the comparison numbers."

Just because we're so still at a very early stage of development, particularly with Jack Daniel's, and many of them now talking of places like Africa and the Middle East, many of the emerging markets where we still have -- we might have a nice presence today and we built it but it's still on a relatively small scale versus the opportunity that's there. And those investments could come in the form of -- oftentimes it comes in the form of route-to-consumer investments because we've found that that can have a very direct impact on the brand development. Some of these markets don't permit, in the same way that we're used to here, traditional advertising in some ways. We have sometimes referred to them as dark markets, et cetera.

I mean, so in essence, it makes it more a hypothesis than a reality. I think some of the more, I'd say systemic things that relate to particularly our business, which is not the food part, of course, as much as it is the drink part of the restaurant business, I think I haven't heard anything that makes me change that, which is this aspect of going back now several, several years where consumers started to subtly shift their consumption occasions toward the off-premise more. And there seems to be more a millennial thing, the ability particularly to use social media to gather people effectively starting your own small bar on an evening if you want because it's so efficient to do so and the impact that this then has on suppliers and brands as you try to navigate the marketplace where the off-premise is growing faster than the on-premise. And so what are those dynamics? I actually think it'll be really interesting to see how, particularly one of the more recent developments that came out of this year's election cycle, which was continued momentum on the legalization of marijuana, that being an interesting development. Of course, it's something we've been monitoring. But what it -- just this would be, again, an anecdotal thing, the fact that that tends to be more of an off-premise consumption occasion, actually and to the extent that there's cross-category usage between marijuana and beverage alcohol, what does that do in terms of its impact on a brand or a supplier's approach to the business. I mean, it'd be -- I think that development will, if anything, add even greater momentum to the off-premise sales versus the on-premise sales. So these are all things that are kind of speculative, quite honestly. They're hypotheses that we are observing out there. We are monitoring them. I do think our organization has done a nice job on trying to cater to the off-premise occasion a bit more, whether it's through special packs, items such as -- like the development of flavored whiskey category I think hits a sweet spot as it relates to convenience in terms of consumption. I think as it relates to price and volume trade-offs, I think certainly the off-premise environment is a more price-sensitive channel than the on-premise one. And so there's a number of attributes of the channels that you have to pay attention to as you see subtle. These have not been wholesale and dramatic shifts; they're much more subtle but if you study them over maybe 3 or 5 or 7 years, they become more important than they do in any 1 quarter. So that's about all we have observed as it relates to the questions you were asking. We'll be paying close attention to it, though of course, as the months unfold and the realities of what's prognosticated actually come into play."

Both the release and the presentation can be found on our website under the section titled Investors, Events & Presentations. 
In the press release, we have listed a number of the risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K, Form 8-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
During this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures and the reasons management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and results of operations are contained in the press release. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jane for her prepared remarks."

As Jay mentioned, we posted slides to our website this morning that I will reference in my comments to help you walk through our 2 main areas of focus today, including first, our year-to-date results; and second, our full year outlook. After I complete my remarks, I'll turn the call over to Paul for his comments, and then we'll open it up for Q&A.
So let me start off by providing you with a brief summary of our highlights for our performance to date and outlook, which you will see on Slide 3, and then we'll dig into each of these areas in a bit more detail. 
First, as expected, our reported results through October continued to be negatively impacted by acquisitions and divestiture activity as well as FX headwinds. 
Second, we experienced a modest improvement in both our underlying top line and operating income results in the second quarter, although our top line growth was a bit less than we had expected. We'll walk you through some of the reasons for this in a moment.  
Third, we continue to experience operating leverage, driven primarily by a reduction in SG&A expense. 
And then finally, we reaffirmed our EPS guidance for the year at $1.71 to $1.81. 
Additionally, we lowered our outlook for underlying net sales and underlying operating income by roughly 1 point. We'll walk you through the reasons we believe our revised outlook is consistent with the trends in our business.
So with that, let me start by reviewing our recent results that are shown on Slide 4. Our second quarter underlying net sales growth of 3% accelerated modestly from the first quarter's 2% growth and resulted in first half underlying net sales growth of about 2.5%. Reported results in the first half declined 4% and were pulled down by: 3 points due to the impact of acquired and divested brands; 2 points due to adverse foreign exchange; and 1 point due to lower inventory levels. 
In the first half of this fiscal year, our underlying net sales growth was negatively impacted by 3 items: First, the timing of promotional activity in the United Kingdom as well as some customer buying patterns in Germany, which we expect will reverse over the balance of this fiscal year; second, the absence of discontinued agency brands in Mexico and the Czech Republic, which were in our first half results last year and will no longer impact comparisons going forward; and third, the drag caused by lower used barrel sales, which we expect to moderate in the back half of this fiscal year. So without these 3 items, we estimate our normalized underlying net sales growth for the first 6 months of the year was approximately 4%.
So let's break down our net sales in a little bit more detail. Looking at it geographically, you can see on pages -- Slide 5 and 6 that the United States was the strongest contributor, delivering over 5% growth during the first 6 months. Second quarter underlying net sales growth in the United States accelerated almost 2 points from the first quarter's rate of growth. Jack Daniel's Family of Brands grew 4% in the United States, driven by 3% depletion growth for Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and continued growth from Gentleman Jack and Tennessee Honey. Jack Daniel's Fire strength in the on-premise helped the brand return to growth during the quarter after cycling against tough launch comparisons from the first quarter of last year. Our premium bourbon, including Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, are continuing to grow nicely despite its acceleration in volumes that we anticipated after taking some sizable price increases that were further enforced through high-end positioning. And our tequila brand, el Jimador and Herradura, delivered another quarter of sustained double-digit growth in the United States.
Moving now to the emerging markets where second quarter underlying net sales growth of 3% improved 8 percentage points over the first quarter's decrease, resulting in a 1% decline in the first half. Our 2 largest emerging markets, Mexico and Poland, delivered robust results with underlying net sales growth of 18% and 11%, respectively. Mexico's gains were broad-based, with strong growth for New Mix, Herradura and Jack Daniel's. El Jimador grew underlying net sales volume the fourth consecutive year of price increases as we continued to reposition the brand to drive better margins and returns. Poland's growth was driven by strong gains for Jack Daniel's and improved Finlandia results. Russia, Brazil and Turkey declined at double-digit rate through the first half, as did China and Southeast Asia. 
Sluggish performance in many emerging markets are symptomatic of challenging economic conditions, not to mention the ripple effects that result from widespread currency devaluation. This includes the direct impact to our reported results in U.S. dollars as well as decline in consumer and trade purchasing power. For example, foreign exchange can create customer issues through decreased ability to hold inventories, margin pressures and increased levels of parallel trade. 
In developed markets outside the United States, underlying net sales grew 2% in the first half, but were flat in the quarter. Results in the United Kingdom were negatively impacted by the timing of some promotional activities for some large retailers from October into November and December. Germany's second quarter sales were negatively impacted by customer buying patterns. Year-to-date, underlying net sales growth of 2% would have been roughly 5% excluding these 2 items above and the removal of agency brands in the Czech Republic. Importantly, we expect these items to reverse over the balance of fiscal year.  
Finally, Global Travel Retail grew net sales on an underlying basis by 4% in the first half, helped by distribution gains and soft comparisons to last year.
Moving now to some additional color on our brands shown on Slide 7. Globally, Jack Daniel's Family of Brands delivered growth of 2%, led by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey and helped by Tennessee Honey, Tennessee Fire, Gentleman Jack and RTD. The Jack Daniel's 150 campaign is well under way and we expect incremental benefits over the balance of the year, including the Taste of Lynchburg commemorative bottles at 86 and 100 proof that rode into retail stores for the November and December holiday selling season. 
Our bourbon brands also continued on their growth trajectory. As consumers searched for high-quality spirits with heritage, we believe our leading bourbon brands will increasingly stand out against the wave of crafted drinks. We have some of the highest quality bourbons available in the market. And we believe the global potential for our bourbons remain largely untapped as we increasingly leverage the significant investments we have made behind the global growth of the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands, including route to consumer.
In our tequilas, the Herradura brand is enjoying the early stages of increasing consumer awareness and trial, driving solid double-digit gains for the trademark in both Mexico and the United States. We believe that the brand is a growing gem in our portfolio and one that will become an increasingly important contributor to our business given its high margins and significant opportunity to grow share. During the second quarter, we launched the brand's first ever global marketing campaign called Luck is Earned, leveraging the brand's name, as Herradura translates into horseshoe. This campaign illustrates the brand's history, heritage and leadership in tequila and brings it all to life through the consumers' stories. 
El Jimador had a similarly strong quarter, driving first half net sales growth of 9%. We believe that the brand's health has never been better as we capitalized on our success in building awareness in the on-premise to fuel off-premise sales in the United States and as we repositioned the brand in Mexico at a more premium level. 
Finlandia declined 4% during the first 6 months, with mid-single-digit growth in Poland, offset by continued pressure in the premium vodka categories in Russia. Sonoma-Cutrer and Korbel champagne delivered mid-single-digit and low double-digit growth, respectively.
Now, before I move down the income statement, let me spend a moment discussing our used barrel business, which has had a noteworthy impact on our first half results. Over the long term, we have found being vertically integrated benefits our company through quality control, cost efficiencies and supply stability for the new barrels we need to create our premium whiskey. Used barrels are the by-product from the organic growth of the American whiskey business. So as we have grown our whiskey business, we have been emptying more barrels. This has led to a growing revenue stream that peaked around 2% in fiscal 2016. Over the last year, barrel prices have declined more than 10%, which when combined with lower volumes due to softness in demand for blended Scotch, has negatively impacted our year-to-date underlying sales growth rate by nearly a point. 
Our reported margin declined 200 basis points in the first half of fiscal 2017, as illustrated on Slide 8. This decline is primarily due to the impact of A&D activity, which negatively impacted first half reported gross margin by 140 basis points and 60 basis points from adverse foreign exchange. We have also experienced some gross margin pressure from higher content costs, due in part to higher wood prices.
Moving on to operating costs shown on Slide 9. Underlying A&P increased 4% as we ramped up spend as we moved into the all-important OND period. First half underlying A&P is up 1%, down 10% reported. We expect our brand investments and activation will drive momentum over the holiday and into calendar 2017. 
On the SG&A front, we remain committed to a disciplined approach to controlling our cost. This, coupled with the absence of onetime items from last year, has allowed us to drive down underlying SG&A year-to-date by 3%, or 4% on a reported basis. This decline in SG&A helped fuel the 7% growth in underlying operating income in the first half of this fiscal year against last year's 9% underlying operating income growth comparison over the same period. 
Underlying operating income growth improved from 6% in the first quarter to 8% in the second quarter. Year-to-date reported operating income declined 5%, largely due to an absence of divested brands and foreign exchange headwinds, which is illustrated on Slide 4.
In aggregate, we delivered reported earnings per share of $0.50 in the second quarter, up 3% over the prior-year period, and $0.87 during the first 6 months of fiscal 2017, up 1%. Earnings per share was helped by a lower tax rate and lower share count.
So let me now move into my second topic and final topic for this morning: an update on our outlook for fiscal 2017, as shown on Slide 10. So after all the puts and takes over the last 6 months, we estimate that our portfolio delivered top line underlying growth on a normalized basis of approximately 4%. This is against strong 7% growth in the prior-year's first half, equating to almost 10% 2-year stacked growth. Fiscal 2016 underlying net sales comparisons eased in the back half of our fiscal year to 3% to 4%, which implies that we should be well on track to deliver 4% to 5% underlying net sales growth for the full year. For the details, we have provided an appendix in the back of the presentation that presents fiscal 2016 quarterly rates of growth, excluding the impact from A&D and net of excise taxes.
As we look at our revised full year outlook for fiscal 2017, we are encouraged by several other items. First, November depletions in Europe grew double digits, rebuilding -- rebounding nicely from October declines and validating the timing items we called out. In fact, the United Kingdom had its best volumetric month ever for Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey. 
Second, consumer takeaway trends for Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey remained solid in most major markets, helped in part by our continued focus behind the JD 150 plan. Value takeaway is up double digits in Germany and Mexico and mid-single digits in France. The United Kingdom's short-term trends have been impacted by the previously mentioned timing and promotional activity. The 12-month value takeaway is up mid-single digits. 
And finally, as we analyze the impact from slowing emerging markets growth shown on Slide 12, we believe that trends are improving at the same time that our comparisons are easing, particularly as we move into the fourth quarter.
We expect less reported gross margin erosion on a full year basis than what we have experienced to the first half of this fiscal year, as the easing in margin pressures from A&D activity is anticipated to be offset somewhat by higher content cost. The global pricing environment remains challenging. And while we expect to see modest benefits from price/mix for the fiscal year, they will not be sufficient to fully offset somewhat higher content cost.
On our operating cost, we will continue to invest in our brand portfolio, but we remain conservative until we see a more favorable near-term environment that warrants a more aggressive investment cost structure. We expect underlying SG&A to be roughly flat in the year and plan a modest increase in the back half. Operating leverage will help drive operating income growth of 6% to 8%.
Moving now to FX where assuming current spot rates, we expect adverse foreign exchange to be approximately $0.02 worse for the full year than we had anticipated on our first quarter call, equal to a $0.05 headwind in this year. When considering these expected FX headwinds, the underlying growth in our business and the benefit of a lower share count, our EPS outlook of $1.71 to $1.81 for the full year is unchanged, as we reaffirmed earlier today. As a sensitivity, assuming our foreign currency cash exposures collectively move 10% in either direction, EPS over the balance of the year would be impacted by roughly $0.04.
So in summary, our core brand portfolio continues to deliver healthy, sustained underlying rates of growth, with reported results under pressure from the combined effects of foreign exchange headwinds and our disposal of Southern Comfort and Tuaca last year. We believe that our revised underlying growth rates are both appropriate and achievable, given the business trends we have seen in the first half and what we expect in the second half of fiscal 2017. 
Given the macro deterioration and subsequent slowdown in our results in many emerging markets, we have been highly focused on cost discipline, which has largely offset the top line malaise and allowed us to continue delivering high single-digit growth in underlying operating income. 
Over the last year, we have made some portfolio enhancements that we believe better position Brown-Forman for the next decade of growth. Our portfolio is skewed to the fastest-growing categories with some of the best brands in the spirits industry. And we are nearing completion of the major capital expansion we began almost 5 years ago to prepare for the next decade of global growth of our underpenetrated brands.
Simply put, we remain bullish on our long-term growth prospects. Our ability to protect and grow our cash flow over time, combined with our balance sheet flexibility, has allowed us to continue to return significant capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. So even with our elevated capital investments over the last 5 years, we have returned $4 million to our shareholders since 2012 as we aim to consistently deliver top-tier returns over the long term.
So let me call -- turn the call over to Paul for his comments. Paul?"
256839,410674086,1099782,"Brown-Forman Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 07, 2016",2016-12-07,"Earnings Calls","Brown-Forman Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for dialing in, as always. As a supplement to Jane's remarks, I believe we had a pretty good first half, particularly in light of a handful of items that worked against our reported earnings. Let me",1072,"Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for dialing in, as always. As a supplement to Jane's remarks, I believe we had a pretty good first half, particularly in light of a handful of items that worked against our reported earnings. Let me reiterate those briefly.
First and foremost is the absence of sales and profits from the brands we sold late last fiscal year and, to a lesser extent, the loss of agency brands in a couple of countries that negatively impacted the first half. Following this were continued foreign exchange headwinds. A third item was the difficult first half comparison we had against last year's Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire launch in the United States, and this challenging comp was most prominent in our first quarter this year. Further, the sluggish conditions in several emerging markets continued, though as Jane did note, we did see a nice improvement from Q1 to Q2. And finally, lower sales and profits this year from our used barrel business, and we believe the most significant portion of this impact has already occurred in our first half. 
Despite these items, our underlying sales were still up 2.5% in the first half, and underlying operating income was up a solid 7%. And as Jane just shared with you, when we take the step of normalizing our underlying sales, we estimate the first half to be more like 4%.
In the absence of some of these first half headwinds, we are planning for a noteworthy uptick in our second half underlying sales growth. This would position us for full year underlying sales in the 4% to 5% range and underlying operating income growth in the 6% to 8% range, very nice underlying operating -- underlying growth against the current backdrop, in my view. And when we account for a little below-the-line help from interest expense, taxes and a reduced share count from our repurchase program, it adds up to us reaffirming today our full year earnings guidance.
Another important aspect of our current fiscal year is the work that we are doing today to position Brown-Forman for growth in 2020 and beyond. Looking back over the last 20 years, we have periodically taken actions or made investments that tempered near-term earnings in favor of sustaining or accelerating the company's growth over the long term. In the early to mid-1990s, 2 good examples of this would be strong our globalization push in the early '90s and the launch of the Woodford Reserve brand in distillery a couple of years later. In the mid-2000s, further examples were the sale of our consumer durables business, followed by the acquisition of Chambord and Casa Herradura. And later in 2011, we chose to sell our popular priced wine business and shift our focus to the introduction of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, a trademark line extension that today is Brown-Forman's second most important brand. 
The reason that I referenced these earlier trade-offs is because we believe that we are amidst such a time period yet again. Let me cite a couple of examples from the last year or 2. First, our strong capital investments of late are intended to expand production capacity or improve our brand home places, in some cases both, for Jack Daniel's, Woodford Reserve, Old Forester, Slane Irish whiskey and our cooperage operations. The depreciation costs are just now starting to make their way into our product costs. And we believe this will be a highly acceptable trade-off for the benefit of having sufficient future product supplies and authentic foundations for consumer and trade hospitality in the years ahead. 
Second, our recent disposition of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, paired with our acquisition of the GlenDronach, BenRiach and Glenglassaugh brands and distilleries once again traded a larger pool of current sales and profitability but with a declining sales trend for a currently smaller business, but one that we believe offers greater long-term growth potential, not unlike, say, the choice we made a decade ago to sell consumer durables and buy Casa Herradura. 
This fiscal year's reported results illustrate this trade-off visibly as the absence of Southern Comfort and Tuaca sales and profits are not offset by the profits of the smaller single malt brands, which are also temporarily depressed this year by the onetime costs of integrating them into Brown-Forman. I will also note that our decision not to reduce SG&A commensurate with the lost profitability of the disposed brands equates to a people investment we are making, as many of our frontline sales and marketing employees redirect their attention to the balance of our portfolio. And we believe this will benefit our brand development in the years ahead. 
One of the best pieces of evidence I can provide to these type of short-term trade-offs are good decisions long term for Brown-Forman can be found in the example of Woodford Reserve, which celebrated its 20th anniversary as a brand this year. As a result of our strong investments over the years behind the brand's distillery, its home place, its packaging and its lifestyle marketing, Woodford Reserve has grown steadily to become one of the leaders of the exciting and fast-growing super-premium bourbon category. In fact, I believe the brand's development over the last 2 decades made a meaningful contribution to the bourbon category's resurgence as a whole. In my view, Woodford epitomizes the quality, authenticity, flavor, hospitality and down-to-earth personality that today's consumers seeks from their high-end bourbon experience. Having surpassed the recent milestone of 500,000 cases, the brand is poised for excellent growth in the years ahead. And alongside Gentleman Jack and Sonoma-Cutrer, it serves as a superb reference point for other premium brands in Brown-Forman's portfolio that might be new to our company or still in relatively early stages of seizing the large opportunity in front of them. 
We aspire for brands like Old Forester, Herradura, GlenDronach, Coopers' Craft and our forthcoming Slane Irish whiskey to follow a similar path as the one Woodford has traveled over these last 20 years, and we are investing behind this aspiration accordingly. And at some point down the road, we will look forward to recalling this current time of investment as another important period for Brown-Forman that helped the company continue its historic combination of high margins, high returns on invested capital and strong and consistent growth.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now happy to take your questions."

If we don't get it fully, just repeat it, if you will. I think we've recognized the realities of this competitive landscape, I think you're referring to the United States here, for some time. I mean, it's been our experience that the largest companies and brands in the United States across most categories have -- obviously, they're typically a higher basis of existing business and volume, but they have been generally losing share of the U.S. market for some time, as a lot of these upstart brands and a lot of the newer brands that are being introduced to the market have grown, in some cases, rapidly from these small bases. We, of course, have had some of those ourselves. Just the brand I just referenced there, Woodford, would be such a nice example. But when you have brand leaders like in our case, like Jack Daniel's, you are absolutely exposed to that. And so I think in our case, for example, of the premium and ultra-premium bourbon business, we have not set an aspiration that Jack Daniel's would need to lead in terms of market share development of that category, just because it is far and away the largest brand and has -- I mean, you would expect brands like Woodford Reserve and even our own Gentleman Jack, et cetera, to grow at rates above Jack Daniel's. Now, having said that, we do strive, with the passage of time, to compete at typically the -- one of our internal reference points we look at a lot would be the growth of the brand at a net sales level that's consistent with the country's development overall. So look out for the TDS or premium TDS in some instances. So we have a lot of different categorical reference points. But the point you make is particularly prominent in the United States as it relates to just this onslaught of competition that's been introduced to the marketplace for the last 5 years where, as we say, we're well aware of it. I feel pretty good that the brands that have been more established in our portfolio have held up fairly well. Some of it has, of course, from just category momentum. Of course, the fact that bourbon has been growing. We, too, have observed, I think you referenced that maybe some of the more recent 3 and 6 months growth trends look a little softer than they were historically. We observed that as well, but they still remain, from our experience, well above historical. And actually, particularly in comparing them to some other countries around the world, they still seem very attractive."

I mean at this stage, we are very comfortable with the portfolio we have in tequila, as -- we sometimes, of course, refer to it as Casa Herradura. But remember, it includes predominantly, I mean in terms of our main focus, 2 trademarks, which is the Herradura tequila brand itself and then El Jimador. And then, of course, I'll just remind everybody, within each of those brands, one of the -- this is actually one of the great balancing acts anybody who owns a tequila brand undertakes is that you've got typically 3 expressions under each of those. And they range from -- it's really interesting to watch how they get categorized by various followers of the category, our competitors. Because we have a clear product under both the Herradura and El Jimador brand that is both -- in both cases, they've experienced very rapid growth particularly in the United States. And then of the -- and then aged version is called Añejo, and then in between is Reposado. So they -- and they actually have different competitor sets in some ways, we find, that, of course, the clear expressions compete more with maybe the vodka category or clear goods, white goods. And then the aged expressions can actually find as a competitive reference sometimes more the whiskeys and brown goods. So you have to look at those individually. I mean, our -- we -- I think it's safe to say these last 12 months or so have been perhaps the best experience we've had in the tequila business since we have owned Casa Herradura. It's really come in a couple of different ways now and the brand development on both of the trademarks in the United States, but also, their continued success down in Mexico. I think a really important aspect was the repositioning in terms of price for El Jimador down in that market. As the business, at the low price points that it was at, was not as attractive for an owner like Brown-Forman. So we felt it was important to -- even with lower volumes, to have higher prices. And we've been undertaking a program to do that now for several years. The Herradura business itself, partially down there as a result of some innovation with the brand Herradura Ultra, has allowed the brand to compete more effectively in Mexico. And then just its continued momentum in the U.S. market as I think super and ultra-premium tequilas continue to enjoy the same type of momentum that we've seen in super-premium bourbon. So as it relates to a forecasted -- any shortfalls in terms of supply, I haven't looked closely at that data in a while, but we don't currently have that impacting our business in any significant way."

We knew going into the year that pricing on the barrels were going to be down. And so we were aware of that. We also -- what we didn't anticipate was some phasing on the timing of the volume. And so that disproportionately hit our first half of our results. They didn't come in as we planned. What we've done now is we also, just for your information, we do annual negotiations in the falls [ph] of the year where we meet with our customers, and we know -- it's an annual negotiation, it begins January 1 through December of next year. So we already know directionally what the numbers will be, if you will, both for volumetrically and pricing-wise. So we've taken that in consideration, and that's where a lot of our comments are coming from. I will say the business itself is very cyclical. It's a very dynamic market. It didn't come through in my script. And the supply-demand dynamics are very, very -- I think for the rest of the year, we've got it pretty well honed in. But this is again a cyclical business, and we'll watch it as we go ahead into the future."

And as we get any kind of updated view related to the future years, we'll probably be doing more of that during our typical planning. And we'd provide that kind of update probably with our full year earnings back, I guess, in the spring of 2017. So the other question related to the flavors. And yes, I think you're -- your assumption was that are these comps kind of easing. And I think the reality is, yes. We felt like particularly -- first and foremost, we feel like Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey has been on a more regular pattern since its introduction. I mean it's been out there now 5 years plus. The Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire which had, in the United States, its national launch, at the tail end of FY '15, into the early part of FY '16, it created the most significant comparisons for us in our first quarter of this year. And so we definitely feel that they eased into the second quarter and will actually continue to ease as the year goes on. You're always building some form of distribution for these newer line extensions and products. But particularly for that one, it ramped up its distribution rather quick because there was some real pent-up demand for it. So we've been working against some of that initial distribution in trial in the earliest part of this fiscal year. I also think that the brand's continuing to, in some ways, build distribution in the United States to the on-premise. I mean, it's made its way into more points of distribution in the U.S. on-premise. And actually, its velocity looks pretty good from what we can tell. So I feel relatively good about the U.S. Jack Daniel's flavors we've got. The fact that we are not introducing another one and can focus our attention on these 2, particularly in the absence of Southern Comfort and Tuaca, which were also brands we were tending to in prior years, are nothing but a help in our ability to continue to grow those flavors. So I think we're implementing against -- pretty much against the strategy we would have outlined a year ago, which is to really focus on these 2, develop them, in the case of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, start the process and to be very disciplined about building its presence in international markets this year as well. And we think that might give us a little bit of help in the second half of this year, too."

Sure, I think it's  maybe doing a little bit of both, the way you pose that question. I do think there's no doubt that the infusion of a lot of new bourbon brands, or, I mean, frankly, you can see it across a bunch of categories. We're starting to see it, of course, in gin. You can see it in tequila. I mean, it's long happened in vodka, of course, as whoever the latest upstart for the recent decade was, took its, in some cases, position from the previous leading brand. But in this case, I think it is contributing. A lot of the entrepreneurs we're seeing, it's contributing to category interest. I think it most certainly then contributes to category trial and some of the volumes. And is that a source of competition? Of course. I mean, there's no way that it can't be when there's more available entrants. And so the way that it makes a company like us think about that is, first and foremost, try to understand what it is about the category and the brands that are coming in that people are finding interesting. And to the extent that our brands also possess, or, in some cases, may even have better attributes along those lines, make sure we're emphasizing them. And so something that's been undertaken at Brown-Forman here these last couple of years is to really emphasize the credentials of our American whiskey brands, and it starts, of course, with Jack Daniel's. And so if you're paying attention to everything from marketing communications to the quality with which we are preparing our home places, to packaging and messaging on packaging, all of that is intended to be contemporary to what people find interesting today about American whiskey and in bourbon. For people who are prone to not wanting an established brand versus something that's new and are just going to try it, I mean, there's not much we can do about being well known or having brand awareness. What we can do though is also offer some brands from Brown-Forman, as is the case with Coopers' Craft that are new to the world and, of course, tell them that story of why Coopers' Craft is, in my view, a perfectly suited entrant into this craft bourbon category today and how authentic the story is behind it as it pays tribute to the barrel making that is unique to Brown-Forman. And so we feel like we're trying to participate in a growing category in a variety of ways. And to date, I'd say we've been net beneficiaries of all this than we have been on the losing end of it. I mean we can cross-reference a bunch of categories, both inside and outside the beverage alcohol business, where that hasn't been the case. And so I think what we can do is put forward our best foot to meet actually the needs of what is creating this consumer interest, which, I think, are some of the elements I mentioned in my prepared remarks, which are things like authenticity and quality and, I mean, making sure the taste and flavor of your products meet their needs, hospitality is incredibly important in this equation. So we're just continuing to strengthen and emphasize those attributes. And so far, Coopers' Craft is doing pretty well. It's in a very limited amount of the U.S. geography only. Our internal reception from our own people, first and foremost, was very strong. And now we're just now getting in out into, which you would -- you recognize as a pretty competitive and crowded marketplace. But the fact that it comes from Brown-Forman and given our credibility in this category, gives it a leg up over many of these upstarts that are coming in from entrepreneurs."

The -- we are seeing some improving trends, as I noted, in the emerging markets. All emerging markets aren't created equal. So there's certain markets where we're investing and those that we won't. That was what I was referring to, so some of those areas. The U.S., we are investing nicely in. So it varies where -- where we will continue to invest is where the consumer is and where they're receptive to it. We would just be more thoughtful. I always remind people to, when we think about the line item of advertising, or when you look at that, we think about our investments well beyond that line item, including the SG&A line, which is the people on the street that builds the brands as well as the cost of our packaging and the value-added packs, which we have several out there right now as it relates to the 2 we were referring to from the Taste of Lynchburg for the JD 150 celebration.

And those investments could come in the form of -- oftentimes it comes in the form of route-to-consumer investments because we've found that that can have a very direct impact on the brand development. Some of these markets don't permit, in the same way that we're used to here, traditional advertising in some ways. We have sometimes referred to them as dark markets, et cetera.

Again, it's a month in, but what are you hearing qualitatively about the prospect for foot traffic and spend levels per ticket, so to speak, in restaurants?"

I mean, so in essence, it makes it more a hypothesis than a reality. I think some of the more, I'd say systemic things that relate to particularly our business, which is not the food part, of course, as much as it is the drink part of the restaurant business, I think I haven't heard anything that makes me change that, which is this aspect of going back now several, several years where consumers started to subtly shift their consumption occasions toward the off-premise more. And there seems to be more a millennial thing, the ability particularly to use social media to gather people effectively starting your own small bar on an evening if you want because it's so efficient to do so and the impact that this then has on suppliers and brands as you try to navigate the marketplace where the off-premise is growing faster than the on-premise. And so what are those dynamics? I actually think it'll be really interesting to see how, particularly one of the more recent developments that came out of this year's election cycle, which was continued momentum on the legalization of marijuana, that being an interesting development. Of course, it's something we've been monitoring. But what it -- just this would be, again, an anecdotal thing, the fact that that tends to be more of an off-premise consumption occasion, actually and to the extent that there's cross-category usage between marijuana and beverage alcohol, what does that do in terms of its impact on a brand or a supplier's approach to the business. I mean, it'd be -- I think that development will, if anything, add even greater momentum to the off-premise sales versus the on-premise sales. So these are all things that are kind of speculative, quite honestly. They're hypotheses that we are observing out there. We are monitoring them. I do think our organization has done a nice job on trying to cater to the off-premise occasion a bit more, whether it's through special packs, items such as -- like the development of flavored whiskey category I think hits a sweet spot as it relates to convenience in terms of consumption. I think as it relates to price and volume trade-offs, I think certainly the off-premise environment is a more price-sensitive channel than the on-premise one. And so there's a number of attributes of the channels that you have to pay attention to as you see subtle. These have not been wholesale and dramatic shifts; they're much more subtle but if you study them over maybe 3 or 5 or 7 years, they become more important than they do in any 1 quarter. So that's about all we have observed as it relates to the questions you were asking. We'll be paying close attention to it, though of course, as the months unfold and the realities of what's prognosticated actually come into play."
