I am pleased to report that both Enterprise Solutions and mainframe new sales performed better than expected in the third quarter.

I am pleased to report that both Enterprise Solutions and mainframe new sales performed better than expected in the third quarter. Both revenue and new sales outperformed expectations with strong new sales growth for the second consecutive quarter. Total new sales were up just over 10% year-over-year following an exceptionally strong second quarter. Enterprise Solutions' new sales increased in the high single digits year-over-year. Mainframe new sales increased in the mid-teens year-over-year. It marks the third consecutive quarter of Enterprise Solutions' new sales growth and the second consecutive quarter of mainframe new sales growth. This is a reflection of our ongoing efforts to improve product competitiveness as well as sales effectiveness and consistency. 
Relative to our expectations, third quarter results benefited from the combination of very strong performance from recent acquisition, a higher level of renewal bookings growth that came at a healthy attach rate and better-than-expected sales execution. Looking to our fourth quarter and into the next fiscal year, I am encouraged by the progress we are making in our sales and product execution. I believe we are well-positioned to achieve our FY '16 and medium term guidance. As conveyed in November, we expect our upcoming FY '17 to be the year CA crosses into sustained albeit initially modest revenue growth. 
Our improved confidence in the business is reflected in the accelerated share repurchase, which essentially completed the previous $1 billion share repurchase authorization; the additional $750 million share repurchase authorization; and our intent to increase the dividend in FY '17, subject to quarterly Board approval. We remain committed to our 3-pronged capital allocation strategy of returning capital to shareholders with an ongoing share repurchase program and one of the highest dividend payouts in the industry, while continuing to invest for future growth. Importantly, we are investing in innovation that matters. From containers and data analytics to Big Data, open source and Agile, we are making investments to ensure the CA solutions are meaningful and compelling and can drive growth for years to come. In some cases, this investment will result in net new products and in other cases, it will result in meaningful feature enhancements to existing product suites that will make CA solutions even more competitive in the marketplace. Many of you experienced this in November at CA World, which was a banner event. It was a tremendous opportunity for customers, partners, media and analysts to see the full breadth and power of the CA branded portfolio. The pendulum is swinging towards the desire to reduce complexity and consolidate around full suite solutions suppliers with global service. Consequently, customers increasingly find CA more attractive than point product vendors. 
All of our key CA World metrics were up year-over-year, including overall attendance, customer engagement, pipeline generation and broad visibility across both traditional and social media outlets. More specifically, the number of customer accounts represented at CA World increased in the mid-20s and our social media presence nearly doubled year-over-year year. These improvements reflect the increasing engagement of CA's traditional platinum customers as well as the broadening impact the named and partner businesses are having in our ability to address growth opportunities. At CA World, we launched 4 net new organically-developed products and dozens of new releases and product enhancements. CA's organic engineering engine continues to improve and drive innovation. We also demonstrated a number of innovation sneak peeks showcasing products currently in development. These innovations extend CA's ability to enable customers to embrace and benefit from the rapidly-emerging Application Economy. They represent CA's platform agnostic strategy of enabling customers to develop, manage and secure increasingly complex IT environment, regardless of whether the app resides in the cloud or on a mainframe or whether it's on-demand or on-prem. As the time between major waves of innovation continues to compress, it is increasingly critical for global enterprises to be more agile. Agile is the way they develop and Agile isn't a way to think about their business models and strategy. The accelerating frequency and amplitude of the waves of innovation provide game-changing opportunities for those with vision and the ability to execute. Agile is not just a product or methodology that CA is evangelizing and selling. It is a disciplined and modus operandi that we are broadly embracing internally. We've already migrated 85% of CA's projects to the CA Agile central platform, with the balance expected to be completed by the end of this fiscal year. I fully expect this will accelerate our pace of internal innovation and product development and result in more high-quality relevant products. 
Leading enterprises all around the world are architecting their digital transformations. One of our customers, General Electric, aspires to be the leader in industrial Internet and expects to be a top 10 software company by 2020. Tangible proof that every company is becoming a software company. The momentum driving change was some of the most storied companies in the world as palpable. The opportunities for CA to help customers embrace the Application Economy are seemingly endless. 
Now I'd like to highlight a few areas within Enterprise Solutions, in which we are seeing very good progress. In the Agile Management pillar, formerly Management Cloud, I am very happy to report that Rally continues to exceed our expectations. Seat expansions within the large enterprise customers and improvement in seat retention positively impacted performance. Customer seat count retention, or what CA refers to as renewals, is the best it's been since before Rally went public in early 2013. This is indicative of our customers' view of CA Agile central as a strategic partner and trusted adviser rather than just a software tool. It highlights the success of our land-and-expand strategy as initial deployments within enterprises grow exponentially. In the quarter, Barclays, which had been using Rally within just one of its North American divisions, executed a large upgrade to more broadly embrace Agile across its North American and European operation. Thousands of additional seats were signed in a competitive win. Another notable win was with a regional local exchange carrier that upgraded to thousands of seats to standardize on CA Agile central across the enterprise. 
Also within the Agile management pillar, I'm pleased to note that ITBM, or IT business management, increased new sales for the third consecutive quarter. Within ITBM, CA project and portfolio management SaaS, again, grew new sales, marking its third consecutive quarter of robust year-over-year growth. In the quarter, CA was recognized as the leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for integrated IT portfolio analysis applications. 
In Q3, we had a major win with an American multinational conglomerate. This win was the result of a very competitive campaign involving CA project and portfolio management SaaS. We are seeing consolidation in the market as customers gravitate towards stable proven vendors with the size and scale to support large enterprise deployments. 
Moving to DevOps, API management continued to be a bright spot, consistently posting strong growth rates. The third quarter marked the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit or better year-over-year new sales growth. The opportunity here is vast and we are typically addressing whitespace or replacing homegrown solutions. 
We launched 3 new products and enhancements at CA World. CA last API creator lets customers rapidly create API connectors from data resources such as Mongo DB and Oracle SQL databases. What used to take developers 3 to 4 weeks to create an API can now be done in fewer than 5 clicks. CA Mobile App Services provides core backend services for building end-to-end enterprise mobile applications, and CA API management SaaS enables customers to combine the convenience of cloud SaaS with enterprise-level Security. Demand for CA API management is expansive. The business unit acquired more than 50 new customers in Q3. New customers to CA API management included one of the largest insurance companies in the world as well as a financial Services technology company. The former is standardizing multiple divisions on CA API management, and the latter is standardizing on CA API management enterprise-wide. While initial deployments are exciting, major capacity expansions are proof points of our successful land-and-expand strategy. Notable capacity expansion deals include a win with a leading global payments company. This customer is deploying CA API management as the standard for a variety of application projects. And due to CA's strong mobile and authentication use cases, a major U.S. airline is employing CA API management to build its a B2B environment and .c omproperty. Our Security business had an outstanding third quarter with new sales up over 45% year-over-year. The acquisition of Xceedium, which is provided a tremendous lift to our Privileged Access Management product portfolio, is driving considerable momentum in our Security group and has far exceeded our expectations. 
In the quarter, we executed one of the largest deals for the Security group in recent history, led by Privileged Access Management. We closed a competitive win at a federal agency, which extending from a single use case to an expansion of growth out their entire environment. The streamlined capabilities of CA Privileged Access Management is enabling this customer to leverage its existing public key infrastructure, smart card and strong authentication solution with privileged user controls and auditing. 
Another highlight was the competitive win with an iconic American multinational mass media conglomerate. CA Privileged Access Manager was chosen to protect the brand and its intellectual property. It needed a standards-based solution that could easily integrate with a broad set of applications and systems. CA offer to compress a solution that allows the customer to secure their on-premise and SaaS-based applications and systems to ensure it can effectively control privileged users. Now the brand and its IP are protected against both internal and external threats. 
In the quarter, we announced the new release of CA Identity suite. New features include an application launch pad so that users can access any web application on the go, easy streamlined access, direct account entitlement management and integrated advanced authentication. As one of our large customers, Florida Blue Cross and Blue Shield recently highlighted, CA makes identity management easy so that any employee can understand it. We help our customers manage and govern the access of its employees, which is critical to improving productivity, maintaining Security and protecting data. I am pleased that what we are working on from a product perspective is beginning to bear fruit and our value proposition and positioning is resonating with customers. Our performance this quarter is evidence that the transformation to a modern sales organization is demonstrating increasingly consistent solid performance. For the third consecutive quarter, our combined named and growth sales teams delivered healthy growth. And in the third quarter, our pipeline conversion rates and win rates improved, our sales cycles the short end and our average deal size increased. I am pleased with the teams consistently improving efficiency and continued focus on accelerating velocity. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with our third quarter performance, which reflects the consistent improvement in our execution. We feel that we are near an inflection point in the business. That said, we know there is still work to be done to grow at a rate that is represented that will CA's true potential. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to review our third quarter financials and full-year guidance. Thank you."
262913,321572139,921122,"CA, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2016",2016-01-26,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated.

Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
The year-over-year strength of the dollar continues to be a headwind to both our results and our guidance. Our Q3 total revenue was $1.34 billion and was down 1%. Enterprise solutions increased 3%, mainframe solutions decreased 2%; and Services decreased 4%. Q3 renewals were up approximately 30% in constant currency and in the low 20s as reported. The higher level of renewal bookings was driven by earlier-than-expected closing of some renewal transactions originally expected outside of Q3 as well as an increase in average duration. Importantly, attach rates to these renewals were healthy. 
Renewal yield for the quarter was in the mid-80s. The lower than historical average renewal yield was the result of a large North American financial Services customer transitioning to an application that requires fewer of our products to support. This transition was expected and previously factored into our fiscal year and medium-term guidance and expectations related to our Mainframe business. Excluding this transaction, our renewal yield was in the low 90s. We expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up approximately 30% year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2015, and up in the mid-20s range as reported. Excluding the large system integrator renewal that occurred in the second quarter, we now expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up mid-to high single-digit and flat to up low single digits as reported. 
Q3 total new product and capacity sales were up just over 10% in constant currency and up mid-single digits as reported. The year-over-year increase was due to very strong performance from recent acquisitions, a higher level of renewal bookings growth with a healthy attach rate as well as a solid sales execution also has a positive effect. The outperformance in Q3 related to our expectation has smoothed the lumpiness we had expected between Q3 and Q4 due to movement in the renewal portfolio. 
The Rally acquisition continues to perform well with seat expansions within large enterprises and improvements in seat retention positively impacting performance. Total paid seats under contract at the end of Q3 increased in the high 20% range year-over-year. We define a paid seat as a seat with a subscription or support contract. As a reminder, we plan to phase out this metric as paid seat growth is not expected to be an accurate proxy for expected revenue growth as we penetrate our large platinum accounts. 
Acquisitions contributed approximately 10 points that total new sales growth in the quarter as reported and just above 10% in constant currency. Excluding acquisitions, for the first 9 months of fiscal year '16, total new sales were up low teens in constant currency and up mid-single digits as reported. 
Turning to geographies. New sales were strong in North America and EMEA driven by stronger-than-expected performance from acquisitions and the timing of renewals. However, new sales were down in APJ and the Latin America due to smaller renewal portfolios. Within our segments, Q3 mainframe new sales, including new product and capacity, was up in the mid-teens year-over-year and up high single digits as reported. Overall, we continue to expect our mainframe revenue to be down in the low digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the mainframe market. Q23 Solutions new product sales were up in the high single digits in constant currency and up [ph] low single digits as reported. Acquisitions contributed mid-teens growth in the quarter in both constant currency and as reported. Excluding acquisitions, for the first 9 months of FY '16, ES new sales were up mid single digits in constant currency and down low single digits as reported. 
Services revenue decreased 4% in constant currency and 9% as reported. Over the long term, we expect Services revenue to decline as we design our products to be easier to install and as we leverage partners. Total revenue backlog improved to up 5% in constant currency or up 2% as reported. Current revenue backlog declined 2% in constant currency or down 5% as reported. As many of you know, current revenue backlog is impacted by the timing of deals in our renewal portfolio. As contracts move closer to their renewals, revenue backlog declines. Current through the will likely grow when we do metric multiple quarters of the new sales growth while maintaining a low 90s renewal yield. While the timing of some deals shifted from FY '17 into Q3 driven largely by customer requests, we continue to expect FY '17 to be a solid renewal year. We believe our customer's desire for MIPS capacity ahead of renewal expiration is a positive reflection on the strength of our current mainframe cycle. 
Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 38% and GAAP operating margin was 28%. Segment operating margin in the quarter were 61% [ph] for Mainframe Solutions, 12% for Enterprise Solutions and 6% for Services. Our Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was 29%, and our GAAP tax rate was 21%. Q3 non-GAAP diluted was $0.63, up 1% year-over-year and includes a $0.02 benefit from the accelerated share repurchase in the quarter. Q3 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.52, up 18%, including a $0.02 benefit from accelerated share repurchase in the quarter. Our Q3 CFFO was $332 million, up 18% year-over-year or up 6% as reported. CFFO improved year-over-year due primarily to a decrease in vendor disbursements and payroll, partially offset by the decrease in cash collections due to an unfavorable effect on foreign exchange. Single installment cash payments were $125 million and up year-over-year but down for the first 9 months of fiscal year. We ended Q3 with approximately $250 million in net cash. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased 22 million shares for approximately $590 [ph] million, as we accelerated and essentially completed our $1 billion shell repurchase authorization. The Board of Directors authorized an additional $750 million share repurchase program, which we expect to begin to execute in FY '17. In Q3, we paid $105 million in dividends. We also announced a plan to increase the annual dividend from a dollar to a dollar two in fiscal year 2017. Our balance sheet is strong and we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based on exchange rates in the last day of the preceding quarter, which was December 31, 2015. The guidance also assumes no new material acquisitions. We expect currency to have a negative impact to our full year fiscal 2016 revenue of approximately 5 points at December 31 rates. For the year, the increased mix of ratable relative to upfront we experienced in the first half of the year has created a headwind to our reported revenue. We continue to expect total revenue to be towards the low end of our guidance of down 1% to flat in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of around $3.99 billion to $4.03 billion. Please note that the negative impact of foreign currency on our reported revenue outlook is approximately $200 million. The movement of some transactions from Q4 into Q3 has the effect of moderating our Q4 expectations, which we expect to weigh our metrics, including new sales, reported revenue, bookings, operating margin and EPS in Q4. We expect full year GAAP operating margin of 28% and full year operating margin of 38%, consistent with our prior expectations. 
Similar to our expert stations for revenue, we believe operating margin will be negatively impacted by a higher mix of ratable revenue rather than upfront deals in the first half of the year. Keep in mind that our fiscal Q4 operating margins are likely to be the weakest of the year due to the seasonality of operating expenses. Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%, consistent with our prior expectations. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow between 4% to 7%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.39 to $2.45. The negative impact of foreign currency and earnings per share is around $0.23. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 8% to 13%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.74 to $1.80. The diluted earnings per share estimates include the impact of accelerated share repurchase, which has a positive impact of approximately $0.03 and $0.04 to GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share, respectively. 
At the end of the fiscal year, we expect approximately 412 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 427 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to increase 2% to 7% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $970 million to $1.02 billion. And now we'll take your questions."

The things sound pretty good here, but, I guess, just when I look at some of the numbers, that's where I just start to wonder a little bit. And Richard, it's really more -- or Mike, around the mainframe. So I see the new sales being up in the mid-teens year-over-year, high single digits on reported basis and mid-teens in constant currency. But you still expect revenue to decline in low single digits over the medium term? So could you help us just sort of understand that? Because I think a lot of investors, because mainframe is so relevant for you, they'd love to see that be relatively stable. But if the new business is up and you still expect to decline over the medium term, that must mean that the renewals and, I don't know, maybe this quarter for the mainframe is an anomaly, adn certainly you point that out. But maybe this quarter and quarters like that, I think, it was like 3 years ago, you had a similar issue. But it may have a big effect because I would think that -- well, first of all, with mainframe deal a little more stable? I mean, I only hear that news sales are up and I think the second quarter in a row, it was up pretty good. And to hear that, the revenue is going to go down in the medium term, there seems to be somewhat of a disconnect, or is it really just about the renewals? I'm sorry, for the long-winded question."

So the quarter actually, a little different than what we had said back -- last quarter and it behaved any better way. So 2 pieces that were better.

Those deals that were due to be renewed in Q4 and a couple of deals that were in first half of next year, customers are now getting our contracts in my with the mix that they had purchased through IBM over last year or 2. And you can see in the last quarter that they just announced -- they had another good quarter of mixed growth. So we do expect that to come in over the length of these deals over the next 3 years, like we talked about. In fact, in November. The second part is the renewal yield does need to be in that around 90% range. This quarter, we had anticipated that particular vendor to take off their mainframe and put in a non-mainframe product set. We knew that they've been working on that for a few years, and so that was anticipated in both this year's guidance and our medium-term guidance. And as you said that happens from time to time is single digit kind of percentage when that happens. So we have that planned out over and we can see that coming because it takes years for people to migrate away when they choose to do so. As far as the total niche growth over the quarter, it was very healthy as you said and that is a positive for us over time. We need the mix to be growing, so [indiscernible] the 20% plus in order for us to have a flat growth. So this is really in line with what we anticipated. It's just a few quarters ahead, so just really smooths out the difference between Q3 and Q4."

At anytime you see someone using a mobile application to check maybe a checking account or their stock or anything else, that's driving a huge amount of back end MIPS. They can be priced differently because they tend to be a little bit cheaper the way those MIPS are deployed, but it has a strong growth for the Mainframe business. If you ask about sort of a hybrid model, where IBM came out with their IBM mainframe and the ability to use Linux, we also have products that do that. We announced 1 at CA World, so you'll see us putting on the mainframe MIPS versus Linux and that will continue to keep that cost of that hardware and everything attached to what very competitive in the marketplace. WHEN u then asked the last question, whose rate is coming off? It's similar to what I said to John. We don't see a lot of large customers drop off their mainframe.

So an example, any of the SaaS products at Rally continues to be a bigger piece of the portfolio in PPM. That will all be viewed in the ratable nature.

Xceedium, which is the other new acquisition, had a lot of standalone transactions assets our growth area, which you heard Mike talked about, the named accounts that grew 10%. So those tend to be more standalone transactions. Will that mix change over time? Yes. We saw a change in the first half of the year when things went more ratable. But this quarter, it kind of went back to more of a traditional mix. And I think next -- the quarter that we're currently in seems to be shaping more of the traditional mix. But as the product set becomes more ratable in nature, clearly, that will be less revenue to be taken upfront. So I think that to net that out, you'll have certain products that our go to drive that, so as we grow with our SaaS products. But our portfolio will definitely drive certain products to grow ratable. Example, all of mainframe and a lot of our traditional ES products."

I'll comment on part of it and I'll let Rich come in as well. First of all, will we just take a look at the map, our 2017 and 2018 renewal portfolio are very strong. So we've got an awful lot to work with that already pretty much booked business that we really understand. We know how to close those types of transactions. It continues to be yet high renewal yield and the low to mid-90s and we don't see that changing. So that's a good basis point to start from. And then secondly, we have been building a much, much better increasing portfolio of products. When you take a look at the competitive wins we've been getting over the last 3 quarters and take a look at what's being built organically in our labs and the improvement we'd have had with respect to our organic engineering, I think that that's a confidence factor. And then lastly is we're seeing a bit of a tipping point happen in the market, where customers are really starting to get aggravated with the integration of big part of the infrastructure being done on their nickel and they're looking for suites. And when you take a look at how we go to market and the buckets of products we have, we are a suite player. And to the extent we can get rid of all the engineering in and around the integration of multiple products, I think that the net win there our back. And I see this mostly right now in Security. When we are selling our Security products, it usually starts off at a very technical sales. And as soon as that seal starts moving up in the executive ladder and gets to be COO or get to a CFO or CEO, they don't want to talk about the tactical solution. They want to talk about how you are going to protect our company and how can you think about this more holistically. We've got a great quarter with Xceedium and Xceedium is a great opportunity for us to have that conversation. It's not lost on anybody that most of the hacks that have happened over the last year and a half has happened by a privileged identity getting compromised. There is a tactical reach out right now, which is about every corporation to solve that particular problem. But as you start having that conversation and you bring it up to an end up at executive level, they expand into how we are protecting identities for a full corporation. There's only a handful of companies and what that can do that and usually there's only a couple that can do that at scale. I think that were very well-positioned for those kinds of competitive bids."

With respect to macro, we haven't seen any change in customer segment in the problems we're trying to solve. If you think about just about every single company, they're trying to be part of the Application Economy so they are building applications. If you're building applications, they're going to be using things like CA Agile management. They're going to be using testing tools that we have. They're going to be using service virtualization. They're going to want to instrument those applications and make sure that the hardware that they deploy them on has enough capacity and if that hardware is jumping into problems, they want to be notified about it. And obviously, they're going to want to be secured. So being in the right spot as everyone thinks towards the macro, how am I going to improve? The way that they're going to improve is by getting involved in the Application Economy. Now there is also a lot of macro territorial issues. China is definitely a bit on the might and just about everybody. And how do you think people are going to solve their issues in China? And China is a move into a consumer oriented economy from an expert economy. They're going to want to have all the things that you would expect the G20 nation to have. They're going to have to want credit cards. They're going to want to have insurance. They're going to want to have cars. They're going to want to have electronic devices. All of that commerce is going to be built on the Application Economy as well. So I feel like we're very well-positioned strategically in macro in order to make that happen. And that is -- we haven't put our FY '17 guidance yet. We'll do that after we finish up the year, but we'll take that into consideration. But I see right now is a bit of a blend and a little bit of a correction. The stuff that's getting corrected, I think everybody probably saw that it probably should get corrected. When you have the company like ours that makes money, you have a company like ours that has great customer service and as a company like ours that invest $1 billion in the R&D, that's the kind of stability that I think customers are going to want to pay attention to."

They had a strong quarter in the last couple of quarters. We're not as big in China, so some of the pressures that Mike just described in China were a little bit inflated from that as well as Russia. So we performed very well again in Europe and North America. A lot of what we did over the last 18 months to get our named and growth accounts moving is really starting to pay dividends. And as Mike said earlier, we saw that segment growing 10%, and that's the third quarter in a row, where it had significant growth. So I think we're positioned where we have a lot of whitespace, if you will, in  the Fortune 5000. We were traditionally 4 years ago very concentrated in our Fortune 500.

I am pleased to report that both Enterprise Solutions and Mainframe new sales performed better than expected in the third quarter. Both revenue and new sales outperformed expectations, with strong new sales gr",1879,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I am pleased to report that both Enterprise Solutions and Mainframe new sales performed better than expected in the third quarter. Both revenue and new sales outperformed expectations, with strong new sales growth for the second consecutive quarter. Total new sales were up just over 10% year-over-year following an exceptionally strong second quarter. 
Enterprise Solutions' new sales increased in the high single digits year-over-year. Mainframe new sales increased in the mid-teens year-over-year. It marks the third consecutive quarter of Enterprise Solutions' new sales growth and the second consecutive quarter of Mainframe new sales growth. This is the reflection of our ongoing efforts to improve product competitiveness as well as sales effectiveness and consistency. 
Relative to our expectations, third quarter results benefited from the combination of very strong performance from recent acquisitions, a higher level of renewal bookings growth that came at a healthy attach rate and better-than-expected sales execution. 
Looking to our fourth quarter and into the next fiscal year, I am encouraged by the progress we are making in our sales and product execution. I believe we are well positioned to achieve our FY '16 and medium-term guidance. As conveyed in November, we expect our upcoming FY '17 to be the year CA crosses into sustained, albeit initially modest, revenue growth. 
Our improved confidence in the business is reflected in the accelerated share repurchase, which essentially completed the previous $1 billion share repurchase authorization, the additional $750 million share repurchase authorization and our intent to increase the dividend in FY '17, subject to quarterly board approval. We remain committed to our 3-pronged capital allocation strategy of returning capital to shareholders, with an ongoing share repurchase program and one of the highest dividend payouts in the industry, while continuing to invest for future growth. 
Importantly, we are investing in innovation that matters. From containers and data analytics to Big Data, open source and Agile, we are making investments to ensure that CA solutions are meaningful and compelling and can drive growth for years to come. In some cases, this investment will result in net new products. And in other cases, it will result in meaningful feature enhancements to existing product suites that will make CA solutions even more competitive in the marketplace. 
Many of you experienced this in November at CA World, which was a banner event. It was a tremendous opportunity for customers, partners, media and analysts to see the full breadth and power of the CA brand and portfolio. The pendulum is swinging towards the desire to reduce complexity and consolidate around full-suite solution suppliers with global service. Consequently, customers increasingly find CA more attractive than point-product vendors. 
All of our key CA World metrics were up year-over-year, including overall attendance, customer engagement, pipeline generation and broad visibility across both traditional and social media outlets, more specifically, the number of customer accounts represented at CA World increased in the mid-20s and our social media presence nearly doubled year-over-year. These improvements reflect the increasing engagement of CA's traditional platinum customers as well as the broadening impact the named and partner business is having on our ability to address growth opportunities. 
At CA World, we launched 4 net new organically developed products and dozens of new releases and product enhancements. CA's organic engineering engine continues to improve and drive innovation. We also demonstrated a number of innovation sneak peeks showcasing products currently in development. These innovations extend CA's ability to enable customers to embrace and benefit from the rapidly emerging Application Economy. They represent CA's platform-agnostic strategy of enabling customers to develop, manage and secure increasingly complex IT environments, regardless of whether the app resides in the cloud or on a mainframe or whether it's on-demand or on-prem. As the time between major waves of innovation continues to compress, it is increasingly critical for global enterprises to be more agile. Agile is the way they develop and Agile is the way they think about their business models and strategy. The accelerating frequency and amplitude of the waves of innovation provide game-changing opportunities for those with vision and the ability to execute. Agile is not just a product or methodology that CA is evangelizing and selling, it is a disciplined and modus operandi that we are broadly embracing internally. We've already migrated 85% of CA's projects to the CA Agile Central platform, with the balance expected to be completed by the end of this fiscal year. I fully expect this will accelerate our pace of internal innovation and product development and result in more high-quality relevant products. 
Leading enterprises all around the world are architecting their digital transformation. One of our customers, General Electric, aspires to be the leader in the industrial Internet and expects to be a top 10 software company by 2020, tangible proof that every company is becoming a software company. The momentum-driving change with some of the most storied companies in the world is palpable. The opportunities for CA to help customers embrace the Application Economy are seemingly endless. 
Now I'd like to highlight a few areas within Enterprise Solutions in which we are seeing very good progress. In the Agile management pillar, formerly Management Cloud, I am very happy to report that Rally continues to exceed our expectations. Seat expansions within the large enterprise customers and improvement in seat retention positively impacted performance. Customer seat count retention, or what CA refers to as renewals, is the best it's been since before Rally went public in early 2013. This is indicative of our customers' view of CA Agile Central as a strategic partner and trusted adviser rather than just a software tool. It highlights the success of our land-and-expand strategy as initial deployments within enterprises grow exponentially. 
In the quarter, Barclays, which had been using Rally within just one of its North American divisions, executed a large upgrade to more broadly embrace Agile across its North American and European operations. Thousands of additional seats were signed in this competitive win. Another notable win was with a regional local exchange carrier that upgraded to thousands of seats to standardize on CA Agile Central across the enterprise. 
Also within the Agile management pillar, I'm pleased to note that ITBM, or IT Business Management, increased new sales for the third consecutive quarter. Within ITBM, CA Project and Portfolio Management SaaS again grew new sales, marking its third consecutive quarter of robust year-over-year growth. In the quarter, CA was recognized as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Integrated IT Portfolio Analysis Applications. 
In Q3, we had a major win with an American multinational conglomerate. This win was the result of a very competitive campaign involving CA Project and Portfolio Management SaaS. We are seeing consolidation in the market as customers gravitate towards stable proven vendors with the size and scale to support large enterprise deployments. 
Moving to DevOps, API management continues to be a bright spot, consistently posting strong growth rates. The third quarter marked the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit or better year-over-year new sales growth. The opportunity here is vast and we are typically addressing whitespace or replacing homegrown solutions. 
We launched 3 new products and enhancements at CA World. CA Live API Creator lets customers rapidly create API connectors from database resources such as MongoDB and Oracle SQL databases. What used to take developers 3 to 4 weeks to create an API can now be done in fewer than 5 clicks. CA Mobile App Services provides core back-end services for building end-to-end enterprise mobile applications. And CA API management SaaS enables customers to combine the convenience of cloud SaaS with enterprise-level security. 
Demand for CA API management is expansive. The business unit acquired more than 50 new customers in Q3. New customers to CA API management included one of the largest insurance companies in the world as well as a financial services technology company. The former is standardizing multiple divisions on CA API management, and the latter is standardizing on CA API management enterprise-wide. While initial deployments are exciting, major capacity expansions are proof points of our successful land-and-expand strategy. Notable capacity expansion deals include a win with a leading global payments company. This customer is deploying CA API management as the standard for a variety of application projects. And due to CA's strong mobile and authentication use cases, a major U.S. airline is employing CA API management to build its B2B environment and dot-com property. 
Our Security business had an outstanding third quarter, with new sales up over 45% year-over-year. The acquisition of Xceedium, which has provided a tremendous lift to our Privileged Access Management product portfolio, is driving considerable momentum in our Security group and has far exceeded our expectations. 
In the quarter, we executed one of the largest deals for the Security group in recent history, led by Privileged Access Management. We closed a competitive win at a federal agency, which is extending from a single-use case to an expansion throughout their entire environment. The streamlined capabilities of CA Privileged Access Management is enabling this customer to leverage its existing public key infrastructure, smart card and strong authentication solution with privileged user controls and auditing. 
Another highlight was the competitive win with an iconic American multinational mass media conglomerate. CA Privileged Access Manager was chosen to protect the brand and its intellectual property. It needed a standards-based solution that could easily integrate with a broad set of applications and systems. CA offered a comprehensive solution that allows the customer to secure their on-premise and SaaS-based applications and systems to ensure it can effectively control privileged users. Now the brand and its IP are protected against both internal and external threats. 
In the quarter, we announced the new release of CA Identity suite. New features include an application launchpad so that users can access any web application on the go, easy streamlined access, direct account entitlement management and integrated advanced authentication. 
As one of our large customers, Florida Blue Cross and Blue Shield recently highlighted, CA makes identity management easy so that any employee can understand it. We help our customers manage and govern the access of its employees, which is critical to improving productivity, maintaining security and protecting data. I am pleased that what we are working on from a product perspective is beginning to bear fruit and our value proposition and messaging is resonating with customers. Our performance this quarter is evidence that the transformation into a modern sales organization is demonstrating increasingly consistent solid performance. For the third consecutive quarter, our combined named and growth sales teams delivered healthy growth. And in the third quarter, our pipeline conversion rates and win rates improved, our sales cycles shortened and our average deal size increased. I am pleased with the team's consistently improving efficiency and continued focus on accelerating velocity. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with our third quarter performance, which reflects the consistent improvement in our execution. We feel that we are near an inflection point in the business. That said, we know there is still work to be done to grow at a rate that is represented of CA's true potential. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to review our third quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."
262913,321572139,921211,"CA, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2016",2016-01-26,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike.

Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
The year-over-year strength in the dollar continues to be a headwind to both our results and our guidance. Our Q3 total revenue was $1.34 billion and was down 1%. Enterprise Solutions increased 3%; Mainframe Solutions decreased 2%; and Services decreased 4%. Q3 renewals were up approximately 30% in constant currency and in the low 20s as reported. The higher level of renewal bookings was driven by earlier-than-expected closing of some renewal transactions originally expected outside of Q3 as well as an increase in the average duration. Importantly, attach rates to these renewals were healthy. 
Renewal yield for the quarter was in the mid-80s. The lower-than-historical average renewal yield was a result of a large North American financial services customer transitioning to an application that requires fewer of our products to support. This transition was expected and previously factored into our fiscal year and medium-term guidance and expectations related to our Mainframe business. Excluding this transaction, our renewal yield was in the low 90s. We expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up approximately 30% year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2015 and up in the mid-20s range as reported. Excluding the large system integrator renewal that occurred in the second quarter, we now expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up mid- to high single-digits and flat to up low single digits as reported. 
Q3 total new product and capacity sales were up just over 10% in constant currency and up mid-single digits as reported. The year-over-year increase was due to very strong performance from recent acquisitions, a higher level of renewal bookings growth with a healthy attach rate as well as a solid sales execution also has a positive effect. The outperformance in Q3 related to our expectations had smoothed the lumpiness we had expected between Q3 and Q4 due to the movement in the renewal portfolio. 
The Rally acquisition continues to perform well, with seat expansions within large enterprises and improvement in seat retention positively impacting performance. Total paid seat under contract at the end of Q3 increased in the high 20% range year-over-year. We define a paid seat as a seat with a subscription or support contract. As a reminder, we plan to phase out this metric as paid seat growth is not expected to be an accurate proxy for expected revenue growth as we penetrate our large platinum accounts. 
Acquisitions contributed approximately 10 points to total new sales growth in the quarter as reported and just above 10% in constant currency. Excluding acquisitions, for the first 9 months of fiscal year '16, total new sales were up low teens in constant currency and up mid-single digits as reported. 
Turning to geographies. New sales were strong in North America and EMEA, driven by stronger-than-expected performance from acquisitions and the timing of renewals. However, new sales were down in APJ and Latin America due to smaller renewal portfolios. Within our segments, Q3 Mainframe new sales, including new product and capacity, was up in the mid-teens year-over-year and up high single digits as reported. Overall, we continue to expect our Mainframe revenue to be down in the low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the mainframe market. 
Q3 Enterprise Solutions new product sales were up in the high single digits in constant currency and up low single digits as reported. Acquisitions contributed mid-teens growth in the quarter in both constant currency and as reported. Excluding acquisitions, for the first 9 months of FY '16, ES new sales were up mid-single digits in constant currency and down low single digits as reported. 
Services revenue decreased 4% in constant currency and 9% as reported. Over the long term, we expect Services revenue to decline as we design our products to be easier to install and as we leverage partners. Total revenue backlog improved to up 5% in constant currency or up 2% as reported. Current revenue backlog declined 2% in constant currency or down 5% as reported. As many of you know, current revenue backlog is impacted by the timing of deals in our renewal portfolio. As contracts move closer towards their renewals, revenue backlog declines. Current revenue backlog will likely grow when we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low 90s renewal yield. 
While the timing of some deals shifted from FY '17 into Q3, driven largely by customer requests, we continue to expect FY '17 to be a solid renewal year. We believe our customer's desire for MIPS capacity ahead of renewal expiration is a positive reflection on the strength of our current mainframe cycle. 
Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 38%, and GAAP operating margin was 28%. Segment operating margin in the quarter were 61% for Mainframe Solutions, 12% for Enterprise Solutions and 6% for Services. Our Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was 29%, and our GAAP tax rate was 21%. Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.63, up 1% year-over-year, and includes a $0.02 benefit from the accelerated share repurchase in the quarter. Q3 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.52, up 18%, including a $0.02 benefit from the accelerated share repurchase in the quarter. 
Our Q3 CFFO was $332 million, up 18% year-over-year or up 6% as reported. CFFO improved year-over-year due primarily to a decrease in vendor disbursements and payroll, partially offset by the decrease in cash collections due to an unfavorable effect on foreign exchange. Single installment cash payments were $125 million and up year-over-year but down for the first 9 months of fiscal year. We ended Q3 with approximately $250 million in net cash. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased 22 million shares for approximately $590 million as we accelerated and essentially completed our $1 billion share repurchase authorization. The Board of Directors authorized an additional $750 million share repurchase program, which we expect to begin to execute in FY '17. In Q3, we paid $105 million in dividends. We also announced a plan to increase the annual dividend from $1.00 to $1.02 in fiscal year 2017. Our balance sheet is strong and we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based on exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was December 31, 2015. The guidance also assumes no new material acquisitions. We expect currency to have a negative impact to our full year fiscal 2016 revenue of approximately 5 points at December 31 rates. For the year, the increased mix of ratable relative to upfront we experienced in the first half of the year has created a headwind to our reported revenue. We continue to expect total revenue to be towards the low end of our guidance of down 1% to flat in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of around $3.99 billion to $4.03 billion. Please note that the negative impact of foreign currency on our reported revenue outlook is approximately $200 million. The movement of some transactions from Q4 into Q3 has the effect of moderating our Q4 expectations, which we expect to weigh on metrics, including new sales, reported revenue, bookings, operating margin and EPS in Q4. We expect full year GAAP operating margin of 28% and full year non-GAAP operating margin of 38%, consistent with our prior expectations. 
Similar to our expectations for revenue, we believe operating margin will be negatively impacted by a higher mix of ratable revenue rather than upfront deals in the first half of the year. Keep in mind that our fiscal Q4 operating margins are likely to be the weakest of the year due to the seasonality of operating expenses. 
Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%, consistent with our prior expectations. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow between 4% to 7%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.39 to $2.45. The negative impact of foreign currency on earnings per share is around $0.23. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 8% to 13%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.74 to $1.80. The diluted earnings per share estimate includes the impact of the accelerated share repurchase, which has a positive impact of approximately $0.03 and $0.04 to GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share respectively. 
At the end of the fiscal year, we expect approximately 412 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 427 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to increase 2% to 7% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $970 million to $1.02 billion. 
And now we'll take your questions."

But things sound pretty good here, but I guess, sort of, just when I look at some of the numbers, that's where I just start to wonder a little bit. And Rich, it's really more -- or Mike, around the mainframe. So I see like new sales being up in the mid-teens year-over-year, at high single digits on a reported basis and mid-teens in constant currency, but you still expect revenue to decline in low single digits over the medium term. So could you help us just sort of understand that? Because I think in -- for a lot of investors, because mainframe is so relevant for you, they'd love to see that kind of be relatively stable. But if the new business is up, you still expect it to decline over the medium term. That must mean that the renewals, and I don't know, maybe this quarter for mainframe is an anomaly. It certainly is as you pointed that out. But maybe this quarter and quarters like that, I think, it was like 3 years ago, you had a similar issue. But it may have a big effect because I would think that -- well, first of all, would mainframe deal a little more stable? I mean, when you hear that news sales are up, and as I think the second quarter in a row, it was up pretty good. And to hear that, that revenue is going to go down in the medium term, there seems to be somewhat of a disconnect or is it really just about the renewals? I'm sorry for the long-winded question."

So the quarter actually behaved a little differently than when we had said back last quarter and it behaved in a better way. So the 2 pieces that were better, acquisitions clearly in total improved and the second part is the mainframe that you described. Those deals that were due to be renewed in Q4 and a couple deals that were in the first half of next year, customers are now getting our contracts in line with the niches they had purchased through IBM over the last year or 2. And you can see in the last quarter that they just announced they had another good quarter of niche growth. So we do expect that to come in over the length of these deals over the next 3 years, like we talked about, in fact, in November. The second part is though the renewal yield does need to be in that round 90% range. This quarter, we had anticipated that particular vendor to take off their mainframe and put in a non-mainframe product set. We knew that they've been working on that for a few years. And so that was anticipated in both this year's guidance and our medium-term guidance. And as you said, that happens from time to time, is a single-digit kind of percentage where that happens. So we have that planned out over, and we can see that coming because it takes years for people to migrate away when they do choose to do so. As far as the total niche growth though for the quarter, it was very healthy, as you said, and that is a positive for us over time. We need mix to be growing in totality, though at 20%-plus in order for us to have flat growth. So this is really in line with what we had anticipated, it's just a few quarters ahead, so it just really smoothes out the difference between Q3 and Q4."

I know you've been putting a lot of effort into trying to disconnect that, or not necessarily disconnect it, but sign more new business outside the renewal cycle and also sign with new customers. So in order for you to grow that new business, it sort of has to grow like, at over time anyway, faster or better than the renewals. Is that a right way to think about it? And I'm sorry, go ahead."

They could be priced differently because they tend to be a little bit cheaper the way those MIPS are deployed, but it has a strong growth for the Mainframe business. If you ask about sort of the hybrid model, where IBM came out with their -- IBM's mainframe and the ability to use Linux, we also have products that do that. We announced one at CA World, so you'll see us putting on the mainframe, MIPS versus Linux, and that we'll continue to keep that cost of that hardware and everything attached to it very competitive in the marketplace. When you then asked the last question, whose rate is coming off? It's similar to what I said to John. We don't see a lot of large customers dropping their mainframe. In fact, we're seeing their capacity pick up. It tends to be at the very, very low end, a single application on our older mainframe.

So an example, any of the SaaS products at Rally just continues to be a bigger piece of the portfolio in PPM. That will all be viewed in a ratable nature. The other thing is the products that are to be renewed. So as the mainframe in this particular quarter, as an example, have a lot of ratable nature to it. Xceedium, which is then the other new acquisition, they will have a lot of standalone transactions as did our growth area, which you heard Mike talk about, the named accounts that grew 10%. So those tend to be more standalone transactions. Will that mix change over time? Yes. We saw a change in the first half of the year when more things went ratable. But this quarter, it kind of went back to more of a traditional mix. And I think next -- the quarter that we're currently in, it seems to be shaping up to be more in that traditional mix. But as the product set becomes more ratable in nature, clearly, there will be less revenue that will be taken upfront. So I think that to net that out, you'll have certain products that are going to drive that, so as we grow with our SaaS products. But our portfolio will definitely drive certain products to go ratable. An example, all of mainframe and a lot of our traditional ES products."

So we've got an awful lot to work with that's already pretty much booked business that we really understand. We know how to close those types of transactions that continues to be -- gets high renewal yields and the low to mid-90s, and we don't see that changing. So that's a good basis point to start from. And then secondly, we have been building a much, much better increasing portfolio of products. When you take a look at the competitive wins we've been getting over the last 3 quarters and take a look at what's being built organically in our labs and the improvement we have -- had, had with respect to organic engineering, I think that that's a confidence factor. And then lastly is we're seeing a bit of a tipping point happen in the market, where customers are really starting to get aggravated with the integration of big parts of their infrastructure being done on their nickel and they're looking for suites. And when you take a look at how we go to market and the buckets of products we have, we are a suite player. And to the extent that we can get rid of all of the engineering in and around the integration of multiple products, I think that the net win at our back. And I see this mostly right now in Security. When we are selling our Security products, it usually starts off as a very tactical sale. And as soon as that sale starts moving up the executive ladder and gets to a CISO or gets to a CFO or CEO, they don't want to talk about a tactical solution, they want to talk about how are you going to protect my company and how can you think about this more holistically. We've had a great quarter with Xceedium, and Xceedium is a great opportunity for us to have that conversation. It's not lost on anybody that most of the hacks that have happened over the last 1.5 years have happened by a privileged identity getting compromised. There is a tactical reach-out right now by just about every corporation to solve that particular problem. But as soon as you start having that conversation and you bring it up to an executive level, they expand into the how we are protecting the identities for our whole corporation. There's only a handful of companies in the world that can do that, and there's only a couple that can do that at scale. I think that we're very well-positioned for those kinds of competitive bids."

With respect to macro, we haven't seen any change in customer sentiment for the problems they're trying to solve. If you think about just about every single company, they're trying to be part of the Application Economy, so they are building applications. And if they're building applications, they're going to be using things like CA Agile management. They're going to be using testing tools that we have. They're going to be using service virtualization. They're going to want to instrument those applications and make sure that the hardware that they deploy them on has enough capacity, and if that hardware is bumping into problems, they're going to want to be notified about it. And obviously, they're going to want to be secured. So being in the right spot as everyone thinks towards the macro, how am I going to improve? The way that they're going to improve is by getting involved in the Application Economy. Now there isn't also a lot of macro territorial issues. China has definitely been on the mind of just about everybody. And how do you think people are going to solve their issues in China? And China is a move into a consumer-oriented economy from an export economy. They're going to want to have all the things that you would expect the -- a G20 nation to have. They're going to want to have credit cards. They're going to want to have insurance. They're going to want to have cars. They're going to want to have electronic devices. All of that commerce is going to be built on the Application Economy as well. So I feel like we're very well-positioned strategically in macro in order to make that happen. And that is -- we haven't put out our FY '17 guidance yet. We'll do that after we finish up the year. But we'll take that all into consideration. But what I see right now is a bit of a blip and a little bit of a correction. The stuff that's getting corrected, I think everybody probably saw that it probably should get corrected. When you have a company like ours that makes money, you have a company like ours that has great customer service, you see a company like ours that invests $1 billion in real R&D, that's the kind of stability that I think customers are going to want to pay attention to."

262913,321572139,921223,"CA, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2016",2016-01-26,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I am pleased to report that both Enterprise Solutions and Mainframe new sales performed better than expected in the third quarter. Both revenue and new sales outperformed expectations, with strong new sales gr",1879,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I am pleased to report that both Enterprise Solutions and Mainframe new sales performed better than expected in the third quarter. Both revenue and new sales outperformed expectations, with strong new sales growth for the second consecutive quarter. Total new sales were up just over 10% year-over-year following an exceptionally strong second quarter. 
Enterprise Solutions' new sales increased in the high single digits year-over-year. Mainframe new sales increased in the mid-teens year-over-year. It marks the third consecutive quarter of Enterprise Solutions' new sales growth and the second consecutive quarter of Mainframe new sales growth. This is the reflection of our ongoing efforts to improve product competitiveness as well as sales effectiveness and consistency. 
Relative to our expectations, third quarter results benefited from the combination of very strong performance from recent acquisitions, a higher level of renewal bookings growth that came at a healthy attach rate and better-than-expected sales execution. 
Looking to our fourth quarter and into the next fiscal year, I am encouraged by the progress we are making in our sales and product execution. I believe we are well positioned to achieve our FY '16 and medium-term guidance. As conveyed in November, we expect our upcoming FY '17 to be the year CA crosses into sustained, albeit initially modest, revenue growth. 
Our improved confidence in the business is reflected in the accelerated share repurchase, which essentially completed the previous $1 billion share repurchase authorization, the additional $750 million share repurchase authorization and our intent to increase the dividend in FY '17, subject to quarterly board approval. We remain committed to our 3-pronged capital allocation strategy of returning capital to shareholders, with an ongoing share repurchase program and one of the highest dividend payouts in the industry, while continuing to invest for future growth. 
Importantly, we are investing in innovation that matters. From containers and data analytics to Big Data, open source and Agile, we are making investments to ensure that CA solutions are meaningful and compelling and can drive growth for years to come. In some cases, this investment will result in net new products. And in other cases, it will result in meaningful feature enhancements to existing product suites that will make CA solutions even more competitive in the marketplace. 
Many of you experienced this in November at CA World, which was a banner event. It was a tremendous opportunity for customers, partners, media and analysts to see the full breadth and power of the CA brand and portfolio. The pendulum is swinging towards the desire to reduce complexity and consolidate around full-suite solution suppliers with global service. Consequently, customers increasingly find CA more attractive than point-product vendors. 
All of our key CA World metrics were up year-over-year, including overall attendance, customer engagement, pipeline generation and broad visibility across both traditional and social media outlets. More specifically, the number of customer accounts represented at CA World increased in the mid-20s and our social media presence nearly doubled year-over-year. These improvements reflect the increasing engagement of CA's traditional platinum customers as well as the broadening impact the named and partner business is having on our ability to address growth opportunities. 
At CA World, we launched 4 net new organically developed products and dozens of new releases and product enhancements. CA's organic engineering engine continues to improve and drive innovation. We also demonstrated a number of innovation sneak peeks showcasing products currently in development. These innovations extend CA's ability to enable customers to embrace and benefit from the rapidly emerging Application Economy. They represent CA's platform-agnostic strategy of enabling customers to develop, manage and secure increasingly complex IT environments, regardless of whether the app resides in the cloud or on a mainframe or whether it's on-demand or on-prem. As the time between major waves of innovation continues to compress, it is increasingly critical for global enterprises to be more agile. Agile is the way they develop and Agile is the way they think about their business models and strategy. The accelerating frequency and amplitude of the waves of innovation provide game-changing opportunities for those with vision and the ability to execute. Agile is not just a product or methodology that CA is evangelizing and selling, it is a disciplined and modus operandi that we are broadly embracing internally. We've already migrated 85% of CA's projects to the CA Agile Central platform, with the balance expected to be completed by the end of this fiscal year. I fully expect this will accelerate our pace of internal innovation and product development and result in more high-quality relevant products. 
Leading enterprises all around the world are architecting their digital transformations. One of our customers, General Electric, aspires to be the leader in the industrial Internet and expects to be a top 10 software company by 2020, tangible proof that every company is becoming a software company. The momentum-driving change with some of the most storied companies in the world is palpable. The opportunities for CA to help customers embrace the Application Economy are seemingly endless. 
Now I'd like to highlight a few areas within Enterprise Solutions in which we are seeing very good progress. In the Agile management pillar, formerly Management Cloud, I am very happy to report that Rally continues to exceed our expectations. Seat expansions within the large enterprise customers and improvement in seat retention positively impacted performance. Customer seat count retention, or what CA refers to as renewals, is the best it's been since before Rally went public in early 2013. This is indicative of our customers' view of CA Agile Central as a strategic partner and trusted adviser rather than just a software tool. It highlights the success of our land-and-expand strategy as initial deployments within enterprises grow exponentially. 
In the quarter, Barclays, which had been using Rally within just one of its North American divisions, executed a large upgrade to more broadly embrace Agile across its North American and European operations. Thousands of additional seats were signed in this competitive win. Another notable win was with a regional local exchange carrier that upgraded to thousands of seats to standardize on CA Agile Central across the enterprise. 
Also within the Agile management pillar, I'm pleased to note that ITBM, or IT Business Management, increased new sales for the third consecutive quarter. Within ITBM, CA Project and Portfolio Management SaaS again grew new sales, marking its third consecutive quarter of robust year-over-year growth. In the quarter, CA was recognized as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Integrated IT Portfolio Analysis Applications. 
In Q3, we had a major win with an American multinational conglomerate. This win was the result of a very competitive campaign involving CA Project and Portfolio Management SaaS. We are seeing consolidation in the market as customers gravitate towards stable proven vendors with the size and scale to support large enterprise deployments. 
Moving to DevOps, API management continues to be a bright spot, consistently posting strong growth rates. The third quarter marked the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit or better year-over-year new sales growth. The opportunity here is vast and we are typically addressing whitespace or replacing homegrown solutions. 
We launched 3 new products and enhancements at CA World. CA Live API Creator lets customers rapidly create API connectors from database resources such as MongoDB and Oracle SQL databases. What used to take developers 3 to 4 weeks to create in API can now be done in fewer than 5 clicks. CA Mobile App Services provides core back-end services for building end-to-end enterprise mobile applications. And CA API management SaaS enables customers to combine the convenience of cloud SaaS with enterprise-level security. 
Demand for CA API management is expansive. The business unit acquired more than 50 new customers in Q3. New customers to CA API management included one of the largest insurance companies in the world as well as a financial services technology company. The former is standardizing multiple divisions on CA API management, and the latter is standardizing on CA API management enterprise-wide. While initial deployments are exciting, major capacity expansions are proof points of our successful land-and-expand strategy. Notable capacity expansion deals include a win with a leading global payments company. This customer is deploying CA API management as the standard for a variety of application projects. And due to CA's strong mobile and authentication use cases, a major U.S. airline is employing CA API management to build its B2B environment and dot-com property. 
Our Security business had an outstanding third quarter, with new sales up over 45% year-over-year. The acquisition of Xceedium, which has provided a tremendous lift to our Privileged Access Management product portfolio, is driving considerable momentum in our Security group and has far exceeded our expectations. 
In the quarter, we executed one of the largest deals for the Security group in recent history, led by Privileged Access Management. We closed a competitive win at a federal agency, which is extending from a single-use case to an expansion throughout their entire environment. The streamlined capabilities of CA Privileged Access Management is enabling this customer to leverage its existing public key infrastructure, smart card and strong authentication solution with privileged user controls and auditing. 
Another highlight was the competitive win with an iconic American multinational mass media conglomerate. CA Privileged Access Manager was chosen to protect the brand and its intellectual property. It needed a standards-based solution that could easily integrate with a broad set of applications and systems. CA offered a comprehensive solution that allows the customer to secure their on-premise and SaaS-based applications and systems to ensure it can effectively control privileged users. Now the brand and its IP are protected against both internal and external threats. 
In the quarter, we announced the new release of CA Identity suite. New features include an application launchpad so that users can access any web application on the go, easy streamlined access, direct account entitlement management and integrated advanced authentication. 
As one of our large customers, Florida Blue Cross and Blue Shield recently highlighted, CA makes identity management easy so that any employee can understand it. We help our customers manage and govern the access of its employees, which is critical to improving productivity, maintaining security and protecting data. I am pleased that what we are working on from a product perspective is beginning to bear fruit and our value proposition and messaging is resonating with customers. Our performance this quarter is evidence that the transformation into a modern sales organization is demonstrating increasingly consistent solid performance. For the third consecutive quarter, our combined named and growth sales teams delivered healthy growth. And in the third quarter, our pipeline conversion rates and win rates improved, our sales cycles shortened and our average deal size increased. I am pleased with the team's consistently improving efficiency and continued focus on accelerating velocity. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with our third quarter performance, which reflects the consistent improvement in our execution. We feel that we are near an inflection point in the business. That said, we know there is still work to be done to grow at a rate that is representive of CA's true potential. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to review our third quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."
262913,321572139,921223,"CA, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2016",2016-01-26,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike.

Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
The year-over-year strength in the dollar continues to be a headwind to both our results and our guidance. Our Q3 total revenue was $1.34 billion and was down 1%. Enterprise Solutions increased 3%; Mainframe Solutions decreased 2%; and Services decreased 4%. Q3 renewals were up approximately 30% in constant currency and in the low 20s as reported. The higher level of renewal bookings was driven by earlier-than-expected closing of some renewal transactions originally expected outside of Q3 as well as an increase in the average duration. Importantly, attach rates to these renewals were healthy. 
Renewal yield for the quarter was in the mid-80s. The lower-than-historical average renewal yield was a result of a large North American financial services customer transitioning to an application that requires fewer of our products to support. This transition was expected and previously factored into our fiscal year and medium-term guidance and expectations related to our Mainframe business. Excluding this transaction, our renewal yield was in the low 90s. We expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up approximately 30% year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2015 and up in the mid-20s range as reported. Excluding the large system integrator renewal that occurred in the second quarter, we now expect fiscal 2016 renewals to be up mid- to high single-digits and flat to up low single digits as reported. 
Q3 total new product and capacity sales were up just over 10% in constant currency and up mid-single digits as reported. The year-over-year increase was due to very strong performance from recent acquisitions, a higher level of renewal bookings growth with a healthy attach rate as well as a solid sales execution also has a positive effect. The outperformance in Q3 related to our expectations had smoothed that lumpiness we had expected between Q3 and Q4 due to the movement in the renewal portfolio. 
The Rally acquisition continues to perform well, with seat expansion within large enterprises and improvement in seat retention positively impacting performance. Total paid seat under contract at the end of Q3 increased in the high 20% range year-over-year. We defined a paid seat as a seat with a subscription or a support contract. As a reminder, we plan to phase out this metric as paid seat growth is not expected to be an accurate proxy for expected revenue growth as we penetrate our large platinum accounts. 
Acquisitions contributed approximately 10 points to total new sales growth in the quarter as reported and just above 10% in constant currency. Excluding acquisitions, for the first 9 months of fiscal year '16, total new sales were up low teens in constant currency and up mid-single digits as reported. 
Turning to geographies. New sales were strong in North America and EMEA, driven by stronger-than-expected performance from acquisitions and the timing of renewals. However, new sales were down in APJ and Latin America due to smaller renewal portfolios. Within our segments, Q3 Mainframe new sales, including new product and capacity, was up in the mid-teens year-over-year and up high single digits as reported. Overall, we continue to expect our Mainframe revenue to be down in the low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the mainframe market. 
Q3 Enterprise Solutions new product sales were up in the high single digits in constant currency and up low single digits as reported. Acquisitions contributed mid-teens growth in the quarter in both constant currency and as reported. Excluding acquisitions, for the first 9 months of FY '16, ES new sales were up mid-single digits in constant currency and down low single digits as reported. 
Services revenue decreased 4% in constant currency and 9% as reported. Over the long term, we expect Services revenue to decline as we design our products to be easier to install and as we leverage partners. Total revenue backlog improved to up 5% in constant currency or up 2% as reported. Current revenue backlog declined 2% in constant currency or down 5% as reported. As many of you know, current revenue backlog is impacted by the timing of deals in our renewal portfolio. As contracts move closer towards their renewals, revenue backlog declines. Current revenue backlog will likely grow when we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low 90s renewal yield. 
While the timing of some deals shifted from FY '17 into Q3, driven largely by customer requests, we continue to expect FY '17 to be a solid renewal year. We believe our customers' desire for MIPS capacity ahead of renewal expiration is a positive reflection on the strength of our current mainframe cycle. 
Q3 non-GAAP operating margin was 38%, and GAAP operating margin was 28%. Segment operating margin in the quarter were 61% for Mainframe Solutions, 12% for Enterprise Solutions and 6% for Services. Our Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was 29%, and our GAAP tax rate was 21%. Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.63, up 1% year-over-year, and includes a $0.02 benefit from the accelerated share repurchase in the quarter. Q3 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.52, up 18%, including a $0.02 benefit from accelerated share repurchase in the quarter. 
Our Q3 CFFO was $332 million, up 18% year-over-year or up 6% as reported. CFFO improved year-over-year due primarily to a decrease in vendor disbursements and payroll, partially offset by the decrease in cash collections due to an unfavorable effect on foreign exchange. Single installment cash payments were $125 million and up year-over-year but down for the first 9 months of fiscal year. We ended Q3 with approximately $250 million in net cash. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased 22 million shares for approximately $590 million as we accelerated and essentially completed our $1 billion share repurchase authorization. The Board of Directors authorized an additional $750 million share repurchase program, which we expect to begin to execute in FY '17. In Q3, we paid $105 million in dividends. We also announced a plan to increase the annual dividend from $1.00 to $1.02 in fiscal year 2017. Our balance sheet is strong and we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based on exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was December 31, 2015. The guidance also assumes no new material acquisitions. We expect currency to have a negative impact to our full year fiscal 2016 revenue of approximately 5 points at December 31 rates. For the year, the increased mix of ratable relative to upfront we experienced in the first half of the year has created a headwind to our reported revenue. We continue to expect total revenue to be towards the low end of our guidance of down 1% to flat in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of around $3.99 billion to $4.03 billion. Please note that the negative impact of foreign currency on our reported revenue outlook is approximately $200 million. The movement of some transactions from Q4 into Q3 has the effect of moderating our Q4 expectations, which we expect to weigh on metrics, including new sales, reported revenue, bookings, operating margin and EPS in Q4. We expect full year GAAP operating margin of 28% and full year non-GAAP operating margin of 38%, consistent with our prior expectations. 
Similar to our expectations for revenue, we believe operating margin will be negatively impacted by a higher mix of ratable revenue rather than upfront deals in the first half of the year. Keep in mind that our fiscal Q4 operating margins are likely to be the weakest of the year due to the seasonality of operating expenses. 
Underlying this guidance, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%, consistent with our prior expectations. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow between 4% to 7%. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.39 to $2.45. The negative impact of foreign currency on earnings per share is around $0.23. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 8% to 13%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.74 to $1.80. The diluted earnings per share estimate includes the impact of the accelerated share repurchase, which has a positive impact of approximately $0.03 and $0.04 to GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share respectively. 
At the end of the fiscal year, we expect approximately 412 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 427 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to increase 2% to 7% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $970 million to $1.02 billion. 
And now we'll take your questions."

But things sound pretty good here, but I guess, sort of, just when I look at some of the numbers, that's where I just start to wonder a little bit. And Rich, it's really more -- or Mike, around the mainframe. So I see like new sales being up in the mid-teens year-over-year, and high single digits on a reported basis and mid-teens in constant currency, but you still expect revenue to decline in low single digits over the medium term. So could you help us just sort of understand that? Because I think that in -- for a lot of investors, because mainframe is so relevant for you, they'd love to see that be relatively stable. But if the new business is up, you still expect it to decline over the medium term. That must mean that the renewals, and I don't know, maybe this quarter for mainframe is an anomaly. It certainly is -- you pointed that out. But maybe this quarter and quarters like that, I think, it was like 3 years ago, you had a similar issue. But it may have a big effect because I would think that -- well, first of all, would mainframe be a little more stable? I mean, when you hear that news sales are up, and as I think the second quarter in a row, it was up pretty good. And to hear that, that revenue is going to go down in the medium term, there seems to be somewhat of a disconnect or is it really just about the renewals? I'm sorry for the long-winded question."

So the quarter actually behaved a little differently than what we had said back last quarter and it behaved in a better way. So 2 pieces that were better, acquisitions clearly in total improved and the second part is the mainframe that you described. Those deals that were due to be renewed in Q4 and a couple deals that were in the first half of next year, customers are now getting our contracts in line with the MIPS they had purchased through IBM over the last year or 2. And you can see in the last quarter that they just announced they had another good quarter of MIPS growth. So we do expect that to come in over the length of these deals over the next 3 years, like we talked about, in fact, in November. The second part is though the renewal yield does need to be in that round 90% range. This quarter, we had anticipated that particular vendor to take off their mainframe and put in a non-mainframe product set. We knew that they'd been working on that for a few years. And so that was anticipated in both this year's guidance and our medium-term guidance. And as you said, that happens from time to time, is a single-digit kind of percentage where that happens. So we have that planned out over, and we can see that coming because it takes years for people to migrate away when they do choose to do so. As far as the total MIPS growth though for the quarter, it was very healthy, as you said, and that is a positive for us over time. We need MIPS to be growing in totality [ph], though at 20%-plus in order for us to have flat growth. So this is really in line with what we had anticipated, it's just a few quarters ahead, so it just really smoothes out the difference between Q3 and Q4."

Though I know you've been putting a lot of effort into trying to disconnect that, or not necessarily disconnect it, but sign more new business outside the renewal cycle and also sign with new customers. So in order for you to grow that new business, it sort of has to grow like, over time anyway, faster or better than the renewals. Is that a right way to think about it? And I'm sorry, go ahead."

And then our overall new sales growth, as you said, did happen because of the very strong performance cycle with Rally and Xceedium.

And any time you see someone using a mobile application to check maybe a checking account or their stock or anything else, that's driving a huge amount of back-end MIPS. They could be priced differently because they tend to be a little bit cheaper the way those MIPS are deployed, but it has a strong growth for the Mainframe business. If you ask about sort of the hybrid model, where IBM came out with their -- IBM's mainframe and the ability to use Linux, we also have products that do that. We announced one at CA World, so you'll see us putting on the mainframe, MIPS versus Linux, and that will continue to keep that cost of that hardware and everything attached to it very competitive in the marketplace. When you then asked the last question, who's really coming off? It's similar to what I said to John. We don't see a lot of large customers dropping their mainframe. In fact, we're seeing their capacity pick up. It tends to be at the very, very low end, a single application, on an older mainframe. So that's really that -- where we see that business and we haven't really seen that change much over the last couple of years.

So an example, any of the SaaS products, well, Rally continues to be a bigger piece of the portfolio in PPM. That will all be viewed in a ratable nature. The other thing is the products that are to be renewed. So in the mainframe in this particular quarter, as an example, had a lot of ratable nature to it. Xceedium, which is the other new acquisition, though, had a lot of stand-alone transactions as did our growth area, which you heard Mike talk about, the named accounts that grew 10%. So those tend to be more stand-alone transactions. Will that mix change over time? Yes. We saw a change in the first half of the year when more things went ratable. But this quarter, it kind of went back to more of a traditional mix. And I think next -- the quarter that we're currently in, seems to be shaping up to be more in that traditional mix. But as the product set becomes more ratable in nature, clearly, there will be less revenue that will be taken upfront. So I think that to net that out, you'll have certain products that are going to drive that, so as we grow with our SaaS products. But our portfolio will definitely drive certain products to go ratable. An example, all of mainframe and a lot of our traditional ES products."

So we've got an awful lot to work with that's already pretty much booked business that we really understand. We know how to close those types of transactions. It continues to be -- get high renewal yields in the low to mid-90s, and we don't see that changing. So that's a good basis point to start from. And then secondly, we have been building a much, much better increasing portfolio of products. When you take a look at the competitive wins we've been getting over the last 3 quarters -- I take a look at what's being built organically in our labs and the improvement we've had with respect to our organic engineering, I think that, that's a confidence factor. And then lastly is we're seeing a bit of a tipping point happen in the market, where customers are really starting to get aggravated with the integration of big parts of their infrastructure being done on their nickel and they're looking for suites. And when you take a look at how we go to market and the buckets of products we have, we are a suite player. And to the extent that we can get rid of all of the engineering in and around the integration of multiple products, I think that the net -- wind at our back. And I see this mostly right now in Security. When we are selling our Security products, it usually starts off as a very tactical sale. And as soon as that sale starts moving up the executive ladder and gets to a CISO or gets to a CFO or CEO, they don't want to talk about a tactical solution, they want to talk about how are you going to protect my company and how can you think about this more holistically. We've had a great quarter with Xceedium, and Xceedium is a great opportunity for us to have that conversation. It's not lost on anybody that most of the hacks that have happened over the last 1.5 years have happened by a privileged identity getting compromised. There is a tactical reach-out right now by just about every corporation to solve that particular problem. But as soon as you start having that conversation and you bring it up to an executive level, they expand it into ""How we are protecting the identities for our whole corporation?"" There's only a handful of companies in the world that can do that, and there's only a couple that can do that at scale. I think that we're very well-positioned for those kinds of competitive bids."

With respect to macro, we haven't seen any change in customer sentiment for the problems they're trying to solve. If you think about just about every single company, they're trying to be part of the Application Economy, so they are building applications. And if they're building applications, they're going to be using things like CA Agile management. They're going to be using testing tools that we have. They're going to be using service virtualization. They're going to want to instrument those applications and make sure that the hardware that they deploy them on has enough capacity, and if that hardware is bumping into problems, they're going to want to be notified about it. And obviously, they're going to want to be secured. So being in the right spot as everyone thinks towards the macro, how am I going to improve? The way that they're going to improve is by getting involved in the Application Economy. Now there is an -- also a lot of macro territorial issues. China has definitely been on the minds of just about everybody. And how do you think people are going to solve their issues in China? And China is a move into a consumer-oriented economy from an export economy. They're going to want to have all the things that you would expect the -- a G20 nation to have. They're going to want to have credit cards. They're going to want to have insurance. They're going to want to have cars. They're going to want to have electronic devices. All of that commerce is going to be built on the Application Economy as well. So I feel like we're very well-positioned strategically in macro in order to make that happen. And that is -- we haven't put out our FY '17 guidance yet. We'll do that after we finish up the year. But we'll take that all into consideration. But what I see right now is a bit of a blip and a little bit of a correction. The stuff that's getting corrected, I think everybody probably saw that it probably should get corrected. When you have a company like ours that makes money, you have a company like ours that has great customer service, you see a company like ours that invests $1 billion in real R&D, that's the kind of stability that I think customers are going to want to pay attention to."

262913,331122468,982020,"CA, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, May 11, 2016",2016-05-11,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report that we achieved full year results consistent with our guidance. Most performance metrics came in line or above the high end. Our FY '16 performance demonstrates progress in our ongoing work",1618,"Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report that we achieved full year results consistent with our guidance. Most performance metrics came in line or above the high end. Our FY '16 performance demonstrates progress in our ongoing work to reposition our product portfolio, refine our go-to-market strategy and intensely focus on customer experience and customer success. This effort has culminated in our first quarter revenue growth in nearly 4 years. However, our Q4 new sales execution was not as crisp as it could have been. A good reminded that we still have work to do. We believe we are poised to cross over into modest revenue growth for fiscal 2017, and over the medium term, deliver on our guidance of low single-digit growth. This is a big first step in our strategic goal of creating a company for long-term sustainable growth.
For the year, revenue, operating margin and EPS came in line with our guidance range, and CFFO exceeded the high end of the range. Total new sales of FY '16 were up low teens year-over-year, and organic new sales were up mid-single digits. This is the third consecutive year of step-function improvement in organic new sales.
For the year, API Management, Agile Central, PPM, Security and Mainframe were among the products that contributed to new sales growth. This broad-based improvement is encouraging and necessary to drive to sustain growth given the size and breadth of our portfolio. While we are pleased with our progress, there's still work to do to achieve the kind of sustainable growth our company is capable of delivering.
Turning to our Q4 results. Revenue grew 1% year-over-year. This is the first quarter of revenue growth CA has reported since Q1 in fiscal 2013. In the quarter, API Management, Agile Central, PPM and Release Automation all contributed to new sales growth, with each of these areas up double digits.
However, the timing of renewals and shorter duration impacted our overall Q4 new sales performance. Recall that the number of transactions we realized early in the year leaving less to close in Q4, as indicated in prior earnings calls. Regardless of the timing of transactions, we remain disciplined and committed to realizing the value we deliver to our customers.
As such, new sales were down high single digits year-over-year, in line with the renewal portfolio in Q4. While our freestanding Enterprise Solutions business grew in Q4 and named and growth or partner-led business increased low single digits, we are not satisfied. We should have done an even better job of closing more opportunities outside of our renewal portfolio. Our results reflect that we are unwilling to pull deals forward and discount aggressively to amplify the results of any specific quarter or fiscal year. We are managing the business for the long-term best interest of CA and our shareholders. 
Looking ahead, we will be agile and deliberate as we make the requisite modifications to optimize our performance. This ongoing self-evaluation and fast learning is increasingly part of our DNA.
Consistent with this discipline, we are continuing to focus on customer experience. It is a truly firmwide effort and one that we believe repositions CA from a software vendor to a technology partner. We see this ongoing effort as a way in which we are elevating our brand in the eyes of both current and potential customers and in turn, driving a broadening set of new sales opportunities.
I'd like to point out a few transactions from the quarter that highlight how we're enabling customers in their journey of digital transformation and providing competitive advantage in the Application Economy.
Last year, we piloted a customer experience program aimed at supporting customers to ensure they realize the value of their CA solutions. Part of maximizing value from software is ensuring that customers are employing the technology they have purchased and updating them to the latest releases with the best features. This effort has been so well-received that a global health insurance and benefits provider, a established customer across a number of our Enterprise Solutions offering, now enlists CA's Council on best practices with regard to our customer care and user experience initiative. They view CA as the gold standard by which other solutions providers are measured. This customer had deployments of both CA Agile Central as well as 2 other Agile management vendors. In the quarter, our sales team closed the deal, making CA Agile Central the enterprise standard for agile management. Our key competitive differentiation were: The compatibility and integration, opportunity between CA Agile Central and CA Project and Portfolio Management, platform scalability and a portfolio level analytics. This is a great example because it highlights the value customers see in integrated solutions from single vendors. It also demonstrates success in our land-and-expand strategy.
Another example of how we're enabling customers to thrive in the Application Economy is our relationship with a leader in the global money transfer space. This company has been around for more than a century and competes in today's incredibly fast-paced technology-enabled industry. With this continuous stream of new solutions for consumers and businesses, its DevOps vision and strategy are inseparable from its business outcomes. We are pleased that they have chosen to standardize on CA Release Automation to accelerate automation in their development processes driving faster speed and improve quality. The decision was made to expand CA Release Automation across the enterprise after achieving success with initial implementations. Our solution takes manual steps out of the development and deployment of applications. This allows the customer to broadly benefit from the reduced time, costs and risks associated with application development.
This opportunity came on the heels of our Release Automation Continuous Delivery Edition or CDE, which was made available in February. This is a great example of how our organic efforts can create customer value, which culminate in new and expanding opportunities for CA. Specifically, Release Automation CDE is an easily configurable, digital and strategic control point for optimizing processes, teams and applications. It supports collaboration and increases visibility while connecting delivered content with business goals.
As these customer examples demonstrate, the breadth and composition of our portfolio have become one of CA's competitive advantages. We remain committed to accelerating organic innovation. We are focused on creating meaningful solutions that are easier to install, easier to use and easier to manage. 
With the rollout of Agile Central across our development organization now essentially complete, we expect a more frequent cadence of higher-quality releases that delight, inspire enable our customers. 
While organic innovation remains a priority, I'm pleased to say that our acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium, now known as CA Agile Central and CA Privileged Access Management or PAM respectively, exceeded their business cases and our expectations. We believe our discipline, strategic and methodical approach to acquisitions and our thoughtful and deliberate integration execution is bearing fruit. They are enhancing our ability to provide valuable solutions to our customers. We are establishing a growing portfolio of products that are scalable, easy to install and easy to manage. This in turn will accelerate our ability to sell into our named and growth or partner-led opportunities.
For example, in the quarter, we won a competitive deal with the CA Privileged Access Management at an iconic American healthcare and consumer products company. Following a proof of concept, the customer was pleasantly surprised by their ability to rapidly deploy our CA PAM solution and take the demonstrate value.
Similarly, we closed an [indiscernible] management transaction with one of the largest SaaS companies in the world. After observing the value of CA API management in one of its acquired companies, a decision was made to expand its footprint. It is expected that billions of transactions will run through our API Management software by the end of the year.
Another named account win in the quarter was with a multinational pharmaceutical company that has chosen CA Project and Portfolio Management SaaS for its IT operations and interestingly, its M&A activities. We view all 3 of these examples as beachheads from which we can grow our relationships, provide increased value with our broader set of solutions and successfully execute our land-and-expand strategy. 
Our sales strategy, specifically of separation of platinum from named, growth and partner-led accounts is working. Though we are fully aware that there are areas around consistently and execution that we can continue to improve. On the marketing front, we have made considerable process to strengthen the image of CA's brand. There's strong evidence that our marketing programs are positively impacting consideration and accelerating our ability to build demand pipeline for our products.
As you may have seen, we are engaged with a technology partnership with CNN in its coverage of the presidential election. CNN is leveraging our technology to enable a new app, CNN Politics built with CA API Management and CA Mobile App Analytics. This enhances CNN's ability to provide their audience with a rich and immersive election experience, enabling them to more directly engage in one of the biggest conversations of the year in the U.S. and around the globe. We are making strides in changing the trajectory of CA. There are things we are proud of with regard to our execution in FY '16, and there are areas where I know we can continue to improve. We are making progress, but as I said before, progress is not linear. We will continue to manage the business with thoughtful discipline and continue to do what's in the best interest of our customers, employees and shareholders over the long term.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to review our fourth quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all our comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency, unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers",1379,"Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all our comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency, unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indication for the quarter and the fiscal year. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release.
Our Q4 total revenue was $1.01 billion and was up 1%. Enterprise Solutions increased 6%, Mainframe Solutions declined 2% and services were flat.
Fiscal 2016 total revenue was $4.03 billion, in line with our guidance of down 1% to flat. Enterprise Solutions were up 2%, Mainframe was down 2% and services declined 3%.
Q4 renewals were down approximately 10% and down low teens as reported. As Mike stated, we realized the number of renewal transactions earlier in the fiscal year, leaving less to close in Q4. This year-over-year change in our renewal bookings vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing and duration of large transactions. 
Q4 total new product and capacity sales were down high single digits and approximately 10% as reported. The acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium contributed high single digits to new sales in constant currency and as reported.
In the quarter, freestanding Enterprise Solutions new sales increased mid-single digits and increased low single digits as reported. Named and partner-led business increased low single digits in constant currency and declined low single digits as reported.
Our Q4 new sales performance was impacted by the headwinds of a smaller renewal portfolio as well as considerably shorter contract duration than we experienced in recent years.
Weighted average subscription and maintenance duration in Q4 was 2.66 years, down from 3.76 years in Q3, and the lowest it's been in recent quarters. Shorter duration in the quarter was driven by the composition of the portfolio that was up for renewal. A shorter average duration has impacted reducing the state of total value of bookings. To reiterate Mike's earlier comments, our new sales performance also reflects our discipline and general unwillingness to close deals earlier in the absence of compelling metrics for the sake of any quarter or year for that matter.
For the year, total new sales were up low teens, and organic new sales were up mid-single digits. As reported, total new sales were up mid-single digits and organic new sales were down low single digits for the year. As Mike mentioned, this is the third year in a row of notable organic new sales improvement.
Fiscal 2016 renewals were up approximately 30% and up mid-20s as reported, in line with our expectations. Excluding the large system integrator renewal that closed in Q2, renewals were up high single digits and low single digits as reported. Renewal yield during the quarter was in the mid-90s. Taking the average of the 4 quarters in the year, the renewal yield was just above [ph] 90%.
We expect fiscal 2017 renewals to be up mid-single digits year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2016 in constant currency and as reported.
Turning to geographies. Q4 new sales were down across all the regions. New sales in North America and EMEA, our 2 largest regions, were particularly impacted by the renewal portfolio during the quarter. However, for the full year, excluding the impact of currency, new sales were up in all of the geographies, with the exception of APJ. As reported, new sales were up in North America and Latin America and down in EMEA and APJ.
Within our segments, Q4 Enterprise Solutions' new product sales were down approximately 10% in constant currency and down low teens as reported. Areas such as API Management, Agile Central, PPM and Release Automation contributed to new sales in the quarter. However, as we discussed in the past within Enterprise Solutions, there are products in our enhance portfolio that are more mature and not growing but contribute to margin and cash flow. Acquisitions contributed high single digits in the quarter.
FY '16 Enterprise Solutions' new product sales were up high single digits in constant currency and up low single digits as reported. Excluding the acquisition of Rally and Xceedium, Enterprise Solutions' new sales in FY '16 were down low single digits in constant currency and down high single digits as reported.
In our Mainframe segment, Q4 Mainframe new sales, including new product capacity, were down low single digits in constant currency and down mid-single digits as reported, in line with our renewal portfolio.
Fiscal 2016 Mainframe new sales, including new product and capacity, were up in the mid-20s in constant currency and up in the high teens as reported. Overall, we expect our Mainframe revenue to decline in the low single digits over medium term, which we believe is in line with the mainframe market.
Services revenues was flat in Q4 and declined 3% for the year Over the long term, as our products become easier to install and we're able to better leverage partners, makes back our services revenue will not experience the growth we anticipate from our software solutions.
Current revenue backlog was down 1% in constant currency and was impacted by a lower renewal portfolio as discussed earlier. Current revenue backlog will likely grow after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low-90s renewal yield. Q4 non-GAAP operating margin was 38% and GAAP operating margin was 28%. Fiscal 2016 non-GAAP operating margin was 38% and GAAP operating margin was 28%. Fiscal 2016 segment operating margins were 10% for Enterprise Solutions, 61% for Mainframe Solutions and 7% for services.
Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was 31%. Our GAAP tax rate was 35%, and our fiscal 2016 non-GAAP and GAAP tax rates were 29%. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.60, up 21% year-over-year. Fiscal 2016 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.43, up 6% year-over-year. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.41, up 36%. Fiscal 2016 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.70, up 13%.
Our Q4 CFFO was $471 million, flat year-over-year. Same installment cash payments were $130 million and down year-over-year. Fiscal 2016 CFFO was $1.03 billion, up 9% and above our guidance of 2% to 7% year-over-year growth. We ended Q4 with approximately $720 million in net cash. During the fourth quarter, we did not repurchase any shares, consistent with our plan following the accelerated share repurchase in the prior quarter. We paid $104 million in dividends. In fiscal 2016, we repurchased $707 million in shares and paid $429 million in dividend, which in total represents over 100% of our free cash flow. We expect to begin to execute against our existing $750 million share repurchase authorization through the course of fiscal 2017.
At a minimum, we plan to offset dilution, and we maintain the flexibility to change pace opportunistically and due to market conditions.
Turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates in the last day of the preceding quarter, which was March 31, 2016, and does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions. Total revenue is expected to be flat to up 1% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.04 billion to $4.08 billion. We expect a full year non-GAAP operating margin of 38% and a full year GAAP operating margin of 30%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be between 28% and 29%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.51 to $2.56. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 3% to 6%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.92 to $1.97.
At year end, we expect approximately 410 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 414 million shares. We expect the share count to be a few million shares higher sequentially in Q1 due to annual stock trends and then trend down through the course of the year.
Cash flow from operations is expected to increase 1% to 5% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.06 billion to $1.1 billion.

Secondly is, as you know, I'm a big believer for a software company that organic development has to be a priority. I'm very impressed with the traction that the team has. I think this release -- I'm sorry, this the next probably 45 days will have somewhere between 10 and 14 new releases of our software, some of this is net new products.

Secondly is we're not just training our sales force, we're training our customers. If you take a look at the number of deals, it was our year-end. The trajectory or the pattern recognition of our customers is that CA will be desperate and be more willing to take weaker economics on deals. And you take a look at the work that Rich Beckert and Allan did. We just did not being deals from FY '17 into FY '16 to make a quarter or to make the year. And I think that, that trains both our sales force and it trains our customers that we are not going to give up on value that we think we have, especially with our new products.

The other part of that though, even though the renewal portfolio is a little bit lighter, kind of going back to what Mike and I talked about, the main part of our business continue to grow again. So we've now had every quarter where name continues to grow. And our ES freestanding actually grew mid-single digits. So we actually had some bright spots inside the portfolio for the quarter. But he overall, what was to be renewed, a lot of it was renewed in Q3 and in Q2. So it kind of came in just how we had anticipated. That's what we had said on our last call at the end of Q3.

And I think over time, that's where we're going to see the upside that we're really -- we're looking for is getting those net new customers with the land and expand transactions. If you look at the 2 examples, I specifically picked 2 examples in my prepared remarks that our small transactions that end up being multimillion dollar transactions, and this is what we are training our sales force to do.

The second thing when you look at the ES restating, as I said earlier, so that means deals sold outside the renewal, we're actually up mid single digits, which says we're growing with the market. And then the last part was the named and partners. The volume actually is up quite a bit year-over-year double-digit. Even when you back out the smaller -- let's say the old Rally smaller transactions, we're still up double-digit. So as Mike said, the land and expand that really saw in Q4, really were populating a lot of customers with smaller transaction sizes. So we're actually okay with how we thought that went. So in general, the quarter behaved exactly how we thought it would."

I'll do the last question first because it's the easiest. As we continue to make the portfolio more attractive where nothing is getting funded internally and our IT department is not being built using the Agile technology and the principles around that build is actually easy to use, easy to install, lower cost of ownership and easy to upgrade. So right from the get-go, those are the design principles being put into everything that we are doing from an organic perspective and that also goes with respect to a new releases. So new releases are -- have a very strong part of the engineering to make sure that they're easy to upgrade. But the portfolio is larger than ours. It's going to take time to get most of the portfolio into that state, but everything that we're doing right now and every single project is fully loaded into Agile Central. So we feel we've got great headlights into all the projects that are going on and we're truly only building things that matter. I think that the headlights into what's happening into development is the best that's been in the history of this company for sure and better than most companies I've seen. I've been in this business an awful long time. So I do think that what we're building really matters and we're going to see a lot more organic development. Now that's going to have a knock-on effect to our sales productivity. And right now some of our products require a fair bit of skill and a long sales cycle just due to the complexity and the product and the problem it solves. But as we start to think through that over time and we get releases that are easier to use, easier to sell, easier to upgrade, I think via my tough time it takes and the amount of total headcount to sell a particular transaction goes down. Take a look at Xceedium, our PAM solution. That is a solution that is low-cost -- lower cost of sale, easy to implement and low-cost -- high-value in short period of time for the customer. Rally, similar. As we start getting more and more of those solutions into the marketplace of our sales team, we're going to see benefits both on the volume and the velocity of sales, and we're also going to see that in the cost of sales."

And what we find with that is something to do with their install, how it was installed, did they even install it. By coming back around with them later on, what we're seeing is a better uptick in our renewals. If you noticed this quarter, we had a mid-90s renewals. It was a very strong renewal quarter. And for the year, on average of those 4 quarters, we were around 90% [ph]. So as long as we continue to see that track that way, as long as a lot of things Mike talked about earlier, year ability to install continue, we believe that we'll continue to have the renewal yields stay up in that range.

We're are also making sure that for every single customer that called the helpdesk, especially with the high severity issue, that they're getting turnaround time in 4 hours. Our Net Promoter Score gone up each and every quarter for the last 7 quarters since we've been tracking it. And I think the whole company focused on this is making a big difference. On the development side, we separated a full group out that's called customer experience, and what they're doing is we're all the user design as well as the usability of the product of new product development. So having a centralized group, making sure that a product that gets put into the market is easy-to-use, easy to understand and easy to install I think is going to have a lot of dividends going forward and we see from what that group's been able to do so far, we're very impressed."

262913,331122468,982255,"CA, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, May 11, 2016",2016-05-11,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report that we achieved full year results consistent with our guidance. Most performance metrics came in line or above the high end. Our FY '16 performance demonstrates progress in our ongoing work",1619,"Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report that we achieved full year results consistent with our guidance. Most performance metrics came in line or above the high end. Our FY '16 performance demonstrates progress in our ongoing work to reposition our product portfolio, refine our go-to-market strategy and intensely focus on customer experience and customer success. This effort has culminated in our first quarter revenue growth in nearly 4 years. However, our Q4 new sales execution was not as crisp as it could have been, a good reminder that we still have work to do. We believe we are poised to cross over into modest revenue growth for fiscal 2017 and, over the medium term, deliver on our guidance of low single-digit growth. This is a big first step in our strategic goal of creating a company for long-term sustainable growth.
For the year, revenue, operating margin and EPS came in line with our guidance range, and CFFO exceeded the high end of the range. Total new sales of FY '16 were up low teens year-over-year, and organic new sales were up mid-single digits. This is the third consecutive year of step-function improvement in organic new sales.
For the year, API Management, Agile Central, PPM, Security and Mainframe were among the products that contributed to new sales growth. This broad-based improvement is encouraging and necessary to drive sustained growth given the size and breadth of our portfolio. While we are pleased with our progress, there's still work to do to achieve the kind of sustainable growth our company is capable of delivering.
Turning to our Q4 results. Revenue grew 1% year-over-year. This is the first quarter of revenue growth CA has reported since Q1 in fiscal 2013. In the quarter, API Management, Agile Central, PPM and Release Automation all contributed to new sales growth, with each of these areas up double digits. However, the timing of renewals and shorter duration impacted our overall Q4 new sales performance. Recall that a number of transactions we realized early in the year, leaving less to close in Q4, as indicated in prior earning calls. Regardless of the timing of transactions, we remain disciplined and committed to realizing the value we deliver to our customers. As such, new sales were down high single digits year-over-year, in line with the renewal portfolio in Q4. While our freestanding Enterprise Solutions business grew in Q4 and named and growth or partner-led business increased low single digits, we are not satisfied. We should have done an even better job of closing more opportunities outside of our renewal portfolio. Our results reflect that we are unwilling to pull deals forward and discount aggressively to amplify the results of any specific quarter or fiscal year. We are managing the business for the long-term best interest of CA and our shareholders. 
Looking ahead, we will be agile and deliberate as we make the requisite modifications to optimize our performance. This ongoing self-evaluation and fast learning is increasingly part of our DNA. Consistent with this discipline, we are continuing to focus on customer experience. It is a truly firm-wide effort and one that we believe repositions CA from a software vendor to a technology partner. We see this ongoing effort as a way in which we are elevating our brand in the eyes of both current and potential customers and, in turn, driving a broadening set of new sales opportunities.
I'd like to point out a few transactions from the quarter that highlight how we are enabling customers in their journey of digital transformation and providing competitive advantage in the Application Economy.
Last year, we piloted a customer experience program aimed at supporting customers to ensure they realize the value of their CA solutions. Part of maximizing value from software is ensuring that customers are employing the technology they have purchased and updating them to the latest releases with the best features. This effort has been so well received that a global health insurance and benefits provider, an established customer across a number of our Enterprise Solutions offering, now enlists CA's counsel on best practices with regard to our customer care and user experience initiative. They view CA as the gold standard by which other solution providers are measured. This customer had deployments of both CA Agile Central as well as 2 other Agile management vendors. In the quarter, our sales team closed the deal, making CA Agile Central the enterprise standard for Agile management. Our key competitive differentiators were: the compatibility and integration opportunity between CA Agile Central and CA Project and Portfolio Management, platform scalability and a portfolio-level analytics. This is a great example because it highlights the value customers see in integrated solutions from single vendors. It also demonstrates success in our land-and-expand strategy.
Another example of how we're enabling customers to thrive in the Application Economy is our relationship with a leader in the global money transfer space. This company has been around for more than a century and competes in today's incredibly fast-paced, technology-enabled industry. With this continuous stream of new solutions for consumers and businesses, its DevOps' vision and strategy are inseparable from its business outcomes. We are pleased that they have chosen to standardize on CA Release Automation to accelerate automation in their development processes, driving faster speed and improved quality. The decision was made to expand CA Release Automation across the enterprise after achieving success with initial implementations. Our solution takes manual steps out of the development and deployment of applications. This allows the customer to broadly benefit from the reduced time, costs and risks associated with application development.
This opportunity came on the heels of our Release Automation Continuous Delivery Edition or CDE, which was made available in February. This is a great example of how our organic efforts can create customer value, which culminate in new and expanding opportunities for CA. Specifically, Release Automation CDE is an easily configurable, visual and strategic control point for optimizing processes, teams and applications. It supports collaboration and increases visibility while connecting delivered content with business goals.
As these customer examples demonstrate, the breadth and composition of our portfolio have become one of CA's competitive advantages. We remain committed to accelerating organic innovation. We are focused on creating meaningful solutions that are easier to install, easier to use and easier to manage. 
With the rollout of Agile Central across our development organization now essentially complete, we expect a more frequent cadence of higher-quality releases that delight, inspire and enable our customers. 
While organic innovation remains a priority, I'm pleased to say that our acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium, now known as CA Agile Central and CA Privileged Access Management or PAM, respectively, exceeded their business cases and our expectations. We believe our discipline, strategic and methodical approach to acquisitions and our thoughtful and deliberate integration execution is bearing fruit. They are enhancing our ability to provide valuable solutions to our customers. We are establishing a growing portfolio of products that are scalable, easy to install and easy to manage. This, in turn, will accelerate our ability to sell into our named and growth or partner-led opportunities.
For example, in the quarter, we won a competitive deal with the CA Privileged Access Management at an iconic American health care and consumer products company. Following a proof of concept, the customer was pleasantly surprised by their ability to rapidly deploy our CA PAM solution and quickly demonstrate value.
Similarly, we closed an API Management transaction with one of the largest SaaS companies in the world. After observing the value of CA API Management in one of its acquired companies, a decision was made to expand its footprint. It is expected that billions of transactions will run through our API Management software by the end of the year.
Another named account win in the quarter was with a multinational pharmaceutical company that has chosen CA Project and Portfolio Management SaaS for its IT operations and interestingly, its M&A activities. We view all 3 of these examples as beachheads from which we can grow our relationships, provide increased value with our broader set of solutions and successfully execute our land-and-expand strategy. 
Our sales strategy, specifically the separation of platinum from named, growth and partner-led accounts is working, though we are fully aware that there are areas around consistency and execution that we can continue to improve. On the marketing front, we have made considerable progress to strengthen the image of CA's brand. There's strong evidence that our marketing programs are positively impacting consideration and accelerating our ability to build demand pipeline for our products.
As you may have seen, we are engaged in a technology partnership with CNN in its coverage of the presidential election. CNN is leveraging our technology to enable a new app, CNN Politics, built with CA API Management and CA Mobile App Analytics. This enhances CNN's ability to provide their audience with a rich and immersive election experience, enabling them to more directly engage in one of the biggest conversations of the year in the U.S. and around the globe. We are making strides in changing the trajectory of CA. There are things we are proud of with regard to our execution in FY '16, and there are areas where I know we can continue to improve. We are making progress, but as I said before, progress is not linear. We will continue to manage the business with thoughtful discipline and continue to do what's in the best interest of our customers, employees and shareholders over the long term.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to review our fourth quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency, unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter and the fiscal year. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release.
Our Q4 total revenue was $1.01 billion and was up 1%. Enterprise Solutions increased 6%, Mainframe Solutions declined 2% and Services were flat.
Fiscal 2016 total revenue was $4.03 billion, in line with our guidance of down 1% to flat. Enterprise Solutions were up 2%, Mainframe was down 2%, and Services declined 3%.
Q4 renewals were down approximately 10% and down low teens as reported. As Mike stated, we realized the number of renewal transactions earlier in the fiscal year, leaving less to close in Q4. This year-over-year change in our renewal bookings vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing and duration of large transactions. 
Q4 total new product and capacity sales were down high single digits and approximately 10% as reported. The acquisition of Rally and Xceedium contributed high single digits to new sales in constant currency and as reported.
In the quarter, freestanding Enterprise Solutions' new sales increased mid-single digits and increased low single digits as reported. Named and partner-led business increased low single digits in constant currency and declined low single digits as reported.
Our Q4 new sales performance was impacted by the headwinds of a smaller renewal portfolio as well as considerably shorter contract duration than we had experienced in recent years.
Weighted average subscription and maintenance duration in Q4 was 2.66 years, down from 3.76 years in Q3 and the lowest it's been in recent quarters. Shorter duration in the quarter was driven by the composition of the portfolio that was up for renewal. A shorter average duration has the impact of reducing the stated total value of bookings. To reiterate Mike's earlier comments, our new sales performance also reflects our discipline and general unwillingness to close deals earlier in the absence of compelling metrics for the sake of any quarter or year for that matter.
For the year, total new sales were up low teens, and organic new sales were up mid-single digits. As reported, total new sales were up mid-single digits and organic new sales were down low single digits for the year. As Mike mentioned, this is the third year in a row of notable organic new sales improvement.
Fiscal 2016 renewals were up approximately 30% and up mid-20s as reported, in line with our expectations. Excluding the large system integrator renewal that closed in Q2, renewals were up high single digits and low single digits as reported. Renewal yield during the quarter was in the mid-90s. Taking the average of the 4 quarters in the year, the renewal yield was just above 90%. We expect fiscal 2017 renewals to be up mid-single digits year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2016 in constant currency and as reported.
Turning to geographies. Q4 new sales were down across all the regions. New sales in North America and EMEA, our 2 largest regions, were particularly impacted by the renewal portfolio during the quarter. However, for the full year, excluding the impact of currency, new sales were up in all of the geographies, with the exception of APJ. As reported, new sales were up in North America and Latin America and down in EMEA and APJ.
Within our segments, Q4 Enterprise Solutions' new product sales were down approximately 10% in constant currency and down low teens as reported. Areas such as API Management, Agile Central, PPM and Release Automation contributed to new sales in the quarter. However, as we discussed in the past, within Enterprise Solutions, there are products in our enhance portfolio that are more mature and not growing but contribute to margin and cash flow. Acquisitions contributed high single digits in the quarter.
FY '16 Enterprise Solutions' new product sales were up high single digits in constant currency and up low single digits as reported. Excluding the acquisition of Rally and Xceedium, Enterprise Solutions' new sales in FY '16 were down low single digits in constant currency and down high single digits as reported.
In our Mainframe segment, Q4 Mainframe new sales, including new product capacity, were down low single digits in constant currency and down mid-single digits as reported, in line with our renewal portfolio.
Fiscal 2016 Mainframe new sales, including new product and capacity, were up in the mid-20s in constant currency and up in the high teens as reported. Overall, we expect our Mainframe revenue to decline in the low single digits over medium term, which we believe is in line with the mainframe market.
Services revenues was flat in Q4 and declined 3% for the year. Over the long term, as our products become easier to install and we are able to better leverage partners, we expect our Services revenue will not experience the growth we anticipate from our software solutions.
Current revenue backlog was down 1% in constant currency and was impacted by a lower renewal portfolio as discussed earlier. Current revenue backlog will likely grow after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low-90s renewal yield. Q4 non-GAAP operating margin was 38% and GAAP operating margin was 28%. Fiscal 2016 non-GAAP operating margin was 38% and GAAP operating margin was 28%. Fiscal 2016 segment operating margins were 10% for Enterprise Solutions, 61% for Mainframe Solutions and 7% for Services.
Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was 31%. Our GAAP tax rate was 35%, and our fiscal 2016 non-GAAP and GAAP tax rates were 29%. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.60, up 21% year-over-year. Fiscal 2016 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.43, up 6% year-over-year. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.41, up 36%. Fiscal 2016 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.78, up 13%.
Our Q4 CFFO was $471 million, flat year-over-year. Single installment cash payments were $130 million and down year-over-year. Fiscal 2016 CFFO was $1.03 billion, up 9% and above our guidance of 2% to 7% year-over-year growth. We ended Q4 with approximately $720 million in net cash. 
During the fourth quarter, we did not repurchase any shares, consistent with our plan following the accelerated share repurchase in the prior quarter. We paid $104 million in dividends. In fiscal 2016, we repurchased $707 million in shares and paid $429 million in dividends, which in total represents over 100% of our free cash flow. We expect to begin to execute against our existing $750 million share repurchase authorization through the course of fiscal 2017.
At a minimum, we plan to offset dilution, and we maintain the flexibility to change pace opportunistically and due to market conditions.
Turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates in the last day of the preceding quarter, which was March 31, 2016, and does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions. 
Total revenue is expected to be flat to up 1% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.04 billion to $4.08 billion. We expect a full year non-GAAP operating margin of 38% and a full year GAAP operating margin of 30%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be between 28% and 29%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.51 to $2.56. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 3% to 6%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.92 to $1.97.
At year-end, we expect approximately 410 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 414 million shares. We expect the share count to be a few million shares higher sequentially in Q1 due to annual stock grants and then trend down through the course of the year.

Secondly is, as you know, I'm a big believer for a software company that organic development has to be a priority. I'm very impressed with the traction that the team has. I think this release -- I'm sorry, this -- the next probably 45 days, we'll have somewhere between 10 and 14 new releases of our software out. Some of this is net new products. So the organic engine is starting to -- is really starting to cook [ph], and we're going to continue to put as much fuel into that fire as possible. We've been very disciplined in acquisitions, and the acquisitions that we have purchased all have beat their plans that we put in place when we bought them. We'll continue to be very focused on having the discipline to pick the things that fit within our strategy rather than chasing deals, and we're going to continue to focus on developing talent inside the company and acquiring talent to help us move forward."

And I think if we were to have the relationships at the right level and we would have understood the buying patterns of those particular customers at the level of detail that we should have, I think we would have understood where those deals fit in the forecast. Secondly is we're not just training our sales force. We're training our customers. If you take a look at a number of deals, it was our year-end, the trajectory or the pattern recognition of our customers is that CA would be desperate and be more willing to take weaker economics on deals. And you take a look at the work that Rich Beckert and Adam did, we just did not being deals from FY '17 into FY '16 to make a quarter or to make a year. And I think that, that trains both our sales force and it trains our customers that we are not going to give up on value that we think we have, especially with our new products. So I think we can turn the crank on execution a little bit better, and I think that we have a great set of metrics and a great set of experiences in Q4 that it show us areas where we can improve.

The other part of that, though, and even though the renewal portfolio is a little bit later, kind of going back to what Mike had talked about, the main part of our business continue to grow again. So we've now had every quarter where named continues to grow, and our ES freestanding actually grew mid-single digits. So we actually had some bright spots inside the portfolio for the quarter. But the overall, what was to be renewed, a lot of it was renewed in Q3 and in Q2. So it kind of came in just how we had anticipated. It's what we had said on our last call at the end of Q3. And yes, it is of low renewal duration, but all that really shows is just when you have a little less Mainframe, they go a little less in length."

I'll give you the macro, and I'll let Rich talk about some specific areas. First of all, we are in a very competitive space, which means if you are going to be competing for business, you have to bring your compete level up, which means that you have to have intimate knowledge of your account and you have to have intimate knowledge of our products in those accounts. Areas where I saw deals slipped, I think that we should have known more and we should have relationships at higher levels and at a more detailed cadence. And I think that those are things we can work on. Now if you look on a global basis, we have lots and lots of transactions that absolutely follow that but we have to -- in the words of Vince Lombardi, ""You don't do things right some of the time. You do things right all the time."" And in our competitive space, enterprise software, we have to be more consistent on a global basis, and I think that we have an opportunity to turn the crank up on that a little bit. Now the second part, to your point, is in our named business. Our named business, definitely we had more transactions, and we're continuing to see the volume of that pick up, John. And I think over time, that's where we're going to see the upside that we're really -- we're looking for, is getting those net new customers with those land-and-expand transactions. If you look at the 2 examples, I specifically picked 2 examples in my prepared remarks that our small transactions that end up being multimillion dollar transactions, and this is what we're training our sales force to do. And we're also training our customers to understand how to look at CA in the context of some of our new software.

And then the last part was the named and partners. The volume actually is up quite a bit year-over-year double digit. Even when you back out the smaller -- let's say the old Rally smaller transactions, we're still up double digit.

But in general, we see that flattening out, and as I was trying to give you guys some headlights there, we have at least a 3% headwind just of what's coming into the portfolio.

I'll do the last question first because it's the easiest. As we continue to make the portfolio more attractive where nothing is getting funded internally and our IT department is not being built using the Agile methodology and the principles around that build is actually easy to use, easy to install, lower cost of ownership and easy to upgrade. So right from the get-go, those are the design principles being put into everything that we're doing from an organic perspective and that also goes with respect to new releases. So new releases are -- have a -- very strong part of the engineering to make sure that they're easy to upgrade, but the portfolio is larger than ours. It's going to take time to get most of the portfolio into that state, but everything that we're doing right now and every single project is fully loaded into Agile Central. So we feel we've got great headlights into all the projects that are going on, and we're truly only building things that matter. I think that the headlights into what's happening into development is the best that's been in the history of this company for sure and better than most companies I've seen. I've been in this business an awful long time. So I do think that what we're building really matters, and we're going to see a lot more organic development. Now that's going to have a knock-on effect to our sales productivity. And right now, some of our products require a fair bit of skill and a long sales cycle just due to the complexity of the product and the problem it solves. But as we start to think through that over time and we get releases out there that are easier to use, easier to sell, easier to upgrade, I think the amount of time it takes and the amount of total headcount to sell a particular transaction goes down. Take a look at Xceedium, our PAM solution. That is a solution that is a low cost -- a lower cost of sale, easy to implement and low cost -- high value in short period of time for the customer. Rally, similar. As we start getting more and more of those solutions into the marketplace of our sales team, we're going to see benefits both on the volume and velocity of sales, and we're also going to see that in the cost of sales."

By coming back around with them later on, what we're seeing is a better uptick in our renewals. If you noticed this quarter, we had a mid-90s renewals, which is a very strong renewal quarter. And for the year, on average of those 4 quarters, we were around 90%. So as long as we continue to see that track that way, as long as a lot of things Mike talked about earlier, your ability to install continue, we believe that we'll continue to have the renewal yields stay up in that range.

We're are also making sure that for every single customer that calls the help desk, especially with the high severity issue, that they're getting turnaround time in 4 hours. Our Net Promoter Score had gone up each and every quarter for the last 7 quarters since we've been tracking it, and I think the whole company focused on this is making a big difference. On the development side, we separated a full group out that's called customer experience, and what they're doing is reviewing all the user design as well as the usability of the product -- of new product development. So having a centralized group, making sure that a product that gets put into the market is easy to use, easy to understand and easy to install, I think, is going to have a lot of dividends going forward.

I'm pleased to report that we achieved full year results consistent with our guidance. Most performance metrics came in line or above the high end. Our FY '16 performance demonstrates progress in our ongoing work to reposition our product portfolio, refine our go-to-market strategy and intensely focus on customer experience and customer success. This effort has culminated in our first quarter revenue growth in nearly 4 years. However, our Q4 new sales execution was not as crisp as it could have been, a good reminder that we still have work to do. We believe we are poised to cross over into modest revenue growth for fiscal 2017 and, over the medium term, deliver on our guidance of low single-digit growth. This is a big first step in our strategic goal of creating a company for long-term sustainable growth.
For the year, revenue, operating margin and EPS came in line with our guidance range, and CFFO exceeded the high end of the range. Total new sales of FY '16 were up low teens year-over-year, and organic new sales were up mid-single digits. This is the third consecutive year of step-function improvement in organic new sales.
For the year, API Management, Agile Central, PPM, Security and Mainframe were among the products that contributed to new sales growth. This broad-based improvement is encouraging and necessary to drive sustained growth given the size and breadth of our portfolio. While we are pleased with our progress, there's still work to do to achieve the kind of sustainable growth our company is capable of delivering.
Turning to our Q4 results. Revenue grew 1% year-over-year. This is the first quarter of revenue growth CA has reported since Q1 in fiscal 2013. In the quarter, API Management, Agile Central, PPM and Release Automation all contributed to new sales growth, with each of these areas up double digits. However, the timing of renewals and shorter duration impacted our overall Q4 new sales performance. Recall that the number of transactions we realized early in the year, leaving less to close in Q4, as indicated in prior earning calls. Regardless of the timing of transactions, we remain disciplined and committed to realizing the value we deliver to our customers. As such, new sales were down high single digits year-over-year, in line with the renewal portfolio in Q4. 
While our freestanding Enterprise Solutions business grew in Q4 in named and growth or partner-led business increased low single digits, we are not satisfied. We should have done an even better job of closing more opportunities outside of our renewal portfolio. Our results reflect that we are unwilling to pull deals forward and discount aggressively to amplify the results of any specific quarter or fiscal year. We are managing the business for the long-term best interest of CA and our shareholders. 
Looking ahead, we will be agile and deliberate as we make the requisite modifications to optimize our performance. This ongoing self-evaluation and fast learning is increasingly part of our DNA. Consistent with this discipline, we are continuing to focus on customer experience. It is a truly firm-wide effort and one that we believe repositions CA from a software vendor to a technology partner. We see this ongoing effort as a way in which we are elevating our brand in the eyes of both current and potential customers and, in turn, driving a broadening set of new sales opportunities.
I'd like to point out a few transactions from the quarter that highlight how we are enabling customers in their journey of digital transformation and providing competitive advantage in the Application Economy.
Last year, we piloted a customer experience program aimed at supporting customers to ensure they realize the value of their CA solutions. Part of maximizing value from software is ensuring that customers are employing the technology they have purchased and updating them to the latest releases with the best features. This effort has been so well received that a global health insurance and benefits provider, an established customer across a number of our Enterprise Solutions offering, now enlists CA's counsel on best practices with regard to our customer care and user experience initiative. 
They view CA as the gold standard by which other solution providers are measured. This customer had deployments of both CA Agile Central as well as 2 other Agile management vendors. In the quarter, our sales team closed the deal, making CA Agile Central the enterprise standard for Agile management. Our key competitive differentiators were: the compatibility and integration opportunity between CA Agile Central and CA Project and Portfolio Management, platform scalability and a portfolio-level analytics. This is a great example because it highlights the value customers see in integrated solutions from single vendors. It also demonstrates success in our land-and-expand strategy.
Another example of how we're enabling customers to thrive in the Application Economy is our relationship with a leader in the global money transfer space. This company has been around for more than a century and competes in today's incredibly fast-paced, technology-enabled industry. With its continuous stream of new solutions for consumers and businesses, its DevOps' vision and strategy are inseparable from its business outcomes. We are pleased that they have chosen to standardize on CA Release Automation to accelerate automation in their development processes, driving faster speed and improved quality. The decision was made to expand CA Release Automation across the enterprise after achieving success with initial implementations. 
Our solution takes manual steps out of the development and deployment of applications. This allows the customer to broadly benefit from the reduced time, costs and risks associated with application development. This opportunity came on the heels of our Release Automation Continuous Delivery Edition or CDE, which was made available in February. This is a great example of how our organic efforts can create customer value, which culminate in new and expanding opportunities for CA. Specifically, Release Automation CDE is an easily configurable, visual and strategic control point for optimizing processes, teams and applications. It supports collaboration and increases visibility while connecting delivered content with business goals.
As these customer examples demonstrate, the breadth and composition of our portfolio have become one of CA's competitive advantages. We remain committed to accelerating organic innovation. We are focused on creating meaningful solutions that are easier to install, easier to use and easier to manage. 
With the rollout of Agile Central across our development organization now essentially complete, we expect a more frequent cadence of higher-quality releases that delight, inspire and enable our customers. 
While organic innovation remains a priority, I'm pleased to say that our acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium, now known as CA Agile Central and CA Privileged Access Management or PAM, respectively, exceeded their business cases and our expectations. We believe our disciplined, strategic and methodical approach to acquisitions and our thoughtful and deliberate integration execution is bearing fruit. They are enhancing our ability to provide valuable solutions to our customers. 
We are establishing a growing portfolio of products that are scalable, easy to install and easy to manage. This, in turn, will accelerate our ability to sell into our named and growth or partner-led opportunities. For example, in the quarter, we won a competitive deal with the CA Privileged Access Management at an iconic American health care and consumer products company. Following a proof of concept, the customer was pleasantly surprised by their ability to rapidly deploy our CA PAM solution and quickly demonstrate value.
Similarly, we closed an API Management transaction with one of the largest SaaS companies in the world. After observing the value of CA API Management in one of its acquired companies, a decision was made to expand its footprint. It is expected that billions of transactions will run through our API Management software by the end of the year.
Another named account win in the quarter was with a multinational pharmaceutical company that has chosen CA Project and Portfolio Management SaaS for its IT operations and interestingly, its M&A activities. We view all 3 of these examples as beachheads from which we can grow our relationships, provide increased value with our broader set of solutions and successfully execute our land-and-expand strategy. 
Our sales strategy, specifically the separation of platinum from named, growth and partner-led accounts is working, though we are fully aware that there are areas around consistency and execution that we can continue to improve. On the marketing front, we have made considerable progress to strengthen the image of CA's brand. There's strong evidence that our marketing programs are positively impacting consideration and accelerating our ability to build demand pipeline for our products.
As you may have seen, we are engaged in a technology partnership with CNN in its coverage of the presidential election. CNN is leveraging our technology to enable a new app, CNN Politics, built with CA API Management and CA Mobile App Analytics. This enhances CNN's ability to provide their audience with a rich and immersive election experience, enabling them to more directly engage in one of the biggest conversations of the year in the U.S. and around the globe. We are making strides in changing the trajectory of CA. There are things we are proud of with regard to our execution in FY '16, and there are areas where I know we can continue to improve. We are making progress, but as I said before, progress is not linear. We will continue to manage the business with thoughtful discipline and continue to do what's in the best interest of our customers, employees and shareholders over the long term.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to review our fourth quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency, unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and",1380,"Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency, unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter and the fiscal year. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release.
Our Q4 total revenue was $1.01 billion and was up 1%. Enterprise Solutions increased 6%, Mainframe Solutions declined 2% and Services were flat.
Fiscal 2016 total revenue was $4.03 billion, in line with our guidance of down 1% to flat. Enterprise Solutions were up 2%, Mainframe was down 2%, and Services declined 3%.
Q4 renewals were down approximately 10% and down low teens as reported. As Mike stated, we realized a number of renewal transactions earlier in the fiscal year, leaving less to close in Q4. This year-over-year change in our renewal bookings vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing and duration of large transactions. 
Q4 total new product and capacity sales were down high single digits and approximately 10% as reported. The acquisition of Rally and Xceedium contributed high single digits to new sales in constant currency and as reported.
In the quarter, freestanding Enterprise Solutions' new sales increased mid-single digits and increased low single digits as reported. Named and partner-led business increased low single digits in constant currency and declined low single digits as reported.
Our Q4 new sales performance was impacted by the headwinds of a smaller renewal portfolio as well as considerably shorter contract duration than we had experienced in recent years.
Weighted average subscription and maintenance duration in Q4 was 2.66 years, down from 3.76 years in Q3 and the lowest it's been in recent quarters. Shorter duration in the quarter was driven by the composition of the portfolio that was up for renewal. A shorter average duration has the impact of reducing the stated total value of bookings. To reiterate Mike's earlier comments, our new sales performance also reflects our discipline and general unwillingness to close deals earlier in the absence of compelling metrics for the sake of any quarter or year for that matter.
For the year, total new sales were up low teens, and organic new sales were up mid-single digits. As reported, total new sales were up mid-single digits and organic new sales were down low single digits for the year. As Mike mentioned, this is the third year in a row of notable organic new sales improvement.
Fiscal 2016 renewals were up approximately 30% and up mid-20s as reported, in line with our expectations. Excluding the large system integrator renewal that closed in Q2, renewals were up high single digits and low single digits as reported. Renewal yield during the quarter was in the mid-90s. Taking the average of the 4 quarters in the year, the renewal yield was just above 90%. We expect fiscal 2017 renewals to be up mid-single digits year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2016 in constant currency and as reported.
Turning to geographies. Q4 new sales were down across all the regions. New sales in North America and EMEA, our 2 largest regions, were particularly impacted by the renewal portfolio during the quarter. However, for the full year, excluding the impact of currency, new sales were up in all of the geographies, with the exception of APJ. As reported, new sales were up in North America and Latin America and down in EMEA and APJ.
Within our segments, Q4 Enterprise Solutions' new product sales were down approximately 10% in constant currency and down low teens as reported. Areas such as API Management, Agile Central, PPM and Release Automation contributed to new sales in the quarter. However, as we discussed in the past, within Enterprise Solutions, there are products in our enhance portfolio that are more mature and not growing but contribute to margin and cash flow. Acquisitions contributed high single digits in the quarter.
FY '16 Enterprise Solutions' new product sales were up high single digits in constant currency and up low single digits as reported. Excluding the acquisition of Rally and Xceedium, Enterprise Solutions' new sales in FY '16 were down low single digits in constant currency and down high single digits as reported.
In our Mainframe segment, Q4 Mainframe new sales, including new product capacity, were down low single digits in constant currency and down mid-single digits as reported, in line with our renewal portfolio.
Fiscal 2016 Mainframe new sales, including new product and capacity, were up in the mid-20s in constant currency and up in the high teens as reported. Overall, we expect our Mainframe revenue to decline in the low single digits over medium term, which we believe is in line with the Mainframe market.
Services revenues was flat in Q4 and declined 3% for the year. Over the long term, as our products become easier to install and we are able to better leverage partners, we expect our Services revenue will not experience the growth we anticipate from our software solutions.
Current revenue backlog was down 1% in constant currency and was impacted by a lower renewal portfolio as discussed earlier. Current revenue backlog will likely grow after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low-90s renewal yield. Q4 non-GAAP operating margin was 38% and GAAP operating margin was 28%. Fiscal 2016 non-GAAP operating margin was 38% and GAAP operating margin was 28%. Fiscal 2016 segment operating margins were 10% for Enterprise Solutions, 61% for Mainframe Solutions and 7% for Services.
Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was 31%. Our GAAP tax rate was 35%, and our fiscal 2016 non-GAAP and GAAP tax rates were 29%. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.60, up 21% year-over-year. Fiscal 2016 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.43, up 6% year-over-year. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.41, up 36%. Fiscal 2016 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.78, up 13%.
Our Q4 CFFO was $471 million, flat year-over-year. Single installment cash payments were $130 million and down year-over-year. Fiscal 2016 CFFO was $1.03 billion, up 9% and above our guidance of 2% to 7% year-over-year growth. We ended Q4 with approximately $720 million in net cash. 
During the fourth quarter, we did not repurchase any shares, consistent with our plan following the accelerated share repurchase in the prior quarter. We paid $104 million in dividends. In fiscal 2016, we repurchased $707 million in shares and paid $429 million in dividends, which in total represents over 100% of our free cash flow. We expect to begin to execute against our existing $750 million share repurchase authorization through the course of fiscal 2017.
At a minimum, we plan to offset dilution, and we maintain the flexibility to change pace opportunistically and due to market conditions.
Turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates in the last day of the preceding quarter, which was March 31, 2016, and does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions. 
Total revenue is expected to be flat to up 1% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.04 billion to $4.08 billion. We expect a full year non-GAAP operating margin of 38% and a full year GAAP operating margin of 30%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be between 28% and 29%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.51 to $2.56. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 3% to 6%. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.92 to $1.97.
At year-end, we expect approximately 410 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 414 million shares. We expect the share count to be a few million shares higher sequentially in Q1 due to annual stock grants and then trend down through the course of the year.
Cash flow from operations is expected to increase 1% to 5% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.06 billion to $1.1 billion.

Secondly is, as you know, I'm a big believer for a software company that organic development has to be a priority. I'm very impressed with the traction that the team has. I think this release -- I'm sorry, this -- the next probably 45 days, we'll have somewhere between 10 and 14 new releases of our software out. Some of this is net new products. So the organic engine is starting to -- is really starting to cook, and we're going to continue to put as much fuel into that fire as possible.

And at the end of the quarter, we had a number of slipped deals that we thought should have closed in the quarter. And I think if we were to have the relationships at the right level and we would have understood the buying patterns of those particular customers at the level of detail that we should have, I think we would have understood where those deals fit in the forecast. Secondly is we're not just training our sales force. We're training our customers. If you take a look at a number of deals, it was our year-end, the trajectory or the pattern recognition of our customers is that CA would be desperate and be more willing to take weaker economics on deals. And if you take a look at the work that Rich Beckert and Adam did, we just did not being deals from FY '17 into FY '16 to make a quarter or to make a year. And I think that, that trains both our sales force and it trains our customers that we are not going to give up on value that we think we have, especially with our new products.

The other part of that, though, and even though the renewal portfolio is a little bit lighter, kind of going back to what Mike had talked about, the named part of our business continue to grow again. So we've now had every quarter where named continues to grow, and our ES freestanding actually grew mid-single digits. So we actually had some bright spots inside the portfolio for the quarter. But the overall, what was to be renewed, a lot of it was renewed in Q3 and in Q2. So it kind of came in just how we had anticipated. It's what we had said on our last call at the end of Q3. And yes, it is of low renewal duration, but all that really shows is just when you have a little less Mainframe, they go a little less in length."

I'll give you the macro, and I'll let Rich talk about some specific areas. First of all, we are in a very competitive space, which means if you are going to be competing for business, you have to bring your compete level up, which means that you have to have intimate knowledge of your accounts and you have to have intimate knowledge of our products in those accounts. Areas where I saw deals slip, I think that we should have known more and we should have relationships at higher levels and at a more detailed cadence. And I think that those are things we can work on. Now if you look on a global basis, we have lots and lots of transactions that absolutely follow that but we have to -- in the words of Vince Lombardi, ""You don't do things right some of the time. You do things right all the time."" And in our competitive space, enterprise software, we have to be more consistent on a global basis, and I think that we have an opportunity to turn the crank up on that a little bit. Now the second part, to your point, is in our named business. Our named business, definitely we had more transactions, and we're continuing to see the volume of that pick up, John. And I think over time, that's where we're going to see the upside that we're really -- we're looking for, is getting those net new customers with those land-and-expand transactions. If you look at the 2 examples, I specifically picked 2 examples in my prepared remarks that are small transactions that end up being multimillion dollar transactions, and this is what we're training our sales force to do. And we're also training our customers to understand how to look at CA in the context of some of our new software. Rich has some detail on some of the renewal portfolio that he can bring up -- bring you up to speed on."

Even when you back out the smaller -- let's say the old Rally smaller transactions, we're still up double digit.

And that was a completely seamless digital transaction where it had no sales with this, so the first time we've done that. And that's a great indication of getting those pipes built because we really do believe that there's going to be a portion of our portfolio that has to be that seamless and our ability to use it that way, but it's going to take some time. When you take a look at flagship-type products, take a look at PPM, it's #1 in its category, pure-play, on-demand software that is heralded by customers all over the world and has the scale to do the project and portfolio management. Rally is on a great SaaS platform. We continue to be amazed at how thoughtful that team put together that platform and how easy it is for our sales force.

I'll do the last question first because it's the easiest. As we continue to make the portfolio more attractive where nothing is getting funded internally and our IT department is not being built using the Agile methodology and the principles around that build is, it has to be easy to use, easy to install, lower cost of ownership and easy to upgrade. So right from the get-go, those are the design principles being put into everything that we're doing from an organic perspective and that also goes with respect to new releases. So new releases are -- have a -- very strong part of the engineering to make sure that they're easy to upgrade. With a portfolio as large as ours, it's going to take time to get most of the portfolio into that state, but everything that we're doing right now and every single project is fully loaded into Agile Central. So we feel we've got great headlights into all the projects that are going on, and we're truly only building things that matter. I think that the headlights into what's happening into development is the best that's been in the history of this company for sure and better than most companies I've seen. I've been in this business an awful long time. So I do think that what we're building really matters, and we're going to see a lot more organic development. Now that's going to have a knock-on effect to our sales productivity. And right now, some of our products require a fair bit of skill and a long sales cycle just due to the complexity of the product and the problem it solves. But as we start to think through that over time and we get releases out there that are easier to use, easier to sell, easier to upgrade, I think the amount of time it takes and the amount of total headcount to sell a particular transaction goes down. Take a look at Xceedium, our PAM solution. That is a solution that is a low cost -- a lower cost of sale, easy to implement and low cost -- high value in short period of time for the customer. Rally, similar. As we start getting more and more of those solutions into the marketplace of our sales team, we're going to see benefits both on the volume and velocity of sales, and we're also going to see that in the cost of sales."

The second part of that is we've done a lot of reaching out to customers who were dissatisfied to find out why they were dissatisfied. And what we find with that is sometimes it has to do with their install, how it was installed, did they even install it. By coming back around with them later on, what we're seeing is a better uptick in our renewals. If you noticed this quarter, we had a mid-90s renewals, which is a very strong renewal quarter. And for the year, on average of those 4 quarters, we were around 90%. So as long as we continue to see that track that way, as long as a lot of things Mike talked about earlier, your ability to install continue, we believe that we'll continue to have the renewal yields stay up in that range. And as long as we grow with the market like we talked about back in November, we think we'll be on track."

For example, we have a team that goes through that is not in development and/or sales crawling back into some of our customers in the finance organization, in the HR organization just polling customers to see what they think of CA and what they can do following the Net Promoter Score algorithm. We're are also making sure that for every single customer that calls the help desk, especially with the high severity issue, that they're getting turnaround time in 4 hours. Our Net Promoter Score has gone up each and every quarter for the last 7 quarters since we've been tracking it, and I think the whole company focused on this is making a big difference. On the development side, we separated a full group out that's called customer experience, and what they're doing is reviewing all the user design as well as the usability of the product -- of new product development. So having a centralized group, making sure that a product that gets put into the market is easy to use, easy to understand and easy to install, I think, is going to have a lot of dividends going forward. And from what we've seen from what that group's been able to do so far, we're very impressed."

Our Q1 revenue grew year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter. Revenue improvement was broad-based with growth across all geographies. Our Q1 results give us an improved confidence in our ability to cross over into modest growth for the full year in 2017. 
As you read in the press release, Rich Beckert is retiring after a decade of service to the company. Rich joined CA in 2006 and has played an important role in CA's evolution. I'd like to thank Rich for his many contributions over the years. He has been instrumental in implementing processes and instilling discipline that have helped lay the foundation upon which the company can grow. While we undertake a search for Rich's replacement, Kieran McGrath, CA's Corporate Controller, has been named interim CFO, reporting to me. Kieran was the finance lead of IBM's $25 billion global software business and brings a wealth of financial and operational and transformational management experience. We also announced that Adam Elster and Ayman Sayed have been named President, Global Field Operations and President, Chief Product Officer, respectively. This fine-tuning of our organizational structure further strengthens and integrates sales and product, 2 areas that are key to our growth. This level of collaboration ensures that our development and go-to-market efforts are completely aligned to customer end market demand. 
Turning to the quarter. New sales were up significantly higher than we had expected. Total new sales increased more than 50% and organic new sales increased in the high 20s. A big driver of Q1 new sales growth was a transaction with the large system integrator or SI that was originally slated to expire in FY '18. We are pleased with the metrics of this 7-year deal, which had a healthy attach rate and enabled CA to gain wallet share. 
Excluding this early renewal, total new sales increased in the high single digits year-over-year. New sales in the quarter also benefited from deals that slipped from Q4 last year into Q1 this year. 
Mainframe new sales increased well over 100% year-over-year. Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the low 20s year-over-year. From a product perspective, the greatest contributors to new sales growth in the first quarter were Mainframe, Security, Agile Central, PPM, UIM and APM. 
Overall, I'm very happy with our first quarter results. Our revenue grew nearly 3%. We delivered very good margin performance despite a difficult year-over-year compare, which drove solid EPS and CFFO. 
Looking ahead to Q2, please remember that Q2 of fiscal year 2016 included a large SI renewal with incredibly strong metrics, which creates a very difficult compare next quarter. 
Turning to our products. Q2 marks the anniversary of our acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium. Both acquisitions continue to perform well and their performance has accelerated beyond preacquisition run rates. That said, there is still ample runway ahead for each of these acquisitions to reach their full potential. In the quarter, as part of the large SI deal, CA Privileged Access Management or PAM closed the single largest deal in Xceedium's history both pre-and post-acquisition. It was selected over other competitors to become the standard for the large SI to leverage across its more than 1,000 global customers. Separately, CA PAM displaced an incumbent at a large American multinational telecommunications company due to CA PAM's strength in password management. Our performance this quarter demonstrates our strategy of acquiring great technology and leveraging our relationships to accelerate growth. This is one of the reasons why we are committed to M&A as part of our 3 leg of capital allocation strategy. Clearly, we are very happy with our recent acquisitions. 
Meanwhile, we remain committed to cultivating the spirit of innovation at CA. Unified Infrastructure Management or UIM for cloud launched at the end of the quarter. It is a great example of how we're executing to our strategic imperative to innovate organically. UIM is a market-leading cloud-monitoring solution that showcases CA position as a platform agnostic solutions provider. With our new UIM for cloud release, CA now supports Amazon Web Services, OpenStack, Docker, Nutanix, and PureStorage for private and public cloud as well as on-premise. Many of our customers see CA Unified Infrastructure management at the heart of their cloud strategy. Our new capabilities supporting Amazon Web Services and OpenStack are essential in helping to optimize customer workloads. We are pleased that IT Central Station, a leading crowd sourced product review site for enterprise technology, named CA UIM as the #1 solution for cloud monitoring. 
Project and portfolio management or PPM is another area that has consistently been a bright spot and serves as a quick example of organic innovation. PPM had a good first quarter with new sales up mid-single digits year-over-year. In the quarter, there were a number of 6-figure transactions that closed, 3 of which were brand-new customers to the platform. We often win because of PPM's superior functionality, which is encouraging and highlights the value our internal development teams can bring to market. PPM new sales have grown in 4 of the 5 most recent quarters. We are pleased that in our first quarter, CA was named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for IT Project and Portfolio Management Software Applications. 
I'd also like to take the opportunity to call out the exceptional quarter Mainframe had in Q1. I am very pleased with both Mainframe new sales and revenue performance in the quarter. As one of the few software solutions providers investing in the Mainframe, CA is a trusted partner to many of the largest enterprises around the world. One of our key competitive advantages at our largest customers is our combined enterprise and Mainframe Solutions portfolio. Our customers are challenged to manage increasingly complex, heterogeneous, public, private, hybrid cloud and on-premise environment. Our combined enterprise and Mainframe Solutions segments enable us to strategically partner with customers to develop innovative solutions that solve some of the most complicated problems that span multiple platforms. Many of our customers benefit from the ability of CA to manage their entire infrastructure stack across distributed, cloud and mainframe. The positive impact this has an our customers is notable. It lowers our customers' cost of ownership and shortens the time it takes to find and resolve issues. From global financial institutions and industrial conglomerates to governments and telecom companies, enterprises around the world employ a combination of CA's cross-platform solutions and leverage the synergies between our Mainframe and Enterprise Solutions products. The interplay between Mainframe and enterprise enables CA to cost-effectively bring new innovation to the mainframe market. This supports our customers commitment to the platform. It also supports a seamless user experience by making it much easier for customers to manage instead of coordinating a number of disparate point solution vendors. There is no doubt that we are continuing to make progress towards our goal of building this company for long-term sustainable growth. Our development organization continues to improve as we focus on making products that matter with improved user interfaces that are easy to deploy and easy to manage. Success here will better enable us to leverage channel opportunities and grow through alternative routes to market. 
Our sales organization has also seen considerable improvement. For example, looking at our platinum Net Promoter Score or NPS, which is based on a survey designed to measure the willingness of customers to recommend CA to other customers, our scores continue to trend positively. More broadly, our customer satisfaction scores are also following a similar positive trajectory. We know that when we are at our best, we are customer-centric, results focused, self-aware and agile. While our performance in growth, our partner-led businesses, went uneven in Q1, we continue to view this as a significant opportunity for CA to meaningfully expand our market reach. We have just started to the scratch the surface. We will continue to make adjustments in the Agile and our approach to driving continuous improvement throughout the organization. 
Overall, I am very encouraged by our progress across a number of fronts. But as I said before, progress will not be linear. We have had a very good Q1, but we face an incredibly difficult new sales compare in Q2. We are on a journey to transform this company to one of sustainable long-term growth. We still have work to do. 
That said, I'd like to be the first invite you to come and see some of the fruits of this work at CA World this year. We will host a financial analyst track on November 16th, which will provide a great opportunity to speak with a number of people on our executive team; experience a broad array of our solutions in action; and hear what our customers are saying first-hand. And there really is no better way to fully capture the CA picture than to experience CA World for yourself. We'll be sending out candidates with a registration link shortly. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to review our first quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

As Mike mentioned, after 10 years here at CA, I am announcing my retirement. I am proud to have been a part of substantial change that's taken place over the years and to be in a position to leave CA in capable hands. I am confident that a solid foundation is in place to support the next phase of CA's journey. 
As usual, before we get started with a quarterly review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency, unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I am going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found on our supplemental and press release. 
Our Q1 total revenue was $999 million and up 3% in constant currency and 2% as reported. As Mike mentioned, this was the second consecutive quarter we've grown revenue year-over-year in constant currency. Q1 Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 10%. Mainframe Solutions decreased 1% and Services declined 2%. Q1 total new product and capacity sales were up in the mid-50s and low 50s as reported. Organic sales were up high 20s and mid-20s as reported. Both organic and inorganic new sales were driven by the SI. The large system integrator contributed high 40s to the total new sales growth. Acquisitions contributed high 20s to total new sales growth. The increase in Q1 total new sales, excluding the large SI, was primarily due to Mainframe Solutions new product sales. 
Q1 renewals more than doubled year-over-year, both in constant currency and as reported. As we have previously stated, the year-over-year change in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions. The large system integrator transaction replaced an existing deal that was scheduled to expire in fiscal 2018. This new transaction provided an incremental contract value in excess of $475 million and extent extended the agreement an additional 5 years. As such, we now expect fiscal 2017 renewals to be up in the high teens year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2016 in constant currency and as reported. 
Renewal yield for the quarter was in the low 90s [ph] percent range, in line with our long-term target. 
Turning to geographies. New sales were particularly strong in North America driven by the large system integrator transaction. New sales were also strong in EMEA. However, new sales were down in APJ and down sharply in Latin America due to continued macroeconomic challenges in the region. 
As Mike mentioned, revenue grew across all geographies in constant currency. On an as-reported basis, revenue grew across all geographies except Latin America, where revenue decreased slightly. 
Within our segments, Mainframe new sales more than doubled year-over-year in constant currency and as reported. The large SI transaction contributed slightly more than 100% of the greater than 150% Mainframe Solutions new product sales growth. Overall, we continue to expect our Mainframe revenue to be down in the low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the Mainframe. 
Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the low 20s year-over-year in constant currency and as reported. The large SI contributed in the high 20s to Enterprise Solutions new product sales growth. Areas such as Security, Agile Central, PPM, UIM and APM contributed to the new sales growth in the quarter. However, as we discussed in the past, within Enterprise Solutions, there are products in our enhanced portfolio that are more mature and not growing, but contribute to margin and cash flow. Acquisitions contributed mid-30s to new sales growth within Enterprise Solutions and were a notable contributor to the value we were delivering with the large SI transaction. 
Services revenue decreased 2% in constant currency to 3% as reported. Over the long term, we expect Services revenue to decline as we design our parts to be easier to install and as we leverage partners. 
Total revenue backlog improved to up 15% in constant currency and up 14% as reported. Current revenue backlog improved to flat in constant currency and as reported. As we said in the past, current revenue backlog will likely grow after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low 90s renewal yield. We expect current revenue backlog to fluctuate this year. 
Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 39% and GAAP operating margin was 29%. Operating margin declined year-over-year primarily due to the impact of a favorable legal development in the year-ago period. 
Segment operating margins in the quarter were 62% [ph] from Mainframe Solutions, 13% for Enterprise Solutions and 3% for Services. Our Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 29%. Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.64, [ph] down 2% year-over-year and flat as reported. Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.47, down 4% and flat year-over-year as reported. 
Our Q1 CFFO was $161 million, down 10% year-over-year or down 14% as reported. CFFO declined year-over-year due to the timing of cash taxes, which were lower in the year-ago period. Single installment cash payments were $23 million, down year-over-year. We ended Q1 with approximately $688 million in net cash. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased $50 [ph] million in shares and paid $107 million in dividends. We have $700 million remaining in our original $750 [ph] million share repurchase authorization. 
As Mike said, our uneven performance in some product areas and in named and growth and partner-led opportunities are places we are focusing as we continue on this journey to transform the company to one that can sustainably grow as we continue to work to improve efficiency and productivity within our development organization. Simultaneously, we are working to 
drive continuous improvements across our sales organization so that consistency and velocity trend in the right direction across all geographies. 
Overall, we are getting better, but we have not across the chasm. It is important to note the current backlog revenue backlog was flat in the quarter, consistent with our prior commentary. We expect backlog will fluctuate through the year. The large SI deal that was signed in Q1 was great for CA, with total deal size, aggregate revenue run rate, associated renewal yield all representing very good metrics for us. While the large SI deal had no impact to Q1 revenue and minimal impact to current backlog, it does substantially shift the renewal portfolio such that FY '17 is now significantly larger and FY '18 is naturally much lighter. Consequently, fiscal 2018 renewals are expected to decline year-over-year due to the timing of the large SI. Otherwise, the renewal portfolio is substantially unchanged relative to our prior expectations. 
As Mike mentioned, Q2 will be challenged by an extremely difficult compare due to the large SI that renewed in the year-ago period. This will be particularly evident in the new sales, which are expected to decline sharply. Conversely, we had acquisition-related expenses that should create a more favorable year-over-year compare from an operating margin perspective. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based on exchange rates of the last day of the preceding quarter, which was June 30, 2016. The guidance also assumes no material acquisitions. For the full year, we continue to expect total revenue to be in the range of flat to up 1% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of around $4.03 billion to $4.07 billion. We expect a full year non-GAAP operating margin of 38% and a GAAP full year operating margin of 29% compared to prior GAAP operating margin guidance of 30%. GAAP operating margin and EPS guidance reflects the impact of the increase in our share price on stock-based compensation. We expect our non-GAAP and GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%, consistent with our prior expectations. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.49 to $2.54. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 2% to 5% compared to prior guidance of 3% to 6%. The change in our GAAP growth expectations reflects the impact of the increase in our stock price on stock-based compensation. As mentioned earlier, this translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.80 [ph] to $1.93. 
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 411 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 414 million shares. Cash from operations is expected to increase 1% to 5% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.05 billion to $1.09 billion.

With respect to the large transaction, first of all, this was not something that we orchestrated at the request of the customer and in an effort to support their business, but it ended up being a very tightly renegotiated contract that have excellent metrics. We added [ph] $425 million worth of net new value at contracts -- sorry, it's $475 million of net new value and it takes out for 7 years. And when you take a look at this particular system integrator, this -- our technology is going to be installed at over 1,000 customers. And it is a lot of our new technology, for example, PAM, the Privileged Access Management is part of that transaction, which we think is top of mind for most companies right now. And having that installed in that many particular account, I think, is tremendous for us. The other thing that's significant is we've locked up our 3 biggest customers for almost 5 years now. That gives us a lot of visibility and it gives us an awful lot of software running and an awful lot of customers, where we have an opportunity to extend those relationships over time. So it's a pretty significant transaction as you can tell by the size of that and how it's affected our operating metrics. And I couldn't be happier with the team that negotiated and I really do like the characteristics of the transaction."

The hardest thing for us to do is to sell new software to a net new customer. Almost all of our energy for new on the product side, on the marketing side, on the sales side is equipping that sales team with the tools and capabilities to be able to sell our products into customers where we don't have a significant relationship. Now the volume of transaction is going -- are going up and I'm pretty pleased with that. But we need to have more product and we have to have more customers binding in that space. I think, there's things that we can do product-wise. I think, there's things that we can do marketing-wise with our compete level. And I also think there's things we can do from a sales effectiveness perspective to make that more repeatable over time. And, it really does lead into how I've changed the tone with respect to product and sales. I think, this is not a unique issue with respect to CA. I think this is an industry issue. Customers today, they want to talk to sales professional that really understand them and their line of business and how our products work in the context of their operation. That's why you see so much focus on trying to buy and proof-of-concept in the selling motion. Secondly, if you're building products, especially if you're building Agile, you have to have customers participate in the build very early on in the design cycle. We need our sales teams to have the relationships and accounts, where they're willing to participate in our design because if they participate in our design, the probability that we build an application that absolutely solves a group of problems for a wide variety of customers goes up. At the end of the day, customers want products that are easy to install, easy to upgrade, easy to operate, and having both Imon and Adam focus on that together, I think, is going to have a material impact to our overall consistency and our ability to sell not just in platinum, but also in the named and growth space."

And I guess, the question is for Kieran, but either, Rich, you might want to chime in or even Mike, too. You said you expect this business to be down low single digits, which is what's expected for the industry. But assuming this is all ratable business, you had a big, large, new Mainframe business quarter, right? I'm curious. Did the new business in this quarter more than offset attrition in this quarter? Like if you're looking at annualized numbers? And if so, which it seems like it probably did, why couldn't it actually grow, other than you being prudently conservative in your fast past, which make a lot of sense in this business, especially a business that some describe as a melting glacier?"

We had a very good run over here over the last several quarters with the Mainframe new sales performance and we've been very pleased with all of our renewal metrics. And we think with the amount of capacity IBM is putting out in marketplace, we get to populate that. I do think we would be somewhat naive if we were to ignore just the overall market trends at this point in time. We think the minus 1% here is a pretty nice improvement that we've seen. If you recall a year ago, we were running at about minus 3% [ph] for the first half of the year and we've made steady improvement in that space. Right now, from what we can see, low single digits seems very doable, very manageable and actually very much in sync with where the market is. Obviously, any opportunity to do better than that would, of course, the team will take advantage of that. But that's where -- right now, we really just expect it to be down in the low single digits."

This is a business that we're paying very close attention to. I think, we're probably  one of the only 2 vendors that are making these investments in R&D the Mainframe business. When you take a look at how that product group has done, they've done a fantastic job. They put a 53 new releases in the last year with 0 defects. And when we talk to that customer base, as I said before, we are getting very maniacal listening to the customer. What they want is high-quality releases. These are mission-critical systems running high transaction throughput. They want software that works all day every day. And when I took a look at what that team has done especially over the last year as they've adopted Agile, they have just absolutely gotten better. And I know Rich is very close to this business, maybe you have a couple of comments, Rich, on the Mainframe?"

Yes, if you did this kind of quarter every quarter, you're correct, it would be growing, but that's not how it would happen on purpose. As hard as IBM's Mainframe, all the work that we've done internally, they're right on track with there. In fact, on the year the inception of the -- inception to date basis on their current product line, their products are doing better than the previous one from what we can see, so we are happy with the progress. There's always going to be price pressure as you know on the mix that we're putting on the floor.

And just my second question, I'd like to turn to sort of -- it's going to really focus on the other business, the Enterprise Solutions business. You talked of uneven performance in named and growth business, which is going to be mostly  Enterprise Solutions I think. Can you provide a little more detail around what that means as far as uneven performance? Because actually, we hear about that in the field, too. We actually hear wins that you guys are making outside of your existing platinum accounts and you hear those things and you go, wow, that's pretty interesting.

And trust me, I ask myself that question a lot and I try to get as many people in the company that provide answers. And what we've come up with is a large list of things that I think we can do better in that space. We had an absolutely fantastic quarter, but we spent an awful lot of time consistently being agile, taking a look at what we can do better. And the inconsistent performance is some of it's people related, some of it's leadership related, some of it is product related and some of it is and is related to. If you take a look on a global basis, we're spotty. We have quarters where sales teams are giving a really good job of getting to understand the line of business leaders and really  getting tight relationships, understanding their buying process. And we have other areas that they have not been able to penetrate into some of those accounts. Now some of that is brand-to-brand recognition. You have to remember is that we're a 40-year-old company. For 37 years of that, we basically sold to between 100 to 200 customers, and now we're expanding our TAM trying to get into the other 1,700 customers to buy enterprise software and they just don't know CA as well as they should. Now The brand marketing that we're doing with CNN gets us to be known. The work, especially in Europe that we've done with Trekk and the cycling team has been phenomenal for people asking the question, what is CA? So we're getting some brand awareness, and I think's helping the sales force. Coupled with that is a lot of product improvements. We've been changing the product to get to where those types of customers want to buy. They want easy to use. They want easy to buy. They want easy to upgrade. They want to understand how that product works before they buy it. And I think that's not a CA phenomenon, that's an industry phenomenon. I think that as you are building out net new product, if it doesn't have those types of characteristics, it's going to be harder and harder to sell. When you take a look at our product portfolio, we have a number of products that do that and do that very well, but we don't have enough of them. And when I work with Imon and I work with Adam, those are the things that we're trying to drill down on. Now secondly, we've made pretty big investment in digital marketing, which has had an uptick for us but it's still early days with that. When you put all of that focus together, I think, you're going to see definitely more consistency in the named segment, but it's a work in progress for us. We got our revenue from a number of different places, John. As you know, we've got one of the most of us to get a models out there. We know how to do renewals. We're good at that. We know how to upsell in a renewal and extend the size of the wallet and account. We know how to do that real well. We've been doing a much better job over the last 2 years of selling outside the renewal and there's always room for improvement there, but we know how to do that. When it comes to capacity sales, that's not something that we get to drive as much as some people would like to think. At the end of the day, you either need capacity or you don't. And to the extent that customers need capacity, we absolutely know how to do with that. The hardest thing for us to do that we're getting better and better at each and every quarter is cold calling into a customer that we have a little or no relationship with, explaining what CA is, explaining what it is we can do to help them. And that's taking time and we're going to keep at it on the every day. Is that helpful?"

UIM, especially the new release, was strong again. APM, strong again. Rally was another strong quarter for us. So when you take a look at a lot of these, Rally is -- the Rally will probably be excluded from organic. But when you take a look at another transaction we did with PAM, although of the products is not organic, there's no way that sale would've gotten done without our sales force. So I think that's quite a organic or inorganic, but it was the second biggest transaction, I think, PAM has ever done, and it will never have been done without the relationships that we have."

And also, we're going to do acquisitions. I want to make sure that, that CFO has the ability to understand the dynamics of doing acquisitions. And lastly is there's maniacal drumbeat of paying attention to customers. Paying attention to customers has to be the focus of everybody in the company. Now the tip of the spear usually shows up in sales and product, but how you model, how your budget, how you think through all of the things that customers are driving us for, I think, a CFO plays a pretty strategic role in helping all of the business units think that through and make sure that we're organized from a financial perspective to understand that."

We also have another product that did very well in Security, it's called payment Security. So we are definitely very focused on taking advantage of a number of unique things happening in that Security market space. First of all, the market is continuously growing. There's no winner across the board in Security. Customers are leaning towards companies that have more scale and more breadth because they're looking for global service on a topic like this. They would prefer to deal with fewer vendors rather than stitch together the Security platforms of multiple vendors. The fact that we've got a very large portfolio and are dominant in the IT management space, I think, puts us in a very good position to compete. As you -- as we get closer to CA World, you'll see us put out more organic product with respect to Security, and I think that the way that we think through Security and the way that we're thinking through how the Security of the future operates with productive analytics is unique to the market space. So I'm pretty bullish about what we're able to do in Security over time."

A lot of that work, whether it be in the cloud or whether it be on-premise. The other thing is ease-of-use. All the products in the marketplace today are not as easy to use as customers want. And oddly enough, this is something that really requires a lot of insight and intellect because we can lock things down pretty tight. The user experience becomes more difficult the more tighter we lock things down. Customers pushback on that and end-users pushback on it even harder. So the real secret is to make an elegant solution that is very robust, very safe, provides an incredible amount of governance and reporting and makes it easy for users to do what it is they want to do. And a lot of that is going to be based on predictive analytics. And when you take some of the work we've been doing over the last year in this space, I'm pretty excited about our role to be able to use that type of technology to help solve that critical problem."

We wouldn't want to be more than a standard deviation outside of the core tenets of our strategy. We're not chasing revenue. We're not chasing fads. We have an intimate idea of what enterprise software is going to look like in the future. And to the extent that we can find with technology that but that strategy, we're all in. Secondly is we are disciplined buyers. We have been very thoughtful, I believe, with respect to what we're willing to pay for technology.

As you read in the press release, Rich Beckert is retiring after a decade of service to the company. Rich joined CA in 2006 and has played an important role in CA's evolution. I'd like to thank Rich for his many contributions over the years. He has been instrumental in implementing processes and instilling discipline that have helped lay the foundation upon which the company can grow. While we undertake a search for Rich's replacement, Kieran McGrath, CA's Corporate Controller, has been named interim CFO, reporting to me. Kieran was the finance lead of IBM's $25 billion global software business and brings a wealth of financial and operational and transformational management experience. We also announced that Adam Elster and Ayman Sayed have been named President, Global Field Operations, and President, Chief Product Officer, respectively. This fine-tuning of our organizational structure further strengthens and integrates sales and product, 2 areas that are key to our growth. This level of collaboration ensures that our development and go-to-market efforts are completely aligned to customer and market demand. 
Turning to the quarter. New sales were up significantly higher than we had expected. Total new sales increased more than 50%, and organic new sales increased in the high 20s. A big driver of Q1 new sales growth was a transaction with a large system integrator or SI that was originally slated to expire in FY '18. We are pleased with the metrics of this 7-year deal, which had a healthy attach rate and enabled CA to gain wallet share. 
Excluding this early renewal, total new sales increased in the high single digits year-over-year. New sales in the quarter also benefited from deals that slipped from Q4 last year into Q1 this year. 
Mainframe new sales increased well over 100% year-over-year. Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the low 20s year-over-year. From a product perspective, the greatest contributors to new sales growth in the first quarter were Mainframe, Security, Agile Central, PPM, UIM and APM. 
Overall, I'm very happy with our first quarter results. Our revenue grew nearly 3%. We delivered very good margin performance despite a difficult year-over-year compare, which drove solid EPS and CFFO. 
Looking ahead to Q2, please remember that Q2 of fiscal year 2016 included a large SI renewal with incredibly strong metrics, which creates a very difficult compare next quarter. 
Turning to our products. Q2 marks the anniversary of our acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium. Both acquisitions continue to perform well, and their performance has accelerated beyond pre-acquisition run rates. That said, there is still ample runway ahead for each of these acquisitions to reach their full potential. 
In the quarter, as part of the large SI deal, CA Privileged Access Management, or PAM, closed the single-largest deal in Xceedium's history, both pre- and post-acquisition. It was selected over other competitors to become the standard for the large SI to leverage across its more than 1,000 global customers. Separately, CA PAM displaced an incumbent at a large American multinational telecommunications company due to CA PAM's strength in password management. Our performance this quarter demonstrates our strategy of acquiring great technology and leveraging our relationships to accelerate growth. This is one of the reasons why we are committed to M&A as part of our 3-legged capital allocation strategy. Clearly, we are very happy with our recent acquisitions. 
Meanwhile, we remain committed to cultivating the spirit of innovation at CA. Unified Infrastructure Management or UIM for cloud launched at the end of the quarter. It is a great example of how we're executing to our strategic imperative to innovate organically. UIM is a market-leading cloud-monitoring solution that showcases CA's position as a platform agnostic solution provider. With our new UIM for cloud release, CA now supports Amazon Web Services, OpenStack, Docker, Nutanix and PureStorage for private and public cloud as well as on-premise. Many of our customers see CA Unified Infrastructure Management at the heart of their cloud strategy. Our new capabilities supporting Amazon Web Services and OpenStack are essential in helping to optimize customer workloads. We are pleased that IT Central Station, a leading crowd-sourced product review site for enterprise technology, named CA UIM as the #1 solution for cloud monitoring. 
Project and Portfolio Management, or PPM, is another area that has consistently been a bright spot and serves as a great example of our organic innovation. PPM had a good first quarter, with new sales up mid-single digits year-over-year. In the quarter, there were a number of 6-figure transactions that closed, 3 of which were brand-new customers to the platform. We often win because of PPM's superior functionality, which is encouraging and highlights the value our internal development teams can bring to market. PPM new sales have grown in 4 of the 5 most recent quarters. We are pleased that in our first quarter, CA was named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for IT Project and Portfolio Management Software Applications. 
I'd also like to take the opportunity to call out the exceptional quarter Mainframe had in Q1. I am very pleased with both Mainframe new sales and revenue performance in the quarter. As one of the few software solution providers investing in the mainframe, CA is a trusted partner to many of the largest enterprises around the world. 
One of our key competitive advantages at our largest customers is our combined Enterprise and Mainframe Solutions portfolio. Our customers are challenged to manage increasingly complex, heterogeneous public, private, hybrid cloud and on-premise environments. Our combined Enterprise and Mainframe Solutions segment enable us to strategically partner with customers to develop innovative solutions that solve some of the most complicated problems that span multiple platforms. Many of our customers benefit from the ability of CA to manage their entire infrastructure stack across distributed, cloud and mainframe. The positive impact this has on our customers is notable. It lowers our customers' cost of ownership and shortens the time it takes to find and resolve issues. From global financial institutions and industrial conglomerates, to governments and telecom companies, enterprises around the world employ a combination of CA's cross-platform solutions and leverage the synergies between our Mainframe and Enterprise Solutions products. The interplay between Mainframe and Enterprise enables CA to cost-effectively bring new innovation to the mainframe market. This supports our customers' commitment to the platform. It also supports a seamless user experience by making it much easier for customers to manage instead of coordinating a number of disparate point-solution vendors. There is no doubt that we are continuing to make progress towards our goal of building this company for long-term sustainable growth. Our development organization continues to improve as we focus on making products that matter with improved user interfaces that are easy to deploy and easy to manage. Success here will better enable us to leverage channel opportunities and grow through alternative routes to market. 
Our sales organization has also seen considerable improvement. For example, looking at our Platinum Net Promoter Score, or NPS, which is based on a survey designed to measure the willingness of customers to recommend CA to other customers, our scores continue to trend positively. More broadly, our customer satisfaction scores are also following a similar positive trajectory. We know that when we are at our best, we are customer-centric, results-focused, self-aware and agile. 
While our performance in Named and Growth, or Partner-led businesses, was uneven in Q1, we continue to view this as a significant opportunity for CA to meaningfully expand our market reach. We have just started to the scratch the surface. We will continue to make adjustments and be agile in our approach to driving continuous improvement throughout the organization. 
Overall, I am very encouraged by our progress across a number of fronts. But as I've said before, progress will not be linear. We have had a very good Q1, but we face an incredibly difficult new sales compare in Q2. We are on a journey to transform this company to one of sustainable long-term growth. We still have work to do. 
That said, I'd like to be the first invite you to come and see some of the fruits of this work at CA World this year. We will host a financial analyst track on November 16th, which will provide a great opportunity to speak with a number of people on our executive team; experience a broad array of our solutions in action; and hear what our customers are saying first-hand. There really is no better way to fully capture the CA picture than to experience CA World for yourself. We will be sending out save-the-dates with a registration link shortly. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to review our first quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

I am confident that a solid foundation is in place to support the next phase of CA's journey. 
As usual, before we get started with the quarterly review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency, unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I am going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
Our Q1 total revenue was $999 million and up 3% in constant currency and 2% as reported. As Mike mentioned, this was the second consecutive quarter we have grown revenue year-over-year in constant currency. Q1 Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 10%, Mainframe Solutions decreased 1%, and Services declined 2%. Q1 total new product and capacity sales were up in the mid-50s and low 50s as reported. Organic sales were up high 20s and mid-20s as reported. Both organic and inorganic new sales were driven by the SI. The large system integrator contributed high 40s to the total new sales growth. Acquisitions contributed high 20s to total new sales growth. The increase in Q1 total new sales, excluding the large SI, was primarily due to Mainframe Solutions new product sales. 
Q1 renewals more than doubled year-over-year, both in constant currency and as reported. As we have previously stated, the year-over-year change in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions. The large system integrator transaction replaced an existing deal that was scheduled to expire in fiscal 2018. This new transaction provided an incremental contract value in excess of $475 million and extends the agreement an additional 5 years. As such, we now expect fiscal 2017 renewals to be up in the high teens year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2016 in constant currency and as reported. 
Renewal yield for the quarter was in the low 90s percent range, in line with our long-term target. 
Turning to geographies. New sales were particularly strong in North America, driven by the large system integrator transaction. New sales were also strong in EMEA. However, new sales were down in APJ and down sharply in Latin America due to continued macroeconomic challenges in the region. 
As Mike mentioned, revenue grew across all geographies in constant currency. On an as-reported basis, revenue grew across all geographies except Latin America, where revenue decreased slightly. 
Within our segments, Mainframe new sales more than doubled year-over-year in constant currency and as reported. The large SI transaction contributed slightly more than 100% of the greater than 150% Mainframe Solutions new product sales growth. Overall, we continue to expect our Mainframe revenue to be down in the low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the mainframe market. 
Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the low 20s year-over-year in constant currency and as reported. The large SI contributed in the high 20s to Enterprise Solutions new product sales growth. Areas such as Security, Agile Central, PPM, UIM and APM contributed to the new sales growth in the quarter. However, as we've discussed in the past, within Enterprise Solutions, there are products in our enhanced portfolio that are more mature and not growing but contribute to margin and cash flow. Acquisitions contributed mid-30s to new sales growth within Enterprise Solutions and were a notable contributor to the value we were delivering in the large SI transaction. 
Services revenue decreased 2% in constant currency and 3% as reported. Over the long term, we expect Services revenue to decline as we design our products to be easier to install and as we leverage partners. 
Total revenue backlog improved to up 15% in constant currency and up 14% as reported. Current revenue backlog improved to flat in constant currency and as reported. As we said in the past, current revenue backlog will likely grow after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low 90s renewal yield. We expect current revenue backlog to fluctuate this year. 
Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 39% and GAAP operating margin was 29%. Operating margin declined year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of a favorable legal development in the year-ago period. 
Segment operating margins in the quarter were 62% for Mainframe Solutions, 13% for Enterprise Solutions and 3% for Services. Our Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 29%. Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.64, down 2% year-over-year and flat as reported. Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.47, down 4% and flat year-over-year as reported. 
Our Q1 CFFO was $161 million, down 10% year-over-year or down 14% as reported. CFFO declined year-over-year due to the timing of cash taxes, which were lower in the year-ago period. Single installment cash payments were $23 million, down year-over-year. We ended Q1 with approximately $688 million in net cash. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased $50 million in shares and paid $107 million in dividends. We have $700 million remaining in our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. 
As Mike said, our uneven performance in some product areas and in Named and Growth, and Partner-led opportunities, are places we are focusing as we continue this journey to transform the company to one that can sustainably grow as we continue to work to improve efficiency and productivity within our development organization. Simultaneously, we are working to drive continuous improvements across our sales organization so that consistency and velocity trend in the right direction across all geographies. 
Overall, we are getting better, but we have not yet crossed the chasm. It is important to note that the current revenue backlog was flat in the quarter, consistent with our prior commentary. We expect backlog will fluctuate through the year. The large SI deal that was signed in Q1 was great for CA, with the total deal size, aggregate revenue run rate, associated renewal yield all representing very good metrics for us. While the large SI deal had no impact to Q1 revenue and minimal impact to current backlog, it does substantially shift the renewal portfolio such that FY '17 is now significantly larger and FY '18 is naturally much lighter. Consequently, fiscal 2018 renewals are expected to decline year-over-year due to the timing of the large SI. Otherwise, the renewal portfolio is substantially unchanged relative to our prior expectations. 
As Mike mentioned, Q2 will be challenged by an extremely difficult compare due to the large SI that renewed in the year-ago period. This will be particularly evident in the new sales, which are expected to decline sharply. Conversely, we had acquisition-related expenses that should create a more favorable year-over-year compare from an operating margin perspective. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based on exchange rates of the last day of the preceding quarter, which was June 30, 2016. The guidance also assumes no material acquisitions. For the full year, we continue to expect total revenue to be in the range of flat to up 1% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of around $4.03 billion to $4.07 billion. We expect a full year non-GAAP operating margin of 38% and a GAAP full year operating margin of 29% compared to prior GAAP operating margin guidance of 30%. GAAP operating margin and EPS guidance reflect the impact of the increase in our share price on stock-based compensation. We expect our non-GAAP and GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%, consistent with our prior expectations. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.49 to $2.54. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 2% to 5% compared to prior guidance of 3% to 6%. The change in our GAAP growth expectations reflects the impact of the increase in our stock price on stock-based compensation. As mentioned earlier, this translates to a reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.88 to $1.93. 
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 411 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 414 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to increase 1% to 5% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.05 billion to $1.09 billion. 
For this Q&A session, we've asked Kieran to step in to field questions with Mike. I'll be here should there be any particular points where I can offer clarity, but we'd like to give Kieran the opportunity to step into this part of his new role. 
With that, we'll open it up for questions."

It was at the request of the customer and in an effort to support their business. But it ended up being a very tightly negotiated contract that has excellent metrics. We added $425 million worth of net new value contracts -- sorry, it's $475 million of net new value and it takes out for 7 years. And when you take a look at this particular system integrator, this -- our technology is going to be installed in over 1,000 customers. In it is a lot of our new technology, for example, PAM, the Privileged Access Management is part of that transaction, which we think is top of mind for most companies right now. And having that installed in that many particular accounts, I think, is tremendous for us. The other thing that's significant is we've locked up our 3 biggest customers for almost 5 years now. That gives us a lot of visibility and it gives us an awful lot of software running in an awful lot of customers, where we have an opportunity to extend those relationships over time. So it's a pretty significant transaction as you can tell by the size of it and how it's affected our operating metrics. And I couldn't be happier with the team that negotiated, and I really do like the characteristics of the transaction."

The hardest thing for us to do is to sell new software to a net new customer. Almost all of our energy for new on the product side, on the marketing side, on the sales side is equipping that sales team with the tools and capabilities to be able to sell our products into customers where we don't have the significant relationship. Now the volume of transaction is going -- are going up, and I'm pretty pleased with that. But we need to have more product and we have to have more customers buying in that space. I think there's things that we can do product-wise. I think there's things that we can do marketing-wise with our compete level. And I also think there's things we can do from a sales effectiveness perspective to make that more repeatable over time. And this really does lead into how I've changed the tone with respect to product and sales. I think this is not a unique issue with respect to CA. I think this is an industry issue. Customers today, they want to talk to sales professionals that really understand them and their line of business and how our products work in the context of their operation. That's why you see so much focus on try and buy and proof-of-concept in the selling motion. Secondly, if you're building products, especially if you're building Agile, you have to have customers participate in the build very early on in the design cycle. We need our sales teams to have the relationships and accounts where they're willing to participate in our design because if they participate in our design, the probability that we build an application that absolutely solves a group of problems for a wide variety of customers goes up. At the end of the day, customers want products that are easy to install, easy to upgrade, easy to operate, and having both Ayman and Adam focus on that together, I think, is going to have a material impact to our overall consistency and our ability to sell not just in Platinum, but also in the Named and Growth space."

You said you expect this business to be down low single digits, which is what's expected for the industry.

Did new business in this quarter more than offset attrition in this quarter, like if you're looking at annualized numbers?

And we think with the amount of capacity IBM is putting out into marketplace, we get to populate that. I do think we would be somewhat naive if we were to ignore just the overall market trends at this point in time. We think the minus 1% here is a pretty nice improvement that we've seen. If you recall, a year ago, we were running at about minus 3% for the first half of the year, and we've made steady improvement in that space. Right now, from what we can see, low single digit seems very doable, very manageable and actually very much in sync with where the market is.

We had an absolutely fantastic quarter, but we spent an awful lot of time consistently being agile, taking a look at what we can do better. And the inconsistent performance is some of it's people-related, some of it's leadership-related, some of it's product-related, and some of it is industry-related. If you take a look on a global basis, we're spotty. We have quarters where sales teams are doing a really good job of getting to understand line of business leaders and really getting tight relationships, understanding their buying process. And we have other areas that they have not been able to penetrate into some of those accounts. Now some of that is brand-to-brand recognition. You have to remember that for -- we're a 40-year-old company. For 37 years of that, we basically sold to between 100 to 200 customers, and now we're expanding our TAM, trying to get into the other 1,700 customers that buy enterprise software and they just don't know CA as well as they should.

So we're getting some brand awareness, and I think's helping the sales force. Coupled with that is a lot of product improvements. We've been changing the product to get to where those types of customers want to buy. They want easy to use. They want easy to buy. They want easy to upgrade. They want to understand how that product works before they buy it. And I think that's not a CA phenomenon, that's an industry phenomenon. I think that as you are building out net new product, if it doesn't have those types of characteristics, it's going to be harder and harder to sell. When you take a look at our product portfolio, we have a number of products that do that and do that very well, but we don't have enough of them. And when I work with Ayman and I work with the -- Adam, those are the things that we're trying to drill down on. Now secondly, we've made pretty big investments in digital marketing, which has had an uptick for us but is still early days with that. When you put all of that focus together, I think you're going to see definitely more consistency in the Named segment, but it's a work in progress for us. We get our revenue from a number of different places, John. As you know, you've got one of the most sophisticated models out there. We know how to do renewals. We're good at that. We know how to upsell in a renewal and extend the size of the wallet and account. We know how to do that real well. We've been doing a much better job over the last 2 years of selling outside the renewal, and there's always room for improvement there. But we know how to do that. When it comes to capacity sales, that's not something that we get to drive as much as some people would like to think. At the end of the day, you either need capacity or you don't. And to the extent that customers need capacity, we absolutely know how to do that. The hardest thing for us to do that we're getting better and better at in each and every quarter is cold-calling into a customer that we have, a little or no relationship with, explaining what CA is, explaining what it is we can do to help them. And that's taking time, and we're going to keep at it all day everyday. Is that helpful?"

There's no winner across the board in Security. Customers are leaning towards companies that have more scale and more breadth because they're looking for global service on a topic like this. They would prefer to deal with fewer vendors rather than stitch together the Security platforms of multiple vendors. The fact that we've got a very large portfolio and are dominant in the ID management space, I think, puts us in a very good position to compete.

Our Q1 revenue grew year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter. Revenue improvement was broad-based, with growth across all geographies. Our Q1 results give us improved confidence in our ability to cross over into modest growth for the full year in 2017. 
As you read in the press release, Rich Beckert is retiring after a decade of service to the company. Rich joined CA in 2006 and has played an important role in CA's evolution. I'd like to thank Rich for his many contributions over the years. He has been instrumental in implementing processes and instilling discipline that have helped lay the foundation upon which the company can grow. While we undertake a search for Rich's replacement, Kieran McGrath, CA's Corporate Controller, has been named interim CFO, reporting to me. Kieran was the finance lead of IBM's $25 billion global software business and brings a wealth of financial and operational and transformational management experience. We also announced that Adam Elster and Ayman Sayed have been named President, Global Field Operations, and President, Chief Product Officer, respectively. This fine-tuning of our organizational structure further strengthens and integrates sales and product, 2 areas that are key to our growth. This level of collaboration ensures that our development and go-to-market efforts are completely aligned to customer and market demand. 
Turning to the quarter. New sales were up significantly higher than we had expected. Total new sales increased more than 50%, and organic new sales increased in the high 20s. A big driver of Q1 new sales growth was a transaction with a large system integrator or SI that was originally slated to expire in FY '18. We are pleased with the metrics of this 7-year deal, which had a healthy attach rate and enabled CA to gain wallet share. 
Excluding this early renewal, total new sales increased in the high single digits year-over-year. New sales in the quarter also benefited from deals that slipped from Q4 last year into Q1 this year. 
Mainframe new sales increased well over 100% year-over-year. Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the low 20s year-over-year. From a product perspective, the greatest contributors to new sales growth in the first quarter were Mainframe, Security, Agile Central, PPM, UIM and APM. 
Overall, I'm very happy with our first quarter results. Our revenue grew nearly 3%. We delivered very good margin performance despite a difficult year-over-year compare, which drove solid EPS and CFFO. 
Looking ahead to Q2, please remember that Q2 of fiscal year 2016 included a large SI renewal with incredibly strong metrics, which creates a very difficult compare next quarter. 
Turning to our products. Q2 marks the anniversary of our acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium. Both acquisitions continue to perform well, and their performance has accelerated beyond pre-acquisition run rates. That said, there is still ample runway ahead for each of these acquisitions to reach their full potential. 
In the quarter, as part of the large SI deal, CA Privileged Access Management, or PAM, closed the single largest deal in Xceedium's history, both pre- and post-acquisition. It was selected over other competitors to become the standard for the large SI to leverage across its more than 1,000 global customers. Separately, CA PAM displaced an incumbent at a large American multinational telecommunications company due to CA PAM's strength in password management. Our performance this quarter demonstrates our strategy of acquiring great technology and leveraging our relationships to accelerate growth. This is one of the reasons why we are committed to M&A as part of our 3-legged capital allocation strategy. Clearly, we are very happy with our recent acquisitions. 
Meanwhile, we remain committed to cultivating the spirit of innovation at CA. Unified Infrastructure Management or UIM for cloud launched at the end of the quarter. It is a great example of how we're executing to our strategic imperative to innovate organically. UIM is a market-leading cloud-monitoring solution that showcases CA's position as a platform agnostic solution provider. With our new UIM for cloud release, CA now supports Amazon Web Services, OpenStack, Docker, Nutanix and PureStorage for private and public cloud as well as on-premise. Many of our customers see CA Unified Infrastructure Management at the heart of their cloud strategy. Our new capabilities supporting Amazon Web Services and OpenStack are essential in helping to optimize customer workloads. We are pleased that IT Central Station, a leading crowd-sourced product review site for enterprise technology, named CA UIM as the #1 solution for cloud monitoring. 
Project and Portfolio Management, or PPM, is another area that has consistently been a bright spot and serves as a great example of our organic innovation. PPM had a good first quarter, with new sales up mid-single digits year-over-year. In the quarter, there were a number of 6-figure transactions that closed, 3 of which were brand-new customers to the platform. We often win because of PPM's superior functionality, which is encouraging and highlights the value our internal development teams can bring to market. PPM new sales have grown in 4 of the 5 most recent quarters. We are pleased that in our first quarter, CA was named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for IT Project and Portfolio Management Software Applications. 
I'd also like to take the opportunity to call out the exceptional quarter Mainframe had in Q1. I am very pleased with both Mainframe new sales and revenue performance in the quarter. As one of the few software solution providers investing in the mainframe, CA is a trusted partner to many of the largest enterprises around the world. 
One of our key competitive advantages at our largest customers is our combined Enterprise and Mainframe Solutions portfolio. Our customers are challenged to manage increasingly complex, heterogeneous public, private, hybrid cloud and on-premise environments. Our combined Enterprise and Mainframe Solutions segment enable us to strategically partner with customers to develop innovative solutions that solve some of the most complicated problems that span multiple platforms. Many of our customers benefit from the ability of CA to manage their entire infrastructure stack across distributed, cloud and mainframe. The positive impact this has on our customer is notable. It lowers our customers' cost of ownership and shortens the time it takes to find and resolve issues. From global financial institutions and industrial conglomerates, to governments and telecom companies, enterprises around the world employ a combination of CA's cross-platform solutions and leverage the synergies between our Mainframe and Enterprise Solution products. The interplay between Mainframe and Enterprise enables CA to cost-effectively bring new innovation to the mainframe market. This supports our customers' commitment to the platform. It also supports a seamless user experience by making it much easier for customers to manage instead of coordinating a number of disparate point-solution vendors. There is no doubt that we are continuing to make progress towards our goal of building this company for long-term sustainable growth. Our development organization continues to improve as we focus on making products that matter with improved user interfaces that are easy to deploy and easy to manage. Success here will better enable us to leverage channel opportunities and grow through alternative routes to market. 
Our sales organization has also seen considerable improvement. For example, looking at our Platinum Net Promoter Score, or NPS, which is based on a survey designed to measure the willingness of customers to recommend CA to other customers, our scores continue to trend positively. More broadly, our customer satisfaction scores are also following a similar positive trajectory. We know that when we are at our best, we are customer-centric, results-focused, self-aware and agile. 
While our performance in Named and Growth, or Partner-led businesses, was uneven in Q1, we continue to view this as a significant opportunity for CA to meaningfully expand our market reach. We have just started to the scratch the surface. We will continue to make adjustments and be agile in our approach to driving continuous improvement throughout the organization. 
Overall, I am very encouraged by our progress across a number of fronts. But as I've said before, progress will not be linear. We have had a very good Q1, but we face an incredibly difficult new sales compare in Q2. We are on a journey to transform this company to one of sustainable long-term growth. We still have work to do. 
That said, I'd like to be the first to invite you to come and see some of the fruits of this work at CA World this year. We will host a financial analyst track on November 16th, which will provide a great opportunity to speak with a number of people on our executive team; experience a broad array of our solutions in action; and hear what our customers are saying first-hand. There really is no better way to fully capture the CA picture than to experience CA World for yourself. We will be sending out save-the-dates with a registration link shortly. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to review our first quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

As Mike mentioned, after 10 years here at CA, I am announcing my retirement. I am proud to have been a part of the substantial change that has taken place over the years and to be in a position to leave CA in capable hands. I am confident that a solid foundation is in place to support the next phase of CA's journey. 
As usual, before we get started with the quarterly review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency, unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I am going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
Our Q1 total revenue was $999 million and up 3% in constant currency and 2% as reported. As Mike mentioned, this was the second consecutive quarter we have grown revenue year-over-year in constant currency. Q1 Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 10%, Mainframe Solutions decreased 1%, and Services declined 2%. Q1 total new product and capacity sales were up in the mid-50s and low 50s as reported. Organic sales were up high 20s and mid-20s as reported. Both organic and inorganic new sales were driven by the SI. The large system integrator contributed high 40s to the total new sales growth. Acquisitions contributed high 20s to total new sales growth. The increase in Q1 total new sales, excluding the large SI, was primarily due to Mainframe Solutions new product sales. 
Q1 renewals more than doubled year-over-year, both in constant currency and as reported. As we have previously stated, the year-over-year change in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions. The large system integrator transaction replaced an existing deal that was scheduled to expire in fiscal 2018. This new transaction provided an incremental contract value in excess of $475 million and extends the agreement an additional 5 years. As such, we now expect fiscal 2017 renewals to be up in the high teens year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2016 in constant currency and as reported. 
Renewal yield for the quarter was in the low 90s percent range, in line with our long-term target. 
Turning to geographies. New sales were particularly strong in North America, driven by the large system integrator transaction. New sales were also strong in EMEA. However, new sales were down in APJ and down sharply in Latin America due to continued macroeconomic challenges in the region. 
As Mike mentioned, revenue grew across all geographies in constant currency. On an as-reported basis, revenue grew across all geographies except Latin America, where revenue decreased slightly. 
Within our segments, Mainframe new sales more than doubled year-over-year in constant currency and as reported. The large SI transaction contributed slightly more than 100% of the greater than 150% Mainframe Solutions new product sales growth. Overall, we continue to expect our Mainframe revenue to be down in the low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the mainframe market. 
Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the low 20s year-over-year in constant currency and as reported. The large SI contributed in the high 20s to Enterprise Solutions new product sales growth. Areas such as Security, Agile Central, PPM, UIM and APM contributed to the new sales growth in the quarter. However, as we've discussed in the past, within Enterprise Solutions, there are products in our enhanced portfolio that are more mature and not growing but contribute to margin and cash flow. Acquisitions contributed mid-30s to new sales growth within Enterprise Solutions and were a notable contributor to the value we were delivering in the large SI transaction. 
Services revenue decreased 2% in constant currency and 3% as reported. Over the long term, we expect Services revenue to decline as we design our products to be easier to install and as we leverage partners. 
Total revenue backlog improved to up 15% in constant currency and up 14% as reported. Current revenue backlog improved to flat in constant currency and as reported. As we said in the past, current revenue backlog will likely grow after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low 90s renewal yield. We expect current revenue backlog to fluctuate this year. 
Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 39% and GAAP operating margin was 29%. Operating margin declined year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of a favorable legal development in the year-ago period. 
Segment operating margins in the quarter were 62% for Mainframe Solutions, 13% for Enterprise Solutions and 3% for Services. Our Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 29%. Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.64, down 2% year-over-year and flat as reported. Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.47, down 4% and flat year-over-year as reported. 
Our Q1 CFFO was $161 million, down 10% year-over-year or down 14% as reported. CFFO declined year-over-year due to the timing of cash taxes, which were lower in the year-ago period. Single installment cash payments were $23 million, down year-over-year. We ended Q1 with approximately $688 million in net cash. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased $50 million in shares and paid $107 million in dividends. We have $700 million remaining in our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. 
As Mike said, our uneven performance in some product areas and in Named and Growth, and Partner-led opportunities, are places we are focusing as we continue this journey to transform the company to one that can sustainably grow as we continue to work to improve the efficiency and productivity within our development organization. Simultaneously, we are working to drive continuous improvements across our sales organization so that consistency and velocity trend in the right direction across all geographies. 
Overall, we are getting better, but we have not yet crossed the chasm. It is important to note that the current revenue backlog was flat in the quarter, consistent with our prior commentary. We expect backlog will fluctuate through the year. The large SI deal that was signed in Q1 was great for CA, with the total deal size, aggregate revenue run rate, associated renewal yield all representing very good metrics for us. While the large SI deal had no impact to Q1 revenue and minimal impact to current backlog, it does substantially shift the renewal portfolio such that FY '17 is now significantly larger and FY '18 is naturally much lighter. Consequently, fiscal 2018 renewals are expected to decline year-over-year due to the timing of the large SI. Otherwise, the renewal portfolio is substantially unchanged relative to our prior expectations. 
As Mike mentioned, Q2 will be challenged by an extremely difficult compare due to the large SI that renewed in the year-ago period. This will be particularly evident in the new sales, which are expected to decline sharply. Conversely, we had acquisition-related expenses that should create a more favorable year-over-year compare from an operating margin perspective. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based on exchange rates of the last day of the preceding quarter, which was June 30, 2016. The guidance also assumes no material acquisitions. For the full year, we continue to expect total revenue to be in the range of flat to up 1% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of around $4.03 billion to $4.07 billion. We expect a full year non-GAAP operating margin of 38% and a GAAP full year operating margin of 29% compared to prior GAAP operating margin guidance of 30%. GAAP operating margin and EPS guidance reflect the impact of the increase in our share price on stock-based compensation. We expect our non-GAAP and GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%, consistent with our prior expectations. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.49 to $2.54. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 2% to 5% compared to prior guidance of 3% to 6%. The change in our GAAP growth expectations reflects the impact of the increase in our stock price on stock-based compensation. As mentioned earlier, this translates to a reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.88 to $1.93. 
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 411 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 414 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to increase 1% to 5% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.05 billion to $1.09 billion. 
For this Q&A session, we've asked Kieran to step in to field questions with Mike. I'll be here should there be any particular points where I can offer clarity, but we'd like to give Kieran the opportunity to step into this part of his new role. 
With that, we'll open it up for questions."

It was at the request of the customer and in an effort to support their business. But it ended up being a very tightly negotiated contract that has excellent metrics. We added $425 million worth of net new value with that contract -- sorry, it's $475 million of net new value and it takes out for 7 years. And when you take a look at this particular system integrator, this -- our technology is going to be installed in over 1,000 customers. In it is a lot of our new technology, for example, PAM, the Privileged Access Management is part of that transaction, which we think is top of mind for most companies right now. And having that installed in that many particular accounts, I think, is tremendous for us. The other thing that's significant is we've locked up our 3 biggest customers for almost 5 years now. That gives us a lot of visibility and it gives us an awful lot of software running in an awful lot of customers, where we have an opportunity to extend those relationships over time. So it's a pretty significant transaction as you can tell by the size of it and how it's affected our operating metrics. And I couldn't be happier with the team that negotiated it, and I really do like the characteristics of the transaction."

The hardest thing for us to do is to sell new software to a net new customer. Almost all of our energy for new on the product side, on the marketing side, on the sales side is equipping that sales team with the tools and capabilities to be able to sell our products into customers where we don't have a significant relationship. Now the volume of transaction is going -- are going up, and I'm pretty pleased with that. But we need to have more product and we have to have more customers buying in that space. I think there's things that we can do product-wise. I think there's things that we can do marketing-wise with our compete level. And I also think there's things we can do from a sales effectiveness perspective to make that more repeatable over time. And this really does lead into how I've changed the tone with respect to product and sales. I think this is not a unique issue with respect to CA. I think this is an industry issue. Customers today, they want to talk to sales professionals that really understand them and their line of business and how our products work in the context of their operation. That's why you see so much focus on try and buy and proof-of-concept in the selling motion. Secondly, if you're building products, especially if you're building Agile, you have to have customers participate in the build very early on in the design cycle. We need our sales teams to have the relationships and accounts where they're willing to participate in our design because if they participate in our design, the probability that we build an application that absolutely solves a group of problems for a wide variety of customers goes up. At the end of the day, customers want products that are easy to install, easy to upgrade, easy to operate, and having both Ayman and Adam focus on that together, I think, is going to have a material impact to our overall consistency and our ability to sell not just in Platinum, but also in the Named and Growth space."

You said you expect this business to be down low single digits, which is what's expected for the industry. But assuming this is all ratable business, you had a big, large new Mainframe business quarter, right? I'm curious. Did new business in this quarter more than offset attrition in this quarter, like if you're looking at annualized numbers? And if so, which it seems like it probably did, why couldn't it actually grow, other than you being prudently conservative in your forecast, which makes a lot of sense in this business, especially a business that some describe as a melting glacier?"

I think the first thing I'd say is prudent -- we are definitely prudent in the business. We've had a very good run over here over the last several quarters with the Mainframe new sales performance, and we've been very pleased with all of our renewal metrics. And we think with the amount of capacity IBM is putting out into marketplace, we get to populate that. I do think we would be somewhat naive if we were to ignore just the overall market trends at this point in time. We think the minus 1% here is a pretty nice improvement that we've seen. If you recall, a year ago, we were running at about minus 3% for the first half of the year, and we've made steady improvement in that space. Right now, from what we can see, low single digits seems very doable, very manageable and actually very much in sync with where the market is. Obviously, any opportunity to do better than that, of course the team will take advantage of that. But that's where -- right now, we really just expect it to be down in the low single digits."

This is a business that we're paying very close attention to. I think we're probably one of the only 2 vendors that are making serious investments in R&D in the Mainframe business. When you take a look at how that product group has done, they've done a fantastic job. They've put out 53 new releases in the last year with 0 defects. And when we talk to that customer base, as I said before, we are getting very maniacal of listening to the customer. What they want is high-quality releases. These are mission-critical systems running high transaction throughput. They want software that works all day everyday. And when I take a look at what that team has done, especially over the last year as they've adopted Agile, they have just absolutely gotten better. And I know Rich is very close to this business, maybe you have a couple of comments, Rich, on the Mainframe?"

So yes, if you did this kind of quarter every quarter, you're correct, it would be growing, but that's not how it will happen. It will porpoise. As far as IBM's mainframe and all the work that we've done internally, they're right on track with their -- in fact, on the year to inception of -- inception-to-date basis on their current product line, they're probably actually doing better than the previous one from what we can see. So we are happy with the progress. There's always going to be price pressure, as you know, on the MIPS that we're putting on the floor.

And trust me, I ask myself that question a lot and I try to get as many people in the company to provide answers. And what we've come up with is a large list of things that I think we can do better in that space. We had an absolutely fantastic quarter, but we spent an awful lot of time consistently being agile, taking a look at what we can do better. And the inconsistent performance is -- some of it's people-related, some of it's leadership-related, some of it's product-related, and some of it is industry-related. If you take a look on a global basis, we're spotty. We have quarters where sales teams are doing a really good job of getting to understand line of business leaders and really getting tight relationships, understanding their buying process. And we have other areas that they have not been able to penetrate into some of those accounts. Now some of that is brand and brand recognition. You have to remember that for -- we're a 40-year-old company. For 37 years of that, we basically sold to between 100 and 200 customers, and now we're expanding our TAM, trying to get into the other 1,700 customers that buy enterprise software and they just don't know CA as well as they should. The brand marketing that we're doing with CNN gets us to be known. The work, especially in Europe, that we've done with Trek and the cycling team has been phenomenal, for people asking the question is, what is CA? So we're getting some brand awareness, and I think's helping the sales force. Coupled with that is a lot of product improvements. We've been changing the product to get to where those types of customers want to buy. They want easy to use. They want easy to buy. They want easy to upgrade. They want to understand how that product works before they buy it. And I think that's not a CA phenomenon, that's an industry phenomenon. I think that as you are building out net new product, if it doesn't have those types of characteristics, it's going to be harder and harder to sell. When you take a look at our product portfolio, we have a number of products that do that and do that very well, but we don't have enough of them. And when I work with Ayman and I work with Adam, those are the things that we're trying to drill down on. Now secondly, we've made pretty big investments in digital marketing, which has had an uptick for us but is still early days with that. When you put all of that focus together, I think you're going to see definitely more consistency in the Named segment, but it's a work in progress for us. We get our revenue from a number of different places, John. As you know, you've got one of the most sophisticated models out there. We know how to do renewals. We're good at that. We know how to upsell in a renewal and extend the size of the wallet and account. We know how to do that real well. We've been doing a much better job over the last 2 years of selling outside the renewal, and there's always room for improvement there. But we know how to do that. When it comes to capacity sales, that's not something that we get to drive as much as some people would like to think. At the end of the day, you either need capacity or you don't. And to the extent that customers need capacity, we absolutely know how to do that. The hardest thing for us to do that we're getting better and better at in each and every quarter is cold-calling into a customer that we have a little or no relationship with, explaining what CA is, explaining what it is we can do to help them. And that's taking time, and we're going to keep at it all day everyday. Is that helpful?"

And I think within that, the large SI contributed high 40s to total new sales growth, and acquisitions contributed high 20s. I presume there's some overlap there just in terms of the fact that the SI bought quite a bit of PAM in the quarter. But just kind of wondering roughly what the new sales growth would be, or would have been on an organic basis? And if you excluded that one large deal in the quarter."

UIM, especially with the new release, was strong again. APM, strong again. Rally was another strong quarter for us. So when you take a look at a lot of these, Rally is -- the Rally would probably be excluded from organic. But when you take a look at another transaction we did with PAM, although the product is not organic, there's no way that, that sale would have gotten done without our sales force. So I think that's quasi organic or inorganic, but it was the biggest -- the second biggest transaction, I think, PAM has ever done, and it would never have been done without the relationships that we have."

And also, we're going to do acquisitions, so I want to make sure that, that CFO has the ability to understand the dynamics of doing acquisitions. And lastly is this maniacal drumbeat of paying attention to customers. Paying attention to customers has to be the focus of everybody in the company. Now the tip of the spear usually shows up in sales and in product, but how you model, how you budget, how you think through all of the things that customers are driving us for, I think, a CFO plays a pretty strategic role in helping all of the business units think that through and make sure that we're organized from a financial perspective to understand that."

We also have another product that did very well in Security, it's called Payment Security. So we are definitely very focused on taking advantage of a number of unique things happening in that security market space. First of all, the market is continuously growing. There's no winner across the board in Security. Customers are leaning towards companies that have more scale and more breadth because they're looking for global service on a topic like this. They would prefer to deal with fewer vendors rather than stitch together the Security platforms of multiple vendors. The fact that we've got a very large portfolio and are dominant in the ID management space, I think, puts us in a very good position to compete. As you -- as we get closer to CA World, you're going to see us put out more organic product with respect to Security. And I think that the way that we think through Security and the way that we're thinking through how the security of the future operates with predictive analytics is unique to the market space.

And oddly enough, this is something that really requires a lot of insight and intellect because we can lock things down pretty tight. The user experience becomes more difficult the more tighter we lock things down. Customers push back on that and end users push back on it even harder. So the real secret is to make an elegant solution that is very robust, very safe, provides an incredible amount of governance and reporting and makes it easy for the users to do what it is they want to do. And a lot of that is going to be based on predictive analytics.

What we're buying has to fit in the context of our strategy, and we're very specific with respect to what that is. We wouldn't want it be more than a standard deviation outside of the core tenets of our strategy. We're not chasing revenue. We're not chasing fads. We have an intimate idea of what enterprise software is going to look like in the future. And to the extent that we could find great technology that fits that strategy, we're all in.

While we undertake a search for Rich's replacement, Kieran McGrath, CA's Corporate Controller, has been named interim CFO, reporting to me. Kieran was the finance lead of IBM's $25 billion global software business and brings a wealth of financial and operational and transformational management experience. We also announced that Adam Elster and Ayman Sayed have been named President, Global Field Operations, and President, Chief Product Officer, respectively. This fine-tuning of our organizational structure further strengthens and integrates sales and product, 2 areas that are key to our growth. This level of collaboration ensures that our development and go-to-market efforts are completely aligned to customer and market demand. 
Turning to the quarter. New sales were up significantly higher than we had expected. Total new sales increased more than 50%, and organic new sales increased in the high 20s. A big driver of Q1 new sales growth was a transaction with a large system integrator or SI that was originally slated to expire in FY '18. We are pleased with the metrics of this 7-year deal, which had a healthy attach rate and enabled CA to gain wallet share. 
Excluding this early renewal, total new sales increased in the high single digits year-over-year. New sales in the quarter also benefited from deals that slipped from Q4 last year into Q1 this year. 
Mainframe new sales increased well over 100% year-over-year. Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the low 20s year-over-year. From a product perspective, the greatest contributors to new sales growth in the first quarter were Mainframe, Security, Agile Central, PPM, UIM and APM. 
Overall, I'm very happy with our first quarter results. Our revenue grew nearly 3%. We delivered very good margin performance despite a difficult year-over-year compare, which drove solid EPS and CFFO. 
Looking ahead to Q2, please remember that Q2 of fiscal year 2016 included a large SI renewal with incredibly strong metrics, which creates a very difficult compare next quarter. 
Turning to our products. Q2 marks the anniversary of our acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium. Both acquisitions continue to perform well, and their performance has accelerated beyond pre-acquisition run rates. That said, there is still ample runway ahead for each of these acquisitions to reach their full potential. 
In the quarter, as part of the large SI deal, CA Privileged Access Management, or PAM, closed the single largest deal in Xceedium's history, both pre- and post-acquisition. It was selected over other competitors to become the standard for the large SI to leverage across its more than 1,000 global customers. Separately, CA PAM displaced an incumbent at a large American multinational telecommunications company due to CA PAM's strength in password management. Our performance this quarter demonstrates our strategy of acquiring great technology and leveraging our relationships to accelerate growth. This is one of the reasons why we are committed to M&A as part of our 3-legged capital allocation strategy. Clearly, we are very happy with our recent acquisitions. 
Meanwhile, we remain committed to cultivating the spirit of innovation at CA. Unified Infrastructure Management or UIM for cloud launched at the end of the quarter. It is a great example of how we're executing to our strategic imperative to innovate organically. UIM is a market-leading cloud-monitoring solution that showcases CA's position as a platform agnostic solution provider. With our new UIM for cloud release, CA now supports Amazon Web Services, OpenStack, Docker, Nutanix and PureStorage for private and public cloud as well as on-premise. Many of our customers see CA Unified Infrastructure Management at the heart of their cloud strategy. Our new capabilities supporting Amazon Web Services and OpenStack are essential in helping to optimize customer workloads. We are pleased that IT Central Station, a leading crowd-sourced product review site for enterprise technology, named CA UIM as the #1 solution for cloud monitoring. 
Project and Portfolio Management, or PPM, is another area that has consistently been a bright spot and serves as a great example of our organic innovation. PPM had a good first quarter, with new sales up mid-single digits year-over-year. In the quarter, there were a number of 6-figure transactions that closed, 3 of which were brand-new customers to the platform. We often win because of PPM's superior functionality, which is encouraging and highlights the value our internal development teams can bring to market. PPM new sales have grown in 4 of the 5 most recent quarters. We are pleased that in our first quarter, CA was named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for IT Project and Portfolio Management Software Applications. 
I'd also like to take the opportunity to call out the exceptional quarter Mainframe had in Q1. I am very pleased with both Mainframe new sales and revenue performance in the quarter. As one of the few software solution providers investing in the mainframe, CA is a trusted partner to many of the largest enterprises around the world. 
One of our key competitive advantages at our largest customers is our combined Enterprise and Mainframe Solutions portfolio. Our customers are challenged to manage increasingly complex, heterogeneous public, private, hybrid cloud and on-premise environments. Our combined Enterprise and Mainframe Solutions segment enable us to strategically partner with customers to develop innovative solutions that solve some of the most complicated problems that span multiple platforms. Many of our customers benefit from the ability of CA to manage their entire infrastructure stack across distributed, cloud and mainframe. The positive impact this has on our customer is notable. It lowers our customers' cost of ownership and shortens the time it takes to find and resolve issues. From global financial institutions and industrial conglomerates, to governments and telecom companies, enterprises around the world employ a combination of CA's cross-platform solutions and leverage the synergies between our Mainframe and Enterprise Solution products. The interplay between Mainframe and Enterprise enables CA to cost-effectively bring new innovation to the mainframe market. This supports our customers' commitment to the platform. It also supports a seamless user experience by making it much easier for customers to manage instead of coordinating a number of disparate point-solution vendors. There is no doubt that we are continuing to make progress towards our goal of building this company for long-term sustainable growth. Our development organization continues to improve as we focus on making products that matter with improved user interfaces that are easy to deploy and easy to manage. Success here will better enable us to leverage channel opportunities and grow through alternative routes to market. 
Our sales organization has also seen considerable improvement. For example, looking at our Platinum Net Promoter Score, or NPS, which is based on a survey designed to measure the willingness of customers to recommend CA to other customers, our scores continue to trend positively. More broadly, our customer satisfaction scores are also following a similar positive trajectory. We know that when we are at our best, we are customer-centric, results-focused, self-aware and agile. 
While our performance in Named and Growth, or Partner-led businesses, was uneven in Q1, we continue to view this as a significant opportunity for CA to meaningfully expand our market reach. We have just started to the scratch the surface. We will continue to make adjustments and be agile in our approach to driving continuous improvement throughout the organization. 
Overall, I am very encouraged by our progress across a number of fronts. But as I've said before, progress will not be linear. We have had a very good Q1, but we face an incredibly difficult new sales compare in Q2. We are on a journey to transform this company to one of sustainable long-term growth. We still have work to do. 
That said, I'd like to be the first to invite you to come and see some of the fruits of this work at CA World this year. We will host a financial analyst track on November 16th, which will provide a great opportunity to speak with a number of people on our executive team; experience a broad array of our solutions in action; and hear what our customers are saying first-hand. There really is no better way to fully capture the CA picture than to experience CA World for yourself. We will be sending out save-the-dates with a registration link shortly. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich to review our first quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

I am proud to have been a part of the substantial change that has taken place over the years and to be in a position to leave CA in capable hands. I am confident that a solid foundation is in place to support the next phase of CA's journey. 
As usual, before we get started with the quarterly review, let me remind you that all comparisons are year-over-year and in constant currency, unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I am going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
Our Q1 total revenue was $999 million and up 3% in constant currency and 2% as reported. As Mike mentioned, this was the second consecutive quarter we have grown revenue year-over-year in constant currency. Q1 Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 10%, Mainframe Solutions decreased 1%, and Services declined 2%. Q1 total new product and capacity sales were up in the mid-50s and low 50s as reported. Organic sales were up high 20s and mid-20s as reported. Both organic and inorganic new sales were driven by the SI. The large system integrator contributed high 40s to the total new sales growth. Acquisitions contributed high 20s to total new sales growth. The increase in Q1 total new sales, excluding the large SI, was primarily due to Mainframe Solutions new product sales. 
Q1 renewals more than doubled year-over-year, both in constant currency and as reported. As we have previously stated, the year-over-year change in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions. The large system integrator transaction replaced an existing deal that was scheduled to expire in fiscal 2018. This new transaction provided an incremental contract value in excess of $475 million and extends the agreement an additional 5 years. As such, we now expect fiscal 2017 renewals to be up in the high teens year-over-year as compared to fiscal 2016 in constant currency and as reported. 
Renewal yield for the quarter was in the low 90s percent range, in line with our long-term target. 
Turning to geographies. New sales were particularly strong in North America, driven by the large system integrator transaction. New sales were also strong in EMEA. However, new sales were down in APJ and down sharply in Latin America due to continued macroeconomic challenges in the region. 
As Mike mentioned, revenue grew across all geographies in constant currency. On an as-reported basis, revenue grew across all geographies except Latin America, where revenue decreased slightly. 
Within our segments, Mainframe new sales more than doubled year-over-year in constant currency and as reported. The large SI transaction contributed slightly more than 100% of the greater than 150% Mainframe Solutions new product sales growth. Overall, we continue to expect our Mainframe revenue to be down in the low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the mainframe market. 
Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the low 20s year-over-year in constant currency and as reported. The large SI contributed in the high 20s to Enterprise Solutions new product sales growth. Areas such as Security, Agile Central, PPM, UIM and APM contributed to the new sales growth in the quarter. However, as we've discussed in the past, within Enterprise Solutions, there are products in our enhanced portfolio that are more mature and not growing but contribute to margin and cash flow. Acquisitions contributed mid-30s to new sales growth within Enterprise Solutions and were a notable contributor to the value we were delivering in the large SI transaction. 
Services revenue decreased 2% in constant currency and 3% as reported. Over the long term, we expect Services revenue to decline as we design our products to be easier to install and as we leverage partners. 
Total revenue backlog improved to up 15% in constant currency and up 14% as reported. Current revenue backlog improved to flat in constant currency and as reported. As we said in the past, current revenue backlog will likely grow after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low 90s renewal yield. We expect current revenue backlog to fluctuate this year. 
Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 39% and GAAP operating margin was 29%. Operating margin declined year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of a favorable legal development in the year-ago period. 
Segment operating margins in the quarter were 62% for Mainframe Solutions, 13% for Enterprise Solutions and 3% for Services. Our Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 29%. Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.64, down 2% year-over-year and flat as reported. Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.47, down 4% and flat year-over-year as reported. 
Our Q1 CFFO was $161 million, down 10% year-over-year or down 14% as reported. CFFO declined year-over-year due to the timing of cash taxes, which were lower in the year-ago period. Single installment cash payments were $23 million, down year-over-year. We ended Q1 with approximately $688 million in net cash. 
During the first quarter, we repurchased $50 million in shares and paid $107 million in dividends. We have $700 million remaining in our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. 
As Mike said, our uneven performance in some product areas and in Named and Growth, and Partner-led opportunities, are places we are focusing as we continue this journey to transform the company to one that can sustainably grow as we continue to work to improve the efficiency and productivity within our development organization. Simultaneously, we are working to drive continuous improvements across our sales organization so that consistency and velocity trend in the right direction across all geographies. 
Overall, we are getting better, but we have not yet crossed the chasm. It is important to note that the current revenue backlog was flat in the quarter, consistent with our prior commentary. We expect backlog will fluctuate through the year. The large SI deal that was signed in Q1 was great for CA, with the total deal size, aggregate revenue run rate, associated renewal yield all representing very good metrics for us. While the large SI deal had no impact to Q1 revenue and minimal impact to current backlog, it does substantially shift the renewal portfolio such that FY '17 is now significantly larger and FY '18 is naturally much lighter. Consequently, fiscal 2018 renewals are expected to decline year-over-year due to the timing of the large SI. Otherwise, the renewal portfolio is substantially unchanged relative to our prior expectations. 
As Mike mentioned, Q2 will be challenged by an extremely difficult compare due to the large SI that renewed in the year-ago period. This will be particularly evident in the new sales, which are expected to decline sharply. Conversely, we had acquisition-related expenses that should create a more favorable year-over-year compare from an operating margin perspective. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based on exchange rates of the last day of the preceding quarter, which was June 30, 2016. The guidance also assumes no material acquisitions. For the full year, we continue to expect total revenue to be in the range of flat to up 1% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of around $4.03 billion to $4.07 billion. We expect a full year non-GAAP operating margin of 38% and a GAAP full year operating margin of 29% compared to prior GAAP operating margin guidance of 30%. GAAP operating margin and EPS guidance reflect the impact of the increase in our share price on stock-based compensation. We expect our non-GAAP and GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%, consistent with our prior expectations. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.49 to $2.54. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 2% to 5% compared to prior guidance of 3% to 6%. The change in our GAAP growth expectations reflects the impact of the increase in our stock price on stock-based compensation. As mentioned earlier, this translates to a reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.88 to $1.93. 
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 411 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 414 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to increase 1% to 5% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.05 billion to $1.09 billion. 
For this Q&A session, we've asked Kieran to step in to field questions with Mike. I'll be here should there be any particular points where I can offer clarity, but we'd like to give Kieran the opportunity to step into this part of his new role. 
With that, we'll open it up for questions."

It was at the request of the customer and in an effort to support their business. But it ended up being a very tightly negotiated contract that has excellent metrics. We added $425 million worth of net new value with that contract -- sorry, it's $475 million of net new value and it takes out for 7 years. And when you take a look at this particular system integrator, this -- our technology is going to be installed in over 1,000 customers. In it is a lot of our new technology, for example, PAM, the Privileged Access Management is part of that transaction, which we think is top of mind for most companies right now. And having that installed in that many particular accounts, I think, is tremendous for us. The other thing that's significant is we've locked up our 3 biggest customers for almost 5 years now. That gives us a lot of visibility and it gives us an awful lot of software running in an awful lot of customers, where we have an opportunity to extend those relationships over time. So it's a pretty significant transaction as you can tell by the size of it and how it's affected our operating metrics. And I couldn't be happier with the team that negotiated it, and I really do like the characteristics of the transaction."

The hardest thing for us to do is to sell new software to a net new customer. Almost all of our energy for new on the product side, on the marketing side, on the sales side is equipping that sales team with the tools and capabilities to be able to sell our products into customers where we don't have a significant relationship. Now the volume of transaction is going -- are going up, and I'm pretty pleased with that. But we need to have more product and we have to have more customers buying in that space. I think there's things that we can do product-wise. I think there's things that we can do marketing-wise with our compete level. And I also think there's things we can do from a sales effectiveness perspective to make that more repeatable over time. And this really does lead into how I've changed the tone with respect to product and sales. I think this is not a unique issue with respect to CA. I think this is an industry issue. Customers today, they want to talk to sales professionals that really understand them and their line of business and how our products work in the context of their operation. That's why you see so much focus on try and buy and proof-of-concept in the selling motion. Secondly, if you're building products, especially if you're building Agile, you have to have customers participate in the build very early on in the design cycle. We need our sales teams to have the relationships and accounts where they're willing to participate in our design because if they participate in our design, the probability that we build an application that absolutely solves a group of problems for a wide variety of customers goes up. At the end of the day, customers want products that are easy to install, easy to upgrade, easy to operate, and having both Ayman and Adam focus on that together, I think, is going to have a material impact to our overall consistency and our ability to sell not just in Platinum, but also in the Named and Growth space."

And we think with the amount of capacity IBM is putting out into marketplace, we get to populate that. I do think we would be somewhat naive if we were to ignore just the overall market trends at this point in time. We think the minus 1% here is a pretty nice improvement that we've seen. If you recall, a year ago, we were running at about minus 3% for the first half of the year, and we've made steady improvement in that space. Right now, from what we can see, low single digits seems very doable, very manageable and actually very much in sync with where the market is. Obviously, any opportunity to do better than that, of course the team will take advantage of that. But that's where -- right now, we really just expect it to be down in the low single digits."

And we have other areas that they have not been able to penetrate into some of those accounts. Now some of that is brand and brand recognition. You have to remember that for -- we're a 40-year-old company. For 37 years of that, we basically sold to between 100 and 200 customers, and now we're expanding our TAM, trying to get into the other 1,700 customers that buy enterprise software and they just don't know CA as well as they should. The brand marketing that we're doing with CNN gets us to be known. The work, especially in Europe, that we've done with Trek and the cycling team has been phenomenal, for people asking the question is, what is CA? So we're getting some brand awareness, and I think's helping the sales force. Coupled with that is a lot of product improvements. We've been changing the product to get to where those types of customers want to buy. They want easy to use. They want easy to buy. They want easy to upgrade. They want to understand how that product works before they buy it. And I think that's not a CA phenomenon, that's an industry phenomenon. I think that as you are building out net new product, if it doesn't have those types of characteristics, it's going to be harder and harder to sell. When you take a look at our product portfolio, we have a number of products that do that and do that very well, but we don't have enough of them. And when I work with Ayman and I work with Adam, those are the things that we're trying to drill down on. Now secondly, we've made pretty big investments in digital marketing, which has had an uptick for us but is still early days with that. When you put all of that focus together, I think you're going to see definitely more consistency in the Named segment, but it's a work in progress for us. We get our revenue from a number of different places, John. As you know, you've got one of the most sophisticated models out there. We know how to do renewals. We're good at that. We know how to upsell in a renewal and extend the size of the wallet and account. We know how to do that real well. We've been doing a much better job over the last 2 years of selling outside the renewal, and there's always room for improvement there. But we know how to do that. When it comes to capacity sales, that's not something that we get to drive as much as some people would like to think. At the end of the day, you either need capacity or you don't. And to the extent that customers need capacity, we absolutely know how to do that. The hardest thing for us to do that we're getting better and better at in each and every quarter is cold-calling into a customer that we have a little or no relationship with, explaining what CA is, explaining what it is we can do to help them. And that's taking time, and we're going to keep at it all day everyday. Is that helpful?"

There's no winner across the board in Security. Customers are leaning towards companies that have more scale and more breadth because they're looking for global service on a topic like this. They would prefer to deal with fewer vendors rather than stitch together the Security platforms of multiple vendors. The fact that we've got a very large portfolio and are dominant in the ID management space, I think, puts us in a very good position to compete.

I'm pleased to report solid Q2 results. We delivered another quarter of revenue growth with strong margins and earnings.

We delivered another quarter of revenue growth with strong margins and earnings. Our performance in the quarter improves our confidence in our ability to cross over into modest revenue growth for the full year of fiscal 2017. We are making progress across a number of our key initiatives. Our product development and innovation engines are beginning to gain traction and I am very pleased with our customer experience metrics. We know that we are moving the ball in the right direction, while we recognize that there are areas in which we still need to continue to improve. As expected, new sales declined in the quarter driven largely by the very difficult year-over-year comparison as a result of the large system integrator deal we closed in the year-ago period. Importantly, as we mentioned last quarter, we now have agreements in place with our 3 largest SI customers for the next several years. This reflects our position as a trusted technology partner to the largest global system integrators and provides us with good visibility into our longer term customer commitments. 
In terms of sales execution, I am happy to report that our freestanding new sales increased year-over-year. While the overall portfolio of deals for us to renew was smaller in Q2, I'm encouraged by our healthy attach rates to renewals. In the quarter, MetLife, one of the largest global insurance companies; FedEx, a global transportation and business services leader and Cerner, a health care delivery solutions provider, expanded their relationships with CA to include a number of solutions across our portfolio. New sales in our Named and Growth or partner-led accounts also grew nicely. Continued progress in freestanding new sales and penetration into Named and Growth accounts are key to driving long-term sustained growth. 
Q2 CFFO was negatively impacted year-over-year by the combination of a lower level of single installment collections and a higher level of cash tax payments in the quarter. As we said before, we remain focused on and committed to developing products that are easier to install and easier to manage. A byproduct of this can be seen in  the decline we are experiencing in our Services revenue. We continue to expect as our portfolio of more user-friendly products grows and we increasingly leverage partners, our Services revenue line will be impacted. Our Q2 Services performance reflects this ongoing trend. 
Results were also impacted by a lower level of prior period Services bookings and some non-strategic projects that have come to close. We expect these collective factors will continue to be headwinds for our Services revenue. 
We remain committed to cultivating and nurturing the spirit of innovation at CA. While there is always more work to do and we acknowledge that real, systemic change within a large product organization takes time to bear fruit, we are making considerable progress. We are continuing to innovate within our existing portfolio and now have a more disciplined process in place to invest in future areas of growth for CA. I'm very pleased that our efforts are recognized by industry analysts and, most importantly, our customers. We look forward to providing more color on our progress at CA World next month. 
I would like to highlight our overall portfolio of Continuous Delivery solutions, which had a great quarter with significant customer wins across a number of sectors, including financial Services, telecommunications, media, government and health care IT. We are committed to helping our customers become more agile in the Application Economy. Our Continuous Delivery portfolio is central to the strategy as it enables customers rapidly develop, efficiently test and reliably release applications. The result is more higher quality applications delivered to the market at a faster pace. 
We continue to invest in innovations across the Continuous Delivery portfolio. Our latest version was made available in July and focuses on an improved Security model for customers. It also provides dependency management for complex deployments involving multiple applications. We are pleased the CA Release Automation was positioned by Gartner in the Leaders quadrant in its inaugural Magic Quadrant for Application Release Automation. It helps customers manage their complex Continuous Delivery pipelines and it is a critical element of a DevOps strategy in executing many small releases in quick succession. 
In August, we've released the latest version of CA Agile Requirements Designer, an end-to-end requirements gathering, test automation and test case design tool that reduces manual testing effort. And just last month, we announced the small but strategic acquisition of BlazeMeter. While not meaningful in terms of its immediate financial impact, BlazeMeter adds a next-generation, open-source SaaS-based performance and load testing platform to the portfolio. 
Within Security, I am particularly pleased with Privileged Access Management, advanced authentication as well as Payment Security, which all delivered very healthy new sales growth. 
In the quarter, we closed multiple 7-figure transactions, including very good competitive wins for CA Privileged Access Management. We released a number of enhancements across the portfolio and we continue to view Security as one of the key pillars in our strategy to grow in the years ahead. Security is a critical component for our customers and their digital transformation strategies. 
We are pleased with our performance of our Mainframe business from a revenue perspective for the second quarter and for the first half of our fiscal year. We recognize that this is a market not in secular growth, unlike the rest of our markets. As such, there is no doubt that size matters. We are in a unique position as the largest independent software vendor in this market and, really, the only other company outside of IBM making meaningful investments to support, sustain and innovate for our customers with a Mainframe footprint. This means that we are able to organically innovate on the Mainframe with solutions like CA data content discovery or DCD with more than 70% of enterprise data on the Mainframe. DCD enables customers to identify data exposure risks on Z Systems by automatically scanning through the data on the Mainframe infrastructure for regulated or sensitive data. Data discovery, classification by Security level and comprehensive reporting enables our customers to mitigate risk. We are the only vendor in the market that does this on the Mainframe and we are very pleased with the performance and rate of market adoption. 
The breadth and scale of our portfolio, our focus on integrations across the enterprise and our dedicated efforts to continually improve customer experience are the foundations of our ability to support end-to-end DevOps on the Mainframe. We have flagship solutions like CA Endevor, which provides source code management; an archives versioning of code development, including Java; and parallel development. We also provide newer solutions like CA Application Lifecycle Conductor, or ALC, which helps customers automate and manage the software development life cycle spanning mobile to Mainframe environments. 
CA provides one of the broadest portfolios of Mainframe Solutions and industry and we are leveraging our R&D across our development organization. For example, CA Agile Central users can create a new Agile story and then drag and drop so that ALC and Endevor create all of the associated code on the Mainframe and move the code from development to test and then to production. Other examples of Enterprise Solutions and Mainframe synergies include CA Release Automation, test data management and service virtualization. These are all tangible proof points of CA's commitment to an investment in providing value to our customers across Mainframe, distributed, cloud and mobile. 
This leads me to an area in which everyone across every level of CA's global workforce is focused: customer experience. Perhaps the best way to illustrate what this means to us is to provide a few specific customer examples. TomTom, the Dutch navigation, mapping, GPS and now sports and fitness company, implemented CA Agile Central in its transition from traditional waterfall software development to Agile. Through this experience, TomTom views CA as much more than a software provider. CA is a trusted partner that provides access, demonstrates responsiveness and engages in continuous product collaboration. The Royal Bank of Scotland is implementing the bank's vision of delivering a seamless, omnichannel customer experience using CA risk analytics. CA solutions and partnership enables RBF to be agile and adaptive to the needs of its customers in an ever-changing financial services industry. These are the types of stories that motivate us every day. From the earliest point of contact with customers through the many years that follow, we have vastly improved how we are showing up. From our CNN partnership for its election coverage to the tens of thousands of customers we reached out to on Customer Experience Day last month, and the ongoing contact our development and sales teams have with our customers on a daily basis, we have made considerable improvement. CA's brand familiarity and consideration continues to move higher, particularly among business decision makers. Our customers are giving us higher scores on product quality and customer satisfaction continues to trend positively. We are proud of the great progress our team has made across the organization, but we are not satisfied. We still have work to do to further refine and optimize and really be agile so that we can continue to evolve and achieve the type of long-term sustainable growth we know we have the potential to achieve. Looking ahead, I'm optimistic. When I look at our company holistically in terms of the markets we're in and the opportunities we have, both organically and inorganically, I believe that we are on track. Overall, we believe we can deliver modest, low single-digit growth over the medium term. 
We look forward to welcoming many of you at CA World next month. Through keynotes, guest speakers and technical and best practices sessions, we'll explore and demonstrate how software has risen from a supporting role to the lead actor in driving business strategy and velocity. We will host an analyst session on November 16th that will provide a great opportunity to speak with our executive team and to hear what our customers are saying first hand. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kieran to review our second quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with our quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
Our Q2 total revenue was $1,018,000,000 [ph] and was up 1% and up 2% in constant currency. This was the second consecutive quarter we've grown revenue year-over-year as reported and the third in constant currency. Q2 Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 7% and increased 8% in constant currency. Mainframe Solutions decreased 1% as reported and in constant currency. Services declined 10% and declined 9% in constant currency. 
Q2 total new product and capacity sales were down in the mid-20s as reported and in constant currency. The decrease in Q2 total new sales was due primarily to a difficult year-over-year compare driven by new sales associated with the large system integrator renewal transaction we signed in Q2 last year. Excluding the large SI transaction, total new product and capacity sales were down low teens as reported and in constant currency. 
Q2 renewals were down in the mid-50s, both as reported and in constant currency. Excluding the large SI transaction, renewals were down high single-digits both as reported and in constant currency. As we previously stated, the year-over-year change in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions. We continue to expect the renewal portfolio in fiscal 2017 to increase in the high teens year-over-year both as reported and in constant currency. Renewal yield for the quarter was in the low 90s, in line with our longer-term target. 
Turning to geographies. New sales were down in North America due in part to the difficult year-over-year compare resulting from last year's large SI transaction as well as a smaller renewal portfolio even outside of this large SI transaction. New sales in Latin America declined due to ongoing macro economic challenges in the region. New sales were up in EMEA due to strong performance in Named and Growth or partner-led accounts. To this point, we have seen minimal impact from Brexit on new sales. APJ was up sharply to more normalized levels following a difficult quarter in the year-ago period. Revenue grew across all geographies as reported, except in EMEA. Revenue grew in North America and APJ, was flat in Latin America and declined in EMEA in constant currency. 
Within our segments, Mainframe new sales declined in the mid-40s year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Excluding last year's large SI transaction, Mainframe new sales declined in the mid-20s and in the low 20s in constant currency. Mainframe new sales performance reflects lower levels of Mainframe capacity due to the composition of the renewal portfolio outside of the large SI renewal in the year-ago period. Overall, we continue to expect our Mainframe revenue to be down in the low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the Mainframe market. 
Enterprise Solutions new sales decreased in the high teens year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Extruding last year's large SI transaction, Enterprise Solutions new sales decreased high single-digits as reported and in constant currency, in line with the renewal portfolio. Areas such as Continuous Delivery and Security saw positive new sales growth in the quarter. However, as we discussed in the past, within Enterprise Solutions, there are products in our enhanced portfolio that are more mature and not growing, but contribute to margin and cash flow. 
Services revenue decreased 10% and 9% in constant currency. We expect Services revenue to decline as we design our products to be easier to install and as we leverage partners. Services revenue is also impacted by a lower level of bookings in previous quarters and the conclusion of some nonstrategic Services engagements. As Mike mentioned, we expect this headwind in Services will continue to have a dampening effect on our overall revenue growth. 
Total revenue backlog was up 4% as reported and in constant currency. Current revenue backlog declined 2% as reported and in constant currency. As we've said in the past, current revenue backlog will likely grow after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low 90s [ph] renewal yield. 
Q2 GAAP operating margin was 31% and non-GAAP operating margin was 40%. Operating margin improved year-over-year due to improved operating efficiencies and the impact of the acquisition-related expenses in the year-ago period. This was partially offset by increase in legal expenses related to us entering into an agreement in principle to settle the long-standing matter brought against us by the DOJ and individual plaintiff relating to our GSA schedule with the government. This litigation was previously disclosed by us and relates to time period as far back as 2002. The proposed settlement is for $45 million and admits no wrongdoing. While it is still subject to finalization, we are pleased to have entered into this agreement in principle in an effort to put it behind us. We look forward to continuing our long-standing relationship with the government as a trusted and valued customer and partner. 
Segment operating margins in the quarter were 62% for Mainframe Solutions, 18% for Enterprise Solutions, and 3% for Services. Our Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 31% and 29%, respectively. Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.50, up 28% year-over-year and up 31% in constant currency. Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.67, [ph] up 20% year-over-year and up 18% in constant currency. 
Our Q2 CFFO was negative $58 [ph] million, down year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. CFFO declined relative to the year-ago period primarily due to a lower level of single installment collections in the quarter as well as higher cash tax payments. Single installment cash payments were $59 million and down $70 million year-over-year. The lower level of single installment cash payments resulted from the mix of renewals in the quarter, which had fewer large financial institutions. Single installment cash payments typically come from large financial institutions. 
We ended Q2 with approximately $496 million in net cash. During the second quarter, we repurchased $50 million in shares and paid $107 million in dividends. We have $650 [ph] million remaining of our original $750 [ph] million share repurchase authorization. 
As Mike said, we are pleased with our Q2 performance as it gives us improved confidence in our ability to cross over into modest revenue growth for the full year in fiscal year '17. We are making progress across key imperatives and are continuously evaluating opportunities to improve our ability to sustainably grow. However, there is still work to do. Our performance in some product areas and in Named and Growth and partner-led opportunities continues to improve, but remains uneven. Also, our strong revenue performance in the quarter and the first half was aided by a relatively well proportion of upfront deals in the year-ago period, making for easier compares. As we indicated last quarter, the large SI deal we signed in Q1 substantially shifted the renewal portfolio such that fiscal year '18 renewals are expected to decline year-over-year. To overcome this headwind, we are working to drive continuous improvement in the sales organization to increase consistency and velocity, independent of the renewal cycle. We are continuing to work to improve the efficiency and productivity within our development organization and continue to evaluate M&A opportunities to supplement our portfolio. As a company, we expect modest revenue growth in the medium term. This is the result of our three-pronged capital allocation of quarterly dividends, share repurchases and expositions. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was September 30, 2016. The guidance also assumes no material acquisitions. For the full year, we expect total revenue to increase in a range of flat to up 1% as reported and in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectation. This translates to reported revenue of $4.03 billion to $4.07 billion. We expect full year GAAP operating margin of 29% and full year non-GAAP operating margin of 38%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%, consistent with our prior expectations. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to increase in a range of 6% to 8% as reported and 2% to 5% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.88 to $1.93. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to increase in a range of 2% to 5% as reported and 1% to 3% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.49 to $2.54. 
We'd like to provide some additional color regarding our expectations for the second half of fiscal '17. While there's no change to our full year revenue guidance, I'd like to provide some headlights into how we expect Q3 to play out. In terms of the year-over-year compare, the tailwind of the upfront revenue mix that benefited the first half of the fiscal year is expected to become a headwind in the second half of the fiscal year. As such, we expect revenue to decline a couple of percentage points year-over-year in Q3. This is largely due to the timing of the mix of upfront deals that closed last year in addition to a lower level of Services revenue. As discussed earlier, the upfront mix was particularly low in the first half of fiscal 2016 and then rebounded in the third quarter. 
With regard to non-GAAP operating margins, we expect the lower revenue level to impact Q3 operating margin when compared to the year-ago period. As indicated earlier, there is no change to our full year 2017 revenue or operating margin guidance. 
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 411 million shares outstanding at a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 414 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to be in the range of a 3% decrease to a 1% increase both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to $1.01 billion to $1.05 billion. Previous quarter guidance was an increase of 2% to 6% and an increase of 1% to 5% in constant currency. This change is due to the anticipated settlement of legal matters related to the agreement in principle for the GSA litigation previously discussed. 
With that, we'll open it up for questions."

If you take a look at the cyclical nature of our business and when acquisitions have hit around the yearly [ph] anniversary of Rally and with the Xceedium acquisition being relatively small and the amount of capital we had to put into making Xceedium ready for large-scale customer usage, we've had some savings.

And for the company as a whole, if you look at those onetime costs that we didn't occur this year, basically, think of it as offset with the GSA impact. So the real impact in the margin improvement for the company as a whole as well as for ES was the lot of the upfront revenue that we talked about. So you heard we describe that we had a very we compare in terms of our upfront revenue, and that's all in the ES segment a year ago. The growth that we had in upfront revenue in Q2 was worth about 3 or 4 points of margin expansion on a year-over-year basis. And as Mike said, longer-term plans, we'd expect to get there. And just keep in mind, Q3, we always have the seasonality of our CA World, which incurs some big cost. And then obviously, in Q4, we're finalizing commissions and payouts.

We've consistently seen low single-digit Mainframe deceleration. So it hasn't -- I wouldn't characterize it in the higher end of single digit deceleration. And when we're talking to customers, customers that have made investment in the Mainframe continue to invest in the Mainframe for a variety of reasons. I think, the biggest reason is that's where the applications are. And if you park those applications on to a different platform to do the exact same thing, the amount of calories to do that and the amount of risk, especially of you're in a regulated environment, there just hasn't been a whole lot of appetite to do that. They'd rather spend their net new development dollars building net new products and services to get to devices that customers want. Secondly, there's been a great set technology. One of them that we're one of the primary supply of is API Management. So a lot of Mainframe customers want to serve up that mainframe data that's very  protected, very secured and put it on to a tablet, put it on to a smartphone, and the way they're doing that is using API technology. So they get to keep the high-volume transaction processing engine that is currently working, keep applications, the data structures in place and then being able to serve their customers in a way that customers want to be served. So I think that's the stability argument for the Mainframe, and we haven't anything really change with respect to the. With respect to margin, as you know, we break out our business in 3 segments: Mainframe; ES; and Services. But Mainframe always being in the low 60s and Services fluctuating in the mid-teens. As we continue to get better and have better efficiencies in our enterprise business and higher volume of revenue, we are able to get a blended margin in the high 30s and we feel pretty confident about that through the foreseeable future Kieran, maybe have a couple of comments with respect to the margin?"

But we really extremely low levels as we said in the first 2 quarters of last year and tha really rebounded very nicely up to actually quite high levels of upfront recognition in the third quarter of last year. We actually had a deal related to our Xceedium business that we sold into a government agency, the largest deal that they've ever done, and that was all taken on an upfront basis. So what we're seeing this quarter, very low renewals. Again, nothing unusual about it except that we just didn't have a lot of big deals expiring at this particular point in time.

If you take a look at just this last quarter, with what a relatively small company called BlazeMeter, which is very strategic for us. We've had a lot of growth in our testing market. This is an additive to the testing market that gives customers another opportunity to protect their code as it goes into production. And this is a foray into another SaaS products, and it's also using a significant amount of open-source technology. So it fits all of the things that we think are important and what customers want to buy. And to the the extent that we see opportunities like that, what it does is it gives us an opportunity to accelerate growth and it also derisks our plan going forward."

That's a single product, and I think in my prepared remarks, I had 3 or 4 different products that we profiled. This is one that's done both ways, Michael.

Whenever we're pitching the renewals, our sales force is trained to use that as an opportunity to keep their renewal yield high. So we're constantly shooting for something higher than a 90 in our renewal cycle company. And what it does is it takes some of the pressure of that renewal yield away. The overarching pieces of what we're trying to do there is to help that deceleration and that secular deceleration of the Mainframe debited down by offering customers both net new solutions and also psychologically show them that we're still investing in the Mainframe. We have --  we're 1 of only 2 companies that are still making significant investments in R&D on the Mainframe. And to the extent that we're able to package that up and show the value, I think it protects the franchise."

Now from a freestanding sales perspective, clearly, long term, that is absolutely the objective, right? The objective is over the long haul, to ensure that our business is always going to look for opportunities to sell and not have to wait until an annual or triannual contract expires. I think, our teams are getting better at that. We've seen actually some good performance over the last year in several quarters happening at our Named and Growth accounts. But surprisingly, it actually happens quite frequently in our platinum accounts as well."

Up until even 2 or 3 years ago, Enterprise software companies were constantly selling in and around renewals for these large ELAs because that's how customers have been trained for 20 years to buy from us. And breaking that mold has taken some time. So even though we have the best intentions and we prefer to be able to sell solutions when customers need them, there's a lot of procurement teams that hang on, waiting 6, 9 months before they buy thinking that they're going to get a better deal if they package it up into an ELA. I'm seeing some of the frost break on that particular model, but when I take a look at the mainstream large Fortune 200 companies, there's still a lot of decision made by procurement teams that I think is the shift in the line of business buyers. When we're selling to a line of business buyers, they don't care about ELAs. They have a problem, they want that solution solved and they're buying it with a capital budget -- with an operational budget rather than a capital budget. And a lot of times, they're buying it outside the context of in general on CIO procurement team. Still some work to be done in our industry in that, but I don't think that's a unique CA phenomenon."

We delivered another quarter of revenue growth with strong margins and earnings. Our performance in the quarter improves our confidence in our ability to cross over into modest revenue growth for the full year of fiscal 2017. We are making progress across a number of our key initiatives. Our product development and innovation engines are beginning to gain traction, and I am very pleased with our customer experience metrics. We know that we are moving the ball in the right direction, while we recognize that there are areas in which we still need to continue to improve. 
As expected, new sales declined in the quarter, driven largely by the very difficult year-over-year comparison as a result of the large system integrator deal we closed in the year-ago period. Importantly, as we mentioned last quarter, we now have agreements in place with our 3 largest SI customers for the next several years. This reflects our position as a trusted technology partner to the largest global system integrators and provides us with good visibility into our longer-term customer commitments. 
In terms of sales execution, I am happy to report that our freestanding new sales increased year-over-year. While the overall portfolio of deals for us to renew was smaller in Q2, I'm encouraged by our healthy attach rates to renewals. In the quarter, MetLife, one of the largest global insurance companies; FedEx, a global transportation and business services leader; and Cerner, a health care delivery solution provider, expanded their relationships with CA to include a number of solutions across our portfolio. New sales in our Named and Growth or partner-led accounts also grew nicely. Continued progress in freestanding new sales and penetration into Named and Growth accounts are key to driving long-term sustained growth. 
Q2 CFFO was negatively impacted year-over-year by the combination of a lower level of single installment collections and a higher level of cash tax payments in the quarter. As we said before, we remain focused on and committed to developing products that are easier to install and easier to manage. A byproduct of this can be seen in the decline we are experiencing in our Services revenue. We continue to expect that as our portfolio of more user-friendly products grows and we increasingly leverage partners, our Services revenue line will be impacted. Our Q2 Services performance reflects this ongoing trend. 
Results were also impacted by a lower level of prior period Services bookings and some non-strategic projects that have come to close. We expect these collective factors will continue to be headwinds to our Services revenue. 
We remain committed to cultivating and nurturing the spirit of innovation at CA. While there is always more work to do and we acknowledge that real, systemic change within a large product organization takes time to bear fruit, we are making considerable progress. We are continuing to innovate within our existing portfolio and now have a more disciplined process in place to invest in future areas of growth for CA. I'm very pleased that our efforts are recognized by industry analysts and, most importantly, by our customers. We look forward to providing more color on our progress at CA World next month. 
I would like to highlight our overall portfolio of Continuous Delivery solutions, which had a great quarter with significant customer wins across a number of sectors, including financial services, telecommunications, media, government and health care IT. We are committed to helping our customers become more agile in the Application Economy. Our Continuous Delivery portfolio is central to this strategy as it enables customers to rapidly develop, efficiently test and reliably release applications. The result is more higher-quality applications delivered to the market at a faster pace. 
We continue to invest in innovations across the Continuous Delivery portfolio. Our latest version was made available in July and focuses on an improved security model for customers. It also provides dependency management for complex deployments involving multiple applications. We are pleased that CA Release Automation was positioned by Gartner in the Leaders quadrant in its inaugural Magic Quadrant for Application Release Automation. It helps customers manage their complex Continuous Delivery pipelines, and it is a critical element of a DevOps strategy in executing many small releases in quick succession. 
In August, we released the latest version of CA Agile Requirements Designer, an end-to-end requirements gathering, test automation and test case design tool that reduces manual testing effort. And just last month, we announced the small but strategic acquisition of BlazeMeter. While not meaningful in terms of its immediate financial impact, BlazeMeter adds a next-generation, open-source, SaaS-based performance and load testing platform to the portfolio. 
Within Security, I'm particularly pleased with Privileged Access Management, Advanced Authentication as well as Payment Security, which all delivered very healthy new sales growth. In the quarter, we closed multiple 7-figure transactions, including very good competitive wins for CA Privileged Access Management. We released a number of enhancements across the portfolio, and we continue to view Security as one of the key pillars in our strategy to grow in the years ahead. Security is a critical component for our customers and their digital transformation strategies. 
We are pleased with the performance of our Mainframe business from a revenue perspective for the second quarter and for the first half of our fiscal year. We recognize that this is a market not in secular growth, unlike the rest of our markets. As such, there's no doubt that size matters. We are in a unique position as the largest independent software vendor in this market and, really, the only other company outside of IBM making meaningful investments to support, sustain and innovate for our customers with a mainframe footprint. This means that we are able to organically innovate on the mainframe with solutions like CA Data Content Discovery or DCD. With more than 70% of enterprise data on the mainframe, DCD enables customers to identify data exposure risks on z Systems by automatically scanning through the data on the mainframe infrastructure for regulated or sensitive data. Data discovery, classification by security level and comprehensive reporting enables our customers to mitigate risk. We are the only vendor in the market that does this on the mainframe, and we are very pleased with this performance and rate of market adoption. 
The breadth and scale of our portfolio, our focus on integrations across the enterprise and our dedicated efforts to continually improve customer experience are the foundations of our ability to support end-to-end DevOps on the mainframe. We have flagship solutions like CA Endevor, which provides source code management and archives versioning of code development, including Java and parallel development. We also provide newer solutions like CA Application Lifecycle Conductor or ALC, which helps customers automate and manage the software development life cycle spanning mobile to mainframe environments. 
CA provides one of the broadest portfolios of mainframe solutions in the industry, and we are leveraging our R&D across our development organizations. For example, CA Agile Central users can create a new agile story and then drag and drop so that ALC and Endevor create all of the associated code on the mainframe and move the code from development to test and then to production. Other examples of Enterprise Solutions and Mainframe synergies include CA Release Automation, Test Data Management and Service Virtualization. These are all tangible proof points of CA's commitment to and investment in providing value to our customers across mainframe, distributed, cloud and mobile. 
This leads me to an area in which everyone across every level of CA's global workforce is focused: customer experience. Perhaps the best way to illustrate what this means to us is to provide a few specific customer examples. TomTom, the Dutch navigation, mapping, GPS and now sports and fitness company, implemented CA Agile Central in its transition from traditional waterfall software development to agile. Through this experience, TomTom views CA as much more than a software provider. CA is a trusted partner that provides access, demonstrates responsiveness and engages in continuous product collaboration. 
The Royal Bank of Scotland is implementing the bank's vision of delivering a seamless, omni-channel customer experience using CA Risk Analytics. CA's solutions and partnership enables RBS to be agile and adaptive to the needs of its customers in an ever-changing financial services industry. 
These are the types of stories that motivate us every day. From the earliest point of contact with customers through the many years that follow, we have vastly improved how we are showing up. From our CNN partnership for its election coverage to the tens of thousands of customers we reached out to on Customer Experience Day last month and the ongoing contact our development and sales teams have with our customers on a daily basis, we have made considerable improvement. CA's brand familiarity and consideration continues to move higher, particularly among business decision-makers. Our customers are giving us higher scores on product quality, and customer satisfaction continues to trend positively. 
We are proud of the great progress our team has made across the organization, but we are not satisfied. We still have work to do to further refine and optimize and really be agile so that we can continue to evolve and achieve the type of long-term sustainable growth we know we have the potential to achieve. 
Looking ahead, I'm optimistic. When I look at our company holistically in terms of the markets we're in and the opportunities we have, both organically and inorganically, I believe that we are on track. Overall, we believe we can deliver modest, low single-digit growth over the medium term. 
We look forward to welcoming many of you at CA World next month. Through keynotes, guest speakers and technical and best practice sessions, we'll explore and demonstrate how software has risen from a supporting role to the lead actor in driving business strategy and velocity. We will host an analyst session on November 16 that will provide a great opportunity to speak with our executive team and to hear what our customers are saying first hand. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kieran to review our second quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
Our Q2 total revenue was $1,018,000,000 and was up 1% and up 2% in constant currency. This was the second consecutive quarter we've grown revenue year-over-year as reported and the third in constant currency. Q2 Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 7% and increased 8% in constant currency. Mainframe Solutions decreased 1% as reported and in constant currency. Services declined 10% and declined 9% in constant currency. 
Q2 total new product and capacity sales were down in the mid-20s as reported and in constant currency. The decrease in Q2 total new sales was due primarily to a difficult year-over-year compare, driven by new sales associated with the large system integrator renewal transaction we signed in Q2 last year. Excluding the large SI transaction, total new product and capacity sales were down low teens as reported and in constant currency. 
Q2 renewals were down in the mid-50s, both as reported and in constant currency. Excluding the large SI transaction, renewals were down high single digits, both as reported and in constant currency. As we previously stated, the year-over-year change in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions. We continue to expect the renewal portfolio in fiscal 2017 to increase in the high teens year-over-year, both as reported and in constant currency. Renewal yield for the quarter was in the low 90s, in line with our long-term target. 
Turning to geographies. New sales were down in North America due in part to the difficult year-over-year compare resulting from last year's large SI transaction as well as a smaller renewal portfolio even outside of this large SI transaction. New sales in Latin America declined due to ongoing macroeconomic challenges in the region. New sales were up in EMEA due to strong performance in Named and Growth or partner-led accounts. To this point, we have seen minimal impact from Brexit on new sales. APJ was up sharply to more normalized levels following a difficult quarter in the year-ago period. 
Revenue grew across all geographies as reported, except in EMEA. Revenue grew in North America and APJ, was flat in Latin America and declined in EMEA in constant currency. 
Within our segments, Mainframe new sales declined in the mid-40s year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Excluding last year's large SI transaction, Mainframe new sales declined in the mid-20s and in the low 20s in constant currency. Mainframe new sales performance reflects lower levels of Mainframe capacity due to the composition of the renewal portfolio outside of the large SI renewal in the year-ago period. Overall, we continue to expect our Mainframe revenue to be down in the low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the mainframe market. 
Enterprise Solutions new sales decreased in the high teens year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Excluding last year's large SI transaction, Enterprise Solutions new sales decreased high single digits as reported and in constant currency, in line with the renewal portfolio. Areas such as Continuous Delivery and Security saw positive new sales growth in the quarter. However, as we discussed in the past, within Enterprise Solutions, there are products in our enhanced portfolio that are more mature and not growing but contribute to margin and cash flow. 
Services revenue decreased 10% and 9% in constant currency. We expect Services revenue to decline as we design our products to be easier to install and as we leverage partners. Services revenue is also impacted by a lower level of bookings in previous quarters and the conclusion of some nonstrategic Services engagements. As Mike mentioned, we expect this headwind in Services will continue to have a dampening effect on our overall revenue growth. 
Total revenue backlog was up 4% as reported and in constant currency. Current revenue backlog declined 2% as reported and in constant currency. As we've said in the past, current revenue backlog will likely grow after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low-90s renewal yield. 
Q2 GAAP operating margin was 31%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 40%. Operating margin improved year-over-year due to improved operating efficiencies and the impact of the acquisition-related expenses in the year-ago period. This was partially offset by an increase in legal expenses related to us entering into an agreement in principle to settle the long-standing matter brought against us by the DOJ and an individual plaintiff relating to our GSA schedule with the government. This litigation was previously disclosed by us and relates to time periods as far back as 2002. The proposed settlement is for $45 million and admits no wrongdoing. While it is still subject to finalization, we are pleased to have entered into this agreement in principle in an effort to put it behind us. We look forward to continuing our long-standing relationship with the government as a trusted and valued customer and partner. 
Segment operating margins in the quarter were 62% for Mainframe Solutions, 18% for Enterprise Solutions and 3% for Services. Our Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 31% and 29%, respectively. Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.50, up 28% year-over-year and up 31% in constant currency. Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.67, up 20% year-over-year and up 18% in constant currency. 
Our Q2 CFFO was negative $58 million, down year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. CFFO declined relative to the year-ago period primarily due to a lower level of single installment collections in the quarter as well as higher cash tax payments. Single installment cash payments were $59 million and down $70 million year-over-year. The lower level of single installment cash payments resulted from the mix of renewals in the quarter, which had fewer large financial institutions. Single installment cash payments typically come from large financial institutions. 
We ended Q2 with approximately $496 million in net cash. During the second quarter, we repurchased $50 million in shares and paid $107 million in dividends. We have $650 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. 
As Mike said, we are pleased with our Q2 performance as it gives us improved confidence in our ability to cross over into modest revenue growth for the full year in fiscal year '17. We are making progress across key imperatives and are continuously evaluating opportunities to improve our ability to sustainably grow. However, there is still work to do. Our performance in some product areas and in Named and Growth and partner-led opportunities continues to improve but remains uneven. Also, our strong revenue performance in the quarter and the first half was aided by a relatively low proportion of upfront deals in the year-ago periods, making for easier compares. 
As we indicated last quarter, the large SI deal we signed in Q1 substantially shifted the renewal portfolio such that fiscal year '18 renewals are expected to decline year-over-year. To overcome this headwind, we are working to drive continuous improvement in the sales organization to increase consistency and velocity, independent of the renewal cycle. We are continuing to work to improve the efficiency and productivity within our development organization and continue to evaluate M&A opportunities to supplement our portfolio. As a company, we expect modest revenue growth in the medium term. This is the result of our three-pronged capital allocation of quarterly dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was September 30, 2016. The guidance also assumes no material acquisitions. For the full year, we expect total revenue to increase in a range of flat to up 1% as reported and in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectation. This translates to reported revenue of $4.03 billion to $4.07 billion. We expect full year GAAP operating margin of 29% and full year non-GAAP operating margin of 38%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%, consistent with our prior expectations. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to increase in a range of 6% to 8% as reported and 2% to 5% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.88 to $1.93. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to increase in a range of 2% to 5% as reported and 1% to 3% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.49 to $2.54. 
We'd like to provide some additional color regarding our expectations for the second half of fiscal 2017. While there's no change to our full year revenue guidance, I'd like to provide some headlights into how we expect Q3 to play out. In terms of the year-over-year compare, the tailwind of the upfront revenue mix that benefited the first half of the fiscal year is expected to become a headwind in the second half of the fiscal year. As such, we expect revenue to decline a couple of percentage points year-over-year in Q3. This is largely due to the timing of the mix of upfront deals that closed last year in addition to a lower level of Services revenue. As discussed earlier, the upfront mix was particularly low in the first half of fiscal 2016 and then rebounded in the third quarter. 
With regard to non-GAAP operating margins, we expect the lower revenue level to impact Q3 operating margin when compared to the year-ago period. As indicated earlier, there is no change to our full year 2017 revenue or operating margin guidance. 
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 411 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 414 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to be in the range of a 3% decrease to a 1% increase, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to $1.01 billion to $1.05 billion. Previous quarter guidance was an increase of 2% to 6% and an increase of 1% to 5% in constant currency. This change is due to the anticipated settlement of legal matters related to the agreement in principle for the GSA litigation previously discussed. 
With that, we'll open it up for questions."

So I'm very happy to see tangible metrics that our innovation engine is working. With respect to the higher margin, a lot of that has to do with just timing. If you take a look at the cyclical nature of our business and when acquisitions have hit around the year anniversary of Rally and with the Xceedium acquisition being relatively small and the amount of capital we had to put in to make Xceedium ready for large-scale customer usage, we've had some savings. This will be a blip in Enterprise margins.  Eventually, we'll get up to the high end and be repeatable there, but I don't think 18% is going to be consistent for the next little while. Kieran?"

If we go back and take a look at last year, when we're 36% licensed for, the company as a whole and ES was extremely low. That's obviously the quarter when we brought in both the Rally and the Xceedium acquisitions, so there was a significant amount of onetime costs associated with that. And for the company as a whole, if you look at those onetime costs that we didn't incur this year, basically, think of it as offset with the GSA impact. So the real impact in the margin improvement for the company as a whole as well as for ES was a lot of the upfront revenue that we talked about. So you heard me describe that we had a very weak compare in terms of our upfront revenues, and that's all in the ES segment a year ago. The growth that we had in upfront revenue in Q2 was worth about 3 or 4 points of margin expansion on a year-on-year basis. And as Mike said, longer-term plans, we expect to get there. And just keep in mind, Q3, we always have the seasonality of our CA World, which incurs some big costs. And then obviously, in Q4, when we're finalizing commissions and payouts, it's usually our seasonally lowest quarter of the year."

First, on the Mainframe deceleration, we don't see high single-digit Mainframe deceleration. We've consistently seen low single-digit Mainframe deceleration, so it hasn't -- I wouldn't characterize it in the higher end of single-digit deceleration. And when we're talking to customers, customers that have made an investment in the Mainframe continue to invest in the Mainframe for a variety of reasons. I think the biggest reason is that's where the applications are. And to repark those applications on to a different platform to do the exact same thing, the amount of calories to do that and the amount of risk, especially if you're in a regulated environment, there just hasn't been a whole lot of appetite to do that. They'd rather spend their net new development dollars building net new products and services they get to devices that customers want. Secondly, there's been a great set of technologies. One of them that we're one of the primary suppliers of is API Management. So a lot of Mainframe customers want to serve up that mainframe data that's very protected, very secure and put it onto a tablet, put it onto a smartphone. And the way that they're doing that is using API technology. So they get to keep the high-volume transaction processing engine that is currently working, keep the applications, the data structures in place and then be able to serve their customers in a way that customers want to be served. So I think that's the stability argument for the Mainframe, and we haven't seen anything, really, change with respect to that. With respect to margin, as you know, we break out our business in 3 segments, Mainframe, ES and Services, but Mainframe always being in the low 60s and Services fluctuating in the mid-teens. As we continue to get better and have better efficiencies in our Enterprise business and the higher volume of revenue, we are able to get a blended margin in the high 30s, and we feel pretty confident about that for the foreseeable future. Kieran, maybe you have a couple of comments with respect to the margin."

We really think we can improve the low teens that we've been at in ES, certainly, to get to the high teens over the tactical and midterm time horizon. From a Mainstream perspective, we think as long as the growth continues to decline in the low single digits, as Mike pointed out, we can manage both the cost profile in that business as well as improving the cost profile of the ES business to maintain ourselves in that high 30s that we've been staying at for the last couple of years."

And that makes the customers more attracted to the platform because they're constantly seeing innovation. And to the extent that they can work with their mainframe solution, their on-premise enterprise solution and the cloud solution, we have products that scale across all 3, it just makes less of an argument to move off of a platform that's already working and spend your precious R&D resources on net new innovation that's going to drive your customer segment further along."

It's not unusual for that to start to drift off a little bit over time, and it is so highly dependent on our renewal cycle.

So what we see in this quarter, very low renewals. Again, nothing unusual about it except that we just didn't have a lot of big deals expiring at this particular point in time.

We've gotten ourselves out of some businesses that we didn't think is necessarily strategic. We really want our Services business to be there, really, to help with adoption of our software. In all honesty, long term, we expect that we will have a level of service that's required, one, to drive transformation in our customers, like we would do at a Rally or something like that, as well as to help continue with adoption. So we don't think that this is going to totally evaporate, but I do think in the near and the midterm, we'll probably see rates of decline pretty consistent to what we saw this quarter."

So to answer your question, I think we're in a very good position to achieve the kind of growth we gave through in guidance. But we're always going to be taking a look for new technologies on the buy-versus-build analysis. If you take a look at just this last quarter, we bought a relatively small company called BlazeMeter, which is very strategic for us. We've had a lot of growth in our testing market. This is an additive to the testing market but gives customers another opportunity to protect their code as it goes into production. And this is a foray into another SaaS product, and it's also using a significant amount of open-source technology. So it hit all of the things that we think are important at what customers want to buy. And to the extent that we see opportunities like that, what it does is it gives us an opportunity to accelerate growth, and it also de-risks our plan going forward."

Whenever we're pitching their renewal, our sales force is trained to use that as an opportunity to keep their renewal yield high. So we're constantly shooting for something higher than a 90% in our renewal cycle. And what it does is it takes some of the pressure of that renewal yield away. The overarching pieces of what we're trying to do there is to help that deceleration, that secular deceleration of the Mainframe dampened down by offering customers both net new solutions and also psychologically show them that we're still investing in the Mainframe. We have --  we're 1 of only 2 companies that are still making significant investments in R&D on the Mainframe. And to the extent that we're able to package that up and show the value, I think it protects the franchise."

The objective is, over the long haul, to ensure that our business is always going to look for opportunities to sell and not have to wait until an annual or tri-annual contract expires. I think our teams are getting better at that. We've seen, actually, some good performance over the last year and several quarters happening at our Named and Growth accounts.

Up until even 2 or 3 years ago, enterprise software companies were constantly selling in and around renewals for these large ELAs because that's how customers have been trained for 20 years to buy from us. And breaking that mold has taken some time. So even though we have the best intentions and we prefer to be able to sell solutions when customers need them, there's a lot of procurement teams that hang on, waiting 6, 9 months before they buy, thinking that they're going to get a better deal if they package it up into an ELA. I'm seeing some of the frost break on that particular model, but when I take a look at the mainstream large Fortune 200 companies, there's still a lot of decisions made by procurement teams that I think is shifting the line of business buyers. When we're selling to a line of business buyers, they don't care about ELAs. They have a problem. They want that solution solved, and they're buying it with a capital budget -- with an operational budget rather than a capital budget. And a lot of times, they're buying it outside the context of a general CIO procurement team. Still some work to be done in our industry with that, but I don't think that's a unique CA phenomenon."

We delivered another quarter of revenue growth with strong margins and earnings. Our performance in the quarter improves our confidence in our ability to cross over into modest revenue growth for the full year of fiscal 2017. We are making progress across a number of our key initiatives. Our product development and innovation engines are beginning to gain traction, and I am very pleased with our customer experience metrics. We know that we are moving the ball in the right direction, while we recognize that there are areas in which we still need to continue to improve. 
As expected, new sales declined in the quarter, driven largely by the very difficult year-over-year comparison as a result of the large system integrator deal we closed in the year-ago period. Importantly, as we mentioned last quarter, we now have agreements in place with our 3 largest SI customers for the next several years. This reflects our position as a trusted technology partner to the largest global system integrators and provides us with good visibility into our longer-term customer commitments. 
In terms of sales execution, I am happy to report that our freestanding new sales increased year-over-year. While the overall portfolio of deals for us to renew was smaller in Q2, I'm encouraged by our healthy attach rates to renewals. In the quarter, MetLife, one of the largest global insurance companies; FedEx, a global transportation and business service leader; and Cerner, a health care delivery solution provider, expanded their relationships with CA to include a number of solutions across our portfolio. New sales in our Named and Growth or Partner-led accounts also grew nicely. Continued progress in freestanding new sales and penetration into Named and Growth accounts are key to driving long-term sustained growth. 
Q2 CFFO was negatively impacted year-over-year by the combination of a lower level of single installment collections and a higher level of cash tax payments in the quarter. As we said before, we remain focused on and committed to developing products that are easier to install and easier to manage. A byproduct of this can be seen in the decline we are experiencing in our Services revenue. We continue to expect that as our portfolio of more user-friendly products grows and we increasingly leverage partners, our Services revenue line will be impacted. Our Q2 Services performance reflects this ongoing trend. 
Results were also impacted by a lower level of prior period Services bookings and some non-strategic projects that have come to close. We expect these collective factors will continue to be headwinds to our Services revenue. 
We remain committed to cultivating and nurturing the spirit of innovation at CA. While there is always more work to do and we acknowledge that real, systemic change within a large product organization takes time to bear fruit, we are making considerable progress. We are continuing to innovate within our existing portfolio and now have a more disciplined process in place to invest in future areas of growth for CA. I'm very pleased that our efforts are recognized by industry analysts and, most importantly, by our customers. We look forward to providing more color on our progress at CA World next month. 
I would like to highlight our overall portfolio of Continuous Delivery solutions, which had a great quarter with significant customer wins across a number of sectors, including financial services, telecommunications, media, government and health care IT. We are committed to helping our customers become more agile in the Application Economy. Our Continuous Delivery portfolio is central to this strategy as it enables customers to rapidly develop, efficiently test and reliably release applications. The result is more higher-quality applications delivered to the market at a faster pace. 
We continue to invest in innovations across the Continuous Delivery portfolio. Our latest version was made available in July and focuses on an improved security model for customers. It also provides dependency management for complex deployments involving multiple applications. We are pleased that CA Release Automation was positioned by Gartner in the Leaders quadrant in its inaugural Magic Quadrant for Application Release Automation. It helps customers manage their complex Continuous Delivery pipelines, and it is a critical element of a DevOps strategy in executing many small releases in quick succession. 
In August, we released the latest version of CA Agile Requirements Designer, an end-to-end requirements gathering, test automation and test case design tool that reduces manual testing effort. And just last month, we announced the small but strategic acquisition of BlazeMeter. While not meaningful in terms of its immediate financial impact, BlazeMeter adds a next-generation, open-source, SaaS-based performance and load testing platform to the portfolio. 
Within Security, I'm particularly pleased with Privileged Access Management, Advanced Authentication as well as Payment Security, which all delivered very healthy new sales growth. In the quarter, we closed multiple 7-figure transactions, including very good competitive wins for CA Privileged Access Management. We released a number of enhancements across the portfolio, and we continue to view Security as one of the key pillars in our strategy to grow in the years ahead. Security is a critical component for our customers and their digital transformation strategies. 
We are pleased with the performance of our Mainframe business from a revenue perspective for the second quarter and for the first half of our fiscal year. We recognize that this is a market not in secular growth, unlike the rest of our markets. As such, there's no doubt that size matters. We are in a unique position as the largest independent software vendor in this market and, really, the only other company outside of IBM making meaningful investments to support, sustain and innovate for our customers with a mainframe footprint. This means that we are able to organically innovate on the mainframe with solutions like CA Data Content Discovery or DCD. With more than 70% of enterprise data on the mainframe, DCD enables customers to identify data exposure risks on z Systems by automatically scanning through the data on the mainframe infrastructure for regulated or sensitive data. Data discovery, classification by security level and comprehensive reporting enables our customers to mitigate risk. We are the only vendor in the market that does this on the mainframe, and we are very pleased with this performance and rate of market adoption. 
The breadth and scale of our portfolio, our focus on integrations across the enterprise and our dedicated efforts to continually improve customer experience are the foundations of our ability to support end-to-end DevOps on the mainframe. We have flagship solutions like CA Endevor, which provides source code management and archives versioning of code development, including Java and parallel development. We also provide newer solutions like CA Application Lifecycle Conductor or ALC, which helps customers automate and manage the software development life cycle spanning mobile to mainframe environments. 
CA provides one of the broadest portfolios of mainframe solutions in the industry, and we are leveraging our R&D across our development organizations. For example, CA Agile Central users can create a new agile story and then drag and drop so that ALC and Endevor create all of the associated code on the mainframe and move the code from development to test and then to production. Other examples of Enterprise Solutions and Mainframe synergies include CA Release Automation, Test Data Management and Service Virtualization. These are all tangible proof points of CA's commitment to and investment in providing value to our customers across mainframe, distributed, cloud and mobile. 
This leads me to an area in which everyone across every level of CA's global workforce is focused: customer experience. Perhaps the best way to illustrate what this means to us is to provide a few specific customer examples. TomTom, the Dutch navigation, mapping, GPS and now sports and fitness company, implemented CA Agile Central in its transition from traditional waterfall software development to agile. Through this experience, TomTom views CA as much more than a software provider. CA is a trusted partner that provides access, demonstrates responsiveness and engages in continuous product collaboration. 
The Royal Bank of Scotland is implementing the bank's vision of delivering a seamless, omni-channel customer experience using CA Risk Analytics. CA's solutions and partnership enables RBS to be agile and adaptive to the needs of its customers in an ever-changing financial services industry. 
These are the types of stories that motivate us every day. From the earliest point of contact with customers through the many years that follow, we have vastly improved how we are showing up. From our CNN partnership for its election coverage to the tens of thousands of customers we reached out to on Customer Experience Day last month and the ongoing contact our development and sales teams have with our customers on a daily basis, we have made considerable improvement. CA's brand familiarity and consideration continues to move higher, particularly among business decision-makers. Our customers are giving us higher scores on product quality, and customer satisfaction continues to trend positively. 
We are proud of the great progress our team has made across the organization, but we are not satisfied. We still have work to do to further refine and optimize and really be agile so that we can continue to evolve and achieve the type of long-term sustainable growth we know we have the potential to achieve. 
Looking ahead, I'm optimistic. When I look at our company holistically in terms of the markets we're in and the opportunities we have, both organically and inorganically, I believe that we are on track. Overall, we believe we can deliver modest, low single-digit growth over the medium term. 
We look forward to welcoming many of you at CA World next month. Through keynotes, guest speakers and technical and best practice sessions, we'll explore and demonstrate how software has risen from a supporting role to the lead actor in driving business strategy and velocity. We will host an analyst session on November 16 that will provide a great opportunity to speak with our executive team and to hear what our customers are saying first hand. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kieran to review our second quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
Our Q2 total revenue was $1,018,000,000 and was up 1% and up 2% in constant currency. This was the second consecutive quarter we've grown revenue year-over-year as reported and the third in constant currency. Q2 Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 7% and increased 8% in constant currency. Mainframe Solutions decreased 1% as reported and in constant currency. Services declined 10% and declined 9% in constant currency. 
Q2 total new product and capacity sales were down in the mid-20s as reported and in constant currency. The decrease in Q2 total new sales was due primarily to a difficult year-over-year compare, driven by new sales associated with the large system integrator renewal transaction we signed in Q2 last year. Excluding the large SI transaction, total new product and capacity sales were down low teens as reported and in constant currency. 
Q2 renewals were down in the mid-50s, both as reported and in constant currency. Excluding the large SI transaction, renewals were down high single digits, both as reported and in constant currency. As we previously stated, the year-over-year change in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions. We continue to expect the renewal portfolio in fiscal 2017 to increase in the high teens year-over-year, both as reported and in constant currency. Renewal yield for the quarter was in the low 90s, in line with our long-term target. 
Turning to geographies. New sales were down in North America due in part to the difficult year-over-year compare resulting from last year's large SI transaction as well as a smaller renewal portfolio even outside of this large SI transaction. New sales in Latin America declined due to ongoing macroeconomic challenges in the region. New sales were up in EMEA due to strong performance in Named and Growth or Partner-led accounts. To this point, we have seen minimal impact from Brexit on new sales. APJ was up sharply to more normalized levels following a difficult quarter in the year-ago period. 
Revenue grew across all geographies as reported, except in EMEA. Revenue grew in North America and APJ, was flat in Latin America and declined in EMEA in constant currency. 
Within our segments, Mainframe new sales declined in the mid-40s year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Excluding last year's large SI transaction, Mainframe new sales declined in the mid-20s and in the low 20s in constant currency. Mainframe new sales performance reflects lower levels of Mainframe capacity due to the composition of the renewal portfolio outside of the large SI renewal in the year-ago period. Overall, we continue to expect our Mainframe revenue to be down in the low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the mainframe market. 
Enterprise Solutions new sales decreased in the high teens year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Excluding last year's large SI transaction, Enterprise Solutions new sales decreased high single digits as reported and in constant currency, in line with the renewal portfolio. Areas such as Continuous Delivery and Security saw positive new sales growth in the quarter. However, as we discussed in the past, within Enterprise Solutions, there are products in our enhanced portfolio that are more mature and not growing but contribute to margin and cash flow. 
Services revenue decreased 10% and 9% in constant currency. We expect Services revenue to decline as we design our products to be easier to install and as we leverage partners. Services revenue is also impacted by a lower level of bookings in previous quarters and the conclusion of some nonstrategic Services engagements. As Mike mentioned, we expect this headwind in Services will continue to have a dampening effect on our overall revenue growth. 
Total revenue backlog was up 4% as reported and in constant currency. Current revenue backlog declined 2% as reported and in constant currency. As we've said in the past, current revenue backlog will likely grow after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low-90s renewal yield. 
Q2 GAAP operating margin was 31%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 40%. Operating margin improved year-over-year due to improved operating efficiencies and the impact of the acquisition-related expenses in the year-ago period. This was partially offset by an increase in legal expenses related to us entering into an agreement in principle to settle the long-standing matter brought against us by the DOJ and an individual plaintiff relating to our GSA schedule with the government. This litigation was previously disclosed by us and relates to time periods as far back as 2002. The proposed settlement is for $45 million and admits no wrongdoing. While it is still subject to finalization, we are pleased to have entered into this agreement in principle in an effort to put it behind us. We look forward to continuing our long-standing relationship with the government as a trusted and valued customer and partner. 
Segment operating margins in the quarter were 62% for Mainframe Solutions, 18% for Enterprise Solutions and 3% for Services. Our Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 31% and 29%, respectively. Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.50, up 28% year-over-year and up 31% in constant currency. Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.67, up 20% year-over-year and up 18% in constant currency. 
Our Q2 CFFO was negative $58 million, down year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. CFFO declined relative to the year-ago period primarily due to a lower level of single installment collections in the quarter as well as higher cash tax payments. Single installment cash payments were $59 million and down $70 million year-over-year. The lower level of single installment cash payments resulted from the mix of renewals in the quarter, which had fewer large financial institutions. Single installment cash payments typically come from large financial institutions. 
We ended Q2 with approximately $496 million in net cash. During the second quarter, we repurchased $50 million in shares and paid $107 million in dividends. We have $650 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. 
As Mike said, we are pleased with our Q2 performance as it gives us improved confidence in our ability to cross over into modest revenue growth for the full year in fiscal year '17. We are making progress across key imperatives and are continuously evaluating opportunities to improve our ability to sustainably grow. However, there is still work to do. Our performance in some product areas and in Named and Growth and Partner-led opportunities continues to improve but remains uneven. Also, our strong revenue performance in the quarter and the first half was aided by a relatively low proportion of upfront deals in the year-ago periods, making for easier compares. 
As we indicated last quarter, the large SI deal we signed in Q1 substantially shifted the renewal portfolio such that fiscal year '18 renewals are expected to decline year-over-year. To overcome this headwind, we are working to drive continuous improvement in the sales organization to increase consistency and velocity, independent of the renewal cycle. We are continuing to work to improve the efficiency and productivity within our development organization and continue to evaluate M&A opportunities to supplement our portfolio. As a company, we expect modest revenue growth in the medium term. This is the result of our three-pronged capital allocation of quarterly dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was September 30, 2016. The guidance also assumes no material acquisitions. For the full year, we expect total revenue to increase in a range of flat to up 1% as reported and in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectation. This translates to reported revenue of $4.03 billion to $4.07 billion. We expect full year GAAP operating margin of 29% and full year non-GAAP operating margin of 38%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%, consistent with our prior expectations. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to increase in a range of 6% to 8% as reported and 2% to 5% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.88 to $1.93. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to increase in a range of 2% to 5% as reported and 1% to 3% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.49 to $2.54. 
We'd like to provide some additional color regarding our expectations for the second half of fiscal 2017. While there's no change to our full year revenue guidance, I'd like to provide some headlights into how we expect Q3 to play out. In terms of the year-over-year compare, the tailwind of the upfront revenue mix that benefited the first half of the fiscal year is expected to become a headwind in the second half of the fiscal year. As such, we expect revenue to decline a couple of percentage points year-over-year in Q3. This is largely due to the timing of the mix of upfront deals that closed last year in addition to a lower level of Services revenue. As discussed earlier, the upfront mix was particularly low in the first half of fiscal 2016 and then rebounded in the third quarter. 
With regard to non-GAAP operating margins, we expect the lower revenue level to impact Q3 operating margin when compared to the year-ago period. As indicated earlier, there is no change to our full year 2017 revenue or operating margin guidance. 
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 411 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 414 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to be in the range of a 3% decrease to a 1% increase, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to $1.01 billion to $1.05 billion. Previous quarter guidance was an increase of 2% to 6% and an increase of 1% to 5% in constant currency. This change is due to the anticipated settlement of legal matters related to the agreement in principle for the GSA litigation previously discussed. 
With that, we'll open it up for questions."

So I'm very happy to see tangible metrics that our innovation engine is working. With respect to the higher margin, a lot of that has to do with just timing. If you take a look at the cyclical nature of our business and when acquisitions have hit around the year anniversary of Rally and with the Xceedium acquisition being relatively small and the amount of capital we had to put in to make Xceedium ready for large-scale customer usage, we've had some savings. This will be a blip in Enterprise margins. Eventually, we'll get up to the high end and be repeatable there, but I don't think 18% is going to be consistent for the next little while. Kieran?"

If we go back and take a look at last year, when we were at 36% margins floor, the company as a whole and ES was extremely low. That's obviously the quarter when we brought in both the Rally and the Xceedium acquisitions, so there was a significant amount of onetime costs associated with that. And for the company as a whole, if you look at those onetime costs that we didn't incur this year, basically, think of it as offset with the GSA impact. So the real impact in the margin improvement for the company as a whole as well as for ES was a lot of the upfront revenue that we talked about. So you heard me describe that we had a very weak compare in terms of our upfront revenues, and that's all in the ES segment a year ago. The growth that we had in upfront revenue in Q2 was worth about 3 or 4 points of margin expansion on a year-on-year basis. And as Mike said, longer-term plans, we expect to get there. And just keep in mind, Q3, we always have the seasonality of our CA World, which incurs some big costs. And then obviously, in Q4, when we're finalizing commissions and payouts, it's usually our seasonally lowest quarter of the year."

First, on the Mainframe deceleration, we don't see high single-digit Mainframe deceleration. We've consistently seen low single-digit Mainframe deceleration, so it hasn't -- I wouldn't characterize it in the higher end of single-digit deceleration. And when we're talking to customers, customers that have made an investment in the Mainframe continue to invest in the Mainframe for a variety of reasons. I think the biggest reason is that's where the applications are. And to repark those applications on to a different platform to do the exact same thing, the amount of calories to do that and the amount of risk, especially if you're in a regulated environment, there just hasn't been a whole lot of appetite to do that. They'd rather spend their net new development dollars building net new products and services they can get to devices that customers want. Secondly, there's been a great set of technologies. One of them that we're one of the primary suppliers of is API Management. So a lot of Mainframe customers want to serve up that mainframe data that's very protected, very secure and put it onto a tablet, put it onto a smartphone. And the way that they're doing that is using API technology. So they get to keep the high-volume transaction processing engine that is currently working, keep the applications, the data structures in place and then be able to serve their customers in a way that customers want to be served. So I think that's the stability argument for the Mainframe, and we haven't seen anything, really, change with respect to that. With respect to margin, as you know, we break out our business in 3 segments, Mainframe, ES and Services, but Mainframe always being in the low 60s and Services fluctuating in the mid-teens. As we continue to get better and have better efficiencies in our Enterprise business and the higher volume of revenue, we are able to get a blended margin in the high 30s, and we feel pretty confident about that for the foreseeable future. Kieran, maybe you have a couple of comments with respect to the margin."

We think that there's a lot of opportunity, as Mike pointed out, as you start to scale the revenue, especially in the SaaS side, and you start to achieve some scale. We really think we can improve the low teens that we've been at in ES, certainly, to get to the high teens over the tactical and midterm time horizon. From a Mainstream perspective, we think as long as the growth continues to decline in the low single digits, as Mike pointed out, we can manage both the cost profile in that business as well as improving the cost profile of the ES business to maintain ourselves in that high 30s that we've been staying at for the last couple of years."

And to the extent that they can work with their mainframe solution, their on-premise enterprise solution and the cloud solution, we have products that scale across all 3, it just makes less of an argument to move off of a platform that's already working and spend your precious R&D resources on net new innovation that's going to drive your customer segment further along."

It's not unusual for that to start to drift off a little bit over time, and it is so highly dependent on our renewal cycle.

And in that renewal cycle quarter, when you have a lot of renewals and you're selling the new product, that product is going to be taking a ratable price [ph] from our -- from the VSOE that we have that's forced to take ratable. But we were at really extremely low levels, as we said, in the first 2 quarters of last year, and that really rebounded very nicely up to, actually, quite high levels of upfront recognition in the third quarter of last year, where we actually had a deal related to our Xceedium business that we sold into a government agency, the largest deal that they have ever done, and that was all taken on an upfront basis. So what we see in this quarter, very low renewals. Again, nothing unusual about it except that we just didn't have a lot of big deals expiring at this particular point in time. And any of the freestanding sales that we sold outside of that renewal cycle, for those qualifying products, we were able to take the revenue upfront. So I hate to get gorpy with the VSOE and accounting world of it, but it was a little bit of that, complicated with the mix of just when our renewal cycle was naturally ebbing and flowing."

So to answer your question, I think we're in a very good position to achieve the kind of growth we gave through in the guidance. But we're always going to be taking a look for new technologies on the buy-versus-build analysis. If you take a look at just this last quarter, we bought a relatively small company called BlazeMeter, which is very strategic for us. We've had a lot of growth in our testing market. This is an additive to the testing market but gives customers another opportunity to protect their code as it goes into production. And this is a foray into another SaaS product, and it's also using a significant amount of open-source technology. So it hits all of the things that we think are important as what customers want to buy. And to the extent that we see opportunities like that, what it does is it gives us an opportunity to accelerate growth, and it also de-risks our plan going forward."

It's a -- that's a single product, and I think in my prepared remarks, I had 3 or 4 different products that we profiled. This is one that's done both ways, Michael. For example, I know of an insurance company that bought that particular product outside of the renewal cycle because they thought it was -- it had value, and they wanted to be able to use that to scan their data logs to make sure they're following the regulatory procedures that, that particular industry has. Whenever we're pitching a renewal, our sales force is trained to use that as an opportunity to keep their renewal yield high. So we're constantly shooting for something higher than a 90% in our renewal cycle. And what it does is it takes some of the pressure of that renewal yield away. The overarching thesis of what we're trying to do there is to help that deceleration, that secular deceleration of the Mainframe by -- dampen it down by offering customers both net new solutions and also psychologically show them that we're still investing in the Mainframe. We have -- we're 1 of only 2 companies that are still making significant investments in R&D on the Mainframe. And to the extent that we're able to package that up and show the value, I think it protects the franchise."

Let me take the last one first, and then we'll get back to the backlog. So as I think I said before, the opportunity when you're not selling with a renewal per se, this is the opportunity to take that revenue upfront. And what ends up happening is you have a much higher yield on that which you sell from a new perspective that you'll actually recognize upfront. And that -- those, in fact, play a part why the revenue backlog comes down a little bit as well because the licensed portion of that revenue, you're taking in the current time period. Additionally to that, similar to the lift that we were getting inorganically over the past several quarters as we added revenue from our acquisitions last year, there was a modest current backlog help there as well. And now that that's -- we've wrapped around and we've flatlined on that, I think what you're seeing is probably -- I'd say it's actually relatively flat quarter-on-quarter when you take those things into consideration. Now from a freestanding sales perspective, clearly, long term, that is absolutely the objective, right? The objective is, over the long haul, to ensure that our business is always going to look for opportunities to sell and not have to wait until an annual or triennial contract expires. I think our teams are getting better at that. We've seen, actually, some good performance over the last year and several quarters happening in our Named and Growth accounts. But surprisingly, it happens, actually, quite frequently in our Platinum accounts as well."

Up until even 2 or 3 years ago, enterprise software companies were constantly selling in and around renewals for these large ELAs because that's how the customers have been trained for 20 years to buy from us. And breaking that mold has taken some time. So even though we have the best intentions and we prefer to be able to sell solutions when customers need them, there's a lot of procurement teams that hang on, waiting 6, 9 months before they buy, thinking that they're going to get a better deal if they package it up into an ELA. I'm seeing some of the frost break on that particular model, but when I take a look at the mainstream large Fortune 200 companies, there's still a lot of decisions made by procurement teams that I think is shifting to line-of-business buyers. When we're selling to a line-of-business buyer, they don't care about ELAs. They have a problem. They want that solution solved, and they're buying it with a capital budget -- with an operational budget rather than a capital budget. And a lot of times, they're buying it outside the context of a general CIO procurement team. Still some work to be done in our industry with that, but I don't think that's a unique CA phenomenon."

We delivered another quarter of revenue growth with strong margins and earnings. Our performance in the quarter improves our confidence in our ability to cross over into modest revenue growth for the full year of fiscal 2017. We are making progress across a number of our key initiatives. Our product development and innovation engines are beginning to gain traction, and I am very pleased with our customer experience metrics. We know that we are moving the ball in the right direction, while we recognize that there are areas in which we still need to continue to improve. 
As expected, new sales declined in the quarter, driven largely by the very difficult year-over-year comparison as a result of the large system integrator deal we closed in the year-ago period. Importantly, as we mentioned last quarter, we now have agreements in place with our 3 largest SI customers for the next several years. This reflects our position as a trusted technology partner to the largest global system integrators and provides us with good visibility into our longer-term customer commitments. 
In terms of sales execution, I am happy to report that our freestanding new sales increased year-over-year. While the overall portfolio of deals for us to renew was smaller in Q2, I'm encouraged by our healthy attach rates to renewals. In the quarter, MetLife, one of the largest global insurance companies; FedEx, a global transportation and business service leader; and Cerner, a health care delivery solution provider, expanded their relationships with CA to include a number of solutions across our portfolio. New sales in our Named and Growth or Partner-led accounts also grew nicely. Continued progress in freestanding new sales and penetration into Named and Growth accounts are key to driving long-term sustained growth. 
Q2 CFFO was negatively impacted year-over-year by the combination of a lower level of single installment collections and a higher level of cash tax payments in the quarter. As we said before, we remain focused on and committed to developing products that are easier to install and easier to manage. A byproduct of this can be seen in the decline we are experiencing in our Services revenue. We continue to expect that as our portfolio of more user-friendly products grows and we increasingly leverage partners, our Services revenue line will be impacted. Our Q2 Services performance reflects this ongoing trend. 
Results were also impacted by a lower level of prior period Services bookings and some non-strategic projects that have come to close. We expect these collective factors will continue to be headwinds to our Services revenue. 
We remain committed to cultivating and nurturing the spirit of innovation at CA. While there is always more work to do and we acknowledge that real, systemic change within a large product organization takes time to bear fruit, we are making considerable progress. We are continuing to innovate within our existing portfolio and now have a more disciplined process in place to invest in future areas of growth for CA. I'm very pleased that our efforts are recognized by industry analysts and, most importantly, by our customers. We look forward to providing more color on our progress at CA World next month. 
I would like to highlight our overall portfolio of Continuous Delivery solutions, which had a great quarter with significant customer wins across a number of sectors, including financial services, telecommunications, media, government and health care IT. We are committed to helping our customers become more agile in the Application Economy. Our Continuous Delivery portfolio is central to this strategy as it enables customers to rapidly develop, efficiently test and reliably release applications. The result is more higher-quality applications delivered to the market at a faster pace. 
We continue to invest in innovations across the Continuous Delivery portfolio. Our latest version was made available in July and focuses on an improved security model for customers. It also provides dependency management for complex deployments involving multiple applications. We are pleased that CA Release Automation was positioned by Gartner in the Leaders quadrant in its inaugural Magic Quadrant for Application Release Automation. It helps customers manage their complex Continuous Delivery pipelines, and it is a critical element of a DevOps strategy in executing many small releases in quick succession. 
In August, we released the latest version of CA Agile Requirements Designer, an end-to-end requirements gathering, test automation and test case design tool that reduces manual testing effort. And just last month, we announced the small but strategic acquisition of BlazeMeter. While not meaningful in terms of its immediate financial impact, BlazeMeter adds a next-generation, open-source, SaaS-based performance and load testing platform to the portfolio. 
Within Security, I'm particularly pleased with Privileged Access Management, Advanced Authentication as well as Payment Security, which all delivered very healthy new sales growth. In the quarter, we closed multiple 7-figure transactions, including very good competitive wins for CA Privileged Access Management. We released a number of enhancements across the portfolio, and we continue to view Security as one of the key pillars in our strategy to grow in the years ahead. Security is a critical component for our customers and their digital transformation strategies. 
We are pleased with the performance of our Mainframe business from a revenue perspective for the second quarter and for the first half of our fiscal year. We recognize that this is a market not in secular growth, unlike the rest of our markets. As such, there's no doubt that size matters. We are in a unique position as the largest independent software vendor in this market and, really, the only other company outside of IBM making meaningful investments to support, sustain and innovate for our customers with a mainframe footprint. This means that we are able to organically innovate on the mainframe with solutions like CA Data Content Discovery or DCD. With more than 70% of enterprise data on the mainframe, DCD enables customers to identify data exposure risks on z Systems by automatically scanning through the data on the mainframe infrastructure for regulated or sensitive data. Data discovery, classification by security level and comprehensive reporting enables our customers to mitigate risk. We are the only vendor in the market that does this on the mainframe, and we are very pleased with this performance and rate of market adoption. 
The breadth and scale of our portfolio, our focus on integrations across the enterprise and our dedicated efforts to continually improve customer experience are the foundations of our ability to support end-to-end DevOps on the mainframe. We have flagship solutions like CA Endevor, which provides source code management and archives versioning of code development, including Java and parallel development. We also provide newer solutions like CA Application Lifecycle Conductor or ALC, which helps customers automate and manage the software development life cycle spanning mobile to mainframe environments. 
CA provides one of the broadest portfolios of mainframe solutions in the industry, and we are leveraging our R&D across our development organizations. For example, CA Agile Central users can create a new agile story and then drag and drop so that ALC and Endevor create all of the associated code on the mainframe and move the code from development to test and then to production. Other examples of Enterprise Solutions and Mainframe synergies include CA Release Automation, Test Data Management and Service Virtualization. These are all tangible proof points of CA's commitment to and investment in providing value to our customers across mainframe, distributed, cloud and mobile. 
This leads me to an area in which everyone across every level of CA's global workforce is focused: customer experience. Perhaps the best way to illustrate what this means to us is to provide a few specific customer examples. TomTom, the Dutch navigation, mapping, GPS and now sports and fitness company, implemented CA Agile Central in its transition from traditional waterfall software development to agile. Through this experience, TomTom views CA as much more than a software provider. CA is a trusted partner that provides access, demonstrates responsiveness and engages in continuous product collaboration. 
The Royal Bank of Scotland is implementing the bank's vision of delivering a seamless, omni-channel customer experience using CA Risk Analytics. CA's solutions and partnership enables RBS to be agile and adaptive to the needs of its customers in an ever-changing financial services industry. 
These are the types of stories that motivate us every day. From the earliest point of contact with customers through the many years that follow, we have vastly improved how we are showing up. From our CNN partnership for its election coverage to the tens of thousands of customers we reached out to on Customer Experience Day last month and the ongoing contact our development and sales teams have with our customers on a daily basis, we have made considerable improvement. CA's brand familiarity and consideration continues to move higher, particularly among business decision-makers. Our customers are giving us higher scores on product quality, and customer satisfaction continues to trend positively. 
We are proud of the great progress our team has made across the organization, but we are not satisfied. We still have work to do to further refine and optimize and really be agile so that we can continue to evolve and achieve the type of long-term sustainable growth we know we have the potential to achieve. 
Looking ahead, I'm optimistic. When I look at our company holistically in terms of the markets we're in and the opportunities we have, both organically and inorganically, I believe that we are on track. Overall, we believe we can deliver modest, low single-digit growth over the medium term. 
We look forward to welcoming many of you at CA World next month. Through keynotes, guest speakers and technical and best practice sessions, we'll explore and demonstrate how software has risen from a supporting role to the lead actor in driving business strategy and velocity. We will host an analyst session on November 16 that will provide a great opportunity to speak with our executive team and to hear what our customers are saying first hand. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kieran to review our second quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
Our Q2 total revenue was $1,018,000,000 and was up 1% and up 2% in constant currency. This was the second consecutive quarter we've grown revenue year-over-year as reported and the third in constant currency. Q2 Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 7% and increased 8% in constant currency. Mainframe Solutions decreased 1% as reported and in constant currency. Services declined 10% and declined 9% in constant currency. 
Q2 total new product and capacity sales were down in the mid-20s as reported and in constant currency. The decrease in Q2 total new sales was due primarily to a difficult year-over-year compare, driven by new sales associated with the large system integrator renewal transaction we signed in Q2 last year. Excluding the large SI transaction, total new product and capacity sales were down low teens as reported and in constant currency. 
Q2 renewals were down in the mid-50s, both as reported and in constant currency. Excluding the large SI transaction, renewals were down high single digits, both as reported and in constant currency. As we previously stated, the year-over-year change in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions. We continue to expect the renewal portfolio in fiscal 2017 to increase in the high teens year-over-year, both as reported and in constant currency. Renewal yield for the quarter was in the low 90s, in line with our long-term target. 
Turning to geographies. New sales were down in North America due in part to the difficult year-over-year compare resulting from last year's large SI transaction as well as a smaller renewal portfolio even outside of this large SI transaction. New sales in Latin America declined due to ongoing macroeconomic challenges in the region. New sales were up in EMEA due to strong performance in Named and Growth or Partner-led accounts. To this point, we have seen minimal impact from Brexit on new sales. APJ was up sharply to more normalized levels following a difficult quarter in the year-ago period. 
Revenue grew across all geographies as reported, except in EMEA. Revenue grew in North America and APJ, was flat in Latin America and declined in EMEA in constant currency. 
Within our segments, Mainframe new sales declined in the mid-40s year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Excluding last year's large SI transaction, Mainframe new sales declined in the mid-20s and in the low 20s in constant currency. Mainframe new sales performance reflects lower levels of Mainframe capacity due to the composition of the renewal portfolio outside of the large SI renewal in the year-ago period. Overall, we continue to expect our Mainframe revenue to be down in the low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the mainframe market. 
Enterprise Solutions new sales decreased in the high teens year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Excluding last year's large SI transaction, Enterprise Solutions new sales decreased high single digits as reported and in constant currency, in line with the renewal portfolio. Areas such as Continuous Delivery and Security saw positive new sales growth in the quarter. However, as we discussed in the past, within Enterprise Solutions, there are products in our enhanced portfolio that are more mature and not growing but contribute to margin and cash flow. 
Services revenue decreased 10% and 9% in constant currency. We expect Services revenue to decline as we design our products to be easier to install and as we leverage partners. Services revenue is also impacted by a lower level of bookings in previous quarters and the conclusion of some nonstrategic Services engagements. As Mike mentioned, we expect this headwind in Services will continue to have a dampening effect on our overall revenue growth. 
Total revenue backlog was up 4% as reported and in constant currency. Current revenue backlog declined 2% as reported and in constant currency. As we've said in the past, current revenue backlog will likely grow after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low-90s renewal yield. 
Q2 GAAP operating margin was 31%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 40%. Operating margin improved year-over-year due to improved operating efficiencies and the impact of the acquisition-related expenses in the year-ago period. This was partially offset by an increase in legal expenses related to us entering into an agreement in principle to settle the long-standing matter brought against us by the DOJ and an individual plaintiff relating to our GSA schedule with the government. This litigation was previously disclosed by us and relates to time periods as far back as 2002. The proposed settlement is for $45 million and admits no wrongdoing. While it is still subject to finalization, we are pleased to have entered into this agreement in principle in an effort to put it behind us. We look forward to continuing our long-standing relationship with the government as a trusted and valued customer and partner. 
Segment operating margins in the quarter were 62% for Mainframe Solutions, 18% for Enterprise Solutions and 3% for Services. Our Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 31% and 29%, respectively. Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.50, up 28% year-over-year and up 31% in constant currency. Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.67, up 20% year-over-year and up 18% in constant currency. 
Our Q2 CFFO was negative $58 million, down year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. CFFO declined relative to the year-ago period primarily due to a lower level of single installment collections in the quarter as well as higher cash tax payments. Single installment cash payments were $59 million and down $70 million year-over-year. The lower level of single installment cash payments resulted from the mix of renewals in the quarter, which had fewer large financial institutions. Single installment cash payments typically come from large financial institutions. 
We ended Q2 with approximately $496 million in net cash. During the second quarter, we repurchased $50 million in shares and paid $107 million in dividends. We have $650 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. 
As Mike said, we are pleased with our Q2 performance as it gives us improved confidence in our ability to cross over into modest revenue growth for the full year in fiscal year '17. We are making progress across key imperatives and are continuously evaluating opportunities to improve our ability to sustainably grow. However, there is still work to do. Our performance in some product areas and in Named and Growth and Partner-led opportunities continues to improve but remains uneven. Also, our strong revenue performance in the quarter and the first half was aided by a relatively low proportion of upfront deals in the year-ago periods, making for easier compares. 
As we indicated last quarter, the large SI deal we signed in Q1 substantially shifted the renewal portfolio such that fiscal year '18 renewals are expected to decline year-over-year. To overcome this headwind, we are working to drive continuous improvement in the sales organization to increase consistency and velocity, independent of the renewal cycle. We are continuing to work to improve the efficiency and productivity within our development organization and continue to evaluate M&A opportunities to supplement our portfolio. As a company, we expect modest revenue growth in the medium term. This is the result of our three-pronged capital allocation of quarterly dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was September 30, 2016. The guidance also assumes no material acquisitions. For the full year, we expect total revenue to increase in a range of flat to up 1% as reported and in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectation. This translates to reported revenue of $4.03 billion to $4.07 billion. We expect full year GAAP operating margin of 29% and full year non-GAAP operating margin of 38%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%, consistent with our prior expectations. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to increase in a range of 6% to 8% as reported and 2% to 5% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.88 to $1.93. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to increase in a range of 2% to 5% as reported and 1% to 3% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.49 to $2.54. 
We'd like to provide some additional color regarding our expectations for the second half of fiscal 2017. While there's no change to our full year revenue guidance, I'd like to provide some headlights into how we expect Q3 to play out. In terms of the year-over-year compare, the tailwind of the upfront revenue mix that benefited the first half of the fiscal year is expected to become a headwind in the second half of the fiscal year. As such, we expect revenue to decline a couple of percentage points year-over-year in Q3. This is largely due to the timing of the mix of upfront deals that closed last year in addition to a lower level of Services revenue. As discussed earlier, the upfront mix was particularly low in the first half of fiscal 2016 and then rebounded in the third quarter. 
With regard to non-GAAP operating margins, we expect the lower revenue level to impact Q3 operating margin when compared to the year-ago period. As indicated earlier, there is no change to our full year 2017 revenue or operating margin guidance. 
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 411 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 414 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to be in the range of a 3% decrease to a 1% increase, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to $1.01 billion to $1.05 billion. Previous quarter guidance was an increase of 2% to 6% and an increase of 1% to 5% in constant currency. This change is due to the anticipated settlement of legal matters related to the agreement in principle for the GSA litigation previously discussed. 
With that, we'll open it up for questions."

So I'm very happy to see tangible metrics that our innovation engine is working. With respect to the higher margin, a lot of that has to do with just timing. If you take a look at the cyclical nature of our business and when acquisitions have hit around the year anniversary of Rally and with the Xceedium acquisition being relatively small and the amount of capital we had to put in to make Xceedium ready for large-scale customer usage, we've had some savings. This will be a blip in Enterprise margins. Eventually, we'll get up to the high end and be repeatable there, but I don't think 18% is going to be consistent for the next little while. Kieran?"

If we go back and take a look at last year, when we were at 36% margins floor, the company as a whole and ES was extremely low. That's obviously the quarter when we brought in both the Rally and the Xceedium acquisitions, so there was a significant amount of onetime costs associated with that. And for the company as a whole, if you look at those onetime costs that we didn't incur this year, basically, think of it as offset with the GSA impact. So the real impact in the margin improvement for the company as a whole as well as for ES was a lot of the upfront revenue that we talked about. So you heard me describe that we had a very weak compare in terms of our upfront revenues, and that's all in the ES segment a year ago. The growth that we had in upfront revenue in Q2 was worth about 3 or 4 points of margin expansion on a year-on-year basis. And as Mike said, longer-term plans, we expect to get there. And just keep in mind, Q3, we always have the seasonality of our CA World, which incurs some big costs. And then obviously, in Q4, when we're finalizing commissions and payouts, it's usually our seasonally lowest quarter of the year."

First, on the Mainframe deceleration, we don't see high single-digit Mainframe deceleration. We've consistently seen low single-digit Mainframe deceleration, so it hasn't -- I wouldn't characterize it in the higher end of single-digit deceleration. And when we're talking to customers, customers that have made an investment in the Mainframe continue to invest in the Mainframe for a variety of reasons. I think the biggest reason is that's where the applications are. And to repark those applications on to a different platform to do the exact same thing, the amount of calories to do that and the amount of risk, especially if you're in a regulated environment, there just hasn't been a whole lot of appetite to do that. They'd rather spend their net new development dollars building net new products and services they can get to devices that customers want. Secondly, there's been a great set of technologies. One of them that we're one of the primary suppliers of is API Management. So a lot of Mainframe customers want to serve up that mainframe data that's very protected, very secure and put it onto a tablet, put it onto a smartphone. And the way that they're doing that is using API technology. So they get to keep the high-volume transaction processing engine that is currently working, keep the applications, the data structures in place and then be able to serve their customers in a way that customers want to be served. So I think that's the stability argument for the Mainframe, and we haven't seen anything, really, change with respect to that. With respect to margin, as you know, we break out our business in 3 segments, Mainframe, ES and Services, but Mainframe always being in the low 60s and Services fluctuating in the mid-teens. As we continue to get better and have better efficiencies in our Enterprise business and the higher volume of revenue, we are able to get a blended margin in the high 30s, and we feel pretty confident about that for the foreseeable future. Kieran, maybe you have a couple of comments with respect to the margin."

We really think we can improve the low teens that we've been at in ES, certainly, to get to the high teens over the tactical and midterm time horizon. From a Mainstream perspective, we think as long as the growth continues to decline in the low single digits, as Mike pointed out, we can manage both the cost profile in that business as well as improving the cost profile of the ES business to maintain ourselves in that high 30s that we've been staying at for the last couple of years."

It's not unusual for that to start to drift off a little bit over time, and it is so highly dependent on our renewal cycle.

And it sounds like now -- are you actually looking for that business to decline year-over-year or flatten out? And I guess why wouldn't we see better growth there if that's where some of the new product businesses is going?"

What you normally find is a year ago, it was a very large renewal cycle quarter. And in that renewal cycle quarter, when you have a lot of renewals and you're selling the new product, that product is going to be taking a ratable price [ph] from our -- from the VSOE that we have that's forced to take ratable. But we were at really extremely low levels, as we said, in the first 2 quarters of last year, and that really rebounded very nicely up to, actually, quite high levels of upfront recognition in the third quarter of last year, where we actually had a deal related to our Xceedium business that we sold into a government agency, the largest deal that they have ever done, and that was all taken on an upfront basis. So what we see in this quarter, very low renewals. Again, nothing unusual about it except that we just didn't have a lot of big deals expiring at this particular point in time. And any of the freestanding sales that we sold outside of that renewal cycle, for those qualifying products, we were able to take the revenue upfront. So I hate to get gorpy with the VSOE and accounting world of it, but it was a little bit of that, complicated with the mix of just when our renewal cycle was naturally ebbing and flowing."

So to answer your question, I think we're in a very good position to achieve the kind of growth we gave through in the guidance. But we're always going to be taking a look for new technologies on the buy-versus-build analysis. If you take a look at just this last quarter, we bought a relatively small company called BlazeMeter, which is very strategic for us. We've had a lot of growth in our testing market. This is an additive to the testing market but gives customers another opportunity to protect their code as it goes into production. And this is a foray into another SaaS product, and it's also using a significant amount of open-source technology. So it hits all of the things that we think are important as what customers want to buy. And to the extent that we see opportunities like that, what it does is it gives us an opportunity to accelerate growth, and it also de-risks our plan going forward."

For example, I know of an insurance company that bought that particular product outside of the renewal cycle because they thought it was -- it had value, and they wanted to be able to use that to scan their data logs to make sure they're following the regulatory procedures that, that particular industry has. Whenever we're pitching a renewal, our sales force is trained to use that as an opportunity to keep their renewal yield high. So we're constantly shooting for something higher than a 90% in our renewal cycle. And what it does is it takes some of the pressure of that renewal yield away. The overarching thesis of what we're trying to do there is to help that deceleration, that secular deceleration of the Mainframe by -- dampen it down by offering customers both net new solutions and also psychologically show them that we're still investing in the Mainframe. We have -- we're 1 of only 2 companies that are still making significant investments in R&D on the Mainframe. And to the extent that we're able to package that up and show the value, I think it protects the franchise."

Let me take the last one first, and then we'll get back to the backlog. So as I think I said before, the opportunity when you're not selling with a renewal per se, this is the opportunity to take that revenue upfront. And what ends up happening is you have a much higher yield on that which you sell from a new perspective that you'll actually recognize upfront. And that -- those, in fact, play a part why the revenue backlog comes down a little bit as well because the licensed portion of that revenue, you're taking in the current time period. Additionally to that, similar to the lift that we were getting inorganically over the past several quarters as we added revenue from our acquisitions last year, there was a modest current backlog help there as well. And now that that's -- we've wrapped around and we've flatlined on that, I think what you're seeing is probably -- I'd say it's actually relatively flat quarter-on-quarter when you take those things into consideration. Now from a freestanding sales perspective, clearly, long term, that is absolutely the objective, right? The objective is, over the long haul, to ensure that our business is always going to look for opportunities to sell and not have to wait until an annual or triennial contract expires. I think our teams are getting better at that. We've seen, actually, some good performance over the last year and several quarters happening in our Named and Growth accounts. But surprisingly, it happens, actually, quite frequently in our Platinum accounts as well."

Up until even 2 or 3 years ago, enterprise software companies were constantly selling in and around renewals for these large ELAs because that's how the customers have been trained for 20 years to buy from us. And breaking that mold has taken some time. So even though we have the best intentions and we prefer to be able to sell solutions when customers need them, there's a lot of procurement teams that hang on, waiting 6, 9 months before they buy, thinking that they're going to get a better deal if they package it up into an ELA. I'm seeing some of the frost break on that particular model, but when I take a look at the mainstream large Fortune 200 companies, there's still a lot of decisions made by procurement teams that I think is shifting to line-of-business buyers. When we're selling to a line-of-business buyer, they don't care about ELAs. They have a problem. They want that solution solved, and they're buying it with a capital budget -- with an operational budget rather than a capital budget. And a lot of times, they're buying it outside the context of a general CIO procurement team. Still some work to be done in our industry with that, but I don't think that's a unique CA phenomenon."

We delivered another quarter of revenue growth with strong margins and earnings. Our performance in the quarter improves our confidence in our ability to cross over into modest revenue growth for the full year of fiscal 2017. We are making progress across a number of our key initiatives. Our product development and innovation engines are beginning to gain traction, and I am very pleased with our customer experience metrics. We know that we are moving the ball in the right direction, while we recognize that there are areas in which we still need to continue to improve. 
As expected, new sales declined in the quarter, driven largely by the very difficult year-over-year comparison as a result of the large system integrator deal we closed in the year-ago period. Importantly, as we mentioned last quarter, we now have agreements in place with our 3 largest SI customers for the next several years. This reflects our position as a trusted technology partner to the largest global system integrators and provides us with good visibility into our longer-term customer commitments. 
In terms of sales execution, I am happy to report that our freestanding new sales increased year-over-year. While the overall portfolio of deals for us to renew was smaller in Q2, I'm encouraged by our healthy attach rates to renewals. In the quarter, MetLife, one of the largest global insurance companies; FedEx, a global transportation and business service leader; and Cerner, a health care delivery solution provider, expanded their relationships with CA to include a number of solutions across our portfolio. New sales in our Named and Growth or Partner-led accounts also grew nicely. Continued progress in freestanding new sales and penetration into Named and Growth accounts are key to driving long-term sustained growth. 
Q2 CFFO was negatively impacted year-over-year by the combination of a lower level of single installment collections and a higher level of cash tax payments in the quarter. As we said before, we remain focused on and committed to developing products that are easier to install and easier to manage. A byproduct of this can be seen in the decline we are experiencing in our Services revenue. We continue to expect that as our portfolio of more user-friendly products grows and we increasingly leverage partners, our Services revenue line will be impacted. Our Q2 Services performance reflects this ongoing trend. 
Results were also impacted by a lower level of prior period Services bookings and some non-strategic projects that have come to close. We expect these collective factors will continue to be headwinds to our Services revenue. 
We remain committed to cultivating and nurturing the spirit of innovation at CA. While there is always more work to do and we acknowledge that real, systemic change within a large product organization takes time to bear fruit, we are making considerable progress. We are continuing to innovate within our existing portfolio and now have a more disciplined process in place to invest in future areas of growth for CA. I'm very pleased that our efforts are recognized by industry analysts and, most importantly, by our customers. We look forward to providing more color on our progress at CA World next month. 
I would like to highlight our overall portfolio of Continuous Delivery solutions, which had a great quarter with significant customer wins across a number of sectors, including financial services, telecommunications, media, government and health care IT. We are committed to helping our customers become more agile in the Application Economy. Our Continuous Delivery portfolio is central to this strategy as it enables customers to rapidly develop, efficiently test and reliably release applications. The result is more higher-quality applications delivered to the market at a faster pace. 
We continue to invest in innovations across the Continuous Delivery portfolio. Our latest version was made available in July and focuses on an improved security model for customers. It also provides dependency management for complex deployments involving multiple applications. We are pleased that CA Release Automation was positioned by Gartner in the Leaders quadrant in its inaugural Magic Quadrant for Application Release Automation. It helps customers manage their complex Continuous Delivery pipelines, and it is a critical element of a DevOps strategy in executing many small releases in quick succession. 
In August, we released the latest version of CA Agile Requirements Designer, an end-to-end requirements gathering, test automation and test case design tool that reduces manual testing effort. And just last month, we announced the small but strategic acquisition of BlazeMeter. While not meaningful in terms of its immediate financial impact, BlazeMeter adds a next-generation, open-source, SaaS-based performance and load testing platform to the portfolio. 
Within Security, I'm particularly pleased with Privileged Access Management, Advanced Authentication as well as Payment Security, which all delivered very healthy new sales growth. In the quarter, we closed multiple 7-figure transactions, including very good competitive wins for CA Privileged Access Management. We released a number of enhancements across the portfolio, and we continue to view Security as one of the key pillars in our strategy to grow in the years ahead. Security is a critical component for our customers and their digital transformation strategies. 
We are pleased with the performance of our Mainframe business from a revenue perspective for the second quarter and for the first half of our fiscal year. We recognize that this is a market not in secular growth, unlike the rest of our markets. As such, there's no doubt that size matters. We are in a unique position as the largest independent software vendor in this market and, really, the only other company outside of IBM making meaningful investments to support, sustain and innovate for our customers with a mainframe footprint. This means that we are able to organically innovate on the mainframe with solutions like CA Data Content Discovery or DCD. With more than 70% of enterprise data on the mainframe, DCD enables customers to identify data exposure risks on z Systems by automatically scanning through the data on the mainframe infrastructure for regulated or sensitive data. Data discovery, classification by security level and comprehensive reporting enables our customers to mitigate risk. We are the only vendor in the market that does this on the mainframe, and we are very pleased with this performance and rate of market adoption. 
The breadth and scale of our portfolio, our focus on integrations across the enterprise and our dedicated efforts to continually improve customer experience are the foundations of our ability to support end-to-end DevOps on the mainframe. We have flagship solutions like CA Endevor, which provides source code management and archives versioning of code development, including Java and parallel development. We also provide newer solutions like CA Application Lifecycle Conductor or ALC, which helps customers automate and manage the software development life cycle spanning mobile to mainframe environments. 
CA provides one of the broadest portfolios of mainframe solutions in the industry, and we are leveraging our R&D across our development organizations. For example, CA Agile Central users can create a new agile story and then drag and drop so that ALC and Endevor create all of the associated code on the mainframe and move the code from development to test and then to production. Other examples of Enterprise Solutions and Mainframe synergies include CA Release Automation, Test Data Management and Service Virtualization. These are all tangible proof points of CA's commitment to and investment in providing value to our customers across mainframe, distributed, cloud and mobile. 
This leads me to an area in which everyone across every level of CA's global workforce is focused: customer experience. Perhaps the best way to illustrate what this means to us is to provide a few specific customer examples. TomTom, the Dutch navigation, mapping, GPS and now sports and fitness company, implemented CA Agile Central in its transition from traditional waterfall software development to agile. Through this experience, TomTom views CA as much more than a software provider. CA is a trusted partner that provides access, demonstrates responsiveness and engages in continuous product collaboration. 
The Royal Bank of Scotland is implementing the bank's vision of delivering a seamless, omni-channel customer experience using CA Risk Analytics. CA's solutions and partnership enables RBS to be agile and adaptive to the needs of its customers in an ever-changing financial services industry. 
These are the types of stories that motivate us every day. From the earliest point of contact with customers through the many years that follow, we have vastly improved how we are showing up. From our CNN partnership for its election coverage to the tens of thousands of customers we reached out to on Customer Experience Day last month and the ongoing contact our development and sales teams have with our customers on a daily basis, we have made considerable improvement. CA's brand familiarity and consideration continues to move higher, particularly among business decision-makers. Our customers are giving us higher scores on product quality, and customer satisfaction continues to trend positively. 
We are proud of the great progress our team has made across the organization, but we are not satisfied. We still have work to do to further refine and optimize and really be agile so that we can continue to evolve and achieve the type of long-term sustainable growth we know we have the potential to achieve. 
Looking ahead, I'm optimistic. When I look at our company holistically in terms of the markets we're in and the opportunities we have, both organically and inorganically, I believe that we are on track. Overall, we believe we can deliver modest, low single-digit growth over the medium term. 
We look forward to welcoming many of you at CA World next month. Through keynotes, guest speakers and technical and best practice sessions, we'll explore and demonstrate how software has risen from a supporting role to the lead actor in driving business strategy and velocity. We will host an analyst session on November 16 that will provide a great opportunity to speak with our executive team and to hear what our customers are saying first hand. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kieran to review our second quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you."

Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon, I'm going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. 
Our Q2 total revenue was $1,018,000,000 and was up 1% and up 2% in constant currency. This was the second consecutive quarter we've grown revenue year-over-year as reported and the third in constant currency. Q2 Enterprise Solutions revenue increased 7% and increased 8% in constant currency. Mainframe Solutions decreased 1% as reported and in constant currency. Services declined 10% and declined 9% in constant currency. 
Q2 total new product and capacity sales were down in the mid-20s as reported and in constant currency. The decrease in Q2 total new sales was due primarily to a difficult year-over-year compare, driven by new sales associated with the large system integrator renewal transaction we signed in Q2 last year. Excluding the large SI transaction, total new product and capacity sales were down low teens as reported and in constant currency. 
Q2 renewals were down in the mid-50s, both as reported and in constant currency. Excluding the large SI transaction, renewals were down high single digits, both as reported and in constant currency. As we previously stated, the year-over-year change in our renewal bookings can vary on a quarterly basis due to the timing of large transactions. We continue to expect the renewal portfolio in fiscal 2017 to increase in the high teens year-over-year, both as reported and in constant currency. Renewal yield for the quarter was in the low 90s, in line with our long-term target. 
Turning to geographies. New sales were down in North America due in part to the difficult year-over-year compare resulting from last year's large SI transaction as well as a smaller renewal portfolio even outside of this large SI transaction. New sales in Latin America declined due to ongoing macroeconomic challenges in the region. New sales were up in EMEA due to strong performance in Named and Growth or Partner-led accounts. To this point, we have seen minimal impact from Brexit on new sales. APJ was up sharply to more normalized levels following a difficult quarter in the year-ago period. 
Revenue grew across all geographies as reported, except in EMEA. Revenue grew in North America and APJ, was flat in Latin America and declined in EMEA in constant currency. 
Within our segments, Mainframe new sales declined in the mid-40s year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Excluding last year's large SI transaction, Mainframe new sales declined in the mid-20s and in the low 20s in constant currency. Mainframe new sales performance reflects lower levels of Mainframe capacity due to the composition of the renewal portfolio outside of the large SI renewal in the year-ago period. Overall, we continue to expect our Mainframe revenue to be down in the low single digits over the medium term, which we believe is in line with the mainframe market. 
Enterprise Solutions new sales decreased in the high teens year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Excluding last year's large SI transaction, Enterprise Solutions new sales decreased high single digits as reported and in constant currency, in line with the renewal portfolio. Areas such as Continuous Delivery and Security saw positive new sales growth in the quarter. However, as we discussed in the past, within Enterprise Solutions, there are products in our enhanced portfolio that are more mature and not growing but contribute to margin and cash flow. 
Services revenue decreased 10% and 9% in constant currency. We expect Services revenue to decline as we design our products to be easier to install and as we leverage partners. Services revenue is also impacted by a lower level of bookings in previous quarters and the conclusion of some nonstrategic Services engagements. As Mike mentioned, we expect this headwind in Services will continue to have a dampening effect on our overall revenue growth. 
Total revenue backlog was up 4% as reported and in constant currency. Current revenue backlog declined 2% as reported and in constant currency. As we've said in the past, current revenue backlog will likely grow after we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low-90s renewal yield. 
Q2 GAAP operating margin was 31%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 40%. Operating margin improved year-over-year due to improved operating efficiencies and the impact of the acquisition-related expenses in the year-ago period. This was partially offset by an increase in legal expenses related to us entering into an agreement in principle to settle the long-standing matter brought against us by the DOJ and an individual plaintiff relating to our GSA schedule with the government. This litigation was previously disclosed by us and relates to time periods as far back as 2002. The proposed settlement is for $45 million and admits no wrongdoing. While it is still subject to finalization, we are pleased to have entered into this agreement in principle in an effort to put it behind us. We look forward to continuing our long-standing relationship with the government as a trusted and valued customer and partner. 
Segment operating margins in the quarter were 62% for Mainframe Solutions, 18% for Enterprise Solutions and 3% for Services. Our Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 31% and 29%, respectively. Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.50, up 28% year-over-year and up 31% in constant currency. Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.67, up 20% year-over-year and up 18% in constant currency. 
Our Q2 CFFO was negative $58 million, down year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. CFFO declined relative to the year-ago period primarily due to a lower level of single installment collections in the quarter as well as higher cash tax payments. Single installment cash payments were $59 million and down $70 million year-over-year. The lower level of single installment cash payments resulted from the mix of renewals in the quarter, which had fewer large financial institutions. Single installment cash payments typically come from large financial institutions. 
We ended Q2 with approximately $496 million in net cash. During the second quarter, we repurchased $50 million in shares and paid $107 million in dividends. We have $650 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. 
As Mike said, we are pleased with our Q2 performance as it gives us improved confidence in our ability to cross over into modest revenue growth for the full year in fiscal year '17. We are making progress across key imperatives and are continuously evaluating opportunities to improve our ability to sustainably grow. However, there is still work to do. Our performance in some product areas and in Named and Growth and Partner-led opportunities continues to improve but remains uneven. Also, our strong revenue performance in the quarter and the first half was aided by a relatively low proportion of upfront deals in the year-ago periods, making for easier compares. 
As we indicated last quarter, the large SI deal we signed in Q1 substantially shifted the renewal portfolio such that fiscal year '18 renewals are expected to decline year-over-year. To overcome this headwind, we are working to drive continuous improvement in the sales organization to increase consistency and velocity, independent of the renewal cycle. We are continuing to work to improve the efficiency and productivity within our development organization and continue to evaluate M&A opportunities to supplement our portfolio. As a company, we expect modest revenue growth in the medium term. This is the result of our three-pronged capital allocation of quarterly dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions. 
Now turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was September 30, 2016. The guidance also assumes no material acquisitions. For the full year, we expect total revenue to increase in a range of flat to up 1% as reported and in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectation. This translates to reported revenue of $4.03 billion to $4.07 billion. We expect full year GAAP operating margin of 29% and full year non-GAAP operating margin of 38%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be between 28% and 29%, consistent with our prior expectations. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to increase in a range of 6% to 8% as reported and 2% to 5% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.88 to $1.93. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to increase in a range of 2% to 5% as reported and 1% to 3% in constant currency, consistent with our prior expectations. This translates to non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.49 to $2.54. 
We'd like to provide some additional color regarding our expectations for the second half of fiscal 2017. While there's no change to our full year revenue guidance, I'd like to provide some headlights into how we expect Q3 to play out. In terms of the year-over-year compare, the tailwind of the upfront revenue mix that benefited the first half of the fiscal year is expected to become a headwind in the second half of the fiscal year. As such, we expect revenue to decline a couple of percentage points year-over-year in Q3. This is largely due to the timing of the mix of upfront deals that closed last year in addition to a lower level of Services revenue. As discussed earlier, the upfront mix was particularly low in the first half of fiscal 2016 and then rebounded in the third quarter. 
With regard to non-GAAP operating margins, we expect the lower revenue level to impact Q3 operating margin when compared to the year-ago period. As indicated earlier, there is no change to our full year 2017 revenue or operating margin guidance. 
At the end of the year, we expect approximately 411 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 414 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to be in the range of a 3% decrease to a 1% increase, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to $1.01 billion to $1.05 billion. Previous quarter guidance was an increase of 2% to 6% and an increase of 1% to 5% in constant currency. This change is due to the anticipated settlement of legal matters related to the agreement in principle for the GSA litigation previously discussed. 
With that, we'll open it up for questions."

We'll pay that $45 million off sometime in Q3 or Q4 as we get through the formal process of the settlement. This has been a boat anchor that's been in every K and Q since I've been here. And working through this process is long and arduous, and I think both us and the government are happy to have this behind us. The government's a great customer of ours. We do a lot of different transactions with a lot of different agencies, and this has been something that we've both been working in earnest to try to get to a reasonable settlement. We don't have anything of this kind of magnitude on the books for the rest of the year. And the way we're running the railroad here, we've got enough controls in place that, I think, that being very clean with respect to how we transact, especially with the government, we've really stepped that up over the last couple of years.

Well, the first thing that I was super pleased about is of the growth portion of the Enterprise segment, of the 8%, 4% of that was from our staff solutions, and these are solutions that didn't exist 18 months to 24 months ago. So I'm very happy to see tangible metrics that our innovation engine is working. With respect to the higher margin, a lot of that has to do with just timing. If you take a look at the cyclical nature of our business and when acquisitions have hit around the year anniversary of Rally and with the Xceedium acquisition being relatively small and the amount of capital we had to put in to make Xceedium ready for large-scale customer usage, we've had some savings. This will be a blip in Enterprise margins. Eventually, we'll get up to the high end and be repeatable there, but I don't think 18% is going to be consistent for the next little while. Kieran?"

If we go back and take a look at last year, when we were at 36% margins floor, the company as a whole and ES was extremely low. That's obviously the quarter when we brought in both the Rally and the Xceedium acquisitions, so there was a significant amount of onetime costs associated with that. And for the company as a whole, if you look at those onetime costs that we didn't incur this year, basically, think of it as offset with the GSA impact. So the real impact in the margin improvement for the company as a whole as well as for ES was a lot of the upfront revenue that we talked about. So you heard me describe that we had a very weak compare in terms of our upfront revenues, and that's all in the ES segment a year ago. The growth that we had in upfront revenue in Q2 was worth about 3 or 4 points of margin expansion on a year-on-year basis. And as Mike said, longer-term plans, we expect to get there. And just keep in mind, Q3, we always have the seasonality of our CA World, which incurs some big costs. And then obviously, in Q4, when we're finalizing commissions and payouts, it's usually our seasonally lowest quarter of the year."

I think the Mainframe has been somewhat of a stalwart, and it doesn't get brought up that much. And I'm not sure if that's just because they don't talk about it enough in general. But I'm just trying to get a sense on whether or not you feel like that's a pretty good glide plane from here. And then I guess secondly around Mainframe, obviously, very high-margin business.

First, on the Mainframe deceleration, we don't see high single-digit Mainframe deceleration. We've consistently seen low single-digit Mainframe deceleration, so it hasn't -- I wouldn't characterize it in the higher end of single-digit deceleration. And when we're talking to customers, customers that have made an investment in the Mainframe continue to invest in the Mainframe for a variety of reasons. I think the biggest reason is that's where the applications are. And to repark those applications on to a different platform to do the exact same thing, the amount of calories to do that and the amount of risk, especially if you're in a regulated environment, there just hasn't been a whole lot of appetite to do that. They'd rather spend their net new development dollars building net new products and services they can get to devices that customers want. Secondly, there's been a great set of technologies. One of them that we're one of the primary suppliers of is API Management. So a lot of Mainframe customers want to serve up that mainframe data that's very protected, very secure and put it onto a tablet, put it onto a smartphone. And the way that they're doing that is using API technology. So they get to keep the high-volume transaction processing engine that is currently working, keep the applications, the data structures in place and then be able to serve their customers in a way that customers want to be served. So I think that's the stability argument for the Mainframe, and we haven't seen anything, really, change with respect to that. With respect to margin, as you know, we break out our business in 3 segments, Mainframe, ES and Services, but Mainframe always being in the low 60s and Services fluctuating in the mid-teens. As we continue to get better and have better efficiencies in our Enterprise business and the higher volume of revenue, we are able to get a blended margin in the high 30s, and we feel pretty confident about that for the foreseeable future. Kieran, maybe you have a couple of comments with respect to the margin."

We think that there's a lot of opportunity, as Mike pointed out, as you start to scale the revenue, especially in the SaaS side, and you start to achieve some scale. We really think we can improve the low teens that we've been at in ES, certainly, to get to the high teens over the tactical and midterm time horizon. From a Mainstream perspective, we think as long as the growth continues to decline in the low single digits, as Mike pointed out, we can manage both the cost profile in that business as well as improving the cost profile of the ES business to maintain ourselves in that high 30s that we've been staying at for the last couple of years."

From -- when we go and think about the Mainframe business, I mean, really, the Mainframe business, without that big adjustment -- adjustment for the big SI, was down in the mid-20s. And quite frankly, that's capacity. We're 7 quarters now into the Mainframe, the latest Mainframe cycle. It's not unusual for that to start to drift off a little bit over time, and it is so highly dependent on our renewal cycle. So this Q2 is just a very, very seasonally low renewal cycle for us just based upon the number of large deals that we're going to close. And normally, that's where we would expect to drive incremental Mainframe capacity. If we take a look at the ES business, we think the ES business, which, quite frankly, we were very pleased with a lot of freestanding sales that we saw across the spectrum, as well as the attach rates on the small amount of renewals that we did do, and we think overall, the ES business was sort of down at that mid-single-digit, high single-digit number, consistent with what the renewals would have been if you adjust it for the big acquisition from last year."

What you normally find is a year ago, it was a very large renewal cycle quarter. And in that renewal cycle quarter, when you have a lot of renewals and you're selling the new product, that product is going to be taking a ratable price [ph] from our -- from the VSOE that we have that's forced to take ratable. But we were at really extremely low levels, as we said, in the first 2 quarters of last year, and that really rebounded very nicely up to, actually, quite high levels of upfront recognition in the third quarter of last year, where we actually had a deal related to our Xceedium business that we sold into a government agency, the largest deal that they have ever done, and that was all taken on an upfront basis. So what we see in this quarter, very low renewals. Again, nothing unusual about it except that we just didn't have a lot of big deals expiring at this particular point in time. And any of the freestanding sales that we sold outside of that renewal cycle, for those qualifying products, we were able to take the revenue upfront. So I hate to get gorpy with the VSOE and accounting world of it, but it was a little bit of that, complicated with the mix of just when our renewal cycle was naturally ebbing and flowing."

So to answer your question, I think we're in a very good position to achieve the kind of growth we gave through in the guidance. But we're always going to be taking a look for new technologies on the buy-versus-build analysis. If you take a look at just this last quarter, we bought a relatively small company called BlazeMeter, which is very strategic for us. We've had a lot of growth in our testing market. This is an additive to the testing market but gives customers another opportunity to protect their code as it goes into production. And this is a foray into another SaaS product, and it's also using a significant amount of open-source technology. So it hits all of the things that we think are important as what customers want to buy. And to the extent that we see opportunities like that, what it does is it gives us an opportunity to accelerate growth, and it also de-risks our plan going forward."

It's a -- that's a single product, and I think in my prepared remarks, I had 3 or 4 different products that we profiled. This is one that's done both ways, Michael. For example, I know of an insurance company that bought that particular product outside of the renewal cycle because they thought it was -- it had value, and they wanted to be able to use that to scan their data logs to make sure they're following the regulatory procedures that, that particular industry has. Whenever we're pitching a renewal, our sales force is trained to use that as an opportunity to keep their renewal yield high. So we're constantly shooting for something higher than a 90% in our renewal cycle. And what it does is it takes some of the pressure of that renewal yield away. The overarching thesis of what we're trying to do there is to help that deceleration, that secular deceleration of the Mainframe by -- dampen it down by offering customers both net new solutions and also psychologically show them that we're still investing in the Mainframe. We have -- we're 1 of only 2 companies that are still making significant investments in R&D on the Mainframe. And to the extent that we're able to package that up and show the value, I think it protects the franchise."

Let me take the last one first, and then we'll get back to the backlog. So as I think I said before, the opportunity when you're not selling with a renewal per se, this is the opportunity to take that revenue upfront. And what ends up happening is you have a much higher yield on that which you sell from a new perspective that you'll actually recognize upfront. And that -- those, in fact, play a part why the revenue backlog comes down a little bit as well because the licensed portion of that revenue, you're taking in the current time period. Additionally to that, similar to the lift that we were getting inorganically over the past several quarters as we added revenue from our acquisitions last year, there was a modest current backlog help there as well. And now that that's -- we've wrapped around and we've flatlined on that, I think what you're seeing is probably -- I'd say it's actually relatively flat quarter-on-quarter when you take those things into consideration. Now from a freestanding sales perspective, clearly, long term, that is absolutely the objective, right? The objective is, over the long haul, to ensure that our business is always going to look for opportunities to sell and not have to wait until an annual or triennial contract expires. I think our teams are getting better at that. We've seen, actually, some good performance over the last year and several quarters happening in our Named and Growth accounts. But surprisingly, it happens, actually, quite frequently in our Platinum accounts as well."

Up until even 2 or 3 years ago, enterprise software companies were constantly selling in and around renewals for these large ELAs because that's how the customers have been trained for 20 years to buy from us. And breaking that mold has taken some time. So even though we have the best intentions and we prefer to be able to sell solutions when customers need them, there's a lot of procurement teams that hang on, waiting 6, 9 months before they buy, thinking that they're going to get a better deal if they package it up into an ELA. I'm seeing some of the frost break on that particular model, but when I take a look at the mainstream large Fortune 200 companies, there's still a lot of decisions made by procurement teams that I think is shifting to line-of-business buyers. When we're selling to a line-of-business buyer, they don't care about ELAs. They have a problem. They want that solution solved, and they're buying it with a capital budget -- with an operational budget rather than a capital budget. And a lot of times, they're buying it outside the context of a general CIO procurement team. Still some work to be done in our industry with that, but I don't think that's a unique CA phenomenon."
